## Heidi Priebe’s videos are life changing

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1838j2l/heidi_priebes_videos_are_life_changing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1838j2l/heidi_priebes_videos_are_life_changing/)

> I thought I’d share this here because it kind of feels like I unlocked some door I never knew existed. I knew I struggled with trauma but I never realized how so many coping mechanisms and patterns are truly intertwined with c-ptsd. Heidi’s videos are amazing and I hope it gives someone a tiny piece of hope 💜. I don’t know why but the way she explains things clicked in a way nothing else has.

	Heidi’s videos offered me a lot when I was really scrambling earlier this year. Same with [Patrick Teahan](https://youtube.com/@patrickteahanlicswtherapy?si=NZlroZcEoE68JW4w). Your post made me realize I haven’t watched either in months, which is surely a sign I’ve done some major healing from where I was then.

	Agreed, I learned so much from her videos. Her way of explaining things is pretty great I would say.

	Haven't watched her stuff in a while, very important for me at the start of my healing journey.

	This is the one that brought me to tears:

		I cried when I watched that one too, it's nice to know that I'm not alone despite how awful it is of course.

			It's a good feeling isn't it 🙂 knowing that no experience is unique and that others have come out better at the other end.
			
			For me it starts with understanding then knowing accepting and believing that it is not our fault. But it is our responsibility to take care of ourselves, change our conditions and the things we care about. To move through the hurt and reduce the exposure to the triggers to a manageable level in order to heal through it. Grieving is important but it can't take up all the time. It will come back in flashes and you got to sit with it, embrace it, acknowledge it and be grateful for it. Learn from it what you need and give that to yourself.
			
			We got this!

	Omw!

	Just finished the limerance video...

	Yep, the pieces just...kinda...organized themselves

	I've always wondered why I struggle to get into a relationship, yet I pine for one. Yesterday I discovered that I've probably never even developed an idea of what I would ACTUALLY feel like in a relationship, it's all been fantasies about what the other person is 'being' for me and what I would begrudgingly 'have to be' for them in return.

	There has never been a real placing of my real self in these fantasies, just them being luminous projections in my dark life... they functioned as a Pokémon, only ever say one thing, have an absolute defined type and who I get to 'deploy' in the battle going on in my head...

	Now, today, I come across this post...and for the first time in what feels like forever, I caught myself imagining my actual self in a relationship with someone.

	What once felt 'boring' or 'volatile' to imagine because of my attachment issues, is now where the actual relief from all that pining is experienced.

	I have a lot of work to do

	(Reminder for everyone to have a healthy skepticism toward any experts. Not to downplay what OP is talking about, but I think it's important to have at least one reminder here so that at least one person doesn't feel crazy for not enjoying her content)

	*I havent watched her stuff, so im neutral. Just throwing that out there.

	Heide is truly a great discovery, her grammatical accuracy and ego-less videos are truly oustanding.

	Perhaps I'm alone in this but it feels like even though they are great, doing what she says is not helping me move on.

	I'm fearful avoidant according to the attachment theory standpoint and I've had several toxic relationships that I feel have only raped my soul.

	I've welcomed the pain, I observe my thoughts and feelings and don't hesitate to stay in bed crying if that's what my body and mind feel like doing yet I'm a person of action who's moved countries, cities, lifestyle, relationships, and done everything by the book.

	And yet nothing is helping me to get through this depression. I've been depressed and suicidal for over four years now.

	I just feel how my body and mind are getting worse and all I want is to die.

	It seems no video on YouTube can help me, maybe I am the exception to the rule.

		Heyy!❤️ don't get discouraged, you are not alone in this and clearly you are not the only one who doesn't feel the help from those videos🤗
		
		Personally, everything changed for me when I discovered somatic therapy, vagus nerve exercises, the main 3 survival modes and I immersed myself in art therapy, sound therapy/ hand drumming (overall just creative therapy) I am able to regulate myself better, focus on tasks and I gained back my mojo after ugly episodes where I fixated myself on suicide. 
		
		The videos from Heidi are helpful in the way that it makes us aware of toxic thought patterns but is just that. She doesn't talk about how to work with our bodies. 
		
		You are in freeze state. It's more tricky to get out of freeze mode than , let's say fight or flight. But it's not impossible. 
		
		There are a few Youtubers who talk about this topic but at least they are!:) So I  recommend watching "Irene Lyon" and "The Workout Witch" for somatic exercises. There are also videos about TRE - Trauma Release Exercises from what I remember. I don't remember the channel with the TRE practitioner, but with a search you can find it. 
		
		Sending loving and healing energy🫂

			Thank you so much for taking the time to read and respond!
			
			I’ve made good note of your recommendations!
			
			What makes you believe I’m in a freeze state?
