"Three billionaires destroying the real estate market right now.
Number one, I bet you've never even heard of.
Number three is Jeff Bezos. He's known here for two reasons.
He spent millions investing in this company and you might think it's not a big deal,
it's just a real estate company.
A real estate company has already bought up 200 single-family homes and taken a hundred million
dollars of inventory off the market for first-time home buyers.
And he's buying up hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland, 420,000 acres,
but also way behind Bill Gates.
Just bad, but still not bad enough to be on this list.
Number two is the CEO and co-founder of BlackRock Larry Fink.
Look at this right here. BlackRock and other corporations are buying up to 30% of available
homes in Georgia, 30% in Arizona, and the list just goes on and on.
29% almost 30% in Texas. That's a huge state.
They are choking the housing market of much need it's applied by buying it all up with cash.
Number one is business ban, John Carmel Lums.
82 has a net worth of 9.4 billion that he made in telecommunication.
It's the largest private owner of farmland across America.
And the second largest private land owner just overall.
Between him, another billionaire Ted Turner, and billionaire Bill Gates,
they own over six million land acres in the U.S.
as incapable amount of resources that we all depend on."
