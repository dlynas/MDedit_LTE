When I was young, Eugene McCarthy and Bobby Kennedy challenged the sitting president, LBJ. No one thought it was weird for them to do so. In 1980, Teddy Kennedy challenged the sitting president, Jimmy Carter. No one thought it was weird for him to do so. People simply thought that was the democratic process. Because it is. The narrative that there's something \*wrong\* with challenging an incumbent president - as though there's an unwritten rule that it's a bad idea - is ridiculous. It's part of the "but it has to be this way" illusion by which political elites have trained people to limit our political imaginations for decades. People should run who feel moved to run, and everyone should have a chance to hear their ideas. Three people are running for the Democratic nomination in 2024 and three people should be seen together on a debate stage. \*That\* is the democratic way.



It is so bizarre. Why do people think primaries are held for the incumbent President’s party? If an election is held, there should be debates between the top contenders.

And let us note some details about that history

1968: LBJ started running in the #democraticparty primaries. He didn't debate with Eugene McCarthy, his challenger. He did so bad in #NHpolitics #NHprimary that he dropped out. @JoeBiden has decided to try & skip NH #WeDemandDebates w/ @marwilliamson. The Dems LOST to NIXON!!

Yea, but you are just doing it for the money. You are not a serious candidate.

And Bobby Kennedy Sr was challenging the guiding principles of US foreign policy. You aren’t doing that. You’re projecting the same simplistic “Good Guys vs Bad Guys” nonsense that Joe Biden is. There’s no fundamental difference. Thankfully, Bobby’s is doing that to some degree

I suspect that there is a concern that Biden is not well enough and that his staff won't be able to pre-manage the setting and questions for him well enough so that he'd survive an intense debate. Even if a receiver and earpiece is inconspicuously embedded in his jacket and ear
