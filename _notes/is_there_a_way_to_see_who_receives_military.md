## Is there a way to see who receives military funding?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/18fxhzs/is_there_a_way_to_see_who_receives_military/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/18fxhzs/is_there_a_way_to_see_who_receives_military/)

> As I work through my PhD, I am becoming increasingly aware of the number of members of my department who receive funding from and collaborate directly with the US military. I have figured out how to search DOE grants by PI, but I can't find a similar resource for seeing who receives direct military funding. Is there one?

	What do you mean by 'direct military funding'? The DoD has a pretty straightforward website for looking up their grant awards: [https://publicaccess.dtic.mil/search/#/home](https://publicaccess.dtic.mil/search/#/home)

	Might be able to find something similar for DARPA grants

	hey OP, i'm going to respond off-topic since i understand this impulse and, while laudable to try and be socially conscious about our place in the military-industrial complex, this can become an extremely knotted and complex undertaking as a career physicist. You're already dealing with a field that has a 10-20% survival rate (assuming, of course, you want to stay on something approximating a research course, which may not be the case) so taking on an extra herculean task should be done with extreme care.

	Anyway, as a physicist you're going to be taking money from a diversity of sources to do your work, but ultimately your work is going to be your own. Within a capitalist society you are in a unique position as a researcher to simply... not work in a direction that you find morally objectionable, while still accepting money from people who want you to do it (and who's desires do not align with your own). 

	The military is going to have a vested interest in your work no matter what it is and no matter who is footing the bill, because the US military needs to stay ahead on all technological fronts. You've said elsewhere that you're a solid state physicist, so you're already not working in energetics.

	Be willing to give yourself a bit of grace here. Hell, maybe even think of taking funding from the US military as moving pennies away from missiles and bombs and into any one of ten thousand other objectives. 

	just my 2c.

		And this is true whether or not you work in the US. If you produce publicly available, useful scientific knowledge, the US military (and other militaries) is going to know about it, and going to use it if they can.

	I think it is a bit of an approximation to translate "get funding for research" as "collaborate directly with the US military."

	Is DARPA military in this classification? Just a quick link on their website https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2023-12-06 shows they are funding basic research into quantum computing at multiple universities. The program manager is a Ph.D. from MIT, not a military officer. Probably nobody in the research has talked to a single person in the uniformed military about this project.

	Getting money from a bucket tangentially intended to be research somehow related to defense technologies...I mean, you are pretty close to saying using the Internet is collaborating with the military because it has roots in ARPANet.

	We don't live in a military dictatorship. If money is spent by the government, it's because, in the end, Congress appropriated funds. DARPA isn't asking anybody to build weapons, they aren't asking people to kill people more efficiently, they are just distributing money from a civilian-funded bucket to what their civilian program staff say is most effective. What "collaboration" is this?

	There *are* military-run research labs like MIT Lincoln Laboratory or DOE-run labs like Sandia National Labs. Even much of their research is stuff like abstract radar technology or the video sensors that go into spy satellites, or the failure of semiconductors under radiation, that, yeah, finds the military as the main beneficiary, but is it really morally objectionable? There are admittedly projects like "track the re-entry of ICBM tests" or "understand whether nuclear weapons still work if they have sat on a shelf for 20 years" where it gets morally darker.

	Anyhow, you can draw the line as you like, but another thing to keep in mind is that most funding for universities includes "overhead" so that a good fraction of the money goes to things like keeping the lights on and paying the department secretaries, etc. Might be that using the electricity in the department student lounge to charge your laptop is spending money that came from "the military".

	Also, full disclosure, in my physics career, which ended decades ago, my PI got at least some funding from more-or-less direct military sources, where I gave (or maybe my PI gave and I just answered some questions) a briefing where probably a Lt. Col. was in the room somewhere, I forget. We told them optical filters would be good for various military purposes, we also told them optical filters are good for things like energy-saving windows. We were doing physics, if they want to give us money, ok, we're thankful for it, but I don't take orders from them and I don't salute, we do what the funding contract says and deliver them the reports they want. I guess that's a level of collaboration, but I'm personally OK with that.

			So is being an academic. The DoD doesn’t always want everyone to know what they’re investing in, so if they don’t want you to know about it, it won’t be listed. I’ve seen some pretty morally white stuff get DoD funding, though, so it might be better for you to figure out what the research is and make a decision from there.

					Many published physics papers deliberately credit the funding program on their front page or acknowledgements, often down to the specific grant. That's not "doxxing". 
					
					Like, I was trying to find an arxiv pre-print for the Nature article I linked to from a DARPA PR piece, and I got one from the same group with

					in the acknowledgments. They probably have an ethical obligation to disclose that when publishing, in any case. As for the OP's topic, I mean, these people took money from just about everyone, is their research tainted because some of those have "A", "AF" or "DARPA" in their name? How about that source with "Western Civilization" in it?

		“Most”? How about “there are many”? There are plenty of basic fundamental science research being done through DOE (as OP example) and NSF. Plus more applied but still _not military_ through NASA, NOAA, and others. If OP does not wish to take part in military related work (which I’m assuming is what is behind the question), OP has plenty of opportunities.

			The DOE is *heavily* involved in nuclear weapons. NOAA and NASA are both extremely relevant to both the DoD and three-letter agencies and collaborate frequently. I mean, a rocket is literally a missile that you aim at space instead of the other guy. Never mind all the radio stuff, satellites, imaging, &amp;c. NIST has a ballistics range and works on all sorts of bleeding-edge sensors that are most assuredly dual-use. NSF I’m less sure about, as I don’t know them as anything other than Dr. Moneybags. The military and intelligence communities are in general extremely interested in anything that might be useful, and they have a lot of money to throw around. 
			
			It’s important to note that the military is at least as interested in *saving* lives as ending them, however. To take an example from another field, effective burn treatments and skin grafts were pioneered by military doctors. 
			
			So as I said above, it is perhaps more important to evaluate what a specific avenue of research could be used for before deciding to pursue it. Not taking defense money and publishing based on civilian funding will not stop the military or intelligence communities from using what you discover if they see fit.

			Basic research, military or not is usually small dollar amounts and is considered open for release to the public independent of who sponsors the research.  It’s not until the research becomes applied, what’s called 6.3 or maybe 6.2 research, that application becomes a big concern.
			
			If you look at privately funded research, almost all of it is advanced applied research.  With the loss of Bell Labs, very little basic research is privately funded.  Be grateful that the government does this and that it’s openly disclosed.

						Sure, the DOE was founded 80 years ago to build the atomic bomb.  The core mission of the National Nuclear Security Administration is the safety of the nation's nuclear weapons - but physicists who are being funded by the DOE are not being funded by NNSA.  
						
						Personally, I see no problem with receiving funding from the DOE.  If a person wants to make sure that nothing they do can be used by the military at all, they can't go into tech of any sort.  I think it's disingenuous to make the connection that some DOE money was used to support the bomb, thus DOE funding = military funding.  You might as well say any tax money is thus tainted because tax dollars go to the military.

Even labs such as Argonne that had their origins in the atomic bomb project focus on very different things - cyber security, climate change, training the workforce.
