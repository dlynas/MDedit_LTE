trying to find the words to articulate my utter disdain for the phenomenon of people using the language of social justice to justify interpersonally being shitty partners and friends to people with identities deemed ‘oppressors’ 



am i tripping or talking out my ass here or has anyone noticed the same thing?

for ex., seeing people unironically responding to this clear joke by saying “you shouldn’t praise a man for doing the bare min” is actually so sobering to me like ok sure but also why should a critique of gendered repro labor = not showing appreciation for your partner?

or, seeing people with white partners or friends unironically air out their interpersonal grievances under the guise of ‘social justice’ and allowing that to dictate how you treat them, as if you didn’t know they were white when you got in relationships with them  please stop

My friends ex gf ‘won’ every argument by calling her a colonizer, now owes her thousands in rent but refuses to pay it back, calling it reparations 

Like the plot to a dystopian movie, New York will now monitor social media writings, collect data, and use law enforcement to crack down on any expression it deems to be hate speech.

This phenomenon is ruining the Bachelor franchise

my roommate told my gf & I that we \*have\* to move out at the end of our lease bc she wants the apartment. so my girlfriend said that we all equally have the right to renew (true!) & our roommate said she was a colonizer. like sis, how she colonizing if she on the lease rn?

One of my FB friends fancies herself an anti racist activist (she's old and white). She writes really long posts about listening to black people, not sure how she listens while she's pontificating. Yesterday she was writing about performative allyship.

Purple prose going crazy rn.

I know someone whose friend stopped hanging out with her because her (the person I know) husband’s first language is Spanish. The friend felt there was a power imbalance and I guess deemed it problematic 

No, you're not talking out your ass. I've seen it with a friend. Their parents wanted to get them a house around $50k (doable where we were). They lived with friends and collectively had housing issues. This person said ok to the house, and asked friends to co-own the house.

if they don't want to treat their friends and partners kindness and respect, why be friends/partners at all?

If they really liked them they wouldnt say that. People just want an excuse to be mean

It’s extended outside of social justice and I’ve noticed it with things like psychoanalytical terms (ex gaslighting, codependency, etc). Buzzwords just get overused and lose their meaning in the age of social media, nobody wants to do the work

All these terms and events of the last couple yrs have taught the masses are how to become expert narcissistics, abusers, exploiters etc. The next decade or so is going to really interesting on a micro and marco level, when power shifts from on generation to the next.

there’s a def a difference between “i don’t care about white ppl’s feelings” vs “my friend is hurt by my actions but i’m going to leverage our socioeconomic imbalance as a way to avoid accountability”.

This is definitely a shitty way to treat people around you. I do feel that how much of a problem it actually is may be exaggerated by social media, but then again, I’ve been in the same relationship for twenty years, what do I know?

This commentary just opens the door for people who claim they’re allies to act like victims when they’re asked to walk the walk they’re so loudly discussing. It ignores how the culture we live in directly impacts relationship dynamics.

the thing with

cooking food for her neighbors has been turned into some kind of gendered power play
