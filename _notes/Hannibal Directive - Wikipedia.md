The **Hannibal Directive** ([Hebrew](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language"): נוהל חניבעל; also **Hannibal Procedure** or **Hannibal Protocol**) is the name of a controversial procedure that was used by [Israeli Defense Forces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces "Israel Defense Forces") (IDF) until 2016 to prevent the capture of Israeli soldiers by enemy forces. According to one version, it says that "the kidnapping must be stopped by all means, even at the price of striking and harming our own forces."<sup id="cite_ref-Weiz_2-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-Weiz-2">[2]</a></sup> It was introduced in 1986, after a number of abductions of IDF soldiers in Lebanon and subsequent controversial prisoner exchanges. The full text of the directive was never published, and until 2003, [Israeli military censorship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Israel "Censorship in Israel") forbade any discussion of the subject in the press. The directive has been changed several times,<sup id="cite_ref-Weiz_2-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-Weiz-2">[2]</a></sup> until it was officially revoked in 2016 by IDF chief of staff [Gadi Eizenkot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadi_Eizenkot "Gadi Eizenkot"). The Directive's replacement has not been published.<sup id="cite_ref-Harel16_3-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-Harel16-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-nytimesrevoked_4-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-nytimesrevoked-4">[4]</a></sup>

In 2016, the Hannibal Directive was revoked by then–IDF Chief of Staff [Gadi Eizenkot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadi_Eizenkot "Gadi Eizenkot").

Then–IDF Chief of Staff [Benny Gantz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Gantz "Benny Gantz") (right) in a training exercise where the forces practiced a soldier abduction scenario. Addressing the IDF's operations forum, Gantz stated that IDF protocols do not allow for a soldier to be killed in order to prevent his abduction.<sup id="cite_ref-aftershalit_1-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-aftershalit-1">[1]</a></sup>

Two versions of the Hannibal Directive may have existed simultaneously at times: a written version, accessible only to the upper echelon of the IDF, and an "oral law" version for division commanders and lower levels. In the latter version, "by all means" was often interpreted literally, as in "an IDF soldier was 'better dead than abducted'". In 2011, IDF Chief of Staff [Benny Gantz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Gantz "Benny Gantz") stated the directive does not permit killing IDF soldiers to prevent abduction.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

In case of the abduction of [Gilad Shalit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#Kerem_Shalom_crossing_(2006)), invocation of the Hannibal Directive occurred too late to have any influence on the course of events.

Israeli newspapers have reported that the IDF was issued orders echoing the wording of the Hannibal Directive during the [2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel "2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel"). The IDF was ordered to prevent "at all costs" the abduction of Israeli civilians or soldiers, possibly leading to the death of a large number of Israeli hostages.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_6-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-:4-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:5_7-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-:5-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Ynet240111_8-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-Ynet240111-8">[8]</a></sup>

## Background

Israel has, with [several notable exceptions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Israeli_prisoner_exchanges "List of Israeli prisoner exchanges"), adhered to the principle of not negotiating with those it considers terrorists, especially in hostage situations. This policy led to some notable successes, such as [Operation Entebbe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Entebbe "Operation Entebbe"), but also to loss of human life, e.g. the [Maalot Massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maalot_Massacre "Maalot Massacre"). In cases where Israeli soldiers were captured and no military solution was found, Israel was forced to negotiate with the captors for an exchange of prisoners. Large parts of the Israeli public would not accept abandoning captured soldiers to their fate.

In 1970, a member of the Palestinian National Liberation Movement ([Fatah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah "Fatah")) entered Israel from Lebanon and abducted a security guard in the northernmost Israeli town of [Metula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metula "Metula"). He did this in order to secure a swap of the guard for a senior member of Fatah, jailed in Israel. In 1979, Israel agreed to exchange an Israeli POW held by Palestinians for 76 convicted Palestinian militants in Israeli jails.

After the [1982 Lebanon War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_Lebanon_War "1982 Lebanon War"), Palestinian forces imprisoned nine IDF soldiers as [POWs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/POW "POW"). Six were held by [Fatah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah "Fatah") (the main faction of the [PLO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLO "PLO")) and three by the pro-Syrian [PFLP-GC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PFLP-GC "PFLP-GC"). In 1983, Israel agreed to free 4,700 Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners, including several high ranking PLO officers, for the six IDF soldiers held captive by Fatah. The following year Israel agreed to free another 1,150 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. Many were allowed to remain in Israeli controlled territory.

## The Hannibal Directive

According to _[Haaretz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haaretz "Haaretz")_ reporter Leibovich-Dar, the motivation for the directive was the capture of two Israeli soldiers during a [Hezbollah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah "Hezbollah") ambush in [South Lebanon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lebanon "South Lebanon") in June 1986. Both soldiers presumably died during the attack, and their bodies were returned to Israel in an exchange with Hezbollah in 1996. The directive developers were three top officers of the IDF [Northern Command](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Command_(Israel) "Northern Command (Israel)"): Major General [Yossi Peled](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yossi_Peled "Yossi Peled"), the command's operations officer; Colonel [Gabi Ashkenazi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabi_Ashkenazi "Gabi Ashkenazi"); and the intelligence officer, Colonel [Yaakov Amidror](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_Amidror "Yaakov Amidror"). The order was secret, and its existence was denied by Israeli military authorities.

The exact wording of the directive was not known, though Leibovich-Dar claimed that it had been updated several times over the years.<sup id="cite_ref-Leibovich-Dar1_9-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-Leibovich-Dar1-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Leibovich-Dar2_10-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-Leibovich-Dar2-10">[10]</a></sup> [Anshel Pfeffer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anshel_Pfeffer "Anshel Pfeffer"), writing in _[The Jerusalem Post](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jerusalem_Post "The Jerusalem Post"),_ described the order in 2006 as the "rumored" standard procedure in the eventuality of a kidnap attempt: "soldiers are told, though never officially" the content of this order.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

[Maariv](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maariv_(newspaper) "Maariv (newspaper)") quoted a version of the directive apparently applicable in 2014:

> "A. During a kidnapping, the main task becomes to rescue our soldiers from the abductors, even at the cost of harming or injuring our soldiers.
> 
> B. If the abductors and the kidnapped are identified and the calls are not heeded, a firearm must be fired in order to bring the kidnappers to the ground, or arrest them.
> 
> D.([sic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic "Sic")) If the vehicle or the hijackers do not stop, they should be fired at individually, intentionally, in order to hit the hijackers, even if it means harming our soldiers. (This section was accompanied by an asterisk comment emphasizing: "In any case, everything should be done to stop the vehicle and not allow it to escape").<sup id="cite_ref-Maariv_12-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-Maariv-12">[12]</a></sup>

Apparently, the Hannibal Directive existed in several versions at that time. It had been amended by the [IDF General Staff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Staff_of_the_Israel_Defense_Forces "General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces") in October 2013, but neither the corresponding orders at the [IDF Southern Command](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Command_(Israel) "Southern Command (Israel)"), nor the one at the [Gaza Division](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Division "Gaza Division") had been similarly updated by July 2014. The three different, simultaneously current, versions of the directive could therefore be interpreted in different ways, especially on the sensitive question of the value of a soldier's life.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

Israeli officials insisted that the directive's name was a random computer-generated designation, however, [Hannibal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal "Hannibal"), the Carthaginian general, is said to have preferred suicide by poison rather than being taken prisoner by his Roman enemies.<sup id="cite_ref-Leibovich-Dar1_9-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-Leibovich-Dar1-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Marga_14-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-Marga-14">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

According to statements by several Israeli officials, the aim of the directive is to prevent the capture of an IDF soldier by enemy forces, even by risking the soldier's life or the lives of scores of non-Israeli civilians. Israeli spokespersons claim that IDF forces are forbidden to attempt to kill a captured soldier, rather than having him captured. Many testimonies from IDF soldiers and other sources contradict this claim and suggest that the IDF in practice adheres to the principle that a dead soldier is better than a captive soldier.<sup id="cite_ref-Leibovich-Dar1_9-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-Leibovich-Dar1-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Yeho_16-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-Yeho-16">[16]</a></sup>

According to the directive, once it had been declared by a field officer, Israeli forces were to open fire on enemy forces carrying away an IDF prisoner. Vehicles suspected of removing such a prisoner from the battlefield could thus be attacked, even at the risk of harming, or even killing, the abductee himself. According to some interpretations, this includes even firing missiles from attack helicopters or firing tank shells at suspected escaping vehicles.<sup id="cite_ref-Leibovich-Dar1_9-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-Leibovich-Dar1-9">[9]</a></sup>

[Amos Harel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Harel "Amos Harel") of _[Haaretz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haaretz "Haaretz")_ wrote in November 2011 that the Hannibal Directive was suspended for a time "due to opposition from the public and reservist soldiers" but was revised and reinstated by IDF Chief-of-Staff [Benny Gantz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Gantz "Benny Gantz") after the abduction of [Gilad Shalit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Shalit "Gilad Shalit") in June 2006. The revised order stated that IDF commanders may take whatever action is necessary, even at the risk of endangering the life of an abducted soldier, to foil an abduction, but it does not allow them to kill an abducted Israeli soldier.<sup id="cite_ref-aftershalit_1-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-aftershalit-1">[1]</a></sup> The post-2006 version gave local field commanders the right to invoke Hannibal and take action, without waiting for superior officers' confirmation.<sup id="cite_ref-Marga_14-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-Marga-14">[14]</a></sup>

Former head of [Israeli military intelligence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Intelligence_Directorate_(Israel) "Military Intelligence Directorate (Israel)") (1974–1978) [Shlomo Gazit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Gazit "Shlomo Gazit") criticised the fact that a low level officer ("a corporal") could invoke the Hannibal Directive, with such potentially far reaching consequences. The invocation of the Hannibal Directive in the [2006 Hezbollah cross-border raid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Hezbollah_cross-border_raid "2006 Hezbollah cross-border raid") had far-reaching consequences. An IDF tank sent in pursuit of the abductors attacked, killing its crew. Attempts to rescue the bodies of the tank crew led to further IDF losses. By the time the Israeli government convened to decide how to respond to the attack, Israel - according to Gazit - "was already at war".<sup id="cite_ref-Gaz_17-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-Gaz-17">[17]</a></sup>

The Hannibal Directive was officially revoked by the military in 2016.<sup id="cite_ref-nytimesrevoked_4-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-nytimesrevoked-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> The directive was replaced by three separate directives in January 2017. They were named "True Test", "Tourniquet" and "Guardian of life" and dealt with abductions in the West Bank and outside Israel in peace time and a general directive for war time. Very little is known about the content of these directives or the eventual differences between them. One general difference between the new and the previous Hannibal directive is that now it is clearly stated that, in case of an attempted abduction, soldiers should fire at the abductors "while avoiding hitting the captive."<sup id="cite_ref-Gross_20-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-Gross-20">[20]</a></sup>

## Controversy within the IDF

Dr. [Avner Shiftan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Avner_Shiftan&action=edit&redlink=1 "Avner Shiftan (page does not exist)"), an army physician with the rank of major, came across the Hannibal directive while on reserve duty in [South Lebanon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon "Southern Lebanon") in 1999. In army briefings he "became aware of a procedure ordering soldiers to kill any IDF soldier if he should be taken captive by Hezbollah. This procedure struck me as being illegal and not consistent with the moral code of the IDF. I understood that it was not a local procedure but originated in the [General Staff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Staff_of_the_Israel_Defense_Forces "General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces"), and had the feeling that a direct approach to the army authorities would be of no avail, but would end in a cover-up."<sup id="cite_ref-Lavie_21-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-Lavie-21">[21]</a></sup>

He contacted [Asa Kasher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asa_Kasher "Asa Kasher"), the Israeli philosopher noted for his authorship of [Israel Defense Forces' Code of Conduct](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces#Code_of_conduct "Israel Defense Forces"), who "found it difficult to believe that such an order exists" since this "is wrong ethically, legally and morally". He doubted that "there is anyone in the army" believing that 'better a dead soldier than an abducted soldier'. Haaretz article about Dr. Shiftan's experience was the first to be published in an Israeli newspaper.<sup id="cite_ref-Lavie_21-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-Lavie-21">[21]</a></sup>

In contrast to the view of Kasher, the [IDF Chief of Staff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_General_Staff_(Israel) "Chief of the General Staff (Israel)") [Shaul Mofaz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaul_Mofaz "Shaul Mofaz") said in an interview with Israeli daily _[Yedioth Ahronoth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yedioth_Ahronoth "Yedioth Ahronoth")_ in 1999: "In certain senses, with all the pain that saying this entails, an abducted soldier, in contrast to a soldier who has been killed, is a national problem." Asked whether he was referring to cases like [Ron Arad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Arad_(pilot) "Ron Arad (pilot)") (an [Air Force](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Air_Force "Israeli Air Force") navigator captured in 1986) and [Nachshon Wachsman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nachshon_Wachsman "Nachshon Wachsman") (an abducted soldier killed in 1994 in a failed rescue attempt), he replied "definitely, and not only".<sup id="cite_ref-Lavie_21-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-Lavie-21">[21]</a></sup>

According to Prof. [Emanuel Gross](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Emanuel_Gross&action=edit&redlink=1 "Emanuel Gross (page does not exist)"), from the Faculty of Law at the [University of Haifa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Haifa "University of Haifa"), "Orders like that have to go through the filter of the Military Advocate General's Office, and if they were not involved that is very grave", he said. "The reason is that an order that knowingly permits the death of soldiers to be brought about, even if the intentions were different, carries a black flag and is a flagrantly illegal order that undermines the most central values of our social norms".<sup id="cite_ref-Leibovich-Dar1_9-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-Leibovich-Dar1-9">[9]</a></sup>

Harel writes that a kind of "[Oral Law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_Torah "Oral Torah")" has developed inside IDF, which is supported by many commanders, even at brigade and division level. It goes further than the official order, including the use of tank shells or air strikes. "A dangerous, unofficial interpretation of the protocol has been created," a senior officer told _Haaretz_. "Intentionally targeting a vehicle in order to kill the abductee is a completely illegal command. The army's senior command must make this clear to officers."<sup id="cite_ref-aftershalit_1-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-aftershalit-1">[1]</a></sup>

In anticipation of the [Gaza War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_War_(2008%E2%80%9309) "Gaza War (2008–09)") in 2009, Lt. Col. Shuki Ribak, the commander of the [Golani Brigade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golani_Brigade "Golani Brigade")'s 51st battalion instructed his soldiers to avoid kidnapping at any cost and even made clear that he expected his soldiers to commit suicide rather than being abducted:

> \[N\]o soldier in Battalion 51 will be kidnapped at any price. At any price. Under any condition. Even if it means that he blows himself with his own grenade together with those trying to capture him. Also even if it means that now his unit has to fire a barrage at the car that they are trying to take him away in.<sup id="cite_ref-warn_22-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-warn-22">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>

After a recording of Ribak's instructions was distributed by an anonymous source, the IDF reiterated its denial of having a policy of intentionally killing captured soldiers.<sup id="cite_ref-warn_22-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-warn-22">[22]</a></sup>

## Incidents where the directive was invoked

### Shebaa farms (2000)

The Hannibal Directive was invoked in October 2000 after the [Hezbollah capture of three Israeli soldiers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Hezbollah_cross-border_raid "2000 Hezbollah cross-border raid") in the Israeli-occupied [Shebaa Farms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebaa_Farms "Shebaa Farms") (Har Dov) area. An Israeli border patrol was attacked by a Hezbollah squad with rockets and automatic fire. St.-Sgt. Adi Avitan, St.-Sgt. Benyamin Avraham and St.-Sgt. Omar Sawaid were captured and brought over the ceasefire line into Lebanon by their captors. When the abduction was discovered, the Northern Command ordered a "Hannibal situation". Israeli attack helicopters fired at 26 moving vehicles in the area since they assumed that the abducted soldiers were transported in one of them. Yossi Rephaeloff, the commanding officer who invoked the Hannibal procedure, was asked if it did not occur to him that by firing at the cars he might also kill the abducted soldiers. He answered that when he saw the jeep, he realized that they were no longer alive.<sup id="cite_ref-Leibovich-Dar1_9-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-Leibovich-Dar1-9">[9]</a></sup>

### Kerem Shalom crossing (2006)

Tank gunner Cpl. [Gilad Shalit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Shalit "Gilad Shalit") was captured by Hamas in a [cross-border raid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Gaza_cross-border_raid "2006 Gaza cross-border raid") from Gaza 25 June 2006. Two IDF soldiers were killed in the attack and another two were wounded. Shalit was held for five years, before being exchanged for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, which was the highest number released for a single Israeli prisoner. According to the Israeli commission of inquiry, headed by [Giora Eiland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giora_Eiland "Giora Eiland"), the Hannibal directive was declared more than an hour after the capture. By that time, Shalit and his captors were already well inside the Gaza strip.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> The declaration of Hannibal therefore had few practical consequences.

### Ayta ash-Shaab (2006)

On 12 July 2006, two Israeli soldiers, Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev, were captured by Hezbollah in an [ambush](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Hezbollah_cross-border_raid "2006 Hezbollah cross-border raid"), in which three other soldiers were killed. The Hannibal directive was invoked and a force consisting of tanks and Armored Personnel Carriers was sent across the border to capture a Hezbollah post and block the exit routes out of the town of [Ayta ash-Sha’b](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayta_ash-Shab "Ayta ash-Shab"). A [Merkava II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkava "Merkava") main battle tank ran over a powerful explosive charge and was totally destroyed and its four crew killed. The rescue mission was therefore aborted. An eighth IDF soldier was killed trying to retrieve the bodies of the tank crew.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> The Hannibal directive triggered instant aerial surveillance and airstrikes inside Lebanon to limit Hezbollah's ability to move the soldiers it had seized. "If we had found them, we would have hit them, even if it meant killing the soldiers," a senior Israeli official said.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> The bodies of the two soldiers were returned in an exchange with Hezbollah in July 2008.

### Gaza (2008–09)

During the [2008–2009 Gaza war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_War_(2008%E2%80%9309) "Gaza War (2008–09)"), an unidentified Israeli soldier was shot and injured by a [Hamas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas "Hamas") fighter during a search of a house in one of the neighbourhoods of Gaza. The Hannibal directive was declared. The wounded soldiers' comrades evacuated the house due to fears that it was booby-trapped. According to testimony by soldiers who took part in the incident the house was then shelled to prevent the wounded soldier from being captured alive by Hamas. According to the IDF spokesman, however, the soldier was already dead, killed by terrorist gun fire.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>

### Erez crossing (2009)

In 2009, Israeli civilian Yakir Ben-Melech was shot dead by Israeli security guards while trying to enter the [Gaza Strip](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip") from Israel, by jumping the fence at the [Erez crossing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erez_crossing "Erez crossing"). He was a mental patient of [Yehuda Abarbanel Mental Health Center](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yehuda_Abarbanel_Mental_Health_Center&action=edit&redlink=1 "Yehuda Abarbanel Mental Health Center (page does not exist)"), who, according to family members, wanted to contact [Hamas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas "Hamas"), to secure the release of Israeli captive [Gilad Shalit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Shalit "Gilad Shalit"). According to Shlomo Saban, director of the Erez crossing, several warning shots have been fired, after which the man was shot in the leg, an injury that has caused extensive loss of blood and eventually led to his death.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>

### Rafah (2014)

During the [2014 Gaza War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War "2014 Gaza War"), the third major offensive launched by Israel in Gaza since 2008, IDF [Givati Brigade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Givati_Brigade "Givati Brigade") Lieutenant Hadar Goldin was captured by Hamas militants after a brief skirmish on August 1, despite the announcement of a 72-hour ceasefire agreement earlier that day.

### Qalandia Camp (2016)

Two members of the [Oketz Unit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oketz_Unit "Oketz Unit") (Special Forces) soldiers entered Qalandiya Refugee Camp by mistake and were confronted by a Palestinan crowd, which began throwing stones and molotov cocktails. The burning jeep was abandoned and the two soldiers got separated in the alleys of the camp. One of them retained his mobile phone, contacted IDF command and was picked up by IDF forces. The second soldier hid in a yard, waiting to be rescued. Meanwhile "Hannibal" was declared and the camp was surrounded by large numbers of IDF forces. After less than an hour the second soldier was found unharmed. So, none of the IDF soldiers were ever captured by Palestinians. One Palestinian was killed in the clashes, while 10 Palestinians and five Israeli soldiers were wounded.<sup id="cite_ref-61"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup>

### 2023 Israel–Hamas war

The Hannibal directive, previously understood to generally apply to situations involving IDF soldiers, enemy combatants and possibly non-Israeli civilians (with the goal of avoiding a repetition of the [Ahmad Jibril](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jibril_Agreement "Jibril Agreement"), [Samir Kuntar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samir_Kuntar "Samir Kuntar") and [Gilad Shalit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Shalit_prisoner_exchange "Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange") prisoner exhanges thought as unfavorable for Israel), but not to Israeli civilians, was allegedly implemented by the IDF on a mass scale targeting Israeli civilian hostages while they were being driven by Hamas militants into Gaza on 7 October 2023, the first time in the history of the [Israeli–Palestinian conflict](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict "Israeli–Palestinian conflict") that a Palestinian kidnapping operation and subsequent IDF Hannibal reaction included Israeli civilians.<sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup>

On 5 December 2023, Israeli [hostages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_war_hostage_crisis "2023 Israel–Hamas war hostage crisis") released by Hamas met with [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu "Benjamin Netanyahu")'s [war cabinet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_war_cabinet "Israeli war cabinet") and claimed that, during the 7 October [Hamas attack on Israel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Al-Aqsa_Flood "Operation Al-Aqsa Flood") they were deliberately attacked by Israeli helicopters on their way into Gaza, and were shelled constantly by the Israeli military while they were there.<sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup>

In an interview with Israel's _[Haaretz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haaretz "Haaretz")_ weekly Hebrew pod, Lieut. Col. Nof Erez explained that the IDF was more or less wiped out on the ground on the Gaza border. There was no one that helicopter or drone pilots could communicate with. This made the identification of persons on the ground very difficult. According to Erez, "the Hannibal \[Protocol\], for which we have been conducting drills over the past 20 years, relates to the case a single vehicle containing hostages: you know which part of the fence it comes through, what side of the road it would move to and even which road... What we saw here was a "mass Hannibal". There were many openings in the fence. Thousands of people in many different vehicles, both with hostages and without hostages".<sup id="cite_ref-Haaretz231109Ere7_64-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-Haaretz231109Ere7-64">[64]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-MEEYTErez_65-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-MEEYTErez-65">[65]</a></sup>

The Israeli broadcaster [Channel 12](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_12_(Israel) "Channel 12 (Israel)") reported on 16 December that IDF forces had shot at a tractor carrying hostages to Gaza, killing one hostage and injuring others.<sup id="cite_ref-:02_66-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-:02-66">[66]</a></sup> On 18 December the IDF admitted that "casualties fell as a result of friendly fire on October 7," but added that "beyond the operational investigations of the events, it would not be morally sound to investigate these incidents due to the immense and complex quantity of them that took place in the kibbutzim and southern Israeli communities due to the challenging situations the soldiers were in at the time."<sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup>

According to Kibbutz [Be'eri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be%27eri "Be'eri") survivors Hadas Dagan and Yasmin Porat, an Israeli tank fired two shells at a house that was known to hold over a dozen hostages, including 12-year-old twins; only one hostage survived.<sup id="cite_ref-:22_68-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-:22-68">[68]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:32_69-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-:32-69">[69]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-70"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup> In January 2024, a [Haaretz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haaretz "Haaretz") editorial asked the IDF to disclose whether the Hannibal Directive was used during the [Be'eri massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be%27eri_massacre "Be'eri massacre").<sup id="cite_ref-:5_7-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-:5-7">[7]</a></sup> A few days later, an investigation by Israeli newspaper _[Yedioth Ahronoth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yedioth_Ahronoth "Yedioth Ahronoth")_ concluded that the IDF had in practice applied the Hannibal Directive from noon of October 7, ordering all combat units to stop "at all costs" any attempt by Hamas terrorists to return to Gaza with hostages.<sup id="cite_ref-Ynet240111_8-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-Ynet240111-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-YA240112_71-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-YA240112-71">[71]</a></sup> According to _Yedioth Ahronoth_, Israeli soldiers inspected around 70 vehicles on the roads leading to Gaza that had been hit by a helicopter, tank or [UAV](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAV "UAV"), killing all occupants in at least some cases.<sup id="cite_ref-Ynet240111_8-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-Ynet240111-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-YA240112_71-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-YA240112-71">[71]</a></sup>

Also in January, Noam Dan, cousin of hostage Ofer Calderon, launched an accusation against the Israeli Prime Minister, claiming that captives in Gaza are being deliberately sacrificed as part of a strategy to prolong \[Netanyahu's\] political tenure. Dan argued that this forms part of a wider "Hannibal Directive", stating, "My government is annihilating them."<sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup>

On 28 March 2024 IDF Captain Bar Zonshein gave an interview in which he recounted firing tank shells on vehicles carrying Israeli civilians on October 7. "I decided that this is the right decision, that it's better to stop the abduction and that they not be taken," he told Israeli media outlets.<sup id="cite_ref-73"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup>

On 5 April an inquiry into the events around the kidnapping of Efrat Katz, a resident of Kibbutz Nir Oz, one of the communities targeted by the attack, examined a variety of video evidence and testimony of witnesses. It said the evidence showed that one of the helicopter gunships fired at a vehicle in which gunmen were travelling and which the evidence also suggested had hostages in it. "As a result of the fire, most of the terrorists manning the vehicle were killed, and most likely, Efrat Katz ... was killed as well," it said in a statement. It said the investigation showed that the hostages could not be distinguished by existing surveillance systems. "The commander of the air force did not find fault in the operation by the helicopter crew, who operated in compliance with the orders in a complex reality of war," it said.<sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup>

> The nightmare we went through for 10 years is indescribable, but despite that, I would not agree to have the buddies of an abducted soldier try to save him even at the price of killing him. As long as there is life there is hope. I am also positive that the soldiers would refuse to obey the order and would not kill an Israeli soldier. What about the effect of the order on the soldiers' morale? A soldier who is taken prisoner has to know that everything will be done to rescue him without killing him.

## Military evaluation by opponents

In October 2019 the head of the [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps "Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps") (IRGC) [Quds Force](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quds_Force "Quds Force"), Major-General [Qasem Soleimani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasem_Soleimani "Qasem Soleimani"), gave an interview to Iranian state television on the [2006 Lebanon War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Lebanon_War "2006 Lebanon War"). In it he stressed that the use of the Hannibal Directive by the IDF made organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah upgrade their operational planning and make their hostage-taking operations more meticulous, in order to avoid getting their hostages killed by Israeli fire. Describing the [2006 Hezbollah cross-border raid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Hezbollah_cross-border_raid "2006 Hezbollah cross-border raid"), Soleimani said:

> The \[Hezbollah\] fighters had to cross the border, reach the long-watched Israeli outpost, and take the prisoners. Thus, each operation had to be done so carefully that the Israeli soldiers inside the tanks were not killed. \[...\] The operation had to be carried out very quickly: not in 15 or 30 minutes, but in a very few minutes or even seconds. They had to move the captured Israeli soldiers very quickly to a safe place before the enemy could reach them (and this is always very dangerous, because the enemy in such cases uses the so-called Hannibal Protocol, i.e. opens fire on its own captured soldiers and Resistance fighters, because he prefers to have dead Israeli soldiers than prisoners that he will later be forced to exchange for imprisoned Resistance fighters). Usually, the enemy is within a few minutes of the point of operation – I mean the ground force, since for the air force it could of course take much less time and the enemy would arrive very quickly. So it had to be designed very precisely.<sup id="cite_ref-75"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup>

The SWAT commander thought more kidnappers might surrender. The general wanted the situation resolved by nightfall. Minutes later, the militants launched a rocket-propelled grenade, according to the general and other witnesses who spoke to The Times. 'The negotiations are over,' General Hiram recalled telling the tank commander. 'Break in, even at the cost of civilian casualties.' The tank fired two light shells at the house. Shrapnel from the second shell hit Mr. Dagan in the neck, severing an artery and killing him, his wife said. During the melee, the kidnappers were also killed.
