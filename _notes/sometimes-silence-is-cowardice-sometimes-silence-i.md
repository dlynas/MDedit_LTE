## Sometimes silence is cowardice. Sometimes silence is presence. 

When Audre Lorde said, “your silence will not protect you”, she was speaking to people who have been silenced but had something to say. It was not a mandate to speak and center your own barely-formed opinions in the midst of every conflict. And it certainly was not a mandate to perform your pain or outrage in the public theater that is social media. 

Social media deceives us into thinking it is the supreme form of expression and justice work. But these spaces were not made to care for and protect Black women. And sometimes silence in this space frees you up to advocate better and with more sincerity and curiosity in another space. It does not mean silence in total. Do what feels just and sincere through whatever medium feels just and sincere.

** I’ve been surprised and encouraged how helpful and human the comments on this post have been. But I am logging off for dinner/bedtime and I won’t have the space to swiftly delete/block Islamophobic and antisemitic trolls, so I have to turn off comments for now. If you are having a generative conversation or organizing with folks in the comments, be sure to dm each other in the next hour as I’ll be closing the comment section.
