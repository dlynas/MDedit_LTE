## if you've ever felt like you'd love to join a space where you could discuss some of the themes and topics that we explore in our episodes, now you can! we've partnered with the folks at @eco.gathering who host weekly remote gatherings to discuss a wide variety of topics. this week's theme is LAND and features our episode with Prakash Kashwan, "Decolonizing Conservation."

From EcoGather: "More than half of humans worldwide now live in cities, detached from land–and ancestral homelands–to varying degrees. Concerns about land, especially on a small scale, are often dismissed as trivial or quaint when our predicaments–climate change, global inequality, geopolitical tensions–are so large. However, the importance of land on any scale cannot be overstated: it is the foundation of language, culture, and for those of us terrestrially inclined beings, life itself. So how did we get to this point where half the human world has been deracinated from their ancestral lands? What does this mean for our relationship to the living world and each other? And how might we relate more intimately to land–belong to a living place–in our various contexts? Access to land is also a fundamental requirement for procuring one’s needs for survival. Without land, the barriers to opting out of breaking systems of oppression are that much larger.

	"Even the science of conservation is founded on this assumption that people and wildlife do not coexist
	and so the majority and the most powerful and most well-resourced wildlife conservation programs are founded on this myth of nature, society, separation.
	Now this comes in a way from this legacy that settler colonialism has of destroying nature wherever it calls home.
	So we have these urban areas or towns where there's literally no nature and then because we don't have nature in our day to day lives, we need these parks so that we can drive over the weekend or during vacations to enjoy nature.
	And so this assumption of nature, society, separation based on a very specific European cultural experience and European cultural philosophy is implanted.

	"that its root, the model is premised on the expendability of black and brown people
	and throwing them out of those landscapes.
	So the creation of pristine landscapes that are fenced is based on this model of dispossession
	and that's where the extraction starts.
	An extractive economy that in the name of climate change and wildlife conservation and biodiversity
	is contributing to the continuation of business as usual here in Global North
	and continuation of repressive, oppressive dispossession models of conservation and carbon sequestration
	in the Global South.

	"The first part of alternative has to start from rejecting this notion that society and civilization exist in concrete blocks and nature exist in those safe boxes of nature, separate in national parks and so forth.
	Once we reject these binaries, we know that fossil fuel extraction that is happening right now inside the boundaries of our national parks needs to be stopped and small scale gardening and agriculture and resource harvesting and fire intervention and grazing, all of those kinds of interventions need to be brought back.
	So what we are doing there is that we are rebalancing our engagement with national parks in a way so that the fossil fuel economy is gone and it's then replaced by activities that would support local economies, will create local jobs and will create human nature interactions that are good for conservation."
