**Arrow's impossibility theorem** is a key result in [social choice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_choice_theory "Social choice theory") showing that no [ranked-choice voting rule](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting "Ranked voting")<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-1">[note 1]</a></sup> can produce [logically coherent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory "Rational choice theory") results with more than two candidates. Specifically, any such rule violates _[independence of irrelevant alternatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_of_irrelevant_alternatives "Independence of irrelevant alternatives")_: the principle that a choice between ![{\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3) and ![{\displaystyle B}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/47136aad860d145f75f3eed3022df827cee94d7a) should not depend on the quality of a third, unrelated outcome ![{\displaystyle C}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4fc55753007cd3c18576f7933f6f089196732029).<sup id="cite_ref-:3_2-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:3-2">[1]</a></sup>

The result is often cited in discussions of [election science](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_science "Election science") and [voting theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_theory "Voting theory"), where ![{\displaystyle C}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4fc55753007cd3c18576f7933f6f089196732029) is called a [spoiler candidate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_effect "Spoiler effect"). As a result, Arrow's theorem implies that a ranked voting system can never be completely independent of spoilers.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_2-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:3-2">[1]</a></sup>

The practical consequences of the theorem are debatable, with Arrow himself noting "[Most \[ranked\] systems](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method "Condorcet method") are not going to work badly all of the time. All I proved is that all can work badly [at times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_paradox "Condorcet paradox")."<sup id="cite_ref-ns122_3-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-ns122-3">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:02_4-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:02-4">[3]</a></sup> However, the susceptibility of different systems varies greatly. [Plurality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting "Plurality voting") and [instant-runoff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting "Instant-runoff voting") suffer spoiler effects more often than other methods.<sup id="cite_ref-:43_5-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:43-5">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Borgers22_6-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-Borgers22-6">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Holliday2_7-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-Holliday2-7">[6]</a></sup> [Majority-choice methods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method "Condorcet method") uniquely [minimize the effect of spoilers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#Minimizing) on election results, limiting them to rare<sup id="cite_ref-:532_8-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:532-8">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:632_9-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:632-9">[8]</a></sup> situations known as [cyclic ties](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_cycle "Condorcet cycle").<sup id="cite_ref-Holliday2_7-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-Holliday2-7">[6]</a></sup>

While originally overlooked, a large class of systems called [rated methods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rated_voting "Rated voting") are not affected by Arrow's theorem or IIA failures.<sup id="cite_ref-:02_4-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:02-4">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:022_10-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:022-10">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Poundstone,_William.-20132_11-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-Poundstone,_William.-20132-11">[10]</a></sup> Arrow himself initially did not consider such systems as a result of [philosophical objections](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Interpersonal_comparison_of_utilities&action=edit&redlink=1 "Interpersonal comparison of utilities (page does not exist)"); however, he would go on to recognize such systems are not subject to his theorem, leading him to advocate for [score voting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_voting "Score voting") later in life.<sup id="cite_ref-:02_4-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:02-4">[3]</a></sup>

## History [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")

Arrow's theorem is named after economist and Nobel laureate [Kenneth Arrow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Arrow "Kenneth Arrow"), who demonstrated it in his doctoral thesis and popularized it in his [1951 book](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Choice_and_Individual_Values "Social Choice and Individual Values").<sup id="cite_ref-:3_2-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:3-2">[1]</a></sup>

Arrow's work is remembered as much for its pioneering methodology as its direct implications. Arrow's axiomatic approach provided a framework for proving facts about all conceivable [voting mechanisms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_choice_function "Social choice function") at once, contrasting with the earlier approach of investigating such rules one by one.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-12">[11]</a></sup>

## Background [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Background")

Arrow's theorem falls under the branch of [welfare economics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_economics "Welfare economics") known as [social choice theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_choice_theory "Social choice theory"), which deals with aggregating [preferences](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference "Preference") and information to make fair and accurate decisions for society. The goal is to create a [social ordering function](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_welfare_function "Social welfare function")—a procedure for determining which outcomes are better, according to society as a whole—that satisfies the properties of [rational behavior](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory "Rational choice theory").<sup id="cite_ref-:3_2-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:3-2">[1]</a></sup>

Among the most important is _independence of irrelevant alternatives_, which says that when deciding between ![{\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3) and ![{\displaystyle B}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/47136aad860d145f75f3eed3022df827cee94d7a), our opinions about some irrelevant option ![{\displaystyle C}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4fc55753007cd3c18576f7933f6f089196732029) should not affect our decision.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_2-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:3-2">[1]</a></sup> Arrow's theorem shows this is not possible without relying on further information, such as [rated ballots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rated_ballot "Rated ballot") (rejected by strict [behaviorists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism "Behaviorism")).<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-13">[12]</a></sup>

### Non-degenerate systems [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Non-degenerate systems")

As background, it is typically assumed that any non-[degenerate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_case "Degenerate case") (i.e. actually useful) voting system non-dictatorship:

-   _[**Non-dictatorship**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_mechanism "Dictatorship mechanism")—_at least two voters can affect the outcome of the election. (The system does not just ignore every vote except one, or even ignore all of the votes and always elect the same candidate.)

Most proofs use additional assumptions to simplify deriving the result, though Robert Wilson proved these to be unnecessary.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_14-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:1-14">[13]</a></sup> Older proofs have taken as axioms:

-   [_Non-negative response_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonicity_criterion "Monotonicity criterion")_—increasing_ the rank of an outcome should not make them _lose._ In other words, a candidate should never lose as a result of winning "too many votes".<sup id="cite_ref-:3_2-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:3-2">[1]</a></sup> While originally considered "obvious" for any practical system, [instant-runoff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting "Instant-runoff voting") fails this criterion. Arrow later gave another proof applying to systems with negative response.<sup id="cite_ref-Arrow_19632_15-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-Arrow_19632-15">[14]</a></sup>
-   [_Pareto efficiency_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency "Pareto efficiency")—if every voter agrees one candidate is better than another, the system will agree as well. (A candidate with unanimous support should win.) This assumption replaces non-negative response in Arrow's second proof, extending it to include instant-runoff.<sup id="cite_ref-Arrow_19632_15-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-Arrow_19632-15">[14]</a></sup>
-   [_Majority rule_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_rule "Majority rule")—if most voters prefer   to  , then   should defeat  . This form was proven by the [Marquis de Condorcet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_de_Condorcet "Marquis de Condorcet") with his discovery of the [voting paradox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_paradox "Condorcet paradox").
-   [_Universal domain_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)")—Some authors are explicit about the assumption that the [social welfare function](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_welfare_function "Social welfare function") is a function over the domain of all possible preferences (not just a [partial function](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_function "Partial function")).
    -   In other words, the system cannot simply "give up" and refuse to elect a candidate in some elections.
    -   Without this assumption, [majority rule](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_rule "Majority rule") is the only system that satisfies Arrow's criteria, by [May's theorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/May%27s_theorem "May's theorem"). This result is often cited as justification for [Condorcet methods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_methods "Condorcet methods"), which always elect a majority-preferred candidate if possible.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_16-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:2-16">[15]</a></sup>

### Independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA)")

The IIA condition is an important assumption governing [rational choice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory "Decision theory"). The axiom says that adding irrelevant—i.e. rejected—options should not affect the outcome of a decision. From a practical point of view, the assumption prevents electoral outcomes from behaving erratically in response to the arrival and departure of candidates.<sup id="cite_ref-Arrow_19632_15-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-Arrow_19632-15">[14]</a></sup>

Arrow defines IIA slightly differently, by stating that the social preference between alternatives   and   should only depend on the individual preferences between   and  ; that is, it should not be able to go from   to   by changing preferences over some irrelevant alternative, e.g. whether  . This is equivalent to the above statement about independence of [spoiler candidates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_effect "Spoiler effect"), which can be proven by using the [standard construction of a placement function](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_welfare_function#Constructing_a_social_ordering "Social welfare function").<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-17">[16]</a></sup>

## Theorem [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Theorem")

### Intuitive argument [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Intuitive argument")

Arrow's requirement that the social preference   only depend on individual preferences   is extremely restrictive. [May's theorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/May%27s_theorem "May's theorem") shows that the only "fair" way to aggregate ordinal preferences for pairs of preferences is simple majority; thus, assumptions only slightly stronger than Arrow's are already enough to lock us into the class of [Condorcet methods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method "Condorcet method"). At this point, the existence of the [voting paradox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_paradox "Condorcet paradox") is enough to show the impossibility of rational behavior for [ranked-choice voting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting "Ranked voting").

While the above argument is intuitive, it is not rigorous, and it requires additional assumptions not used by Arrow.

### Formal statement [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Formal statement")

Let **A** be a set of **outcomes**, _N_ a number of voters or decision criteria. We denote the set of all [total orderings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order "Total order") of A by L(A).

An [**ordinal (ranked)**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting "Ranked voting") **social welfare function** is a function:

which aggregates voters' preferences into a single preference order on A.

An _N_\-[tuple](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple "Tuple") (_R_<sub>1</sub>, …, _R_<sub><i>N</i></sub>) ∈ L(A)<sup><i>N</i></sup> of voters' preferences is called a _preference profile_. We assume two conditions:

[Pareto efficiency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency "Pareto efficiency")

If alternative **a** is ranked strictly higher than **b** for all orderings _R_<sub>1</sub> , …, _R_<sub><i>N</i></sub>, then **a** is ranked strictly higher than **b** by F(_R_<sub>1</sub>, _R_<sub>2</sub>, …, _R_<sub><i>N</i></sub>). This axiom is not needed to prove the result,<sup id="cite_ref-:1_14-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:1-14">[13]</a></sup> but is used in both proofs below.

[Non-dictatorship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_mechanism "Dictatorship mechanism")

There is no individual _i_ whose strict preferences always prevail. That is, there is no _i_ ∈ {1, …, _N_} such that for all (_R_<sub>1</sub>, …, _R_<sub><i>N</i></sub>) ∈ L(A)<sup><i>N</i></sup> and all **a** and **b**, when **a** is ranked strictly higher than **b** by _R<sub>i</sub>_ then **a** is ranked strictly higher than **b** by F(_R_<sub>1</sub>, _R_<sub>2</sub>, …, _R_<sub><i>N</i></sub>).

Then, this rule must violate independence of irrelevant alternatives:

[Independence of irrelevant alternatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_of_irrelevant_alternatives "Independence of irrelevant alternatives")

For two preference profiles (_R_<sub>1</sub>, …, _R_<sub><i>N</i></sub>) and (_S_<sub>1</sub>, …, _S_<sub><i>N</i></sub>) such that for all individuals _i_, alternatives **a** and **b** have the same order in _R<sub>i</sub>_ as in _S<sub>i</sub>_, alternatives **a** and **b** have the same order in F(_R_<sub>1</sub>, …, _R_<sub><i>N</i></sub>) as in F(_S_<sub>1</sub>, …, _S_<sub><i>N</i></sub>).

### Formal proof [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Formal proof")

Proof by decisive coalition

 |
| --- |
| 

Arrow's proof used the concept of _decisive coalitions_.<sup id="cite_ref-Arrow_19632_15-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-Arrow_19632-15">[14]</a></sup>

Definition:

-   A subset of voters is a **coalition**.
-   A coalition is **decisive over an ordered pair**   if, when everyone in the coalition ranks  , society overall will always rank  .
-   A coalition is **decisive** if and only if it is decisive over all ordered pairs.

Our goal is to prove that the **decisive coalition** contains only one voter, who controls the outcome—in other words, a [dictator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_mechanism "Dictatorship mechanism").

The following proof is a simplification taken from [Amartya Sen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen "Amartya Sen")<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-18">[17]</a></sup> and [Ariel Rubinstein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Rubinstein "Ariel Rubinstein").<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-19">[18]</a></sup> The simplified proof uses an additional concept:

-   A coalition is **weakly decisive** over   if and only if when every voter   in the coalition ranks  , _and_ every voter   outside the coalition ranks  , then  .

Thenceforth assume that the social choice system satisfies unrestricted domain, Pareto efficiency, and IIA. Also assume that there are at least 3 distinct outcomes.

**Field expansion lemma** — if a coalition   is weakly decisive over   for some  , then it is decisive.

**Proof**

Let   be an outcome distinct from  .

Claim:   is decisive over  .

Let everyone in   vote   over  . By IIA, changing the votes on   does not matter for  . So change the votes such that   in   and   and   outside of  .

By Pareto,  . By coalition weak-decisiveness over  ,  . Thus  .  

Similarly,   is decisive over  .

By iterating the above two claims (note that decisiveness implies weak-decisiveness), we find that   is decisive over all ordered pairs in  . Then iterating that, we find that   is decisive over all ordered pairs in  .

**Group contraction lemma** — If a coalition is decisive, and has size  , then it has a proper subset that is also decisive.

**Proof**

Let   be a coalition with size  . Partition the coalition into nonempty subsets  .

Fix distinct  . Design the following voting pattern (notice that it is the cyclic voting pattern which causes the Condorcet paradox):

(Items other than   are not relevant.)

Since   is decisive, we have  . So at least one is true:   or  .

If  , then   is weakly decisive over  . If  , then   is weakly decisive over  . Now apply the field expansion lemma.

By Pareto, the entire set of voters is decisive. Thus by the group contraction lemma, there is a size-one decisive coalition—a dictator.

Proof by pivotal voter

 |
| --- |
| 

Proofs using the concept of the **pivotal voter** originated from Salvador Barberá in 1980.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-20">[19]</a></sup> The proof given here is a simplified version based on two proofs published in _[Economic Theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Theory_(journal) "Economic Theory (journal)")_.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-21">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-22">[21]</a></sup>

We will prove that any social choice system respecting unrestricted domain, unanimity, and independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) is a dictatorship. The key idea is to identify a _pivotal voter_ whose ballot swings the societal outcome. We then prove that this voter is a partial dictator (in a specific technical sense, described below). Finally we conclude by showing that all of the partial dictators are the same person, hence this voter is a [dictator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-dictatorship "Non-dictatorship").

For simplicity we have presented all rankings as if there are no ties. A complete proof taking possible ties into account is not essentially different from the one given here, except that one ought to say "not above" instead of "below" or "not below" instead of "above" in some cases. Full details are given in the original articles.

### Part one: There is a "pivotal" voter for B over A [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Part one: There is a "pivotal" voter for B over A")

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Diagram_for_part_one_of_Arrow%27s_Impossibility_Theorem.svg)

Part one: Successively move **B** from the bottom to the top of voters' ballots. The voter whose change results in **B** being ranked over **A** is the _pivotal voter for_ **B** _over_ **A**.

Say there are three choices for society, call them **A**, **B**, and **C**. Suppose first that everyone prefers option **B** the least: everyone prefers **A** to **B**, and everyone prefers **C** to **B**. By unanimity, society must also prefer both **A** and **C** to **B**. Call this situation _profile 0_.

On the other hand, if everyone preferred **B** to everything else, then society would have to prefer **B** to everything else by unanimity. Now arrange all the voters in some arbitrary but fixed order, and for each _i_ let _profile i_ be the same as _profile 0_, but move **B** to the top of the ballots for voters 1 through _i_. So _profile 1_ has **B** at the top of the ballot for voter 1, but not for any of the others. _Profile 2_ has **B** at the top for voters 1 and 2, but no others, and so on.

Since **B** eventually moves to the top of the societal preference as the profile number increases, there must be some profile, number _k_, for which **B** _first_ moves _above_ **A** in the societal rank. We call the voter _k_ whose ballot change causes this to happen the _pivotal voter for **B** over **A**_. Note that the pivotal voter for **B** over **A** is not, [a priori](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_knowledge "A priori knowledge"), the same as the pivotal voter for **A** over **B**. In part three of the proof we will show that these do turn out to be the same.

Also note that by IIA the same argument applies if _profile 0_ is any profile in which **A** is ranked above **B** by every voter, and the pivotal voter for **B** over **A** will still be voter _k_. We will use this observation below.

### Part two: The pivotal voter for B over A is a dictator for B over C [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Part two: The pivotal voter for B over A is a dictator for B over C")

In this part of the argument we refer to voter _k_, the pivotal voter for **B** over **A**, as the _pivotal voter_ for simplicity. We will show that the pivotal voter dictates society's decision for **B** over **C**. That is, we show that no matter how the rest of society votes, if _pivotal voter_ ranks **B** over **C**, then that is the societal outcome. Note again that the dictator for **B** over **C** is not a priori the same as that for **C** over **B**. In part three of the proof we will see that these turn out to be the same too.

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Diagram_for_part_two_of_Arrow%27s_Impossibility_Theorem.svg)

Part two: Switching **A** and **B** on the ballot of voter _k_ causes the same switch to the societal outcome, by part one of the argument. Making any or all of the indicated switches to the other ballots has no effect on the outcome.

In the following, we call voters 1 through _k − 1_, _segment one_, and voters _k + 1_ through _N_, _segment two_. To begin, suppose that the ballots are as follows:

-   Every voter in segment one ranks **B** above **C** and **C** above **A**.
-   Pivotal voter ranks **A** above **B** and **B** above **C**.
-   Every voter in segment two ranks **A** above **B** and **B** above **C**.

Then by the argument in part one (and the last observation in that part), the societal outcome must rank **A** above **B**. This is because, except for a repositioning of **C**, this profile is the same as _profile k − 1_ from part one. Furthermore, by unanimity the societal outcome must rank **B** above **C**. Therefore, we know the outcome in this case completely.

Now suppose that pivotal voter moves **B** above **A**, but keeps **C** in the same position and imagine that any number (even all!) of the other voters change their ballots to move **B** below **C**, without changing the position of **A**. Then aside from a repositioning of **C** this is the same as _profile k_ from part one and hence the societal outcome ranks **B** above **A**. Furthermore, by IIA the societal outcome must rank **A** above **C**, as in the previous case. In particular, the societal outcome ranks **B** above **C**, even though Pivotal Voter may have been the _only_ voter to rank **B** above **C**. [By](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_paradox "Condorcet paradox") IIA, this conclusion holds independently of how **A** is positioned on the ballots, so pivotal voter is a dictator for **B** over **C**.

### Part three: There exists a dictator [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Part three: There exists a dictator")

Part three: Since voter _k_ is the dictator for **B** over **C**, the pivotal voter for **B** over **C** must appear among the first _k_ voters. That is, _outside_ of segment two. Likewise, the pivotal voter for **C** over **B** must appear among voters _k_ through _N_. That is, outside of Segment One.

In this part of the argument we refer back to the original ordering of voters, and compare the positions of the different pivotal voters (identified by applying parts one and two to the other pairs of candidates). First, the pivotal voter for **B** over **C** must appear earlier (or at the same position) in the line than the dictator for **B** over **C**: As we consider the argument of part one applied to **B** and **C**, successively moving **B** to the top of voters' ballots, the pivot point where society ranks **B** above **C** must come at or before we reach the dictator for **B** over **C**. Likewise, reversing the roles of **B** and **C**, the pivotal voter for **C** over **B** must be at or later in line than the dictator for **B** over **C**. In short, if _k_<sub>X/Y</sub> denotes the position of the pivotal voter for **X** over **Y** (for any two candidates **X** and **Y**), then we have shown

_k_<sub>B/C</sub> ≤ k<sub>B/A</sub> ≤ _k_<sub>C/B</sub>.

Now repeating the entire argument above with **B** and **C** switched, we also have

_k_<sub>C/B</sub> ≤ _k_<sub>B/C</sub>.

Therefore, we have

_k_<sub>B/C</sub> = k<sub>B/A</sub> = _k_<sub>C/B</sub>

and the same argument for other pairs shows that all the pivotal voters (and hence all the dictators) occur at the same position in the list of voters. This voter is the dictator for the whole election.

## Interpretation and practical solutions [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Interpretation and practical solutions")

Arrow's theorem establishes that no ranked voting rule can _always_ satisfy independence of irrelevant alternatives, but it says nothing about the frequency of spoilers. This led Arrow to remark that "Most systems are not going to work badly all of the time. All I proved is that all can work badly at times."<sup id="cite_ref-ns122_3-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-ns122-3">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:02_4-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:02-4">[3]</a></sup>

Attempts at dealing with the effects of Arrow's theorem take one of two approaches: either accepting his rule and searching for the least spoiler-prone methods, or dropping his assumption of [ranked voting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting "Ranked voting") to focus on studying [rated voting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rated_voting "Rated voting") rules.

### Minimizing IIA failures: Majority-rule methods [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Minimizing IIA failures: Majority-rule methods")

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Italian_food_Condorcet_cycle.png)

An example of a Condorcet cycle, where some candidate _must_ be a spoiler

The first set of methods economists have studied are the [majority-rule methods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_methods "Condorcet methods"), which limit spoilers to rare situations where majority rule is self-contradictory, and uniquely minimize the possibility of a spoiler effect among rated methods.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_16-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:2-16">[15]</a></sup> Arrow's theorem was preceded by the [Marquis de Condorcet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_de_Condorcet "Marquis de Condorcet")'s discovery of [cyclic social preferences](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_paradox "Condorcet paradox"), cases where majority votes are logically inconsistent. Condorcet believed voting rules should satisfy his [majority rule principle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_winner_criterion "Condorcet winner criterion"), i.e. if most voters rank _Alice_ ahead of _Bob_, _Alice_ should defeat _Bob_ in the election.

Unfortunately, as Condorcet proved, this rule can be self-contradictory ([intransitive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intransitivity "Intransitivity")), because there can be a rock-paper-scissors cycle with three or more candidates defeating each other in a circle. Thus Condorcet proved a weaker form of Arrow's impossibility theorem long before Arrow himself, under the stronger assumption that a voting system in the two-candidate case will agree with a simple majority vote.

[Condorcet methods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method "Condorcet method") avoid the spoiler effect in non-cyclic elections, where candidates can be chosen by majority rule. Political scientists have found such cycles to be empirically rare, suggesting they are of limited practical concern. [Spatial voting models](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_model_of_voting "Spatial model of voting") also suggest such paradoxes are likely to be infrequent<sup id="cite_ref-:7_23-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:7-23">[22]</a></sup> or even non-existent.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_24-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:4-24">[23]</a></sup>

#### Left-right spectrum [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Left-right spectrum")

[Duncan Black](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Black "Duncan Black") showed his own remarkable result, the [median voter theorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_voter_theorem "Median voter theorem"). The theorem proves that if voters and candidates are arranged on a [left-right spectrum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum "Political spectrum"), Arrow's conditions are compatible, and all of them will be met by any rule satisfying [Condorcet's principle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_winner_criterion "Condorcet winner criterion").<sup id="cite_ref-:4_24-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:4-24">[23]</a></sup>

More formally, Black's theorem assumes preferences are _single-peaked_: a voter's happiness with a candidate goes up and then down as the candidate moves along some spectrum. For example, in a group of friends choosing a volume setting for music, each friend would likely have their own ideal volume; as volume gets progressively too loud or too quiet, they would be increasingly dissatisfied.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_24-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:4-24">[23]</a></sup>

If the domain is restricted to profiles where every individual has a single-peaked preference with respect to the linear ordering, then social preferences are acyclic. In this situation, Condorcet methods satisfy a wide variety of highly-desirable properties.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_24-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:4-24">[23]</a></sup>

Unfortunately, the rule does not generalize from the political spectrum to the political compass, a result called the [McKelvey-Schofield Chaos Theorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKelvey-Schofield_chaos_theorem "McKelvey-Schofield chaos theorem").<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-25">[24]</a></sup> However, a well-defined median and Condorcet winner do exist if the [distribution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution "Probability distribution") of voters on the ideological spectrum is [rotationally symmetric](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_symmetry "Rotational symmetry").<sup id="cite_ref-dotti_26-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-dotti-26">[25]</a></sup> In realistic cases, when voters' opinions follow a roughly-symmetric distribution such as a [normal distribution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution "Normal distribution") or can be accurately summarized in one or two dimensions, Condorcet cycles tend to be rare.<sup id="cite_ref-:7_23-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:7-23">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:0_27-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:0-27">[26]</a></sup>

#### Generalized stability theorems [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Generalized stability theorems")

Campbell and Kelly (2000) showed that Condorcet methods are the most spoiler-resistant class of ranked voting systems: whenever it is possible for some ranked voting system to avoid a spoiler effect, a Condorcet method will do so.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_16-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:2-16">[15]</a></sup> In other words, replacing a ranked-voting method with its Condorcet variant (i.e. elect a Condorcet winner if they exist, and otherwise run the method) will sometimes prevent a spoiler effect, but never cause a new one.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_16-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:2-16">[15]</a></sup>

In 1977, [Ehud Kalai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehud_Kalai "Ehud Kalai") and [Eitan Muller](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eitan_Muller "Eitan Muller") gave a full characterization of domain restrictions admitting a nondictatorial and rational social welfare function. These correspond to preferences for which there is a Condorcet winner.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-28">[27]</a></sup>

Holliday and Pacuit devise a voting system that provably minimizes the potential for spoiler effects, albeit at the cost of other criteria, and find that it is a Condorcet method, albeit at the cost of occasional [monotonicity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonicity_criterion "Monotonicity criterion") failures (at a much lower rate than seen in [instant-runoff voting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting "Instant-runoff voting")).<sup id="cite_ref-:0_27-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:0-27">[26]</a></sup>

### Eliminating IIA failures: Rated voting [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Eliminating IIA failures: Rated voting")

As shown above, the proof of Arrow's theorem relies crucially on the assumption of [ranked voting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting "Ranked voting"), and is not applicable to [rated voting systems](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_voting "Graded voting"). As a result, systems like [score voting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_voting "Score voting") and [graduated majority judgment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduated_majority_judgment "Graduated majority judgment") pass [independence of irrelevant alternatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_of_irrelevant_alternatives "Independence of irrelevant alternatives").<sup id="cite_ref-ns122_3-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-ns122-3">[2]</a></sup> These systems ask voters to rate candidates on a numerical scale (e.g. from 0–10), and then elect the candidate with the highest average (for score voting) or median ([graduated majority judgment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduated_majority_judgment "Graduated majority judgment")).<sup id="cite_ref-:4_24-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:4-24">[23]</a></sup>

While Arrow's theorem does not apply to graded systems, [Gibbard's theorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbard%27s_theorem "Gibbard's theorem") still does: no electoral system can be strategy-free,<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-29">[28]</a></sup> so the informal dictum that "no voting system is perfect" still has some mathematical basis.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-30">[29]</a></sup>

#### Meaningfulness of cardinal information [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Meaningfulness of cardinal information")

Arrow's framework assumed individual and social preferences are [orderings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_utility "Ordinal utility") or [rankings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting "Ranked voting"), i.e. statements about which outcomes are better or worse than others. Taking inspiration from the [strict behaviorism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism "Behaviorism") popular in psychology, some philosophers and economists rejected the idea of comparing internal human experiences of [well-being](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_utility "Cardinal utility").<sup id="cite_ref-:5_31-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:5-31">[30]</a></sup> Such philosophers claimed it was impossible to compare preferences of different people in situations where they disagree; [Sen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen "Amartya Sen") gives as an example that it is impossible to know whether the [Great Fire of Rome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Fire_of_Rome "Great Fire of Rome") was good or bad, because it allowed [Nero](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero "Nero") to build himself a new palace.<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-32">[31]</a></sup>

Arrow himself originally agreed with these positions and rejected [cardinal utility](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_utility "Cardinal utility"), leading him to focus his theorem on preference rankings.<sup id="cite_ref-:5_31-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:5-31">[30]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Arrow_19632_ChIII_33-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-Arrow_19632_ChIII-33">[32]</a></sup> However, he later reversed this opinion, admitting scoring methods can provide useful information that allows them to evade his theorem.<sup id="cite_ref-:02_4-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:02-4">[3]</a></sup> Similarly, [Amartya Sen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen "Amartya Sen") first claimed interpersonal comparability is necessary for IIA, but later argued it would only require "rather limited levels of partial comparability" to hold in practice.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-34">[33]</a></sup>

[Balinski](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Balinski "Michel Balinski") and [Laraki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rida_Laraki&action=edit&redlink=1 "Rida Laraki (page does not exist)") dispute the necessity of any genuinely [cardinal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_utility "Cardinal utility") information for [rated voting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rated_voting "Rated voting") methods to pass IIA. They argue the availability of a "common language" and the use of verbal grades are sufficient to ensure IIA, because they allow voters to give consistent responses to questions about candidate quality regardless of which candidates run.<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-35">[34]</a></sup>

[John Harsanyi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harsanyi "John Harsanyi") argued [his theorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harsanyi%27s_utilitarian_theorem&action=edit&redlink=1 "Harsanyi's utilitarian theorem (page does not exist)")<sup id="cite_ref-:6_36-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:6-36">[35]</a></sup> and other [utility representation theorems](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_representation_theorem "Utility representation theorem") like the [VNM theorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem "Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem"), which show that [rational behavior](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(philosophical_gambling_strategy) "Coherence (philosophical gambling strategy)") implies consistent [cardinal utilities](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_utility "Cardinal utility"). [Harsanyi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harsanyi "John Harsanyi")<sup id="cite_ref-:6_36-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:6-36">[35]</a></sup> and [Vickrey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Vickrey "William Vickrey")<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-37">[36]</a></sup> independently derived results showing such preferences could be rigorously defined using individual preferences over the [lottery of birth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lottery_of_birth "Lottery of birth").<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-38">[37]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-39">[38]</a></sup>

These results have led to the rise of [implicit utilitarian voting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_utilitarian_voting "Implicit utilitarian voting") approaches, which model ranked-choice procedures as approximations of the [utilitarian rule](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarian_rule "Utilitarian rule") (i.e. [score voting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_voting "Score voting")).<sup id="cite_ref-:12_40-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-:12-40">[39]</a></sup>

#### Nonstandard spoilers [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Nonstandard spoilers")

[Behavioral economists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics "Behavioral economics") have shown human behavior can violate IIA (e.g. with [decoy effects](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoy_effect "Decoy effect")),<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-41">[40]</a></sup> suggesting human behavior might cause IIA failures even if the voting method itself does not. However, such effects tend to be small.<sup id="cite_ref-HuberPayne2014_42-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-HuberPayne2014-42">[41]</a></sup>

[Strategic voting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_voting "Strategic voting") can also create pseudo-spoiler situations: if the winner with honest voting is A, but with strategy is B, then eliminating every candidate but A and B would change the strategic outcome from B to A since majority rule is strategy-proof.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

### Esoteric solutions [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Esoteric solutions")

In addition to the above practical resolutions, there exist unusual (less-than-practical) situations where Arrow's conditions can be satisfied.

#### Non-neutral voting rules [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Non-neutral voting rules")

When [equal treatment of candidates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrality_(social_choice) "Neutrality (social choice)") is not a necessity, Condorcet's majority-rule criterion can be modified to require a [supermajority](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority "Supermajority"). Such situations become more practical if there is a clear default (such as doing nothing, or allowing an [incumbent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent "Incumbent") to complete their term in a [recall election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_election "Recall election")). In this situation, setting a threshold that requires a   majority to select between 3 outcomes,   for 4, etc. does not cause paradoxes; this result is related to the [Nakamura number](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakamura_number "Nakamura number") of voting mechanisms.<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-43">[42]</a></sup>

In [spatial (n-dimensional ideology) models of voting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_model_of_voting "Spatial model of voting"), this can be relaxed to require only   (roughly 64%) of the vote to prevent cycles, so long as the distribution of voters is well-behaved ([quasiconcave](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasiconcave "Quasiconcave")).<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-44">[43]</a></sup>

#### Uncountable voter sets [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Uncountable voter sets")

[Fishburn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_C._Fishburn "Peter C. Fishburn") shows all of Arrow's conditions can be satisfied for [uncountable sets](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncountable_set "Uncountable set") of voters given the [axiom of choice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice "Axiom of choice");<sup id="cite_ref-Fishburn19702_45-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-Fishburn19702-45">[44]</a></sup> however, Kirman and Sondermann showed this requires disenfranchising [almost all](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely "Almost surely") members of a society (eligible voters form a set of [measure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics) "Measure (mathematics)") 0), leading them to refer to such societies as "invisible dictatorships".<sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-46">[45]</a></sup>

#### [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Fractional social choice")

[Maximal lotteries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_lotteries "Maximal lotteries") satisfy a probabilistic version of Arrow's criteria in [fractional social choice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_social_choice "Fractional social choice") models, where candidates can be elected by lottery or engage in power-sharing agreements (e.g. where each holds office for a specified period of time).<sup id="cite_ref-BrBr19a_47-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-BrBr19a-47">[46]</a></sup>

## Common misconceptions [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Common misconceptions")

Arrow's theorem does not deal with [strategic voting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_voting "Strategic voting"), which does not appear in his framework. The Arrovian framework of [social welfare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_welfare_function "Social welfare function") assumes all voter preferences are known and the only issue is in aggregating them.<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-48">[47]</a></sup>

Contrary to a [common misconception](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_misconception "Common misconception"), Arrow's theorem deals with the limited class of [ranked-choice voting systems](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting "Ranked voting"), rather than voting systems as a whole.<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-49">[48]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem#cite_note-50">[49]</a></sup>

In other words, you might do something like saying each voter does not just give a ranking. But says, this is good. And this is not good\[...\] So this gives more information than simply what I have asked for.

"This is a kind of stability property of Condorcet winners: you cannot dislodge a Condorcet winner _A_ by adding a new candidate _B_ to the election if A beats B in a head-to-head majority vote. For example, although the 2000 U.S. Presidential Election in Florida did not use ranked ballots, it is plausible (see Magee 2003) that Al Gore (A) would have won without Ralph Nader (B) in the election, and Gore would have beaten Nader head-to-head.

In the field of consumer's demand theory the ordinalist position turned out to create no problems; cardinal utility had no explanatory power above and beyond ordinal. Leibniz' Principle of the [identity of indiscernibles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles "Identity of indiscernibles") demanded then the excision of cardinal utility from our thought patterns."
