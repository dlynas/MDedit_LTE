## Policy areas\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Public_Knowledge&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Policy areas")\]

Public Knowledge focuses on many different issues within the space of technology and media, highlighting the intersection of copyright, telecommunications, and internet law. Its mission statement promises that the public interest group "promotes freedom of expression, an open internet, and access to affordable communications tools and creative works."<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Knowledge#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

The organization has worked in the courts and alongside Congress and government agencies like the Federal Communications Commission and the [Federal Trade Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission "Federal Trade Commission") to advocate for a more open and equitable internet experience. Public Knowledge is known for its nuanced thought analysis and policy proposals, such as its [Section 230](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230 "Section 230") principles to protect free expression online,<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch"><span title="The material near this tag may use weasel words or too-vague attribution. (March 2023)">according to whom?</span></a></i>]</sup> its proposal for a digital regulator, and its alternative frameworks for [algorithmic accountability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_accountability "Algorithmic accountability").

As of March 2023, the organization advocates for [net neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_law "Net neutrality law"), platform competition, consumer privacy, broadband accessibility and affordability, content moderation, a competitive media landscape, reforming copyright to benefit artists and creators, and reforming [spectrum management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_management "Spectrum management") to help consumers gain wireless access — without losing consumer protections along the way.

Public Knowledge has played a key role in securing broadband privacy rules, net neutrality rules, and expanding spectrum access for unlicensed use.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch"><span title="The material near this tag may use weasel words or too-vague attribution. (March 2023)">according to whom?</span></a></i>]</sup> It has also run successful campaigns for issues such as improving internet access in tribal communities and unlock of cell phones.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Public Knowledge has led coalitions for efforts such as including broadband funding in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.
