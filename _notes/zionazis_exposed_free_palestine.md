		Compare the amount of detailed facts in this video VERSUS the insulting simplicity and half-truths/blatant lies found in a PragerU video.

			Exactly! This is  how you know that shit on The Left is more trustworthy. Notice how Lefties dump citations all up inside their videos. Its almost inconvenient how much shit Lefties cite in their videos - like thwy sometimes extend their videos to talk abt each citation and why certain citations are important based on specific context  or leave long descriptions with all their citations . Or their papers  get extended by a good 3 or 4 pages just for citations alone.

	Only error here is that, *unfortunately* the Soviet Union was actually the first country to formally recognize the existence of an Israeli state, rare USSR and Stalin L there, just to clarify.

	Edit: Scratch that, Truman was first to recognize it via broadcast in May 14th, 1948, but the Soviets were first to formally recognize it in the UN on May 17th, minor correction but an important one.

		Ya. Had to keep on pausing. And I usually underestimate just how disgusting colonialists are and each pause of the video proved me right....

	I thought Herzl was an atheist? Or am I mistaken?

		Religion is nearly useless when you talk of those who see themselves as 'ethnic descendants' of a 'Hebrew empire' that didnt exist in the way they think it did.
