Fallows' 1977 [White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House "White House") staff photo

Fallows was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Jean (née Mackenzie) and James Albert Fallows, a physician.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Fallows#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> He was raised in [Redlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlands,_California "Redlands, California"), [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California "California"), and graduated from [Redlands High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlands_High_School "Redlands High School").<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Fallows#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> He studied American history and literature at [Harvard College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College "Harvard College"), where he was the editor of the daily newspaper, _[The Harvard Crimson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Harvard_Crimson "The Harvard Crimson")_. From 1970 to 1972, Fallows studied economics at [The Queen's College, Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen%27s_College,_Oxford "The Queen's College, Oxford"), as a [Rhodes scholar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes_scholar "Rhodes scholar"). He subsequently worked as an editor and writer for _[The Washington Monthly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Monthly "The Washington Monthly")_ and _[Texas Monthly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Monthly "Texas Monthly")_ magazines.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Fallows#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

For the first two years of the [Carter administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Jimmy_Carter "Presidency of Jimmy Carter") he was Carter's chief speechwriter. At age 27, he became the youngest person in history to hold that position. From 1979 through 1996, he was the Washington Editor for _The Atlantic Monthly_ (now _[The Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic "The Atlantic")_). For two years of that time he was based in Texas, and for four years in Asia. He wrote for the magazine about immigration, defense policy, politics, economics, computer technology, and other subjects. He has been a finalist for the [National Magazine Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Magazine_Awards "National Magazine Awards") five times and won in 2003, for "The Fifty-First State?" (_The Atlantic_, November 2002), which was published six months before the invasion of Iraq and laid out the difficulties of occupying the country. He won the National Book Award for _National Defense_<sup id="cite_ref-nba1983_5-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Fallows#cite_note-nba1983-5">[5]</a></sup> and won a NY Emmy in 2010 for his role as host of a documentary series, _Doing Business in China_.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Fallows#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

Fallows's most influential articles have concerned military policy and military procurement, the college admissions process, technology, China and Japan, and the [American war in Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq "2003 invasion of Iraq"). Early in his career, he wrote an article called "What Did You Do in the Class War, Daddy?" (_Washington Monthly_, October 1975). It described the "draft physical" day at the [Boston Navy Yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Navy_Yard "Boston Navy Yard") in 1970, in which Fallows and his Harvard and [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT "MIT") classmates overwhelmingly produced reasons for medical exemptions, while the white working-class men of [Chelsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea,_Massachusetts "Chelsea, Massachusetts"), [Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts "Massachusetts") were approved for service. He argued that the class bias of the [Vietnam draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_evasion#Vietnam_War "Draft evasion"), which made it easy for him and for others from influential and affluent families to [avoid service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_evasion "Draft evasion"), prolonged the war and that this was a truth many [opponents of the war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_the_U.S._involvement_in_the_Vietnam_War "Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War") found convenient to overlook.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Fallows#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

In the 1980s and 1990s Fallows was a frequent contributor of commentaries to [National Public Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Public_Radio "National Public Radio")'s _[Morning Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Edition "Morning Edition"),_ and since 2009 he has been the regular news analyst for NPR's _[Weekend All Things Considered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekend_All_Things_Considered "Weekend All Things Considered")_. From 1996 to 1998, he was the editor of _US News & World Report_. He was the founding chairman of the [New America Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_America_Foundation "New America Foundation"), a nonprofit group based in [Washington D.C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_D.C. "Washington D.C."). During the 2000–2001 academic year, Fallows taught at the graduate school of journalism at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley "University of California, Berkeley"), and in 2010 he was the Vare Writer in Residence at the [University of Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago "University of Chicago"). Starting in the 2010 academic year, he is a visiting Professor in U.S. Media at the [United States Studies Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Studies_Centre "United States Studies Centre") at the [University of Sydney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sydney "University of Sydney").<sup id="cite_ref-Steketee_6-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Fallows#cite_note-Steketee-6">[6]</a></sup>

Fallows has had a long interest in technology, both writing about and helping to develop it. He's taken a special interest in [personal information management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_information_management "Personal information management") software, going back to [Lotus Agenda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Agenda "Lotus Agenda") which he glowingly reviewed for _The Atlantic_ in 1992 ("Of all the computer programs I have tried, Agenda is far and away the most interesting, and is one of the two or three most valuable").<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Fallows#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> During the [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") wars of the early and mid-nineties, Fallows used and wrote about [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM "IBM")'s [Operating System/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_System/2 "Operating System/2") (OS/2) and its battles with [MS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows "Windows"), often frequenting the Canopus forum and online community on [CompuServe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompuServe "CompuServe"). In 1999, he spent six months at [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") designing software for writers. More recently, he has written about the design of the [Open Source Applications Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Applications_Foundation "Open Source Applications Foundation")'s information manager, code-named [Chandler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_(PIM) "Chandler (PIM)"). He was the on-stage host for the [IDG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Data_Group "International Data Group") Corporation's "Agenda" conference (no relation to Agenda software) in the early years of the 2000s (decade) and of [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Google")'s "Zeitgeist" conference starting in 2005. He has written regular technology columns for _The New York Times_ and _The Atlantic_.

In September 2021, Fallows launched a [Substack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack "Substack") site called _Breaking the News_, whose title was based on his 1996 book of the same name.

## Genetic ancestry\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Fallows&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Genetic ancestry")\]

In 2012, Fallows gained notice for the results of the testing of his genetic makeup. In addition to the fact that the lineage shown on the mitochondrial DNA of his mother's side did not resemble any other samples found in a large-scale study, it was shown that Fallows had an abnormally high percentage of [Neanderthal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal "Neanderthal") ancestry, at 5% of his genes being of Neanderthal origin. This drew attention from numerous scientists.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Fallows#cite_note-25">[24]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Fallows#cite_note-26">[25]</a></sup>
