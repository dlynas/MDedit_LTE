## a ðŸ§µ on what capitalism is (and isn't) ðŸ”¥

Welcome to our lil meme page â€“ thanks for visiting! This page is run mostly by me, Robbie. But did you know we do more than share memes? We're also a podcast ðŸ˜Ž Check out our audio documentaries (deep dives into topics like police abolition, worker cooperatives, Indigenous resistance movements, UBI, and much more) as well as our In Conversation series (with folks like Richard Wolff, Sarah Jaffe, Rupa Marya, Matt Christman, Jason Hickel, Nikki Franco, Johann Hari, Kate Raworth, Jessica Gordon-Nembhard, Alex Press, Cory Doctorow, and many more) 
ðŸŽ§ â€”> upstreampodcast.org (or wherever you listen to podcasts!)

Upstream is a labor of love â€“ we couldnâ€™t keep this project going without donations from our listeners and fans. Chip in at upstreampodcast.org/support
