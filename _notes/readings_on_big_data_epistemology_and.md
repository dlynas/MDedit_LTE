## Readings on Big Data, Epistemology and Neoliberalism?

> Hi,

> I‚Äôm interested in finding texts which explore the ways datafication affects knowledge-production and whether this could be considered under a neoliberal paradigm, i.e, quantification as a means to commodify everything it touches. I‚Äòve read some Wendy Brows, and some works in datafication studies, but haven‚Äôt found many which specifically consider how such knowledge-production might be ideological.

	Directly related to continental philosophy and critical theory, you might be interested in Bernard Stiegler, Yuk Hui, or Philip Agre. The first two are explicitly philosophers who deal with the technology in our present time. Agre is a fascinating computer scientist who wrote a medium length essay entitled Surveillance and Capture, a Foucault inspired piece that applies expert knowledge of the technology field to philosophy. I can't recommend that piece enough. 

	You might also be interested in Mark Hansen. I haven't read any of his books, but The Operational Present of Sensibility is an interesting essay from what I remember. Sort of process philosophy/phenomenology.

	Luciano Floridi is explicitly an analytic philosopher, but his work in the philosophy data really can't be ignored. He gets invites to major events in machine learning for a reason and his book The 4th Revolution is so short and accessible that there's no good reason not to engage with it.

		Second Bernard Stiegler -he's great.
		
		This isn't exactly what you're asking for /[u/cnfusedstudent](https://www.reddit.com/user/cnfusedstudent), but it's tangentially related.

	> By now, the fact that social networks create ‚Äúecho chambers‚Äù has become a truism. As we know from Greek mythology, Echo, the loquacious mountain nymph, was condemned to repeating phrases‚Äîas a punishment for helping Zeus hide his many affairs from Hera. Rejected by Narcissus, she wasted away until nothing but an echo remained. Narcissus in turn‚Äîas punishment for his many cruel rejections‚Äîfell in love with his own image and then killed himself, a victim of unrequited love. Hence, one may conclude, the inability to respond to others makes reciprocal exchange impossible and isolates the individual. In a narcissistic culture of self-affirmation, fostered by algorithmic personalization, communality‚Äîif not democracy‚Äîallegedly has been destroyed. But this analogy misses a deeper implication of the socio-technical transformation. Concealed behind the ‚Äúecho chambers‚Äù and ‚Äúfilter bubbles‚Äù of social media is an incredibly reductive identity politics, which posits class, race, and gender as ‚Äúimmutable‚Äù categories. Hence, at a time in which Western democracies have become ‚Äúpostracial‚Äù and vocal conservative and liberal-progressive critics within the humanities have declared studies of race/class/gender/sexuality pass√©, identity has returned with a vengeance‚Äîthat is, if it ever really left.

	> To understand the kinds of identity politics enabled by network technologies, this book examines a fundamental axiom of computational cultures: pattern discrimination. While the word discrimination originates from the Latin verb _discriminare_, where it simply means ‚Äúto separate, to distinguish, or to make a distinction,‚Äù it was in the late nineteenth century that it became overtly political. In parallel to the development of racist ideology, discrimination since then has referred to a prejudicial treatment of individuals based on a social category (e.g., race, gender, sexuality, age, class). However, in different terminologies the original meaning of the term has been preserved. This is why in computer science ‚Äúpattern discrimination‚Äù is still used as a technical term to describe the imposition of identity on input data, in order to filter (i.e., to discriminate) information from it. But far from being a neutral process, the delineation and application of patterns is in itself a highly political issue, even if hidden behind a technical terminology. The point of this book is to trace and uncover the implicit ties between the ideological and technical uses of discrimination, as we can experience it in algorithmically enhanced systems of pattern recognition.

	Moten and Harney's work on the Undercommons: Fugitive Planning and Black Studies explore what they call Logisticality, which sounds relevant to your search. Erin Manning does interesting work extending that idea in For a Pragmatics of the Useless, describing this fixation with archivable data as an epistemic blinder to exclude neurodiverse forms of knowledge production.

	Some solid suggestions so far, also check out Couldry and Mejias's The Costs of Connection, and then a reading group archive that often treats the issue you're describing
