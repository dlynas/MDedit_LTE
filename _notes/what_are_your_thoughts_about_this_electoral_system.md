## What are your thoughts about this electoral system?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/EndFPTP/comments/19abcdz/what_are_your_thoughts_about_this_electoral_system/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EndFPTP/comments/19abcdz/what_are_your_thoughts_about_this_electoral_system/)

> There would be multi-member regions & they would each have multiple single-member districts (with the range in seats in a region possibly going from 3 districts to 15 districts in each region), candidates each run in their own single-member district & voters put an X beside the candidate running in their single-member district (like under FPTP), then each party‚Äôs candidates in the multi-member region are all then ranked from the highest % of the vote to the lowest one and each district is allocated based on the seat order determined by the Sainte-Lagu√´ method. When one of the region‚Äô districts is awarded to a candidate, all the other candidate who ran in that single-member districts are automatically eliminated. In the end, each single-member district in the multi-member region will have their own representative.

	I tried to model something pretty similar one time. The problem is that once you start awarding single member districts to the non-plurality winner:

	* If you're willing to use 2nd place candidates as the new SMD 'winner', it's really not very proportional or significantly different from existing FPTP. You're still rewarding geographical concentration a lot

	* If you're willing to go past 2nd place to 3rd/4th/5th place etc. winners, you start electing SMD 'winners' who got like 7% of the vote or something. It could technically work, but I doubt voters would like it very much

	Edit to include: Here's another way to think about it. Parties tend to have regional strongholds. Like when I modeled this, I saw that the CDU is very strong in specific regions of Germany. So your 'regions' would, under FPTP, probably have a CDU winner in every SMD. You'd have to be reaching pretty far down into the 2nd-5th place candidates to find a proportional 'winner', this is why I wrote my 2nd bullet point

	Sounds fine to me

	Basic flaw. Districts are represented, not people. The result is intrinsically defective. Roberts Rules of Order would never allow vote elimination. All ballots count, and an absolute majority of non-blank ballots must support a winner or the election must be repeated. No candidate eliminations.

	Sounds very similar to Slovenia's system, except that all the other candidates from a district are eliminated when that district's seat is filled so you can't get the situation where some districts have no representatives whereas others have multiple.

	It sounds alright as a compromise between local representation and proportionality go. I would, however, point out that three seats is too small to ensure proportionality, most academic works I've encountered seem to put the minimum district magnitude at 5 or 6 to ensure a strong degree of proportionality. Obviously, the extent to which this is an issue depends on how important proportionality is to you and what the median district magnitude is.

	Whilst it beats Slovenia's system in the sense that all districts get equal representation, the flipside is that this system would almost definitely produce 'wrong winners' at the district level. Is the principle of each district having its own representative really worth preserving even if it means potentially a significant majority of a district's voters will be 'represented' by someone they didn't vote for? I would argue probably not in most cases. You're better off just having multi-member constituencies with representatives from a range of parties so that a majority of voters will always have representatives that they feel match their views. However, I suppose you could argue that in this system voters in a district where a losing candidate is the representative could still feel represented by representatives from other districts in their region.

	My instinct is that if this system is proposed for an electorate used to FPTP, it would fail because the electorate will not be able to comfortably square the idea of having a losing candidate 'win' in their district with their understanding of representative democracy and fairness. I think this can be seen in cases such as Wales' use of MMP/AMS where dual candidacies (candidates standing both in constituencies and on regional top-up lists) were previously banned as an 'abuse' of the system because it let candidates rejected by voters into the legislature.

	If the outgoing electoral system doesn't use single-member districts then perhaps the electorate will accept it because they have fewer preconceptions about how single-member districts 'should' work.

	The Austrian system works similar while using several levels.

	I think this was proposed in Canada as LocalPR

		It‚Äôs different than Local PR since it doesn‚Äôt use the Single Transferable Vote to elect the Reps &amp; voters don‚Äôt have a list of all candidates to choose from (unlike under Local PR, where all the region‚Äôs candidates are listed on a single ballot), and voters can ONLY vote for candidates within their single-member riding

			The ranking wasn't really an inherent part of the system. Just meant to appeal to Liberals (it was a response to a Liberal MPs demands for a system that met what he thought were mutually exclusive).
			
			If you can only vote for MPs in your own riding every candidate from the top 2 parties will run as an independent then to evade the proportionality requirements.

	That looks a lot like Germany‚Äôs Federal MMP system which seems to be pretty good, this one might produce slightly less proportional outcomes but also less overhang seats.

	* üü® **[CoolFun11](https://www.reddit.com/user/CoolFun11) (OP)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1 _(2024-01-19 09:22:39)_

		I can see the similarities with Germany‚Äôs federal MMP system, but it‚Äôs still different than Germany‚Äôs federal MMP system since no candidate is actually elected under FPTP (unlike under MMP). Under this system, a candidate can win a seat even though they would have arrived second had their single-member riding‚Äôs election been under FPTP.

			Germany's system has been recently reformed so that now sometimes second-placed candidates can be the district winner. They got rid of the variable size of the parliament, so now it is fixed size. For each region (Bundesland), if a party wins (for example) 10 seats via FPTP districts, but only deserves 7 seats based on the party vote, then only the 7 out of the 10 with the highest vote share in their district get selected.

	|Fewer Letters|More Letters|

	|-------|---------|---|

	|FPTP|First Past the Post, a form of plurality voting|

	|MMP|Mixed Member Proportional|

	|PR]|Proportional Representation|

	This is almost identical to a method known as [Fair Majority Voting](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27642416). The paper does not use Sainte-Lague, but instead uses a slightly more sophisticated mathematical technique known as [biproportional apportionment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biproportional_apportionment) which considers not just the raw votes of candidates within a party, but also their vote relative to the other candidates in the district (though you can still use SL to determine how many seats each party gets). It works by boosting the votes for candidates in parties that won fewer seats then they should have proportionality until they have won enough seats. This is justified as a gerrymandering correction factor. The method can also be extended so there are multiple winners in each district.

	As other comments suggest, the result is that the person with the most votes in each district may not win. The paper suggests having thresholds in each district so that a candidate with 5% of the vote cannot win regardless of how much their vote is boosted.
