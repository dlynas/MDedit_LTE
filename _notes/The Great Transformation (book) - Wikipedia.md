_**The Great Transformation**_ is a book by [Karl Polanyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Polanyi "Karl Polanyi"), a Hungarian [political economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_Economy "Political Economy"). First published in 1944 by [Farrar & Rinehart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farrar_%26_Rinehart "Farrar & Rinehart"), it deals with the social and political upheavals that took place in [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England "England") during the rise of the market economy. Polanyi contends that the modern [market economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy "Market economy") and the modern [nation-state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation-state "Nation-state") should be understood not as discrete elements but as a single human invention, which he calls the "Market Society".

A distinguishing characteristic of the "Market Society" is that humanity's economic mentalities have been changed. Prior to this, people based their economies on reciprocity and redistribution across personal and communal relationships.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-ReferenceA-1">[1]</a></sup> As a consequence of industrialization and increasing state influence, competitive markets were created that undermined these previous social tendencies, replacing them with formal institutions that aimed to promote a self-regulating market economy.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_1-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-ReferenceA-1">[1]</a></sup> The expansion of capitalist institutions with an [economically liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_liberalism "Economic liberalism") mindset not only changed laws but also fundamentally altered humankind's economic relations; prior to this, markets played a very minor role in human affairs and were not even capable of setting prices because of their diminutive size.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> It was only after industrialization and the onset of greater state control over newly created market institutions that the myth of human nature's propensity toward rational free trade became widespread.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> However, Polanyi asserts instead that "man's economy, as a rule, is submerged in his social relationships," <sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> and he therefore proposes an alternative [ethnographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnographic "Ethnographic") economic approach called "[substantivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantivism "Substantivism")", in opposition to "formalism", both terms coined by Polanyi in future work.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

On a broader theoretical level, _The Great Transformation_ argues that markets cannot solely be understood through economic theory. Rather, markets are embedded in social and political logics, which makes it necessary for economic analysts to take into account politics when trying to understand the economy.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> For this reason, _The Great Transformation_ is a key work in the fields of political economy and [international political economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_political_economy "International political economy").

## History\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Great_Transformation_(book)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")\]

Polanyi began writing _The Great Transformation_ in England in the late 1930s. He completed the book in the United States during World War II. He set out to explain the economic and social collapse of the 19th century, as well as the transformations that Polanyi had witnessed during the 20th century.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

## General argument\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Great_Transformation_(book)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: General argument")\]

Polanyi argued that the development of the modern state went hand in hand with the development of modern market economies and that these two changes were inextricably linked in history. Essential to the change from a premodern economy to a market economy was the altering of human economic mentalities away from their grounding in local social relationships and institutions, and into transactions idealized as "rational" and set apart from their previous social context.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_1-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-ReferenceA-1">[1]</a></sup> Prior to the Market Society, markets had a very limited role in society and were confined almost entirely to long-distance trade.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> As Polanyi wrote, "the same bias which made [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith "Adam Smith")'s generation view primeval man as bent on barter and truck induced their successors to disavow all interest in early man, as he was now known not to have indulged in those laudable passions."<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

The modern market economy was forced by the powerful modern state, which was needed to push changes in social structure, and in what aspects of human nature were amplified and encouraged, which allowed for a competitive capitalist economy to emerge. For Polanyi, these changes implied the destruction of the basic social order that had reigned throughout pre-modern history. Central to the change was that factors of production, such as land and labor, would now be sold on the market at market-determined prices instead of allocated according to tradition, redistribution, or reciprocity.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> This was both a change of human institutions and human nature.

His empirical case in large part relied upon analysis of the [Speenhamland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speenhamland "Speenhamland") laws, which he saw not only as the last attempt of the [squirearchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirearchy "Squirearchy") to preserve the traditional system of production and social order but also a self-defensive measure on the part of society that mitigated the disruption of the most violent period of economic change. Polanyi also remarks that the pre-modern economies of China, the Incan Empire, the Indian Empires, Babylon, Greece, and the various kingdoms of Africa operated on principles of reciprocity and redistribution with a very limited role for markets, especially in settling prices or allocating the factors of production.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> The book also presented his belief that market society is unsustainable because it is fatally destructive to human nature and the natural contexts it inhabits.

Polanyi attempted to turn the tables on the orthodox liberal account of the rise of capitalism by arguing that “laissez-faire was planned”, whereas social protectionism was a spontaneous reaction to the social dislocation imposed by an unrestrained [free market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market "Free market"). He argues that the construction of a "self-regulating" market necessitates the separation of society into economic and political realms. Polanyi does not deny that the self-regulating market has brought "unheard of material wealth", but he suggests that this is too narrow a focus. The market, once it considers land, labor and money as [fictitious commodities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_commodities "Fictitious commodities"), and including them "means to subordinate the substance of society itself to the laws of the market."<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

This, he argues, results in massive social dislocation, and spontaneous moves by society to protect itself. In effect, Polanyi argues that once the free market attempts to separate itself from the fabric of society, social protectionism is society's natural response, which he calls the "[double movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Movement "Double Movement")." Polanyi did not see economics as a subject closed off from other fields of enquiry, indeed he saw economic and social problems as inherently linked. He ended his work with a prediction of a [socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_socialism "Democratic socialism") society, noting, "after a century of blind 'improvement', man is restoring his 'habitation.'"<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

### Gold standard\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Great_Transformation_(book)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Gold standard")\]

Polanyi offers a prominent argument in the field of political economy for Britain's decision to depart from the gold standard.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_15-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-:1-15">[15]</a></sup> He argues that Britain went off the gold standard due to both deteriorating international economic conditions and pressures from labor, which had grown stronger over time. Labor opposed the gold standard because maintaining it meant that the British government had to implement austerity.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_15-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-:1-15">[15]</a></sup> James Ashley Morrison found many later explanations for the collapse of the gold standard very much resemble the Polanyian argument, which he summarized as follows:

> Developments in the global economy, particularly after World War I, made maintaining the gold standard increasingly painful. Diminished international cooperation combined with Britain’s relative economic decline to exacerbate its difficulties. At the same time, a newly empowered working class harnessed evolving “social purpose” to resist the austerity necessary to defend gold

## Before the market society\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Great_Transformation_(book)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Before the market society")\]

Based on [Bronislaw Malinowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronislaw_Malinowski "Bronislaw Malinowski")'s ethnological work on the [Kula ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kula_ring "Kula ring") exchange in the [Trobriand Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trobriand_Islands "Trobriand Islands"), Polanyi makes the distinction between markets as an auxiliary tool for ease of exchange of goods and market societies. Market societies are those where markets are the paramount institution for the exchange of goods through price mechanisms. Polanyi argues that there are three general types of economic systems that existed before the rise of a market society: reciprocity, redistribution, and householding.

1.  [Reciprocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(cultural_anthropology) "Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)"): exchange of goods is based on reciprocal exchanges between social entities. On a macro level, this would include the production of goods to gift to other groups.
2.  [Redistribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redistribution_(cultural_anthropology) "Redistribution (cultural anthropology)"): trade and production is focused to a central entity such as a tribal leader or feudal lord and then redistributed to members of their society.
3.  [Householding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household "Household"): economies where production is centered on individual households. Family units produce food, textile goods, and tools for their own use and consumption.

These three forms were not mutually exclusive, nor were they mutually exclusive of markets for the exchange of goods. The main distinction is that these three forms of economic organization were based around the social aspects of the society they operated in and were explicitly tied to those social relationships. Polanyi argued that these economic forms depended on the social principles of symmetry, centricity, and [autarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autarky "Autarky") (self-sufficiency). Markets existed as an auxiliary avenue for the exchange of goods that were otherwise not obtainable.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This citation requires a reference to the specific page or range of pages in which the material appears.

## Reception\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Great_Transformation_(book)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Reception")\]

The book has influenced scholars such as [Marshall Sahlins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Sahlins "Marshall Sahlins"), [Immanuel Wallerstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Wallerstein "Immanuel Wallerstein"), [James C. Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_C._Scott "James C. Scott"), [E.P. Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.P._Thompson "E.P. Thompson"), and [Douglass North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglass_North "Douglass North").<sup id="cite_ref-:0_16-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-:0-16">[16]</a></sup> [John Ruggie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ruggie "John Ruggie"), who called the _Great Transformation_ a "magisterial work", was influenced by the work in coining the term Embedded liberalism for the Bretton Woods system of the post-World War II period.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

The sociologists [Fred L. Block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_L._Block "Fred L. Block") and [Margaret Somers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Somers "Margaret Somers") argue that Polanyi's analysis could help explain why the resurgence of free market ideas has resulted in "such manifest failures as persistent unemployment, widening inequality, and the severe financial crises that have stressed Western economies over the past forty years." They suggest that "the ideology that free markets can replace government is just as utopian and dangerous" as the idea that Communism will result in the withering away of the state.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>

In _[Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toward_an_Anthropological_Theory_of_Value "Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value"): The False Coin of Our Own Dreams_, anthropologist [David Graeber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Graeber "David Graeber") offers compliments to Polanyi's text and theories. Graeber attacks formalists and substantivists alike: "those who start by looking at society as a whole are left, like the Substantivists, trying to explain how people are motivated to reproduce society; those who start by looking at individual desires, like the formalists, unable to explain why people chose to maximize some things and not others (or otherwise to account for questions of meaning)."<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> While appreciative of Polanyi's attack on [formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_anthropology "Economic anthropology"), Graeber attempts to move beyond ethnography and towards understanding how individuals find meaning in their actions, synthesizing insights of [Marcel Mauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Mauss "Marcel Mauss"), [Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx "Karl Marx"), and others.

In parallel with Polanyi's account of markets being made internal to society as a result of state intervention, Graeber argues the transition to credit-based markets from societies with separated "[spheres of exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheres_of_exchange "Spheres of exchange")" in gift giving was likely the accidental byproduct of state or temple bureaucracy (temple in the case of Sumer).<sup id="cite_ref-Debt_20-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-Debt-20">[20]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 39–40">: 39–40 </span></sup>  Graeber also notes that the criminalization of debt supplemented the enclosure movements in the destruction of English communities, since credit between community members had originally reinforced communal ties prior to state intervention:

> The criminalization of debt, then, was the criminalization of the very basis of human society. It cannot be overemphasized that in a small community, everyone normally was both lender and borrower. One can only imagine the tensions and temptations that must have existed in a community—and communities, much though they are based on love, in fact, because they are based on love, will always also be full of hatred, rivalry and passion—when it became clear that with sufficiently clever scheming, manipulation, and perhaps a bit of strategic bribery, they could arrange to have almost anyone they hated imprisoned or even hanged.

Economist [Joseph Stiglitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz "Joseph Stiglitz") favors Polanyi's account of market liberalization, arguing that the failures of "Shock Therapy" in Russia and the failures of IMF reform packages echo Polanyi's arguments. Stiglitz also summarizes the difficulties of "market liberalization" in that it requires unrealistic "flexibility" amongst the poor.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>

[Charles Kindleberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_P._Kindleberger "Charles P. Kindleberger") praised the book, saying it "is a useful corrective to the economic interpretation of the world, and should be read more and more by economists, particularly those of the Chicago school." He did however argue that everything in the book should not be taken as accurate.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

Polanyi's argument is often cited as the "Polanyian moment", "Polanyi Moment" or "Polanyi's moment", which indicates the time when [social protectionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_protection "Social protection") starts to surpass marketization and thus reversing the direction of the [double movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_movement "Double movement"). This term has been used to describe the situation after the [Great Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession "Great Recession") in 2008<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic "COVID-19 pandemic").<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> Gemici compared the Polanyi Moment to the [Minsky moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsky_moment "Minsky moment"), the moment of a sudden collapse in the market.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup>

### Criticism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Great_Transformation_(book)&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Criticism")\]

[Rutger Bregman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutger_Bregman "Rutger Bregman"), writing for _[Jacobin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobin_(magazine) "Jacobin (magazine)")_, criticized Polanyi's account of the [Speenhamland system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speenhamland_system "Speenhamland system") as reliant on several myths (increased poverty, increased population growth and increased unrest, as well as "'the pauperization of the masses,' who 'almost lost their human shape';" "basic income did not introduce a floor, he contended, but a ceiling") and the flawed [Royal Commission into the Operation of the Poor Laws 1832](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission_into_the_Operation_of_the_Poor_Laws_1832 "Royal Commission into the Operation of the Poor Laws 1832").<sup id="cite_ref-jacobin_26-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-jacobin-26">[26]</a></sup>

Both Bregman and [Corey Robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Robin "Corey Robin") credited Polanyi's view with [Richard Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon "Richard Nixon") moving away from a proposed [basic income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income "Basic income") system because Polanyi was heavily quoted in a report by Nixon's aide, [Martin Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Anderson_(economist) "Martin Anderson (economist)"), then ultimately providing arguments for various reductions in the welfare state introduced by [Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan "Ronald Reagan"), [Bill Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton "Bill Clinton") and [George W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush "George W. Bush").<sup id="cite_ref-jacobin_26-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-jacobin-26">[26]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>

Economic historians (e.g. Douglass North) have criticized Polanyi's account of the origins of capitalism.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> Polanyi's account of reciprocity and redistributive systems is inherently changeless and thus cannot explain the emergence of the more specific form of modern capitalism in the 19th century.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>

[Deirdre McCloskey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deirdre_McCloskey "Deirdre McCloskey") has criticized several aspects of the _Great Transformation_. She notes that Polanyi's account of "pre-market" societies are inconsistent with anthropological evidence which suggests these societies were not as equitable, socially stable, and successful as Polanyi makes them appear to be. McCloskey notes that market-based societies are not a nascent invention, as Polanyi claims, but that they extend further back in time. She also criticizes Polanyi's conceptualization of self-regulating markets whereby any and all government intervention in the markets means the markets are no longer markets.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_16-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-:0-16">[16]</a></sup>

_The Great Transformation_ has been criticized for underplaying power and class relations in its analysis.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> Polanyi argued, "class interests offer only a limited explanation of long-run movements in society."<sup id="cite_ref-:2_32-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-:2-32">[32]</a></sup> He argued that while humans are "naturally conditioned by economic factors", human motives are only rarely determined by "material want-satisfaction"; rather, human motives were more social (e.g. desire for security and status) than material.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_32-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)#cite_note-:2-32">[32]</a></sup>
