	The Critical Theory of Jurgen Habermas by Thomas McCarthy is often obligatorily recommended, but this comes out a couple years before TCA. The Recent Work of Jurgen Habermas by Stephen White is a much quicker read and much more up to date with what Habermas is doing in the 80s. Raymond Guess, unfortunately, makes some quite elementary misreadings of Habermas's "ideal speech situation" (a term that Habermas has quite literally not used since 1972), so caution is advised. Reading earlier works of Habermas, like The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, might also be necessary to get a sense for his project.

	That being said, TCA is extremely hard to understand without proper context about the history of philosophy. Habermas presupposes his reader has familiarity with debates in more fields than I can count on my hands. In fact, almost every theoretical assertion he makes is done through rigorous textual engagement with other theoretical approaches. If you are not familiar with, at the very least, the Frankfurt School, speech act theory, Weber, and Marx (and that is just for the first volume), along with the contemporary philosophical climate (that is, why Habermas feels the need to rescue the project of modernity with a theory of "communicative" rationality), you will be in for a somewhat confusing read.

	I don't usually do this, but I would actually recommend you not read this book, based on your background. I'm somewhat shocked to hear your high school teacher recommended this (perhaps you have a philosophy-intensive education?) I have recently started teaching undergraduates, and I can confidently say that there is not a single student, no matter how brilliant, who I would recommend this text to. This is not necessarily because they lack the intelligence. There are just few people before the graduate level who have enough familiarity with the various debates Habermas is intervening in to have a productive 800+ page reading experience. Not to say you shouldn't give it a shot. But don't expect too much. After a couple years of reading philosophy you should be able to come back and have a much better reading experience.

		Thank you for your response! 
		
		In defense of my teacher, it was an off handed comment he made during class. I'm not sure he expected me to follow through :)
		
		I don't have a traditional philosophy background at all. I have only ever taken a single class, and I am graduating this spring. I've been reading independently for the last 2 years. I have read much of weber and marx however. I also own the Mccarthy book, so maybe I'll give that a shot. 
		
		I'm definitely in over my head here; reading your response has put the scope of the project in perspective for me. Nonetheless, I'm still pretty optimistic about it. Thanks again.

	[u/Expensive_Home7867](https://www.reddit.com/user/Expensive_Home7867) hit the nail on the head. Habermas is not a reader-friendly writer. You need to know where he's coming from. He assumes a lot from his reader. Most accessible is his first book on the public sphere, you should start there if you really need a taste of him now. Then spend a few years getting well-grounded in the German philosophical tradition starting with Kant and working your way through the 19th and 20th centuries up until you reach Habermas, making sure to develop solid familiarity with all the major figures along the way. This is more adviseable than jumping straight into Habermas, and will have a higher pay off in the long-run. His recent *Auch eine Geschichte der Philosophie* (2019) is just now being published in English in 3 volumes, of which Volume 1 has just appeared. I haven't read it yet, but, as it is a history of philosophy, it may be more accessible than his other theoretical works, while still giving insight into how he views his project.

		Some general side remarks defending Habermas way of writing texts:
		
		Why should Habermas be 'reader-friendly' though? He isn't writing for absolute beginners - his books are scientific research texts for academic experts and geuninely interested people. It's absolute okay to expect something from your readers then.
		
		I hate these new american reader-friendly books starting at zero and producing only surface knowledge and trivial insights, because within the boundaries of this approach going deeper would produce a book of several hundred to maybe thousand pages. This is bullshit.
		
		A book is expert literature or introductionary literature - it can't be both at the same time. There exists a mass of secondary introductionary literature to every topic imaginable - beginners should start there.

			>Some side remark: Why should Habermas be 'reader-friendly' though? He isn't writing for absolute beginners - his books are scientific research texts for academic experts and geuninely interested people. It's absolute okay to expect something from your readers then.
			
			Have you read *Knowledge and Human Interests* or his *On the Logic of the Social Sciences*? More importantly, are you familiar with the academic reception of those works? Just take a look at some scholarly book reviews. Those works are widely criticized for being impenetrable. Fortunately this aspect of Habermas's writing improves starting in the 1980s, but doesn't entirely disappear.

			>I hate these new american reader-friendly books starting at zero and producing only surface knowledge and trivial insights, because within the boundaries of this approach going deeper would produce a book of several hundred to maybe thousand pages. This is bullshit.
			
			It's not about starting from zero. You can have both ‚Äì¬†accessibility and scholarly rigor ‚Äì they're not mutually exclusive. What you're saying might be true for scholars working within **one** field ‚Äì but Habermas draws upon diverse traditions including sociology, psychology, German philosophy, philosophy of language, and American pragmatism. **The more interdisciplinary you become, the less you are permitted to assume from your reader, because you no longer have a single audience, you now have multiple audiences from all the respective fields which you're bringing together.** 
			
			If you've read Habermas you'll know that there are often significant digressive parts in his works (e.g. his entanglements in anthropological theories in Volume 1 of TCA), a digressiveness which he admits to in the preface, which don't actually serve his argument or theory. Such excurses can easily be excised and replaced with expository sections that coherently lay out what exactly he's taking away from a given field and how it builds into his own theory.
			
			There are rigorous texts that go deep which are also reader friendly ‚Äì¬†believe it or not, *Kant's Critique of Pure Reason* is one such text. Kant is actually a very clear writer and goes out of his way to explain things clearly and be understood. It doesn't mean he's "starting from zero" and assumes nothing from his reader.
			
			&amp;#x200B;
			
			>A book is expert literature or introductionary literature - it can't be both at the same time.
			
			Again, that's not what this is about. You seem to have in mind niche monographs and specialist articles in academic journals. These types of academic contributions are characteristic of scholars working within a given field, and are the types of works  people in academia are generally familiar with. 
			
			However, Habermas resists and even (in *Auch eine Geschichte der Philosphie*) has criticized the over-specialization of the academic disciplines. He's a system-builder, his work strives to be all-encompassing, holistic, embracing the full scope of the humanities and social sciences. But he has poorly calibrated the accessibility of his style to the assumptions that he can reasonably expect from his manifold audiences. Would laying the foundation of his works with fewer assumptions make for appreciably longer books? ‚Äì probably not, imo, as this would also entail excising a lot of irrelevancies. Not that he even has an issue with overly long works to begin with.

				Very good response! Made me actually think a bit.
				
				The funny thing is: I read Habermas in his original language (I'm german) and never had any problems following his arguments. I actually really like the structure of his writings, because everything is well-ordered and spelled out just enough. I like his composition. Yeah, he could explicicate some of his assumptions more, but that should be the task of a critical reader anyway.
				
				I don't see the problem with Habermas. Never saw it. It could be a language and a cultural issue; Americans had their problems with Adorno / Horkheimer and their style of writing, too - Adorno even said it in one of his texts.
				
				I prefer the writing style of Habermas much more than the style of today's anglo-american critical theory books. They read like some lazy and cheaply stitched together product just repeating things, which were said 20-40 years ago; hauntological fast food theorizing without much ambitions just producing surface insights / trivial knowledge. These books are wordy, but have no depth.

					>I prefer the writing style of Habermas much more than the style of today's anglo-american critical theory books.

					I actually agree 100% with your assessment here. Overall I'm a huge fan of Habermas's style and ambitions. You're right, a lot of Anglo-American work on critical theory seems expository and receptive, like you said "hauntological fast food theorizing without much ambitions" ‚Äì no one has ambitions to build comprehensive theories drawing upon various fields. This is a deficit and might also relate to the compartmentalization of disciplines in the Anglo-sphere. 
					
					For the record, Habermas is actually my hero and I aspire to pursue the style of philosophy he practices, the kind of normative philosophy that's still being done at Frankfurt.
					
					In fact, I'm studying German in the hopes of getting fluent enough to study philosophy in Germany. Maybe I could DM you to chat more about your experience and advice?

		Unfortunately, *Auch eine Geschichte der Philosophie* is just about as accessible as TCA, perhaps even a bit less. It is not merely an anodyne history of philosophy, but treats the history of Western philosophy (and humanity - Habermas also analyzes what Karl Jaspers once called the "axial worldviews") as a "learning process." He examines the extent to which the "cognitive potential" of modern worldviews have evolved over time in response to problems earlier worldviews could not adequately address. This text is going to assume you TCA, some of his texts commentaries on Western philosophy written after TCA (*The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity* and *Postmetaphysical Thinking*), along with his recent (by which I mean the last 25 years) more positive attitude toward religion (Habermas spends a lot of time on how Judaism represents an expansion of Western civilization's cognitive potential, insofar as it opened up the prospects for a "moralization of the sacred." But if you are familiar with Habermas, it a phenomenal read!

	You need a systematic and efficient approach: Read the scientific secondary literature first and then try to dive in into the primary texts.

	I would start with a handbook / companion by different authors.
