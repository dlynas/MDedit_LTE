_**The Pale King**_ is an [unfinished novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfinished_novel "Unfinished novel") by [David Foster Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace "David Foster Wallace"), published posthumously on April 15, 2011.<sup id="cite_ref-Itzkoff_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-Itzkoff-1">[1]</a></sup> It was planned as Wallace's third novel, and the first since _[Infinite Jest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Jest "Infinite Jest")_ in 1996, but it was not completed at the time of his death.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> Before his suicide in 2008, Wallace organized the manuscript and associated computer files in a place where they would be found by his widow, [Karen Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Green_(artist) "Karen Green (artist)"), and his agent, Bonnie Nadell. That material was compiled by his friend and editor Michael Pietsch into the form that was eventually published. Wallace had been working on the novel for over a decade. Even incomplete, _The Pale King_ is a long work, with 50 chapters of varying length totaling over 500 pages.

The novel was one of the three finalists for the 2012 [Pulitzer Prize for Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize_for_Fiction "Pulitzer Prize for Fiction"), but no award was given that year.

## Overview\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Pale_King&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Overview")\]

Like much of Wallace's work, the novel defies straightforward summary. Each chapter stands almost alone, with text ranging from straight dialogues between coworkers about civics or cartography to snippets of the 1985 Illinois tax code to poignant sensory or character sketches. Many of the chapters relate the experiences of a handful of employees of the [Internal Revenue Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service "Internal Revenue Service") in [Peoria, Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoria,_Illinois "Peoria, Illinois") in 1985. One of the characters, one of two who narrate their chapters, is named David Wallace, but he is a largely fictional counterpart of the author and not the focal point of the novel. Pietsch called the organization of the manuscript "a challenge like none I've ever encountered".<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

The fictional "Author's Foreword" is chapter 9 and is the place in the novel where Wallace's trademark footnotes run most rampant. In this chapter, he introduces the "irksome paradox" that the only bona fide fiction in the book is the copyright page's disclaimer that states "The characters and events in this book are fictitious," while at the same time acknowledging that this foreword itself is defined by that disclaimer as fictional. He further states, in the context of the same self-referential paradox, that "_The Pale King_ is a kind of vocational memoir" and that "the very last thing this book is is some kind of clever metafictional titty-pincher." Other primary characters include Lane Dean Jr., Claude [Sylvanshine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvanshine "Sylvanshine"), David Cusk, and Leonard Stecyk, men drawn for vastly different reasons to a career in the IRS.

## Writing, editing, and publication\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Pale_King&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Writing, editing, and publication")\]

Wallace began research for _The Pale King_ in 1997, after the publication of _[Infinite Jest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Jest "Infinite Jest")_. He started writing the book around 2000.<sup id="cite_ref-Max_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-Max-4">[4]</a></sup> The novel (or "long thing", Wallace's usual term for it) had numerous working titles throughout this period, including _Glitterer_, _SJF_ (_Sir John Feelgood_), _Net of Gems_,<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> and _What Is Peoria For?_

In 2007, Wallace estimated that the novel was about one-third finished.<sup id="cite_ref-Max_4-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-Max-4">[4]</a></sup> One of his notebooks found by his widow, Karen Green (who designed the American edition's cover art<sup id="cite_ref-Itzkoff_1-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-Itzkoff-1">[1]</a></sup>), suggested a possible direction for the novel's plot: "...an evil group within the IRS is trying to steal the secrets of an agent who is particularly gifted at maintaining a heightened state of concentration." Wallace's ultimate intention for the plot is unknown.<sup id="cite_ref-Max_4-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-Max-4">[4]</a></sup>

Wallace in his final hours had "tidied up \[his\] manuscript so that his wife could find it. Below it, around it, inside his two computers, on old floppy disks in his drawers were hundreds of other pages—drafts, character sketches, notes to himself, fragments that had evaded his attempt to integrate them into the novel."<sup id="cite_ref-Max_4-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-Max-4">[4]</a></sup> On her blog, [Kathleen Fitzpatrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Fitzpatrick_(American_academic) "Kathleen Fitzpatrick (American academic)") reported that the _Pale King_ manuscript edited by Michael Pietsch began with "more than 1000 pages... in 150 unique chapters".<sup id="cite_ref-fitz_6-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-fitz-6">[6]</a></sup> The published version is 540 pages and 50 chapters. (The paperback edition includes four additional scenes totaling 23 pages.)

On September 14, 2010, Pietsch announced the novel's publication date and provided further information about its plot, saying that the book "takes agonizing daily events like standing in lines, traffic jams, and horrific bus rides—things we all hate—and turns them into moments of laughter and understanding", a theme Wallace addressed in his 2005 commencement speech at Kenyon College.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> Pietsch added that "although David did not finish the novel, it is a surprisingly whole and satisfying reading experience that showcases his extraordinary imaginative talents and his mixing of comedy and deep sadness in scenes from daily life."<sup id="cite_ref-Itzkoff_1-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-Itzkoff-1">[1]</a></sup>

Although [Little, Brown and Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little,_Brown_and_Company "Little, Brown and Company") set _The Pale King_'s publication date for April 15, 2011 ([Tax Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Day "Tax Day")), [Amazon.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon.com "Amazon.com") and [Barnes & Noble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes_%26_Noble "Barnes & Noble") were allowed to sell copies of the novel through their websites as early as March 22, 2011. That elicited protest from many bookstore owners, who felt it put them at an unfair disadvantage. Little, Brown defended the split dates, maintaining it was common practice.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

## Themes\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Pale_King&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Themes")\]

Richard Rayner wrote in the _Los Angeles Times_ that _The Pale King_'s subjects are "loneliness, depression and the ennui that is human life's agonized bedrock, 'the deeper type of pain that is always there, if only in an ambient low-level way, and which most of us spend nearly all of our time and energy trying to distract ourselves from' \[quoting Wallace\]... _The Pale King_ dares to plunge readers deep into this Dantean hell of 'crushing boredom,' suggesting that something good may lie beyond."<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

The story's central theme reflects that of Wallace's noted 2005 commencement speech at [Kenyon College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenyon_College "Kenyon College"),<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> in which he encouraged his audience to be "conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience."<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

## Reception\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Pale_King&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Reception")\]

Jonathan Segura wrote in _[Publishers Weekly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishers_Weekly "Publishers Weekly")_ that _The Pale King_ "isn't the era-defining monumental work we've all been waiting for since _Infinite Jest_ altered the landscape of American fiction", but added that it is "one hell of a document and a valiant tribute to the late Wallace."<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>

In _[Esquire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esquire_(magazine) "Esquire (magazine)")_, Benjamin Alsup wrote that _The Pale King_ is an "incomplete and weirdly fractured pseudo memoir" that is "frustratingly difficult in places" and "potholed throughout by narrative false starts and dead ends." Despite that, Alsup stated, "you should read _The Pale King_." While conceding that the novel is not conventionally gripping in terms of narrative, the reviewer asserted, "If it keeps you up at night, it won't be because you've got to know what happens next. If you're up, you'll be up because DFW writes sentences and sometimes whole pages that make you feel like you can't breathe."<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

[Lev Grossman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Grossman "Lev Grossman"), in _[Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine) "Time (magazine)")_, wrote that "if _The Pale King_ isn't a finished work, it is, at the very least, a remarkable document, by no means a stunt or an attempt to cash in on Wallace's posthumous fame. Despite its shattered state and its unpromising subject matter, or possibly because of them, _The Pale King_ represents Wallace's finest work as a novelist."<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

In _[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")_, [Michiko Kakutani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michiko_Kakutani "Michiko Kakutani") wrote that "\[_The Pale King_\] feels less like an incomplete manuscript than a rough-edged digest of the themes, preoccupations and narrative techniques that have distinguished \[Wallace's\] work from the beginning." She described the novel as both "breathtakingly brilliant and stupefying dull – funny, maddening and elegiac," and predicted that "_The Pale King_ will be minutely examined by longtime fans for the reflexive light it sheds on Wallace's oeuvre and his life" and will also "snag the attention of newcomers, giving them a window – albeit a flawed window – into this immensely gifted writer's vision of the human condition as lived out in the middle of the middle of America." Kakutani claimed that it is Wallace's "most emotionally immediate work."<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

John Jeremiah Sullivan wrote a long, admiring appreciation of the novel in _GQ_ Magazine.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>

David Hering's book _David Foster Wallace: Fiction and Form_ features a lengthy section on the novel's evolution from its genesis to the final version by Michael Pietsch. Part of this section was excerpted in the _Los Angeles Review of Books_ in September 2016.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

The novel was one of the three finalists for the 2012 [Pulitzer Prize for Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize_for_Fiction "Pulitzer Prize for Fiction"); no award was given that year.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>

## Awards and secondary scholarly literature\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Pale_King&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Awards and secondary scholarly literature")\]

The novel received the 2011 [Salon Book Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_Book_Award "Salon Book Award") (Fiction).<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>

The first academic conference about the book, "Work in Process: Reading David Foster Wallace's _The Pale King_", took place at the [University of Antwerp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Antwerp "University of Antwerp") in Belgium from September 22 to 23, 2011. Organized by Toon Staes, the conference consisted of two days of papers and discussions about the novel by numerous scholars. Notable speakers included Wallace scholars Marshall Boswell, Adam Kelly, and Stephen J. Burn.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>

In 2012, the journal _Studies in the Novel_ published a volume of scholarship on _The Pale King_.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> Edited by Wallace scholar Marshall Boswell, the issue contains seven articles by fellow Wallace scholars and a review of a collection of Wallace scholarship.

Before the novel's publication, there was some speculation that two of the short stories included in _[Oblivion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblivion:_Stories "Oblivion: Stories")_—"Incarnations of Burned Children" and "The Soul is Not a Smithy"—might have been excerpts from the _The Pale King_, but they did not appear in the final book; however, Wallace scholar Nick Maniatis has confirmed that "Incarnations of Burned Children" was part of "some of the earliest work on _The Pale King_".<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_King#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> The short story "All That", published in the December 14, 2009, issue of _[The New Yorker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker "The New Yorker")_, was also widely assumed to be an excerpt from _The Pale King,_ but does not appear in the book.
