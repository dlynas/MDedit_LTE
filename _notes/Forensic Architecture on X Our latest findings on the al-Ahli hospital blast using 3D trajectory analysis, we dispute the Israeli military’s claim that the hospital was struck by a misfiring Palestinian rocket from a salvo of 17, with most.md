Our latest findings on the al-Ahli hospital blast: using 3D trajectory analysis, we dispute the Israeli military’s claim that the hospital was struck by a misfiring Palestinian rocket from a salvo of 17, with most of the damage caused by unspent rocket propellant.



Our analysis shows that all 17 rockets travelled 1.8-2km at 500-630m/s and stopped flaring at a 1km altitude, ~4km west of al-Ahli. According to an aerospace expert, these figures indicate that all rockets would have finished burning their propellant while still in mid-flight.

These recent findings follow our previous analysis, which debunked claims made by an Israeli spokesperson about two videos he alleged showed the rocket responsible for the hospital blast:

Our 3D reconstruction and trajectory analysis confirmed reports by @nytimes and @washingtonpost: the Israeli military and media maintain that the 17 Oct blast at al-Ahli was caused by a misfiring PIJ/Hamas rocket based on 2 videos, neither of which in fact shows what they claim.

The devastating explosion at al-Ahli hospital has come to epitomise the information war surrounding Israel’s post-7 October invasion of Gaza. Using our 3D model, we will continue to track the dynamic airspace over Gaza to challenge key pieces of Israeli disinformation.

Since this last post from 20 October,

reports that there have been more than 350 attacks on healthcare in Gaza, and over 750 across the Occupied Palestine Territory.

Israel has falsely claimed that ‘the IDF does not hit hospitals’. @alhaq\_org has footage of an IOF strike on the Al-Ahli Hospital cancer ward on 14 Oct (see image stills), and WHO has reported 59 attacks on healthcare in Gaza and 137 across the Occupied Territory since 7 Oct.

See our ongoing analysis and mapping of the Israeli destruction of medical infrastructure in Gaza since 7 October:

you will ignore this right. It doesnt fit your narrative.

To any reasonable and informed person it was obvious that israel bombed the hospital from the start. Watching them succesfully spin it into a rocket misfire in real time was heartbreaking and eye opening.
