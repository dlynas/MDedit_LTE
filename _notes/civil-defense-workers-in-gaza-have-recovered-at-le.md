## Civil defense workers in Gaza have recovered at least 300 bodies buried in a mass grave at the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis. Some of the bodies found had their hands tied behind their backs. Many were likely medical staff or patients. "We do not know if they were buried alive or executed," Khan Younis Civil Defense's director Yamen Abu Suleiman told CNN.

The Israeli military launched a siege and series of raids of Nasser Medical Complex earlier this year, claiming that Hamas members used the hospital — the largest one still functioning in Gaza at the time —as a secret base and patients as "human shields." The hospital ceased operations in February. Israeli forces withdrew in April. Khan Younis Civil Defense says they are attempting to locate hundreds of more bodies, many of whom were killed in airstrikes earlier into the conflict and buried near the complex by family members.

Today marks 200 days since Israel launched its assault on Gaza. The official death toll sits at over 34,000, though that figure is almost certainly an undercount as Gaza's health ministry struggles to keep an updated toll due to the loss of government resources and personnel, and as thousands of Palestinians are still missing, kidnapped by Israeli forces, trapped under the rubble or buried in unmarked graves.
