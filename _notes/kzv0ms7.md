	> I'm so sick of this. You know who has a far more effective and direct tool to control inflation that could help the working class instead of potentially harming them? Congress. Raise taxes on corporations and the highest income individuals.

	The reality is politicians (and people with healthy information diets) follow their economic incentives and voters are distracted by the culture wars and other propaganda driven conflicts.

	Conservatives are still insisting stopping 3rd trimester abortions, immigrants, crime, trans, minorities, etc. are real problems and ignoring the economic damage they do to themselves in the process.

	Democrats just have to sit there and say "We don't do batshit culture war shit" as their election slogans which completely ignore the economic problems...and remain relevant.

	We've kinda just gone far enough down the river its going to require country-wide protests on economic issues where the protestors are driven by rational economic incentives in terms of their demands instead of culture war issues. I just don't see a grass roots movement that will do this.

	The rational incentives at this point are:

	1) Adjusting immigration incentives by cracking down on under the table and illegal immigrant employers with massive fines when caught for the employer.

	2) Increasing legal immigration in fields like medical care where there is a shortage of qualified workers already and it gets worse as the population continues to age. Make it easier for them to change employers, drop the stupidly low quotas to "protect workers" when all the rules are just to make them easier to exploit for employers.

	3) Shifting the tax burden to reduce the deficit onto those that can afford it (uncapping social security tax, raising capital gains taxes above $200k income a year to match regular income tax, remove loopholes that let people take advantage of retirement accounts using private equity with very high upsides that are almost certain when they get put in there) and so on. 

	4) Freezing spending to current levels + 50% of inflation across the board with exceptions for infrastructure, revenue generating sources (i.e. Auditing people with the IRS) social security/medicare that should be mostly fixed by uncapping the taxes. The freeze, frankly, is going to need to be 30 years at this point to get spending under control as painful as that sounds.

	5) Creating a public option that can bargain across the board for everyone for health care, dental care, vision care, mental health care, life insurance, home insurance, etc. Replace stuff like the current flood insurance with something rolled into this. Require it to be deficit neutral over 10 year budget windows to allow for major events. You don't need to outlaw private insurance, you just need to keep them honest by creating competition in a broke market.

	6) Maintain current interest rates until inflation is below 3% for at least a full year.

	7) Federal zoning standards that are restricted to noise pollution, air pollution, nuisances that affect sleep/health, but ignore things like low disruption businesses like restaurants/grocery stores mixed with residential.

	8) Federal regulation of oligopolies to require companies not to exceed 30% market share AND require a minimum of 10 companies who are effective competitors to be in the market. Break up anyone bigger and force competition. Capitalism only works when there is real competition. It breaks in all other scenarios and its nuts people don't think this is a problem.

	9) Federal regulation should be reduced to things that directly affect health/safety/economic stability. Its honestly 90% of that already but there is a little fat that can be trimmed. Budgets for enforcing these regulations should be frozen at +100% of inflation instead of +50% and fines should be massively increased to minimize the actual funding cost. Require bonds for 2x put into treasuries of the original fine amount for large businesses to take the regulator to court. Limit appeals to a single appeal to keep this from being dragged out.

	10) Term limit the supreme court to reduce corruption in the judicial system. Each presidential election gets you 1 supreme court justice appointment. Longest serving justice gets replaced. 36 year terms is plenty of time for people to have that kind of power when Congress is unwilling to tackle economic corruption issues in the courts since the same "donors" are playing every branch of government and every party that wins elections on every level.

	11) Give board seats on ALL corporations of over 300 employees (or 300 employees including subsidiaries) to workers in equal number to investors. You don't need unions with dues, just a say in who sits in the C-Suite/makes management decisions. Tie bonuses &amp; buybacks for the C-Suite/management to something the workers can block if they are unhappy. 

	---

	The reality is 0 of this will be implemented though. Like, all of it is economically rational given the situation for 90% of the population. But 0% of it will happen.
