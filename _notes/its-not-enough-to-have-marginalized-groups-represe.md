## It’s not enough to have marginalized groups represented in the nicest room——the structure of the house needs to be rebuilt. 

Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò explains how progressive social justice language is co-opted by elites through “elite capture.”

"Imagine our society as a house. It's got a number of rooms in it, but some of those rooms are only accessible to certain people based on their race or class or other factors.
There are plenty of rooms of power like this in our real society. At the top of the house is the nicest room.
Resources from the rest of the rooms flow there because of how the house is built.
There elite members of the house make decisions on how the house is built.
The elites in this room might feel pressure from the people in other rooms to at least acknowledge that the way things are being run is unfair and unequal.
The elites don't want to lose wealth and power, but they want to appear like they're recognizing the humanity of the people in the other rooms.
To stay on top without giving up anything, it takes the language of identity politics.
They recognize other people in the room who represent marginalized demographics and change the structure of the house.
This change who appears in the nicest rooms. I call that elite capture."
