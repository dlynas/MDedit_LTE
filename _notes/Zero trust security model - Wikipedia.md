From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The **zero trust security model**, also known as **zero trust architecture** (**ZTA**), and sometimes known as **perimeterless security**, describes an approach to the strategy, design and implementation of [IT systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_system "IT system"). The main concept behind the zero trust security model is "never trust, always verify", which means that users and devices should not be trusted by default, even if they are connected to a permissioned network such as a corporate [LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network "Local area network") and even if they were previously verified.

ZTA is implemented by establishing strong identity verification, validating device compliance prior to granting access, and ensuring least privilege access to only explicitly-authorized resources. Most modern corporate networks consist of many interconnected zones, [cloud services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing "Cloud computing") and infrastructure, connections to remote and mobile environments, and connections to non-conventional IT, such as [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things "Internet of things") devices.

The reasoning for zero trust is that the traditional approach – trusting users and devices within a notional "corporate perimeter", or users and devices connected via a [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network "Virtual private network") – is not sufficient in the complex environment of a corporate network. The zero trust approach advocates [mutual authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication "Mutual authentication"), including checking the identity and integrity of users and devices without respect to location, and providing access to applications and services based on the confidence of user and device identity and device health in combination with user [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication "Authentication").<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> The zero trust architecture has been proposed for use in specific areas such as supply chains.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

The principles of zero trust can be applied to data access, and to the management of data. This brings about zero trust [data security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_security "Data security") where every request to access the data needs to be authenticated dynamically and ensure [least privileged access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege "Principle of least privilege") to resources. In order to determine if access can be granted, policies can be applied based on the attributes of the data, who the user is, and the type of environment using [Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control "Attribute-based access control"). This zero-trust data security approach can protect access to the data.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

## History\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zero_trust_security_model&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")\]

In April 1994, the term "zero trust" was coined by Stephen Paul Marsh in his doctoral thesis on computer security at the [University of Stirling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Stirling "University of Stirling"). Marsh's work studied trust as something finite that can be described mathematically, asserting that the concept of trust transcends human factors such as [morality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality "Morality"), [ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics "Ethics"), [lawfulness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawful "Lawful"), [justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice "Justice"), and [judgement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgement "Judgement").<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

The problems of the Smartie or M&M model of the network (the precursor description of [de-perimeterisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-perimeterisation "De-perimeterisation")) was described by a [Sun Microsystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems "Sun Microsystems") engineer in a [Network World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_World "Network World") article in May 1994, who described firewalls' perimeter defence, as a hard shell around a soft centre, like a Cadbury Egg.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

In 2001 the first version of the OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual) was released and this had some focus on trust. Version 3 which came out around 2007 has a whole chapter on Trust which says "Trust is a Vulnerability" and talks about how to apply the OSSTMM 10 controls based on Trust levels.

In 2003 the challenges of defining the perimeter to an organisation's IT systems was highlighted by the [Jericho Forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho_Forum "Jericho Forum") of this year, discussing the trend of what was then given the name "[de-perimeterisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-perimeterisation "De-perimeterisation")".

In response to [Operation Aurora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Aurora "Operation Aurora"), a Chinese APT attack throughout 2009, [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Google") started to implement a zero-trust architecture referred to as [BeyondCorp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeyondCorp "BeyondCorp").

In 2010 the term zero trust model was used by analyst John Kindervag of [Forrester Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrester_Research "Forrester Research") to denote stricter cybersecurity programs and access control within corporations.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_7-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model#cite_note-:1-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:2_8-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model#cite_note-:2-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

However, it would take almost a decade for zero trust architectures to become prevalent, driven in part by increased adoption of mobile and cloud services. <sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2022)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

In 2018, work undertaken in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") by cybersecurity researchers at [NIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST "NIST") and [NCCoE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cybersecurity_Center_of_Excellence "National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence") led to the publication of NIST SP 800-207 – Zero Trust Architecture.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_10-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model#cite_note-:3-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:4_11-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model#cite_note-:4-11">[11]</a></sup> The publication defines zero trust (ZT) as a collection of concepts and ideas designed to reduce the uncertainty in enforcing accurate, per-request access decisions in information systems and services in the face of a network viewed as compromised. A zero trust architecture (ZTA) is an enterprise's cyber security plan that utilizes zero trust concepts and encompasses component relationships, workflow planning, and access policies. Therefore, a zero trust enterprise is the network infrastructure (physical and virtual) and operational policies that are in place for an enterprise as a product of a zero trust architecture plan.

There are several ways to implement all the tenets of ZT; a full ZTA solution will include elements of all three:

-   Using enhanced identity governance and policy-based access controls.
-   Using micro-segmentation
-   Using overlay networks or software-defined perimeters

In 2019 the United Kingdom [National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cyber_Security_Centre_(United_Kingdom) "National Cyber Security Centre (United Kingdom)") recommended that network architects consider a zero trust approach for new IT deployments, particularly where significant use of cloud services is planned.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_12-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model#cite_note-:0-12">[12]</a></sup> An alternative but consistent approach is taken by [NCSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cyber_Security_Centre_(United_Kingdom) "National Cyber Security Centre (United Kingdom)"), in identifying the key principles behind zero trust architectures:

-   Single strong source of user identity
-   User authentication
-   Machine authentication
-   Additional context, such as policy compliance and device health
-   Authorization policies to access an application
-   Access control policies within an application
