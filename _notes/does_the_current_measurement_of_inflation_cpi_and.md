## Does the current measurement of inflation (CPI) and real GDP growth take into account the temporary and waning value of novelty?

Over the course of 10 years, all farmers switch to the gold potato and therefore the economic output doubles in 10 years. Now, a farmer switches back to russet potato and due to its novelty, the market price is twice as much as the gold potato: $4/kg. Over the course of 10 years, all farmers switch to the russet potatoes and so on.This economy doubles every 10 years with no real growth and improvement. I know there could be different baskets (fixed vs evolving) to measure inflation but the common basket to measure inflation is evolving.Are we measuring well-being and inflation and growth correctly. Do we consider the fact that people like novel items for a while? How about quality?

For instance, in theory even the lowest 10% of society, these days, experiences a better life than the highest 10% of society 100 or 200 years ago.  But I doubt it. If you can afford to own and live in a brick house in a safe neighborhood and buy organic meat and vegetables and enjoy a quiet beautiful scenery, and work only 6 months and rest the other 6 months, you are one of the a few percent of the society. We all are in huge debt and 30 yrs mortgage, eat cheap, worry about retirement, work too much, anxious about our retirement, etc. The life that I described was what 80% of the society could afford back then. Using a fixed basket, it seems we all are poor.

	Key point here: consumers have budget constraints. If I have $200 to spend each week on groceries and I decide to spend more on a new variety of potatoes, that means I have less to spend on something else. Maybe I spend less on chocolate biscuits. The only way I can spend more overall due to novelty overall is if I can expand my grocery budget. 

	GDP isn't a measure of well-being, it isn't intended as one. Its proper name is Gross Domestic Product: it's a measure of the goods and services produced in a given area over a given period of time. Loosely, more goods and services tends to result in more well-being because people tend to choose to produce more of the things that make them better off, but obviously a measure of production misses all sorts of things that contribute to well-being.

	Back in 1900, the [American home ownership rate](https://dqydj.com/historical-homeownership-rate-united-states/) was 47%, in 2022 it was 66%. The typical American worker in 1900 worked 2,938 hours per week, in 2017 [that had fallen to 1,757 hours](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-working-hours-per-worker?country=~USA). In 1901, the [typical American household](https://www.bls.gov/cex/csxhistorical.htm) spent 46% of their budget on food. And in 1900 the USA was one of the richest countries with the highest wages in the world, equalled maybe only by Australia. There was a peacetime famine in northern Sweden and Finland in the 1870s, and one in Spain in 1905. People were a lot poorer back then.

			>The farmer creating the new product earns more and can buy more.
			
			And the farmers selling the old product earn less and can buy less. Or my hypothetical baker who is selling fewer biscuits.
			
			>Let's keep things practical, focusing on economic well-being, not philosophy. By well-being, I mean financial well-being.
			
			Let's be practical. Collecting and compiling national level economic statistics is very expensive. The main funders of these tend to be a country's Treasury department and central banks. They're chiefly interested in questions like "how much can the government raise in tax revenue" and "what are the monetary flows between sectors?" You can have all the ideas you like about what GDP should be focused on. Unless you are going to shell out $100m or so, per country, your opinions ain't going to count for much. 
			
			>This could be due to redefining terms.
			
			I have never heard of such a redefinition of terms, and official agencies like the BLS are in my experience pretty reliable about noting such a significant redefinition because such changes are critical information for users. 
			
			>Now, everyone, including men, works and shares chores at home
			
			In the USA at least, leisure time (so excluding both paid work and housework) has increased for [working-age Americans](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/january-2007/working-hard-or-hardly-working-the-evolution-of-leisure-in-the-united-states) of both genders by about 7.3 hours between 1965 and 2003.

					The ramp up in house prices in many developed countries is mainly (81% on average) [due to rising land prices](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24911335), which are not part of GDP as land isn't produced. There's a reasonably broad consensus that the reason for the ramp up in land prices is zoning restrictions on housing supply (using "zone" in a broad sense). A significant reason for this consensus is that Japan and the city of Houston largely escaped this ramp up. 
					
					[Food safety](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4840a1.htm) has improved since 1900 by measures such as [pasteurisation and home refrigeration and freezers](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4840a1.htm).

							You're reasoning from a price change. A good might become more expensive because people value it more. It might instead become more expensive because almost nobody values it and so almost nobody produces it.

							The price of rent has been soaring in the CPI, see https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=10&amp;eid=34561#snid=34584. 
							
							As for the food we ate in 1900, I don't particularly want to eat mainly canned vegetables, fruit, meats and seafood. I think you have a very idealised view of ordinary diets in 1900. 
							
							As for measuring our economy using a fixed set of goods (what people used to consume), I do agree that if  you ignore the massive increases in the variety of goods and services available, the economy will look much smaller. I don't share your opinion that that's a better way to compare. One purpose of GDP is an estimate of what *could* be produced, for example the way the US economy retooled to military production in WWII. If the USA today was only producing the consumer goods available in 1900, it could produce an incredible amount more of them. 
							
							"Market value but no real economic value" - economists gave up on trying to define what "real value" is back in the 19th century.

			>Let's keep things practical, focusing on economic well-being, not philosophy
			
			>I want to clarify that my model doesn't deny that certain inventions have brought convenience. However, these are a small part of today's GDP and not my analysis's focus. Examples include home electronics, the internet, public utilities, electricity, vaccines, and antibiotics. 
			
			Interesting that you say you want to focus on the practical side of economic well-being and then exclude some of the most revolutionary benefits of modern economies that support economic wellbeing. Vaccines, antibiotics, and clean water have reduced child mortality down to an extremely small fraction of what they used to be. That alone seems to imply that, if anything, GDP statistics *underreport* improvements in economic wellbeing.
			
			You seem hyper fixated on financial security. It's true that people are financially stressed today, just as they've always been, but the vast majority of people can purchase much more with their incomes today than they could in the past. Furthermore, much of the consumer surplus from modern technology (think search engines) isn't directly tracked. That, again, seems to imply that GDP numbers are, if anything, understating improvements in living standards rather than over-reporting them.

	What makes you think this? [In 1870 people worked an average of 3000 hours a year, whereas now they only work 1700](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-working-hours-per-worker). [Their life expectancy was 40 years, now it's more like 80](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy?country=OWID_WRL~Americas~OWID_EUR~OWID_AFR~OWID_ASI~OWID_OCE~USA).

			Layman reasoning: there's no doubt the economy is much, much bigger now. This means that the economy certainly grew a lot. 
			
			 One hundred years ago, people had two shirts and pants, a few kitchen items and not much more than that, compare it with your possessions.
			
			So the growth data seems pretty convincing when comparing all things one has now with the things one had in the past - not even mentioning services like: dental care, medical appointments, infinity of shows (compared with almost inaccessible conserts back than)...

Over the course of 10 years, all farmers switch to the gold potato and therefore the economic output doubles in 10 years.

	Do you have any evidence that this is something that is happening today in any meaningful quantity? Even just an example of a product that was introduced, usurped by a different variation, and then brought back at a substantially higher markup would be good. I guess clothing? But clothing is one of the sectors with the least amount of inflation over the past twenty years.

		Yes, look at the fashion industry. But this is a model economy to show how evolving baskets can lead to wrong measurement of the gdp and growth.  
		The right way to measure long term growth is to consider the old time basket and see how much it costs today: fixed basket.

						There are practical solutions to tackle such issues, much like the current Consumer Price Index (CPI) approach. The challenge lies in accounting for changes across borders and time when using any basket of goods. Currently, this is managed by adjusting the basket every 5 or 10 years and applying the concept of "money equivalence" to account for missing or changing goods and services. This approach is more often used in the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) method.  
						To simplify, you establish a consistent and minimally changing basket comprising items like food, housing, clothing, and services. Let's assume it represents 80% of the basket from the past period and 60% of the basket from the current period. This forms the basis for two methods to calculate inflation and growth.  
						These challenges are both technical and practical, but they can be estimated. While they might seem a bit complex, following a certain concept can lead to reasonable ways of estimating the value of missing items. This assumes that the relative importance of various products remains similar in equilibrium.

	Economic output measured as real GDP  doesn't double just because you increase price. In fact, it's completely irrelevant what the price level is and only the total output in units of potatoes matters.

	If you go back a hundred years, the vast majority of us households didn't even have access to electricity. They had no dishwashers, no cars, no cell phones, no fridges, no internet, no TVs, no airlines, no running water to flush toilets or have a shower. Moreover, a bowl, pitcher, and chamber pot were standard issue in most bedrooms and supermarkets carried only a few items, ...

	So no, basically no one, not even the most affluent could afford the luxury that the average person nowadays takes for granted. Assume you claim 7% inflation a year. 

	With regards to inflation, it is even possible it's overstated. A lot of products did not only get a lot cheaper but also substantially better in quality. Many also didn't even exist.

	*TVs

	*Airline tickets: average round trip domestic ticket in 1980 cost $592.55. Given 7%, that would equate to about 10.860 today. Yet, the cost of Air Travel per Mile Has Fallen by 50% Since 1980 ([source: aei.org](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/even-with-fees-the-miracle-of-flight-remains-a-real-bargain-cost-of-air-travel-per-mile-has-fallen-by-50-since-1980/))

	*Clothes

	*Solar panels

	*Toys

	*Computers

	*Phones and plans

	*Many cars, when adjusted for inflation: 1980 Ford F-150 (Seventh Generation) cost 5700. That would be about 105.000 today with 7% inflation.

	*Books

	*Cameras

	*Shoes: Air Jordans cost just $65 when they debuted in 1985. Assuming 7% a year, you would have to set aside 850 dollars in 2023!

	Candy (as well as many other food items): 

	A Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bar, for example, weighed only 1.05 ounces in 1980 and cost 25 cents. That would be USD 4.6 today. However, it's 1.55 oz and cost about 1.3 at Walmart

			Yes, I believe that the quality of life and overall well-being has not seen significant improvement, if any.  
			When we consider the official data, we observe that Americans now earn three times more than they did in 1950. If we assume that an average American works only a third of the hours that the average American worked in 1950, theoretically, one should be able to sustain a similar lifestyle to that of an average person in 1950. For instance, if a single person within a five-member family works just 15 hours a week (1/3 of the original hours) and earns $25,000 per year, that family should be able to afford a reasonable life akin to the average American in 1950, which was a descent life. However, the annual rent for such a home alone exceeds $25,000.  
			Interestingly, this perspective aligns with the predictions of prominent economists from the early 1900s. Take Schumpeter's statement, for instance, where he anticipated that if the growth in US productivity continued as it had been, Americans might soon only need to work one day a week, benefiting from various new inventions. However, the reality is far from this. We're not experiencing such minimal work hours or abundant leisure time.  
			Clearly, there's a discrepancy that cannot be ignored. It's challenging to summarize these data-driven observations without acknowledging that something seems fundamentally off.
