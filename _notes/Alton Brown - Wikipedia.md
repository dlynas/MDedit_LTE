## Career [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alton_Brown&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Career")

Brown studied film at the [University of Georgia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Georgia "University of Georgia") in the early 1980s, and got his start in television as the cinematographer for music videos, including "[The One I Love](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_One_I_Love_(R.E.M._song) "The One I Love (R.E.M. song)")" by [R.E.M.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.E.M. "R.E.M.")<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

Brown was dissatisfied with the quality of cooking shows airing on American television, so he set out to produce his own show. In preparation, he enrolled in the [New England Culinary Institute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Culinary_Institute "New England Culinary Institute"), graduating in 1997.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Brown says<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> he was a poor science student in high school and college, but he focused on the subject to understand the underlying processes of cooking. He is outspoken in his shows<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> about his dislike of single-purpose [kitchen utensils](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_utensil "Kitchen utensil") and equipment such as [garlic presses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garlic_press "Garlic press") and [margarita machines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarita_machine "Margarita machine"), although he adapts a few traditionally single-purpose devices, such as [rice cookers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_cooker "Rice cooker") and [melon ballers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melon_baller "Melon baller"), into multipurpose tools.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

#### _Good Eats_ [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alton_Brown&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Good Eats")

The pilot for _Good Eats_ first aired in July 1998 on the [PBS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Service "Public Broadcasting Service") member TV station [WTTW](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTTW "WTTW") in Chicago. [Food Network](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Network "Food Network") picked up the show in July 1999. Many of the _Good Eats_ episodes<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> feature Brown building makeshift cooking devices in order to point out that many of the devices sold at conventional "cooking" stores are simply fancified hardware store items. _Good Eats_ was nominated for the Best TV [Food Journalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Food_Journalism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Food Journalism (page does not exist)") Award by the [James Beard Foundation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Beard_Foundation "James Beard Foundation") in 2000.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> The show was also awarded a 2006 [Peabody Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peabody_Award "Peabody Award").<sup id="cite_ref-peabody_18-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-peabody-18">[18]</a></sup> In May 2011, Alton Brown announced an end to _Good Eats_ after 14 seasons.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> The final episode, "Turn on the Dark", aired February 10, 2012.

On Alton's 2017 book tour, he stated that _Good Eats_ would have a sequel<sup id="cite_ref-TastingTbale_GoodEatsReturn_20-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-TastingTbale_GoodEatsReturn-20">[20]</a></sup> and that it would be released to the internet in 2018. This was changed in late 2018 when Brown made arrangements with The Cooking Channel to air "revised" versions of several episodes with new recipes entitled _Good Eats Reloaded_, in which he stated new episodes of _Good Eats_ are also in the works. Thirteen episodes of _Good Eats Reloaded_ aired in late winter and early spring 2019, and were added to the _Good Eats_ reruns on The Cooking Channel. It was announced on June 5, 2019, that the new show would be called _Good Eats Returns_; it premiered on the Food Network with the slightly revised title _Good Eats: The Return_ on Sunday, August 25.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>

New episodes of _Reloaded_ premiered in April 2020. New _Return_ episodes were in the writing process and planned to be filming over the summer of 2020, but were delayed due to the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic "COVID-19 pandemic").<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability"><span title="The material near this tag failed verification of its source citation(s).

Three chefs are eliminated one by one, and the winner keeps their unspent money as the day's prize.

### _Pantry Raid_ and _Quarantine Quitchen_ [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alton_Brown&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Pantry Raid and Quarantine Quitchen")

With the [COVID-19](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19 "COVID-19") quarantine in 2020 and the subsequent delays in production on Season 16 of _Good Eats_ (Season 2 of "The Return"), Alton took to [YouTube](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube "YouTube") to make two new online cooking series.

_**Pantry Raid**_ was a series of once-weekly shorts (usually released on Fridays or Saturdays) for making palatable foods while staying safe at home. The episodes were filmed in the _Good Eats_ test kitchens at Brain Food Productions and consisted of Alton and a cameraman as the only personnel onsite.<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup>

_**Quarantine Quitchen**_ \[aka "QQ"\] started as a single [livestream](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestream "Livestream") titled "The Browns Make Dinner", referring to Alton and his wife Elizabeth making dinner at their loft apartment in Georgia. After the success of the first such "episode", the once-weekly series was released live every Tuesday. The series continued off and on while the Browns went on tour in 2022, and now only appear sporadically in 2023.<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup>

## Personal life [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alton_Brown&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Personal life")

Brown lives in [Marietta, Georgia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marietta,_Georgia "Marietta, Georgia"). He and his former wife DeAnna, an [executive producer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer "Executive producer") on _Good Eats_, [divorced](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce "Divorce") in 2015.<sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> They have one daughter born in 1999.<sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup> A few members of his [extended family](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_family "Extended family") appeared on _Good Eats_ (such as his late grandmother, his mother, and daughter, who is known on the show as "Alton's Spawn"), but most of his "family" portrayed on the series were actors or members of the show's production crew.<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-mutantnation.com_55-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-mutantnation.com-55">[55]</a></sup>

Brown and Atlanta restaurant designer Elizabeth Ingram became [engaged](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engagement "Engagement") in 2018.<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup> According to Brown's Instagram account, as of September 2018, he and Ingram had married, on a boat in Charleston, South Carolina.<sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup>

In the fifth episode of Season 18 of _[Worst Cooks in America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worst_Cooks_in_America "Worst Cooks in America")_, Brown referred to his current wife as his third wife.

Brown was once a [motorcycling](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle "Motorcycle") enthusiast,<sup id="cite_ref-roadfly.com_42-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-roadfly.com-42">[42]</a></sup> although he no longer owns one. Additionally, Brown is an airplane [pilot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_(aeronautics) "Pilot (aeronautics)"), and was featured in the aviation magazine _AOPA Flight Training_.<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> He owned two planes, a [Cessna 206](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_206 "Cessna 206") and a [Cessna 414](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_414 "Cessna 414").<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup>

Brown enjoys vintage watches and wore a different watch for every season of _Good Eats_; this was used in production to quickly identify which season a clip is from. When his watch broke down midseason,<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words"><span title="The material near this tag possibly uses too vague attribution or weasel words. (October 2018)">which?</span></a></i>]</sup> he continued to wear the broken timepiece to maintain this system. Twenty years after the [Omega Seamaster](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_Seamaster "Omega Seamaster") watch his father left him was stolen, Brown bought it from an eBay seller and had it restored.<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup>

Brown changed his eating habits in 2009 in order to lose weight and become healthier, losing 50 pounds (23 kg) over the course of nine months.<sup id="cite_ref-Good_Eats_EA1313H_61-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-Good_Eats_EA1313H-61">[61]</a></sup>

Brown discussed his Christian beliefs in a 2010 interview with _Eater_. He said at the time:

> I'm not a spooky snake handler because I live in Georgia and I'm Christian ... that I believe in the Bible, that I travel with the Bible, that I read the Bible every day. I'm still me. I'm still a guy doing a job. I find, actually, that people ask me a lot about it. I don't hit people over the head with the Bible ... I still feel a funny little tinge in my stomach when I'm out to dinner with my wife and daughter in New York. We'll go to dinner and we'll be sitting around the table and we'll say [grace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_(prayer) "Grace (prayer)"). You know what? People are going to stare at you. I used to feel really self-conscious. But I've gotten to a point where I think, nah, I'm not going to feel bad about that. I'm not going to apologize about that.<sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup>

Brown said in a December 2014 interview in [_Time_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine) "Time (magazine)") that he "could no longer abide the [Southern Baptist Convention](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention "Southern Baptist Convention")'s indoctrination of children and its anti-gay stance" adding that he is now "searching for a new belief system."<sup id="cite_ref-time_63-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-time-63">[63]</a></sup>

In November 2020, Brown declared on Twitter that he has almost always voted Republican, but that the 2016 United States Presidential Election was the first time he considered voting for a Democrat since [Michael Dukakis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dukakis "Michael Dukakis") in 1988. He supported [Joe Biden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden") in the [2020 U.S. Presidential Election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election "2020 United States presidential election"), as well as Democrats running in U.S. Senate races in Georgia.<sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup>
