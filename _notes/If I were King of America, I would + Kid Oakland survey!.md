_NHB - No holds barred.  You are not allowed to troll-rate anyone in this thread.  If you do so, you invite massive retaliation.  You are not allowed to break the law, but short of that, anything goes here.  If you are easily offended or squeamish, it is highly recommended you not enter this thread._

Legalize drugs (and tax the shit out of them.)

Disentitle entitlements.

Democrats are putting filibuster reform on the ballot

Drop the stupid missile shield idea (by the time we deployed it, China and Russia would have already stashed suitcase bombs in storage in our major cities.)  

Try a few dozen of our most high-profile domestic war criminals (starting with GW.)  

Fix our elections (transparent and publicly financed.)

Reinstitute the death tax at 50% for all portions of an estate > 10 million bucks.  

Abolish capital punishment(but only AFTER we've tried a few domestic war criminals.)  

Discredit organized religion (and other superstitious nonsense.)  

Tax pollution.  

Recapture the air waves from the corporate giants.  

Get rid of farm subsidies, corporate subsidies, passive income tax breaks.  

Impeach a few supreme court justices (anyone who sided with the majority in Bush v Gore doesn't belong on the court.)  

Teach our children to respect other cultures and people.  

Abolish (or dramatically transform) the pledge of allegiance so that our children learn that vigilant and vocal defense of liberty and justice is a higher value than blind patriotism.

What would you do if you were King/Queen of America?
