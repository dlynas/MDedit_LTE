Heatmap of the development of debt-to-GDP ratio for some European countries, in percent of GDP from 1995 to 2017.

In [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"), the **debt-to-GDP ratio** is the [ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio "Ratio") between a country's [government debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt "Government debt") (measured in units of currency) and its [gross domestic product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product "Gross domestic product") (GDP) (measured in units of currency per year). A low debt-to-GDP ratio indicates that an economy produces goods and services sufficient to pay back debts without incurring further debt.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-GDP_ratio#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> Geopolitical and economic considerations – including [interest rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rates "Interest rates"), [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War "War"), [recessions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession "Recession"), and other variables – influence the borrowing practices of a nation and the choice to incur further [debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt "Debt").<sup id="cite_ref-StLouisFed_2-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-GDP_ratio#cite_note-StLouisFed-2">[2]</a></sup>

It should not be confused with a **deficit-to-GDP ratio**, which, for countries running budget deficits, measures a country's annual net fiscal loss in a given year ([total expenditures minus total revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_balance "Government budget balance"), or the net change in debt per annum) as a percentage share of that country's GDP; for countries running budget surpluses, a _surplus-to-GDP ratio_ measures a country's annual net fiscal _gain_ as a share of that country's GDP.

Particularly in [macroeconomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics "Macroeconomics"), various debt-to-GDP ratios can be calculated. The most commonly used ratio is the [government debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt "Government debt") divided by the gross domestic product (GDP), which reflects the government's finances, while another common ratio is the total debt to GDP, which reflects the finances of the nation as a whole.

The debt-to-GDP ratio is technically not a [dimensionless quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity "Dimensionless quantity"), but a unit of [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time"), being equal to the amount of years over which the accumulated economic product equals the debt.

## Changes\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Debt-to-GDP_ratio&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Changes")\]

The change in debt-to-GDP is approximately "net change in debt as percentage of GDP";<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy_dispute#Disputed_statement" title="Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute"><span title="The material near this tag is possibly inaccurate or nonfactual. (August 2018)">dubious</span></a> <span>– <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Debt-to-GDP_ratio#Dubious" title="Talk:Debt-to-GDP ratio">discuss</a></span></i>]</sup> for government debt, this is [deficit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_deficit "Government budget deficit") or ([surplus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_surplus "Economic surplus")) as percentage of GDP.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy_dispute#Disputed_statement" title="Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute"><span title="The material near this tag is possibly inaccurate or nonfactual.

This is only approximate as GDP changes from year to year, but generally, year-on-year GDP changes are small (say, 3%),<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (August 2018)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> and thus this is approximately correct.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy_dispute#Disputed_statement" title="Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute"><span title="The material near this tag is possibly inaccurate or nonfactual. (August 2018)">dubious</span></a> <span>– <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Debt-to-GDP_ratio#Dubious" title="Talk:Debt-to-GDP ratio">discuss</a></span></i>]</sup>

However, in the presence of significant [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation "Inflation"), or particularly [hyperinflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation "Hyperinflation"), GDP may increase rapidly in nominal terms; if debt is nominal, then its ratio to GDP will decrease rapidly. A period of [deflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation "Deflation") would have the opposite effect.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (August 2018)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

A government's debt-to-GDP ratio can be analysed by looking at how it changes or, in other words, how the debt is evolving over time:

![{\displaystyle {\frac {B_{t}}{Y_{t}}}-{\frac {B_{t-1}}{Y_{t-1}}}=(r-g)\left({\frac {B_{t-1}}{Y_{t-1}}}\right)+\left({\frac {G_{t}-T_{t}}{Y_{t}}}\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bd33f5a59b70aea8d7e3ed6f9febeff12009133e)

<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="Variables not defined (August 2018)">clarification needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

The left hand side of the equation demonstrates the dynamics of the government's debt. ![{\textstyle {\frac {B_{t}}{Y_{t}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/20c7a0c891bf66ab3dc76fda5b764ce87f8a6012) is the debt-to-GDP at the end of the period t, and ![{\textstyle {\frac {B_{t-1}}{Y_{t-1}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2e73aa7c73c15f44f6679d51af21247a15f1de77) is the debt-to-GDP ratio at the end of the previous period (t−1). Hence, the left side of the equation shows the _change_ in the debt-to-GDP ratio. The right hand side of the equation shows the causes of the government's debt.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy_dispute#Disputed_statement" title="Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute"><span title="The material near this tag is possibly inaccurate or nonfactual.

(August 2018)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> and ![{\textstyle {\frac {G_{t}-T_{t}}{Y_{t}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c0eb7ff78e414cd1f6cef563fdfbb15bc213c24e) shows the primary deficit-to-GDP ratio.

If the government has the ability to [print money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_creation "Money creation"), and therefore [monetize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetizing_debt "Monetizing debt") the outstanding debt, the budget constraint becomes:

![{\displaystyle \left({\frac {B_{t}}{Y_{t}}}-{\frac {B_{t-1}}{Y_{t-1}}}\right)+\left({\frac {M_{t}}{Y_{t}}}-{\frac {M_{t-1}}{Y_{t-1}}}\right)=(r-g)\left({\frac {B_{t-1}}{Y_{t-1}}}\right)+\left({\frac {G_{t}-T_{t}}{Y_{t}}}\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ae46062b56256d28ee58e3b60257d91075453cc9)

<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (August 2018)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

The term ![{\textstyle {\frac {M_{t}}{Y_{t}}}-{\frac {M_{t-1}}{Y_{t-1}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d226aef3565e4e13ae209602eabdffd5f782844) is the change in money balances (i.e. money growth). By printing money the government is able to increase nominal money balances to pay off the debt (consequently acting in the debt way that debt financing does, in order to balance the government's expenditures).<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="The text near this tag may need clarification or removal of jargon. (August 2018)">clarification needed</span></a></i>]</sup> However, the effect that an increase in nominal money balances has on [seignorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage "Seigniorage") is ambiguous, as while it increases the amount of money within the economy, the real value of each unit of money decreases due to inflationary effects. This inflationary effect from money printing is called an [inflation tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_tax "Inflation tax").<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-GDP_ratio#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

## Applications\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Debt-to-GDP_ratio&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Applications")\]

Debt-to-GDP measures the [financial leverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_leverage "Financial leverage") of an economy.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

One of the [Euro convergence criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_convergence_criteria "Euro convergence criteria") was that government debt-to-GDP should be below 60%.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-GDP_ratio#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

The World Bank and the IMF hold that "a country can be said to achieve external debt sustainability if it can meet its current and future external debt service obligations in full, without recourse to debt rescheduling or the accumulation of arrears and without compromising growth".<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (August 2018)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> According to these two institutions, external debt sustainability can be obtained by a country "by bringing the net present value (NPV) of external public debt down to about 150 percent of a country's exports or 250 percent of a country's revenues".<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-GDP_ratio#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> High external debt is believed to have harmful effects on an economy.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-GDP_ratio#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> The United Nations [Sustainable Development Goal 17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_17 "Sustainable Development Goal 17"), an integral part of the [2030 Agenda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals "Sustainable Development Goals") has a target to address the external debt of highly indebted poor countries to reduce debt distress.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-GDP_ratio#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

In 2013 [Herndon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Herndon "Thomas Herndon"), Ash, and [Pollin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Pollin "Robert Pollin") reviewed an influential, widely cited research paper entitled, "[Growth in a Time of Debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_in_a_Time_of_Debt "Growth in a Time of Debt")",<sup id="cite_ref-reuters18April2013_8-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-GDP_ratio#cite_note-reuters18April2013-8">[8]</a></sup> by two Harvard economists [Carmen Reinhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Reinhart "Carmen Reinhart") and [Kenneth Rogoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Rogoff "Kenneth Rogoff"). Herndon, Ash and Pollin argued that "coding errors, selective exclusion of available data, and unconventional weighting of summary statistics lead to serious errors that inaccurately represent the relationship between public debt and GDP growth among 20 advanced economies in the post-war period".<sup id="cite_ref-Herndonpublicd15april2013_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-GDP_ratio#cite_note-Herndonpublicd15april2013-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-blogmarketwatch2013_10-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-GDP_ratio#cite_note-blogmarketwatch2013-10">[10]</a></sup> Correcting these basic computational errors undermined the central claim of the book that too much debt causes recession.<sup id="cite_ref-Alexander01_11-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-GDP_ratio#cite_note-Alexander01-11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-GDP_ratio#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Rogoff and Reinhardt claimed that their fundamental conclusions were accurate, despite the errors.<sup id="cite_ref-FT16April2013_13-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-GDP_ratio#cite_note-FT16April2013-13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-GDP_ratio#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

There is a difference between external debt denominated in domestic currency, and external debt denominated in foreign currency. A nation can service external debt denominated in domestic currency by tax revenues, but to service foreign currency debt it has to convert tax revenues in the [foreign exchange market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market "Foreign exchange market") to foreign currency, which puts downward pressure on the value of its currency.
