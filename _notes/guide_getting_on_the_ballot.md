## [Guide] Getting on the Ballot

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/RunForIt/comments/lzu88/guide_getting_on_the_ballot/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunForIt/comments/lzu88/guide_getting_on_the_ballot/)

> Every year, you hear about how some candidate, somewhere, did not "file the paperwork correctly" to get on the ballot. Yes, it's a real shame that this happens, but the truth is, there has never been a guide like this to help anyone, ever. The only experts at this sort of thing work professionally for the Republican and Democratic parties. The advantage is that this process is way easier than it sounds, and that anyone who isn't able to do it probably shouldn't be leading our country anyway. Before you begin reading the step-by-step list, I have two disclaimers:
> 
> A.) Every state is different. You'll have to check with your Secretary of State to make sure that anything you read in here is true. Please, just double-check. If you discover that something in this guide is not true for your state, please let me know so I can include a disclaimer. If you are worried that contacting your SOS is too difficult, at least trying calling the secretary in the front of the office. The Elections Director in your state makes around $60,000 a year just to listen to your problems with the filing process; make them earn their wages!
> 
> B.) The people at your local Secretary of State's Office can also help you with this entire process! Although sirrealismo and I checked a lot of SOS websites to find information, a lot of the information we found was for the 2010/2011 election processes. The paperwork and filing deadlines *will* be different for the 2012 election. My state, for example, does not have the 2012 paperwork uploaded yet; we (the public) don't even know where our new ninth Congressional District will be! It seems that most of these sites are updated approximately 7 months before the actual election. (If you are reading this in the winter of 2011/2012, time is still very much on your side.)
> 
> **Step 1: Finding the right State paperwork**
> 
> For the most part, you can find the paperwork that you need on the Secretary of State website for your state.  Just go to google and type in "Georgia Secretary of State," or whatever state you live in. You may have to navigate to an "election services division" in some states. Many states have "applicant packets" that include all of the necessary paperwork in one place. This paperwork must be filed on time or you WILL NOT BE ON THE BALLOT. See the deadlines in step 4 to see exactly how rushed for time you should be (note, most deadlines are so far off that they haven't even been announced yet.)
> 
> I should also mention that the paperwork available online in my state, Arizona, is only for party candidates. Independent candidates (like me) have to either call and ask for the forms to be mailed, or visit the SOS office (or your state's election division) in person to get the files. I visited the SOS office in person, and they were *very eager* to help me get all of the right paperwork. They understood that running as an independent is hard, and wanted to help with that process.
> 
> *Statement of Origin*: If you plan to spend $500 (this figure varies by state) or more on your campaign, this file MUST be filed BEFORE you accept contributions, spend money, distribute any campaign literature, or circulate any petitions. This is generally filed with your state filing officer.
> 
> *Threshold Exemption Statement*: If you do not plan to spend $500 (varies by state) on your campaign, this file MUST be filed BEFORE you accept contributions, spend money, distribute any campaign literature, or circulate any petitions. This is generally filed with your state filing officer. If you wind up going over your $500 limit, you can always file a Statement of Origin.
> 
> *Nomination Paper*: This file states your name, actual residential address, political party, campaign office (if necessary), and the date of the election for which you wish to run.
> 
> *Affidavit of Qualification*: This file will be your official promise that you qualify, or will qualify at the time of the election, for the office you are seeking. 
> 
> *Campaign Finance Laws Statement*: This is a statement that says you have read all applicable laws to Campaign Finance. If you can't find this form, don't worry – only a few states require it. 
> 
> *Financial Disclosure Form*: Generally, candidates for Federal office are exempt from this form because you'll be filing it with the FEC. The paperwork for them is coming in step 1, part 2. If you are required to fill out this form, it usually requires you to record your financial information from the past 12 months.
> 
> *Statement of Recall*: This form says that you agree to resign if you are not re-elected in a [recall vote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_election).
> 
> *Candidate Nomination Petition*: This one is the doozy, and you'll have to spend a lot of time getting this one. Our next guide, "Ballot Access Laws" deals specifically with filing this particular piece of paperwork. Basically, you need to go collect anywhere between 800 and several thousand signatures from people in your district who say they would like to see you on the ballot. **Most signature requirements have not been updated for the 2012 election, but we will post them in the "Ballot Access Laws" guide as they become available.**
> 
> **Step 1, Part 2: Finding the right Federal Paperwork**
> 
> The Federal Paperwork mostly belongs to the FEC. I'm 99% sure that the FEC only wants to hear from you if you spend or raise over $5000 for your campaign. I will be checking with the [FEC](http://www.fec.gov/) shortly to determine how they are relevant to our particular situation, in that we will be sharing resources with each other for free. If you would like to navigate their [260 page guide](http://www.fec.gov/info/toolkit.shtml#candidate) for me, please, by all means, let me know what you find. You can also call them at 1-800-424-9530, which may be easier than navigating their official guide.
> 
> The other paperwork, which is also timportant, is the Financial Disclosure Statement to the [House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct](http://ethics.house.gov/). ~~You **must** get this papework by calling them at (202) 225-7103.~~ [Online PDFs Are Available Here](http://ethics.house.gov/forms/information-and-forms). The FEC also has a number, (800) 424-9530, which you can call for help in this matter. Again, this paperwork is only necessary *if you raise or spend more than $5,000*.
> 
> **Step 2: Downloading and printing the paperwork**
> 
> You need to be very careful about printing the paperwork. Many of the laws about the paperwork's specifications were written before the invention of the home printer, so they have very specific rules about how things should be printed.  (Paper size, margins, etc.) My state has 8.5x11 inch pdfs for papers that are required to be printed on 8.5x14 – it's insane, but that's "how they get you." If you can't find any information online, you may need to check with your SOS to determine if there are specific printing instructions for your state's paperwork. If you find anything out, let me know so I can add specific information about your state here.
> 
> **Step 3: Filling out the paperwork**
> 
> Be careful, several signatures on the paperwork must be signed in the presence of a notary. Read over everything very carefully so that you know what must be filled out in the presence of a notary. If you need help finding a notary, google "notary services" and you should find someone in your area who can help you (for a small fee.) If you do end up paying for your notary, keep the receipt so you can report the expense to the FEC! (That was a joke, the notary is probably not a reportable expense. Haha! Politics is funny, huh?)
> 
> **Step 4: Submitting the paperwork / Deadlines**
> 
> You should file all of your state paperwork with the Secretary of State for your state.
> 
> Deadlines will be posted here as they become available for the 2012 election. Currently, only a few states have finished filing deadlines for independent candidates. If you plan on running as part of a political party, filing deadlines are due VERY SOON for several states, especially Ohio. Check with your SOS and let me know!
> 
> **Step 5: Getting the "Petition" Part of your Paperwork Done.**
> 
> This one is so long that it has its own guide, which is the most important step for an aspiring politician. Our guide to ballot access laws is the largest, most comprehensive candidate's guide on the entire internet and in the entire world. We have [sirrealismo](http://www.reddit.com/user/sirrealismo) to thank for this.
> 
> If there are any additional pieces of paperwork for your state, please let me know so I can update this guide! Like all of my guides, this one will be updated as new information becomes available – but I need help finding that information!

	California has a filing fee of $1,740 for running for US congress, but you can get it waived by getting 3,000 valid signatures. The signatures may count towards nomination sponsor signature requirements.

	You also need 40 to 60 valid signatures for filing the nomination papers, which the in-lieu-filing-fee petitions can count towards.

	Full page regarding qualifications are here (pdf): http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/2012-elections/june-primary/pdf/congress-qualifications-2012.pdf
