This article is about instructions issued by the president of the United States. For other uses, see [Executive order (disambiguation)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(disambiguation) "Executive order (disambiguation)").

In the United States, an **executive order** is a [directive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_directive "Presidential directive") by the [president of the United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States") that manages operations of the [federal government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States "Federal government of the United States").<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> The legal or constitutional basis for executive orders has multiple sources. [Article Two of the United States Constitution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution "Article Two of the United States Constitution") gives presidents broad executive and enforcement authority to use their discretion to determine how to enforce the law or to otherwise manage the resources and staff of the executive branch. The ability to make such orders is also based on expressed or implied [Acts of Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Congress "Act of Congress") that delegate to the president some degree of discretionary power ([delegated legislation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegated_legislation "Delegated legislation")).<sup id="cite_ref-1957print_2-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-1957print-2">[2]</a></sup> The vast majority of executive orders are proposed by federal agencies before being issued by the president.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

Example from 2017

Like both legislative statutes and the regulations promulgated by government agencies, executive orders are subject to [judicial review](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_review "Judicial review") and may be overturned if the orders lack support by statute or the Constitution. Some policy initiatives require approval by the legislative branch, but executive orders have significant influence over the internal affairs of government, deciding how and to what degree legislation will be enforced, dealing with emergencies, waging wars, and in general fine-tuning policy choices in the implementation of broad statutes. As the head of state and head of government of the United States, as well as commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces, only the president of the United States can issue an executive order.

Presidential executive orders, once issued, remain in force until they are canceled, revoked, adjudicated unlawful, or expire on their terms. At any time, the president may revoke, modify or make exceptions from any executive order, whether the order was made by the current president or a predecessor. Typically, a new president reviews in-force executive orders in the first few weeks in office.

## Basis in the United States Constitution [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Executive_order&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Basis in the United States Constitution")

The [United States Constitution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution "United States Constitution") does not have a provision that explicitly permits the use of executive orders. [Article II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution "Article Two of the United States Constitution"), Section 1, [Clause 1](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Clause_3:_Electoral_College "Article Two of the United States Constitution") of the Constitution simply states: "The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America." Sections 2 and 3 describe the various powers and duties of the president, including "He shall take care that the Laws be faithfully executed".<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

The [U.S. Supreme Court](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Supreme_Court "U.S. Supreme Court") has held<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> that all executive orders from the president of the United States must be supported by the Constitution, whether from a clause granting specific power, or by Congress delegating such to the executive branch.<sup id="cite_ref-AntieauRich1997_6-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-AntieauRich1997-6">[6]</a></sup> Specifically, such orders must be rooted in [Article II of the US Constitution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution "Article Two of the United States Constitution") or enacted by the Congress in [statutes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutes "Statutes"). Attempts to block such orders have been successful at times, when such orders either exceeded the authority of the president or could be better handled through legislation.<sup id="cite_ref-Association1971_7-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-Association1971-7">[7]</a></sup>

The [Office of the Federal Register](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_Federal_Register "Office of the Federal Register") is responsible for assigning the executive order a sequential number, after receipt of the signed original from the White House and printing the text of the executive order in the daily _[Federal Register](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Register "Federal Register")_ and eventually in [Title 3 of the _Code of Federal Regulations_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_3_of_the_Code_of_Federal_Regulations "Title 3 of the Code of Federal Regulations").<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

## History and use [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Executive_order&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: History and use")

With the exception of [William Henry Harrison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Harrison "William Henry Harrison"), all presidents since [George Washington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington "George Washington") in 1789 have issued orders that in general terms can be described as executive orders. Initially, they took no set form and so they varied as to form and substance.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

The first executive order was issued by Washington on June 8, 1789; addressed to the heads of the federal departments, it instructed them "to impress \[him\] with a full, precise, and distinct general idea of the affairs of the United States" in their fields.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

According to political scientist Brian R. Dirck, the most famous executive order was by President [Abraham Lincoln](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln "Abraham Lincoln") when he issued the [Emancipation Proclamation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation "Emancipation Proclamation") on September 22, 1862, which in part contained explicit directions to the Army, the Navy, and other Executive departments:

> The Emancipation Proclamation was an executive order, itself a rather unusual thing in those days. Executive orders are simply presidential directives issued to agents of the executive department by its boss.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

Until the early 1900s, executive orders were mostly unannounced and undocumented, and seen only by the agencies to which they were directed.

That changed when the [US Department of State](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State "United States Department of State") instituted a [numbering scheme](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbering_scheme "Numbering scheme") in 1907, starting retroactively with United States Executive Order 1, issued on October 20, 1862, by President Lincoln.<sup id="cite_ref-PEO_12-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-PEO-12">[12]</a></sup> The documents that later came to be known as "executive orders" apparently gained their name from that order issued by Lincoln, which was captioned "Executive Order Establishing a Provisional Court in Louisiana".<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> That court functioned during the military occupation of [Louisiana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana "Louisiana") during the [American Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War"), and Lincoln also used Executive Order 1 to appoint [Charles A. Peabody](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_A._Peabody "Charles A. Peabody") as judge and designate the salaries of the court's officers.<sup id="cite_ref-PEO_12-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-PEO-12">[12]</a></sup>

President [Harry Truman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Truman "Harry Truman")'s Executive Order 10340 placed all the country's [steel mills](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_mill "Steel mill") under federal control, which was found invalid in _[Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youngstown_Sheet_%26_Tube_Co._v._Sawyer "Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer")_, 343 US 579 (1952), because it attempted to make law, rather than to clarify or to further a law put forth by the Congress or the Constitution. Presidents since that decision have generally been careful to cite the specific laws under which they act when they issue new executive orders; likewise, when presidents believe that their authority for issuing an executive order stems from within the powers outlined in the Constitution, the order instead simply proclaims "under the authority vested in me by the Constitution".

Wars have been fought upon executive order, including the 1999 [Kosovo War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_War "Kosovo War") during President [Bill Clinton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton "Bill Clinton")'s second term in office; however, all such wars have also had authorizing resolutions from Congress. The extent to which the president may exercise military power independently of Congress and the scope of the [War Powers Resolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution "War Powers Resolution") remain unresolved constitutional issues, but all presidents since the passage of the resolution have complied with its terms, while also maintaining that they are not constitutionally required to do so.

Harry S. Truman issued 907 executive orders, with 1,081 orders made by [Theodore Roosevelt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt "Theodore Roosevelt"), 1,203 orders made by [Calvin Coolidge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Coolidge "Calvin Coolidge"), and 1,803 orders made by [Woodrow Wilson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson "Woodrow Wilson"). [Franklin D. Roosevelt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt "Franklin D. Roosevelt") has the distinction of making a record 3,522 executive orders.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

In 2021, President Joseph Biden issued 42 executive orders in the first 100 days of his presidency, more than any other president since Harry Truman.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

### Franklin Roosevelt [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Executive_order&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Franklin Roosevelt")

Before 1932, uncontested executive orders had determined such issues as national mourning on the death of a president and the lowering of flags to half-staff.

President [Franklin Roosevelt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Roosevelt "Franklin Roosevelt") issued the first of his 3,522 executive orders on March 6, 1933, declaring a [bank holiday](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_holiday "Bank holiday"), and forbidding banks to release [gold coin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_coin "Gold coin") or [bullion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullion "Bullion"). [Executive Order 6102](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102 "Executive Order 6102") forbade the hoarding of gold coin, bullion and [gold certificates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_certificate_(United_States) "Gold certificate (United States)"). A further executive order required all newly mined domestic gold be delivered to the Treasury.<sup id="cite_ref-peters_16-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-peters-16">[16]</a></sup>

By Executive Order 6581, the president created the [Export-Import Bank of the United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export-Import_Bank_of_the_United_States "Export-Import Bank of the United States"). On March 7, 1934, he established the [National Recovery Review Board](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Recovery_Review_Board&action=edit&redlink=1 "National Recovery Review Board (page does not exist)") (Executive Order 6632). On June 29, the president issued Executive Order 6763 "under the authority vested in me by the Constitution", thereby creating the [National Labor Relations Board](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board "National Labor Relations Board").

In 1934, while [Charles Evans Hughes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Evans_Hughes "Charles Evans Hughes") was [Chief Justice of the United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States "Chief Justice of the United States") (the period being known as the [Hughes Court](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughes_Court "Hughes Court")), the Court found that the [National Industrial Recovery Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Industrial_Recovery_Act "National Industrial Recovery Act") (NIRA) was unconstitutional. The president then issued Executive Order 7073 "by virtue of the authority vested in me under the said [Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Relief_Appropriation_Act_of_1935 "Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935")", re-establishing the [National Emergency Council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Emergency_Council "National Emergency Council") to administer the functions of the NIRA in carrying out the provisions of the Emergency Relief Appropriations Act. On June 15, he issued Executive Order 7075, which terminated the NIRA and replaced it with the Office of Administration of the [National Recovery Administration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Recovery_Administration "National Recovery Administration").<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

In the years that followed, Roosevelt replaced outgoing justices of the Supreme Court with people more in line with his views: [Hugo Black](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Black "Hugo Black"), [Stanley Reed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Forman_Reed "Stanley Forman Reed"), [Felix Frankfurter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Frankfurter "Felix Frankfurter"), [William O. Douglas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_O._Douglas "William O. Douglas"), [Frank Murphy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Murphy "Frank Murphy"), [Robert H. Jackson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_H._Jackson "Robert H. Jackson") and [James F. Byrnes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_F._Byrnes "James F. Byrnes"). Historically, only George Washington has had equal or greater influence over Supreme Court appointments (as he chose all its original members).

Justices Frankfurter, Douglas, Black, and Jackson dramatically checked presidential power by invalidating the executive order at issue in _Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer_: in that case Roosevelt's successor, [Harry S. Truman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman "Harry S. Truman"), had ordered private steel production facilities seized in [Executive Order 10340](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_10340 "Executive Order 10340") to support the [Korean War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War "Korean War") effort: the Court held that the executive order was not within the power granted to the president by the Constitution.

## Table of U.S. presidents using executive orders [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Executive_order&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Table of U.S. presidents using executive orders")

## Reaction [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Executive_order&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Reaction")

Large policy changes with wide-ranging effects have been implemented by executive order, including the [racial integration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_integration "Racial integration") of the [armed forces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_the_United_States "Military of the United States") under President Truman.

Two extreme examples of an executive order are Franklin Roosevelt's [Executive Order 6102](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102 "Executive Order 6102") "forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States", and [Executive Order 9066](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_9066 "Executive Order 9066"), which delegated military authority to remove any or all people in a military zone (used to target [Japanese Americans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Americans "Japanese Americans"), non-citizen [Germans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans "Germans"), and non-citizen [Italians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italians "Italians") in certain regions). The order was then delegated to [General](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_(United_States) "General (United States)") [John L. DeWitt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_L._DeWitt "John L. DeWitt"), and it subsequently paved the way for all Japanese-Americans on the [West Coast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States "West Coast of the United States") to be sent to [internment camps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment "Internment") for the duration of [World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II").

President [George W. Bush](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush "George W. Bush") issued [Executive Order 13233](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13233 "Executive Order 13233") in 2001, which restricted public access to the papers of former presidents. The order was criticized by the [Society of American Archivists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_American_Archivists "Society of American Archivists") and other groups, who say it "violates both the spirit and letter of existing U.S. law on access to presidential papers as clearly laid down in 44 [USC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Code "United States Code") 2201–07", and adding that the order "potentially threatens to undermine one of the very foundations of our nation". President [Barack Obama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama "Barack Obama") subsequently revoked Executive Order 13233 in January 2009.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>

[The Heritage Foundation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heritage_Foundation "The Heritage Foundation") has accused presidents of abusing executive orders by using them to make laws without Congressional approval and moving existing laws away from their original mandates.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>

### Legal conflicts [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Executive_order&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Legal conflicts")

In 1935, the Supreme Court overturned five of Franklin Roosevelt's executive orders (6199, 6204, 6256, 6284 and 6855).

[Executive Order 12954](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Executive_Order_12954 "s:Executive Order 12954"), issued by President [Bill Clinton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton "Bill Clinton") in 1995, attempted to prevent the federal government from contracting with organizations that had [strike-breakers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikebreaker "Strikebreaker") on the payroll: a federal appeals court ruled that the order conflicted with the [National Labor Relations Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Act "National Labor Relations Act") and overturned the order.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

Congress has the power to overturn an executive order by passing legislation that invalidates it, and can also refuse to provide funding necessary to carry out certain policy measures contained with the order or legitimize policy mechanisms.

In the case of the former, the president retains the power to veto such a decision; however, Congress may override a veto with a two-thirds majority to end an executive order. It has been argued that a Congressional override of an executive order is a nearly impossible event, because of the [supermajority](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority "Supermajority") vote required, and the fact that such a vote leaves individual lawmakers vulnerable to political criticism.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>

On July 30, 2014, the [US House of Representatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_House_of_Representatives "US House of Representatives") approved a resolution authorizing [Speaker of the House](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives") [John Boehner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boehner "John Boehner") to sue President Obama over claims that he exceeded his executive authority in changing a key provision of the [Affordable Care Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Care_Act "Affordable Care Act") ("Obamacare") on his own<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> and over what Republicans claimed had been "inadequate enforcement of the health care law", which Republican lawmakers opposed. In particular, Republicans "objected that the [Obama administration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obama_administration "Obama administration") delayed some parts of the law, particularly the mandate on employers who do not provide health care coverage".<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> The suit was filed in the US District Court for the District of Columbia on November 21, 2014.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>

Part of President [Donald Trump](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump")'s executive order [Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13769 "Executive Order 13769"), which temporarily banned entry to the US of citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, including for permanent residents, [was stayed by a federal court](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_challenges_to_Executive_Order_13769#Darweesh_v._Trump "Legal challenges to Executive Order 13769") on January 28, 2017.<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> However, on June 26, 2018, the US Supreme Court overturned the lower court order in _[Trump v. Hawaii](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_v._Hawaii "Trump v. Hawaii")_ and affirmed that the executive order was within the president's constitutional authority.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>

The degree to which the president has the power to use executive orders to set policy for [independent federal agencies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_agencies_of_the_United_States_government "Independent agencies of the United States government") is disputed.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> Many orders specifically exempt independent agencies, but some do not.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> [Executive Order 12866](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_12866 "Executive Order 12866") has been a particular matter of controversy; it requires cost-benefit analysis for certain regulatory actions.<sup id="cite_ref-AdministrativeConference_31-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-AdministrativeConference-31">[31]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup>

## State executive orders [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Executive_order&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: State executive orders")

Executive orders issued by state [governors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States) "Governor (United States)") are not the same as statutes passed by state legislatures. State executive orders are usually based on existing constitutional or statutory powers of the governor and do not require any action by the state legislature to take effect.<sup id="cite_ref-https://www.colorado.governor/executive-orders_35-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-https://www.colorado.governor/executive-orders-35">[35]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-https://gov.georgia.gov/executive-orders_36-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-https://gov.georgia.gov/executive-orders-36">[36]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-https://www.governor.wa.gov/office-governor/official-actions/executive-orders_37-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-https://www.governor.wa.gov/office-governor/official-actions/executive-orders-37">[37]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-https://www.flgov.com/all-executive-orders_38-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-https://www.flgov.com/all-executive-orders-38">[38]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-https://rules.utah.gov/executive-documents_39-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-https://rules.utah.gov/executive-documents-39">[39]</a></sup>

Executive orders may, for example, demand budget cuts from [state government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_the_United_States "State governments of the United States") when the [state legislature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States) "State legislature (United States)") is not in session, and economic conditions take a [downturn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession "Recession"), thereby decreasing tax revenue below what was forecast when the budget was approved. Depending on the [state constitution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_constitution_(United_States) "State constitution (United States)"), a governor may specify by what percentage each [government agency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_agency "Government agency") must reduce and may exempt those that are already particularly underfunded or cannot put long-term expenses (such as [capital expenditures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditures "Capital expenditures")) off until a later [fiscal year](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year "Fiscal year"). The governor may also call the legislature into [special session](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_session "Special session").

There are also other uses for gubernatorial executive orders. In 2007, for example, [Sonny Perdue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Perdue "Sonny Perdue"), the governor of Georgia, issued an executive order for all [its state agencies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Georgia_(U.S._state) "Government of Georgia (U.S. state)") to reduce water use during a major [drought](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought "Drought"). The same was demanded of [its counties](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counties_in_Georgia "List of counties in Georgia")' water systems as well, but it was unclear whether the order would have the force of law.

## Presidential proclamation [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Executive_order&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Presidential proclamation")

According to political expert Phillip J. Cooper, a [presidential proclamation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_proclamation "Presidential proclamation") "states a condition, declares a law and requires obedience, recognizes an event or triggers the implementation of a law (by recognizing that the circumstances in law have been realized)".<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> Presidents define situations or conditions on situations that become legal or economic truth. Such orders carry the same force of law as executive orders, the difference between being that executive orders are aimed at those inside government, but proclamations are aimed at those outside government.

The administrative weight of those proclamations is upheld because they are often specifically authorized by congressional statute, making them "delegated unilateral powers". Presidential proclamations are often dismissed as a practical presidential tool for policy making because of the perception that proclamations are largely ceremonial or symbolic in nature. However, the legal weight of presidential proclamations suggests their importance to presidential governance.<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup>
