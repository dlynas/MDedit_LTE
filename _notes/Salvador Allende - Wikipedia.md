Allende's involvement in [Chilean politics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilean_politics "Chilean politics") spanned a period of nearly forty years, during which he held various positions including [senator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Chile "Senate of Chile"), [deputy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_of_Deputies_of_Chile "Chamber of Deputies of Chile"), and [cabinet minister](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_minister "Cabinet minister"). As a life-long committed member of the [Socialist Party of Chile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Party_of_Chile "Socialist Party of Chile"), whose foundation he had actively contributed to, he unsuccessfully ran for the national presidency in the [1952](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1952_Chilean_presidential_election "1952 Chilean presidential election"), [1958](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958_Chilean_presidential_election "1958 Chilean presidential election"), and [1964](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Chilean_presidential_election "1964 Chilean presidential election") elections. In [1970](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Chilean_presidential_election "1970 Chilean presidential election"), he won the presidency as the candidate of the [Popular Unity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Unity_(Chile) "Popular Unity (Chile)") coalition in a close three-way race. He was elected in a run-off by [Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_(Chile) "Congress (Chile)"), as no candidate had gained a majority. In office, Allende pursued a policy he called "[The Chilean Way to Socialism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chilean_Way_to_Socialism "The Chilean Way to Socialism")". The [coalition government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government "Coalition government") was far from unanimous. Allende said that he was committed to democracy and represented the more moderate faction of the Socialist Party, while the radical wing sought a more radical course. Instead, the [Communist Party of Chile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Chile "Communist Party of Chile") favored a gradual and cautious approach that sought cooperation with [Christian democrats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_democrats "Christian democrats"),<sup id="cite_ref-Cohen_1994,_pp._98–118_8-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Cohen_1994,_pp._98%E2%80%93118-8">[7]</a></sup> which proved influential for the [Italian Communist Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Communist_Party "Italian Communist Party") and the [Historic Compromise](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_Compromise "Historic Compromise").<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-13">[12]</a></sup>

As president, Allende sought to nationalize major industries, expand education, and improve the living standards of the working class. He clashed with the right-wing parties that controlled Congress and with the judiciary. On 11 September 1973, the military moved to oust Allende in [a coup d'état](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat "1973 Chilean coup d'état") supported by the [CIA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA "CIA"), which initially denied the allegations.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-14">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Winn_2010_15-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Winn_2010-15">[14]</a></sup> In 2000, the CIA admitted its role in the 1970 kidnapping of General [René Schneider](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Schneider "René Schneider") who had refused to use the army to stop Allende's inauguration.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-16">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-17">[16]</a></sup> Declassified documents released in 2023 showed that US president [Richard Nixon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon "Richard Nixon"), his national security advisor [Henry Kissinger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger "Henry Kissinger"), and the United States government, which had branded Allende as a dangerous communist,<sup id="cite_ref-Busky_2000,_pp._195–196_9-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Busky_2000,_pp._195%E2%80%93196-9">[8]</a></sup> were aware of the military's plans to overthrow Allende's democratically-elected government in the days before the coup d'état.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-18">[17]</a></sup>

As troops surrounded [La Moneda Palace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Moneda_Palace "La Moneda Palace"), Allende gave his last speech vowing not to resign.<sup id="cite_ref-en.wikisource.org_19-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-en.wikisource.org-19">[18]</a></sup> Later that day, [Allende died by suicide in his office](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allende_died_by_suicide_in_his_office "Allende died by suicide in his office");<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-20">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-21">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Allende2_22-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Allende2-22">[21]</a></sup> the exact circumstances of his death are still disputed.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-23">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-25">[B]</a></sup> Following Allende's death, General [Augusto Pinochet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet "Augusto Pinochet") refused to return authority to a civilian government, and Chile was later ruled by the [Government Junta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Junta_of_Chile_(1973) "Government Junta of Chile (1973)"), ending more than four decades of uninterrupted democratic governance, a period known as the [Presidential Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Republic_(1925%E2%80%931973) "Presidential Republic (1925–1973)"). The [military junta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_junta "Military junta") that took over dissolved Congress, suspended the [Constitution of 1925](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilean_Constitution_of_1925 "Chilean Constitution of 1925"), and initiated a program of persecuting alleged dissidents, in which at least 3,095 civilians disappeared or were killed.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-26">[24]</a></sup> [Pinochet's military dictatorship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship_of_Chile "Military dictatorship of Chile") only ended after the successful internationally-backed [1989 constitutional referendum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Chilean_constitutional_referendum "1989 Chilean constitutional referendum") led to the peaceful [Chilean transition to democracy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilean_transition_to_democracy "Chilean transition to democracy").

In 1938, Allende was in charge of the electoral campaign of the [Popular Front](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_(Chile) "Popular Front (Chile)") headed by [Pedro Aguirre Cerda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Aguirre_Cerda "Pedro Aguirre Cerda").<sup id="cite_ref-Guzman_30-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Guzman-30">[28]</a></sup> The Popular Front's slogan was "Bread, a Roof and Work!"<sup id="cite_ref-Guzman_30-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Guzman-30">[28]</a></sup> After its electoral victory, he became [Minister of Health](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Health_(Chile) "Minister of Health (Chile)") in the [Reformist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformist "Reformist") Popular Front government which was dominated by the [Radicals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Party_(Chile) "Radical Party (Chile)").<sup id="cite_ref-Guzman_30-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Guzman-30">[28]</a></sup> While serving in that position, Allende was responsible for the passage of a wide range of progressive social reforms, including safety laws protecting workers in the factories, higher pensions for widows, maternity care, and free lunch programmes for schoolchildren.<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-41">[39]</a></sup>

Upon entering the government, Allende relinquished his congressional seat for Valparaíso, which he had won in 1937. Around that time, he wrote _La Realidad Médico Social de Chile_ (_The social and medical reality of Chile_). After the [Kristallnacht](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht "Kristallnacht") in [Nazi Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany"), Allende was one of 76 members of the Congress who sent a [telegram](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram "Telegram") to [Adolf Hitler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler") denouncing the persecution of [Jews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Germany "History of the Jews in Germany").<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-42">[40]</a></sup> Following President Aguirre Cerda's death in 1941, he was again elected deputy while the Popular Front was renamed [Democratic Alliance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Alliance_(Chile) "Democratic Alliance (Chile)").

In 1945, Allende became senator for the [Valdivia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdivia_Province "Valdivia Province"), [Llanquihue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llanquihue_Province "Llanquihue Province"), [Chiloé](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilo%C3%A9_Province "Chiloé Province"), [Aisén](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ais%C3%A9n_Province "Aisén Province") and [Magallanes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magallanes_Province "Magallanes Province") provinces; then for [Tarapacá](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarapac%C3%A1_Region "Tarapacá Region") and [Antofagasta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antofagasta "Antofagasta") in 1953; for [Aconcagua](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aconcagua "Aconcagua") and [Valparaíso](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valpara%C3%ADso "Valparaíso") in 1961; and once more for Chiloé, Aisén and Magallanes in 1969. He became president of the [Chilean Senate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilean_Senate "Chilean Senate") in 1966. During the 50's Allende introduced legislation that established the Chilean national health service, the first program in the Americas to guarantee universal health care.<sup id="cite_ref-nih_43-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-nih-43">[41]</a></sup>

His three unsuccessful bids for the presidency (in the [1952](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1952_Chilean_presidential_election "1952 Chilean presidential election"), [1958](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958_Chilean_presidential_election "1958 Chilean presidential election") and [1964 elections](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Chilean_presidential_election "1964 Chilean presidential election")) prompted Allende to joke that his epitaph would be "Here lies the next President of Chile." In 1952, as candidate for the _[Frente de Acción Popular](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frente_de_Acci%C3%B3n_Popular "Frente de Acción Popular")_ (Popular Action Front, FRAP), he obtained only 5.4% of the votes, partly due to a division within socialist ranks over support for [Carlos Ibáñez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Ib%C3%A1%C3%B1ez "Carlos Ibáñez"). In 1958, again as the FRAP candidate, Allende obtained 28.5% of the vote. This time, his defeat was attributed to votes lost to the [populist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism "Populism") Antonio Zamorano.<sup id="cite_ref-Cura_44-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Cura-44">[42]</a></sup> This explanation has been questioned by modern research that suggest Zamorano's votes came from across the political spectrum.<sup id="cite_ref-Cura_44-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Cura-44">[42]</a></sup>

## Electoral system [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Salvador_Allende&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Electoral system")

Declassified documents show that from 1962 through 1964, the [CIA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA "CIA") spent a total of $2.6 million to finance the campaign of [Eduardo Frei](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Frei_Montalva "Eduardo Frei Montalva") and $3 million in anti-Allende propaganda "to scare voters away from Allende's FRAP coalition". The CIA considered its role in the victory of Frei a great success.<sup id="cite_ref-UsFrei_45-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-UsFrei-45">[43]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-1969congress_46-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-1969congress-46">[44]</a></sup>

They argued that "the financial and organizational assistance given to Frei, the effort to keep Durán in the race, the propaganda campaign to denigrate Allende—were 'indispensable ingredients of Frei's success'", and they thought that his chances of winning and the good progress of his campaign would have been doubtful without the covert support of the [Government of the United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_States "Government of the United States").<sup id="cite_ref-ciafrei_47-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-ciafrei-47">[45]</a></sup> Thus, in 1964 Allende lost once more as the FRAP candidate, polling 38.6% of the votes against 55.6% for [Christian Democrat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Democrat_Party_of_Chile "Christian Democrat Party of Chile") [Eduardo Frei](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Frei_Montalva "Eduardo Frei Montalva"). As it became clear that the election would be a race between Allende and Frei, the political [right](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics "Right-wing politics") – which initially had backed [Radical](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Democracy_(Chile) "Radical Democracy (Chile)") Julio Durán– settled for Frei as "the lesser evil".

Allende was considered part of the moderate wing of the Socialists, with support from the Communists who favored taking power via parliamentary democracy; in contrast, the left-wing of the [Socialists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Party_of_Chile "Socialist Party of Chile") (led by [Carlos Altamirano](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Altamirano "Carlos Altamirano")) and several other far-left parties called for violent insurrection. Some argue, however, that this was reversed at the end of his period in office.<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-48">[46]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-50">[C]</a></sup>

Allende won the 1970 Chilean presidential election as leader of the [Unidad Popular](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Unity_(Chile) "Popular Unity (Chile)") ("Popular Unity") coalition. On 4 September 1970, he obtained a narrow [plurality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_(voting) "Plurality (voting)") of 36.61% to 35.27% over [Jorge Alessandri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Alessandri "Jorge Alessandri"), a former president, with 27.8% going to a third candidate ([Radomiro Tomic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radomiro_Tomic "Radomiro Tomic")) of the [Christian Democratic Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Democratic_Party_of_Chile "Christian Democratic Party of Chile") (PDC). According to the Chilean Constitution of the time, if no presidential candidate obtained a majority of the popular vote, Congress would choose one of the two candidates with the highest number of votes as the winner. Tradition was for Congress to vote for the candidate with the highest popular vote, regardless of margin. Former president Jorge Alessandri had been elected in 1958 with a plurality of 31.56% over Allende's 28.85%.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTETutee2-3_51-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-FOOTNOTETutee2-3-51">[48]</a></sup>

One month after the election, on 20 October, while the Senate had still to reach a decision and negotiations were actively in place between the Christian Democrats and the Popular Unity, General [René Schneider](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Schneider "René Schneider"), Commander in Chief of the Chilean Army, was shot resisting a kidnap attempt by a group led by General [Roberto Viaux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Viaux "Roberto Viaux"). Hospitalized, he died of his wounds three days later, on 23 October.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTETutee3_-_4(till_line_viii)_52-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-FOOTNOTETutee3_-_4(till_line_viii)-52">[49]</a></sup> Schneider was a defender of the ["constitutionalist" doctrine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schneider_Doctrine "Schneider Doctrine") that the army's role is exclusively professional, its mission being to protect the country's sovereignty and not to interfere in politics.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTETutee6_53-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-FOOTNOTETutee6-53">[50]</a></sup>

General Schneider's death was widely disapproved of and, for the time, ended military opposition to Allende,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTETutee7_54-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-FOOTNOTETutee7-54">[51]</a></sup> whom the Congress finally chose on 24 October. On 26 October, President [Eduardo Frei](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Frei_Montalva "Eduardo Frei Montalva") named General [Carlos Prats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Prats "Carlos Prats") as commander in chief of the army to replace René Schneider.<sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-55">[52]</a></sup> Allende assumed the Presidency on 3 November 1970 after signing a _Statute of Constitutional Guarantees_ proposed by the Christian Democrats in return for their support in Congress.

### [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Salvador_Allende&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: "The Chilean Way to Socialism"")

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Salvador_Allende_2.jpg)

Allende in 1970

In his speech to the Chilean legislature following his election, Allende made clear his intention to move Chile from a capitalist to a socialist society:

> We are moving towards socialism, not from an academic love for a doctrinaire system, but encouraged by the strength of our people, who know that it is an inescapable demand if we are to overcome backwardness and who feel that a socialist regime is the only way available to modern nations who want to build rationally in freedom, independence and dignity. We are moving towards socialism because the people, through their vote, have freely rejected capitalism as a system which has resulted in a crudely unequal society, a society deformed by social injustice and degraded by the deterioration of the very foundations of human solidarity.<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-58">[55]</a></sup>

Upon assuming the presidency, Allende began to carry out his platform of implementing a [socialist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist "Socialist") programme called _[La vía chilena al socialismo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_v%C3%ADa_chilena_al_socialismo "La vía chilena al socialismo")_ ("the Chilean Path to Socialism"). That included [nationalization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalization "Nationalization") of large-scale industries (notably [copper mining](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_mining "Copper mining") and banking), and government administration of the health-care system, educational system (with the help of a United States educator, Jane A. Hobson-Gonzalez from [Kokomo, Indiana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokomo,_Indiana "Kokomo, Indiana")), a programme of free milk for children in the schools and in the shanty towns of Chile, and an expansion of the land seizure and redistribution already begun under his predecessor [Eduardo Frei Montalva](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Frei_Montalva "Eduardo Frei Montalva"),<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-59">[56]</a></sup> who had nationalized between one-fifth and one-quarter of all the properties listed for takeover.<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-60">[57]</a></sup> Allende also intended to improve the socio-economic welfare of Chile's poorest citizens;<sup id="cite_ref-The_Chilean_Revolution_61-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-The_Chilean_Revolution-61">[58]</a></sup> a key element was to provide employment, either in the new nationalized enterprises or on public-work projects.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Chilean_Revolution_61-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-The_Chilean_Revolution-61">[58]</a></sup>

In November 1970, 3,000 scholarships were allocated to [Mapuche](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapuche "Mapuche") children in an effort to integrate the indigenous minority into the educational system, payment of pensions and grants was resumed, an emergency plan providing for the construction of 120,000 residential buildings was launched, all part-time workers were granted rights to social security, a proposed electricity price-increase was withdrawn, diplomatic relations were restored with Cuba, and political prisoners were granted an amnesty. In December 1970, bread prices were fixed, 55,000 volunteers were sent to the south of the country to teach writing and reading skills and to provide medical attention to a sector of the population that had previously been ignored, a central commission was established to oversee a tri-partite payment plan in which equal place was given to government, employees and employers, and a protocol agreement was signed with the United Centre of Workers which granted workers representational rights on the funding board of the Social Planning Ministry.<sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-62">[59]</a></sup>

An obligatory minimum wage for workers of all ages (including apprentices) was established,<sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-63">[60]</a></sup> free milk was introduced for expectant and nursing mothers and for children between the ages of 7 and 14,<sup id="cite_ref-google13_64-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-google13-64">[61]</a></sup> free school-meals were established, rent reductions were carried out, and the construction of the [Santiago subway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_subway "Santiago subway") was rescheduled so as to serve working-class neighbourhoods first. Workers benefited from increases in social-security payments, an expanded public-works program, and a modification of the wage and salary adjustment mechanism (which had originally been introduced in the 1940s to cope with the country's chronic inflation), while middle-class Chileans benefited from the elimination of taxes on modest incomes and property.<sup id="cite_ref-google2_66-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-google2-66">[63]</a></sup> In addition, state-sponsored programs distributed free food to the country's neediest citizens,<sup id="cite_ref-google3_67-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-google3-67">[64]</a></sup> and in the countryside, peasant councils were established to mobilise agrarian workers and small proprietors. In the government's first budget (presented to the Chilean congress in November 1970), the minimum taxable income-level was raised, removing from the tax pool 35% of those who had paid taxes on earnings in the previous year. In addition, the exemption from general taxation was raised to a level equivalent to twice the minimum wage. Exemptions from capital taxes were also extended, which benefitted 330,000 small proprietors. The extra increases that Frei had promised to the armed forces were also fully paid. According to one estimate, [purchasing power](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power "Purchasing power") went up by 28% between October 1970 and July 1971.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_68-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-ReferenceA-68">[65]</a></sup>

### Minimum real wages and inflation [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Salvador_Allende&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Minimum real wages and inflation")

The rate of inflation fell from 36.1% in 1970 to 22.1% in 1971, while average [real wages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_wage "Real wage") rose by 22.3% during 1971.<sup id="cite_ref-69"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-69">[D]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-nber_70-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-nber-70">[66]</a></sup> Minimum real wages for [blue-collar workers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-collar_worker "Blue-collar worker") were increased by 56% during the first [quarter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_quarter "Financial quarter") of 1971, while in the same period real minimum wages for white-collar workers were increased by 23%, a development that decreased the differential ratio between blue- and white-collar workers' minimum wage from 49% (1970) to 35% (1971). Central government expenditures went up by 36% in real terms, raising the share of fiscal spending in GDP from 21% (1970) to 27% (1971), and as part of this expansion, the public sector engaged in a huge housing program, starting to build 76,000 houses in 1971, compared to 24,000 for 1970.<sup id="cite_ref-nber_70-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-nber-70">[66]</a></sup> During a 1971 emergency program, over 89,000 houses were built, and during Allende's three years as president an average of 52,000 houses were constructed annually.<sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-71">[67]</a></sup> Although the acceleration of inflation in 1972 and 1973 eroded part of the initial increase in wages, they still rose (on average) in real terms during the 1971–73 period.<sup id="cite_ref-google4_72-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-google4-72">[68]</a></sup> Additionally, Allende government had reduced inflation to 14% in the first nine months of 1971.<sup id="cite_ref-73"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-73">[69]</a></sup>

Allende's first step in early 1971 was to raise minimum wages (in real terms) for blue-collar workers by 37%–41% and by 8%–10% for white-collar workers. Education, food, and housing assistance expanded significantly, with public housing starts going up twelvefold and eligibility for free milk extended from age 6 to age 15. A year later, blue-collar wages were raised by 27% in real terms and white-collar wages became fully indexed.<sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-74">[70]</a></sup> Price controls were also set up, while the Allende Government introduced a system of distribution networks through various agencies (including local committees on supply and prices) to ensure that shopkeepers adhered to the new rules.<sup id="cite_ref-75"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-75">[71]</a></sup>

### Agrarian and literacy reforms [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Salvador_Allende&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Agrarian and literacy reforms")

The new Minister of Agriculture, [Jacques Chonchol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Chonchol "Jacques Chonchol"), promised to expropriate all estates which were larger than eighty "basic" hectares (about 200 acres). That promise was kept, with no farm in Chile exceeding that limit by the end of 1972.<sup id="cite_ref-historyofchile_76-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-historyofchile-76">[72]</a></sup> Within eighteen months the Latifundia (extensive agricultural estates) had been abolished. The [agrarian reform](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilean_land_reform "Chilean land reform") had involved the expropriation of 3,479 properties which, added to the 1,408 properties incorporated under the Frei government, made up some 40% of the total agricultural land area in the country.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_68-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-ReferenceA-68">[65]</a></sup>

Particularly in rural areas, the Allende government launched a campaign against illiteracy, while adult education programs expanded, together with educational opportunities for workers. From 1971 to 1973, enrolments in kindergarten, primary, secondary, and post-secondary schools all increased. The Allende government encouraged more doctors to begin practising in rural and low-income urban areas, and built additional hospitals, maternity clinics, and especially neighborhood health-centers that remained open for longer hours to serve the poor. Improved sanitation and housing facilities for low-income neighborhoods also equalized health-care benefits, while hospital councils and local health councils were established in neighborhood health-centers as a means of democratizing the administration of health policies. The councils gave central-government civil-servants, local-government officials, health-service employees, and community workers the right to review budgetary decisions.<sup id="cite_ref-google5_77-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-google5-77">[73]</a></sup>

The Allende government sought to bring the arts to the mass of the Chilean population by funding a number of cultural endeavours. With eighteen-year-olds and illiterates now granted the right to vote, mass participation in decision-making was encouraged by the Allende government, with traditional hierarchical structures now challenged by socialist egalitarianism. The Allende Government was able to draw upon the idealism of its supporters, with teams of "Allendistas" travelling into the countryside and shanty towns to perform volunteer work.<sup id="cite_ref-historyofchile_76-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-historyofchile-76">[72]</a></sup> The Allende government also worked to transform Chilean popular culture through formal changes to school curriculum and through broader cultural education initiatives, such as state-sponsored music festivals and tours of Chilean folklorists and [nueva canción](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nueva_canci%C3%B3n "Nueva canción") musicians.<sup id="cite_ref-78"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-78">[74]</a></sup> In 1971, the purchase of a private publishing house by the state gave rise to [Editorial Quimantu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editorial_Quimantu "Editorial Quimantu"), which became the center of the Allende Government's cultural activities. In the space of two years, 12 million copies of books, magazines, and documents (8 million of which were books) specializing in social analysis, were published. Cheap editions of great literary works were produced on a weekly basis, and in most cases were sold out within a day. Culture came into the reach of the masses for the first time, who responded enthusiastically. "Editorial Quimantu" encouraged the establishment of libraries in community organizations and trade unions. Through the supply of cheap textbooks, it enabled the Left to progress through the ideological content of the literature made available to workers.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_68-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-ReferenceA-68">[65]</a></sup>

To improve social and economic conditions for women, the Women's Secretariat was established in 1971, which took on issues such as public laundry facilities, public food programs, day-care centers, and women's health care (especially prenatal care).<sup id="cite_ref-google6_79-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-google6-79">[75]</a></sup> The duration of maternity leave was extended from 6 to 12 weeks,<sup id="cite_ref-google7_80-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-google7-80">[76]</a></sup> while the Allende Government steered the educational system towards poorer Chileans by expanding enrollments through government subsidies.<sup id="cite_ref-google8_81-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-google8-81">[77]</a></sup> A "democratisation" of university education was carried out, making the system tuition-free, which led to an 89% rise in university enrollments between 1970 and 1973.

### [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Salvador_Allende&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Social welfare initiatives")

Social spending was dramatically increased, particularly for housing, education, and health, and a major effort was made to redistribute wealth to poorer Chileans. As a result of new initiatives in nutrition and health, together with higher wages, many poorer Chileans were able to feed and clothe themselves better than ever before. Public access to the social security system was increased, and state benefits such as family allowances were raised significantly.<sup id="cite_ref-historyofchile_76-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-historyofchile-76">[72]</a></sup> The redistribution of income enabled wage and salary earners to increase their share of national income from 51.6% (the annual average between 1965 and 1970) to 65% while family consumption increased by 12.9% in the first year of the Allende Government. In addition, while the average annual increase in personal spending had been 4.8% in the period 1965–70, it reached 11.9% in 1971.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_68-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-ReferenceA-68">[65]</a></sup> During the first two years of Allende's presidency, state expenditure on health rose from around 2% to nearly 3.5% of GDP. According to [Jennifer E. Pribble](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Pribble "Jennifer Pribble"), the new spending "was reflected not only in public health campaigns, but also in the construction of health infrastructure".<sup id="cite_ref-google10_83-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-google10-83">[79]</a></sup> Small programs targeted at women were also experimented with, such as cooperative laundries and communal food preparation, together with an expansion of child-care facilities.<sup id="cite_ref-google11_84-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-google11-84">[80]</a></sup>

The National Supplementary Food Program was extended to all primary school pupils and to all pregnant women, regardless of their employment or income condition. Complementary nutritional schemes were applied to malnourished children, while antenatal care was emphasized.<sup id="cite_ref-google12_85-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-google12-85">[81]</a></sup> Under Allende, the proportion of children under the age of 6 with some form of malnutrition fell by 17%.<sup id="cite_ref-google13_64-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-google13-64">[61]</a></sup> Apart from the existing Supply and Prices councils (community-based bodies which controlled the distribution of essential groups in working-class districts, and were a popular, not government, initiative),<sup id="cite_ref-unu_86-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-unu-86">[82]</a></sup> community-based distribution centers and shops were developed, which sold directly in working-class neighborhoods. The Allende government felt obliged to increase its intervention in marketing activities, and state involvement in grocery distribution reached 33%.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_68-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-ReferenceA-68">[65]</a></sup> The CUT (central labor confederation) was accorded legal recognition,<sup id="cite_ref-87"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-87">[83]</a></sup> and its membership grew from 700,000 to almost 1 million. In enterprises in the Area of Social Ownership, an assembly of the workers elected half of the members of the management council for each company. Those bodies replaced the former board of directors.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_68-6"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-ReferenceA-68">[65]</a></sup>

Minimum pensions were increased by amounts equal to two or three times the inflation rate, and between 1970 and 1972, such pensions increased by a total of 550%. The incomes of 300,000 retirement pensioners were increased by the government from one-third of the minimum salary to the full amount. Labor insurance cover was extended to 200,000 market traders, 130,000 small shop proprietors, 30,000 small industrialists, small owners, transport workers, clergy, professional sportsmen, and artisans. The public health service was improved, with the establishment of a system of clinics in working-class neighborhoods on the peripheries of the major cities, providing a health center for every 40,000 inhabitants. Statistics for construction in general, and housebuilding in particular, reached some of the highest levels in the history of Chile. Four million square metres were completed in 1971–72, compared to an annual average of 2+1⁄2 million between 1965 and 1970. Workers were able to acquire goods which had previously been beyond their reach, such as heaters, refrigerators, and television sets. As further noted by Ricardo Israel Zipper, "By now meat was no longer a luxury, and the children of working people were adequately supplied with shoes and clothing. The popular living standards were improved in terms of the employment situation, social services, consumption levels, and income distribution."<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_68-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-ReferenceA-68">[65]</a></sup>

Chilean presidents were allowed a maximum term of six years, which may explain Allende's haste to restructure the economy. Not only was a major restructuring program organized (the [Vuskovic plan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vuskovic_plan "Vuskovic plan")), he also had to make it a success if a left-wing successor to Allende was going to be elected. In the first year of Allende's term, the short-term economic results of the economy minister [Pedro Vuskovic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Vuskovic "Pedro Vuskovic")'s expansive monetary policy were highly favorable: 12% industrial growth and an 8.6% increase in GDP, accompanied by major declines in inflation (down from 34.9% to 22.1%) and unemployment (down to 3.8%). By 1972, the [Chilean escudo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilean_escudo "Chilean escudo") had an inflation rate of 140%. The average real GDP contracted between 1971 and 1973 at an annual rate of a 5.6% negative growth, and the government's fiscal deficit soared while foreign reserves declined.<sup id="cite_ref-89"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-89">[85]</a></sup> Unemployment rates had dropped from 6.3% in 1970 to 3.5% in 1972 before dropping again in 1973 to the lowest ever recorded.<sup id="cite_ref-90"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-90">[86]</a></sup>

The combination of inflation and price controls, together with the disappearance of basic commodities from supermarket shelves, led to the rise of [black markets](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market "Black market") in rice, beans, sugar, and flour.<sup id="cite_ref-icarito-comienzan_91-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-icarito-comienzan-91">[87]</a></sup> The Chilean economic situation was also somewhat exacerbated due to a US-backed campaign to fund worker [strikes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action "Strike action") in certain sectors of the economy.<sup id="cite_ref-covert_92-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-covert-92">[88]</a></sup> The Allende government announced it would default on [debts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt "Debt") owed to international creditors and foreign governments. Allende also froze all prices while raising salaries. His implementation of the policies was strongly opposed by landowners, employers, businessmen and transporters associations, and some civil servants and professional unions. The rightist opposition was led by the [National Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Party_(Chile,_1966%E2%80%931973) "National Party (Chile, 1966–1973)"), the Roman Catholic Church (which in 1973 was displeased with the direction of educational policy),<sup id="cite_ref-93"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-93">[89]</a></sup> and eventually the [Christian Democrats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Democrat_Party_of_Chile "Christian Democrat Party of Chile"). There were growing tensions with foreign [multinational corporations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation "Multinational corporation") and the government of the United States.

Allende undertook the pioneeristic [Project Cybersyn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn "Project Cybersyn"), a distributed [decision support system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_support_system "Decision support system") for [decentralized economic planning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_planning_(economics) "Decentralized planning (economics)"), developed by British [cybernetics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics "Cybernetics") expert [Stafford Beer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Stafford_Beer "Anthony Stafford Beer"). Based on the [experimental viable system model](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model "Viable system model") and the [neural network](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network "Neural network") approach to organizational design, the Project consisted of four modules: a network of [telex](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telex "Telex") machines (_Cybernet_) in all state-run enterprises that would transmit and receive information with the government in [Santiago](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago "Santiago"). Information from the field would be fed into statistical modeling software (_Cyberstride_) that would monitor production indicators, such as raw material supplies or high rates of worker absenteeism, in "almost" real time, alerting the workers in the first case and, in abnormal situations, if those parameters fell outside acceptable ranges by a very large degree, also the central government. The information would also be input into an economic simulation software (_CHECO_, for _CHilean ECOnomic simulator_) which featured a [Bayesian filtering and control setting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_Bayesian_estimation "Recursive Bayesian estimation") that the government could use to forecast the possible outcome of economic decisions. Finally, a sophisticated operations room (_Opsroom_) would provide a space where managers could see relevant economic data, formulate feasible responses to emergencies, and transmit advice and directives to enterprises and factories in alarm situations by using the telex network.<sup id="cite_ref-94"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-94">[90]</a></sup> In conjunction with the system, the Cybersyn development team also planned the Cyberfolk device system, a closed television circuit connected to an interactive apparatus that would enable the citizenry to [actively participate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participative_democracy "Participative democracy") in economic and political decision-making.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Allende raised wages on a number of occasions throughout 1970 and 1971, but the wage hikes were negated by ongoing inflation of Chile's [fiat currency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_currency "Fiat currency"). Although price rises had been high even under Frei (27% a year between 1967 and 1970), a basic basket of consumer goods rose by 120% from 190 to 421 escudos in one month alone, August 1972. From 1970 to 1972, while Allende was in government, exports fell 24% and imports rose 26%, with imports of food rising an estimated 149%.<sup id="cite_ref-95"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-95">[91]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:CITESHORT" title="Wikipedia:CITESHORT"><span title="More information is required to link this short citation to its long citation.

### Foreign policy [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Salvador_Allende&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Foreign policy")

In 1971, Chile re-established diplomatic relations with Cuba, joining Mexico and Canada in rejecting a previously established [Organization of American States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_of_American_States "Organization of American States") convention prohibiting governments in the [Western Hemisphere](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hemisphere "Western Hemisphere") from establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba. Shortly afterward, Cuban president [Fidel Castro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro "Fidel Castro") made [a month-long visit to Chile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro%27s_state_visit_to_Chile "Fidel Castro's state visit to Chile"). Originally, the visit was supposed to be one week; however, Castro enjoyed Chile and one week led to another. Despite his attitude of socialist solidarity, Castro was reportedly critical of Allende's policies. Castro was quoted as saying that "Marxism is a revolution of production", whereas "Allende's was a revolution of consumption."<sup id="cite_ref-Rosentein-Rodan_99-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Rosentein-Rodan-99">[95]</a></sup>

### Socioeconomic and political tensions [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Salvador_Allende&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Socioeconomic and political tensions")

In October 1972, the first of what were to be a wave of strikes was led first by truckers, and later by small businessmen, some (mostly professional) unions and some student groups. Other than the inevitable damage to the economy, the chief effect of the 24-day strike was to induce Allende to bring the head of the army, general [Carlos Prats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Prats "Carlos Prats"), into the government as Interior Minister.<sup id="cite_ref-icarito-comienzan_91-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-icarito-comienzan-91">[87]</a></sup> Allende also instructed the government to commandeer trucks to keep the nation from coming to a halt. Government supporters also helped to mobilize trucks and buses, but violence served as a deterrent to full mobilization, even with police protection for the strike-breakers. Allende's actions were eventually declared unlawful by the Chilean appeals court and the government was ordered to return trucks to their owners.<sup id="cite_ref-100"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-100">[96]</a></sup> Throughout his presidency, racial tensions between the poor descendants of indigenous people, who supported Allende's reforms, and the white elite increased.<sup id="cite_ref-101"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-101">[97]</a></sup>

Throughout his presidency, Allende remained at odds with the Chilean Congress, which was dominated by the Christian Democratic Party. In 1964, Eduardo Frei had promised a "Revolution in Liberty", a middle-class revolution that was funded by the United States government's [Alliance for Progress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_for_Progress "Alliance for Progress").<sup id="cite_ref-102"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-102">[98]</a></sup> Frei carried out a series of progressive reforms, including [land reform](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_reform "Land reform"), an issue that had not been touched since Chile's independence in the early 19th century. According to historian Marian Schlotterbeck, this was "\[John F.\] Kennedy's vision — stave off the threat of communist revolution by improving standards of living across the continent".<sup id="cite_ref-103"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-103">[99]</a></sup> The Christian Democrats had campaigned on a socialist platform in the 1970 elections but drifted away from those positions during Allende's presidency, and accused Allende of leading Chile toward a Cuban-style dictatorship and sought to overturn many of his more radical policies. They eventually formed a coalition with the [National Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Party_(Chile,_1966) "National Party (Chile, 1966)").<sup id="cite_ref-104"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-104">[100]</a></sup>

Allende and his opponents in Congress repeatedly accused each other of undermining the Chilean Constitution and acting undemocratically. Allende's increasingly bold socialist policies (partly in response to pressure from some of the more radical members within his coalition), combined with his close contacts with Cuba, heightened fears in Washington. The Nixon administration continued exerting economic pressure on Chile via multilateral organizations and continued to back Allende's opponents in the Chilean Congress. Almost immediately after his election, Nixon directed [CIA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA "CIA") and [US State Department](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_State_Department "US State Department") officials to "put pressure" on the Allende government.<sup id="cite_ref-Still_105-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Still-105">[101]</a></sup> His economic policies were used by economists [Rudi Dornbusch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudi_Dornbusch "Rudi Dornbusch") and [Sebastián Edwards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebasti%C3%A1n_Edwards "Sebastián Edwards") to coin the term [macroeconomic populism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomic_populism "Macroeconomic populism").<sup id="cite_ref-106"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-106">[102]</a></sup> In 1972, Chile's inflation stood at 150%.<sup id="cite_ref-107"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-107">[103]</a></sup>

## Foreign relations during Allende's presidency [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Salvador_Allende&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Foreign relations during Allende's presidency")

Salvador Allende took office in a difficult international context. Chile was aligned with the [United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") in 1970. Elsewhere in Latin America, [Brazil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil "Brazil"), [Argentina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina "Argentina") and [Bolivia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia "Bolivia") were ruled by conservative military dictatorships (soon to be joined by [Uruguay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay "Uruguay")). [Colombia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia "Colombia") and [Venezuela](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela "Venezuela") also had conservative, but democratically elected, governments. Only [Cuba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba "Cuba"), [Peru](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru "Peru") and [Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico "Mexico") viewed the Chilean socialist experiment with sympathy. Under Allende's presidency, Chile joined the [Non-Aligned Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement "Non-Aligned Movement"), a position that was then almost unique in Latin America.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceB_108-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-ReferenceB-108">[104]</a></sup>

Chile, which until then had been fussy about ideological boundaries, diversified its diplomatic and trade relations, regardless of the internal political regime of each country. The government established diplomatic relations with two Latin American countries (Cuba and [Guyana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyana "Guyana")), seven African countries ([Congo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_the_Congo "Republic of the Congo"), [Equatorial Guinea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_Guinea "Equatorial Guinea"), [Libya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya "Libya"), [Madagascar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar "Madagascar"), [Nigeria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria "Nigeria"), [Tanzania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzania "Tanzania"), and [Zaire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaire "Zaire")), three European countries (Albania, East Germany and Hungary) and seven Asian countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, North Korea, China, Mongolia, South Vietnam and North Vietnam).<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceB_108-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-ReferenceB-108">[104]</a></sup>

It tried to promote Latin American integration. At the 1971 Latin American Economic and Social Council, the Chilean representative Gonzalo Martner García formulated four major proposals, summarized by the historian Jorge Magasich: "1) to ask the United States for a moratorium on external debt for a decade in order to allocate these sums to development policies; 2) to create a Latin American central bank to "invest Latin America's reserves, 70% of which are in the United States", to receive "the region's deposits and assets" and to coordinate the operations of the central banks in order to protect the region from financial turbulence; 3) Promote the creation of a global technology fund for development, fed by compulsory contributions of licenses, industrial processes and other funds for research, so as to limit the abuses associated with technological property; 4) Create a Latin American organisation for the development of science and technology appropriate to the region."<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceB_108-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-ReferenceB-108">[104]</a></sup>

He began negotiations with Bolivia over the historical dispute between the two countries (Bolivia had lost access to the sea since the [War of the Pacific](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Pacific "War of the Pacific") between 1879 and 1884) and welcomed Bolivia's maritime request. Nevertheless, relations became tense again following a coup d'état by Bolivian General [Hugo Banzer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Banzer "Hugo Banzer") in August 1971. At the same time, Chile granted asylum to thousands of political exiles from Latin American countries.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceB_108-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-ReferenceB-108">[104]</a></sup>

Salvador Allende openly rejected the influence of the [Organization of American States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_of_American_States "Organization of American States") (OAS), a body close to the United States government, and the [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Agreement_on_Tariffs_and_Trade "General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade") (GATT), which favored the interests of more developed countries. On the other hand, he was a fervent defender of the [United Nations Conference on Trade and Development](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Conference_on_Trade_and_Development "United Nations Conference on Trade and Development") (UNCTAD), which he considered to be more representative since it allowed economic and trade issues to be negotiated on an equal legal footing. In a speech to UNCTAD, he also warned of the policy of the United States, Japan and the [European Economic Community](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community "European Economic Community") to progressively eliminate obstacles to [free trade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade "Free trade"). He said that "freeing up trade ... erases at a stroke the benefits that the Generalised System of Preferences brings to developing countries".<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceB_108-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-ReferenceB-108">[104]</a></sup>

Allende's Popular Unity government tried to maintain normal relations with the United States. When Chile [nationalized its copper industry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilean_nationalization_of_copper "Chilean nationalization of copper"), the United States government cut off support and increased its support to the opposition. Forced to seek alternative sources of trade and finance, Chile gained commitments from the [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") to invest some $400 million in Chile in the next six years. The United States Departement of State put it at $115 million from Eastern Europe and $65 million from China, while Soviet and Chilean Popular Unity sources put it at total of $620 million from socialist countries. Much of the credit was never utilized, and the Soviets were not willing to subsidize Chile the same way they did for Cuba.<sup id="cite_ref-109"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-109">[105]</a></sup>

Allende's government was disappointed that it received far less economic assistance from the Soviets than it hoped for. Trade between the two countries did not significantly increase and the credits were mainly linked to the purchase of Soviet equipment. Moreover, credits from the Soviet Union were much less than those provided to the [People's Republic of China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China "People's Republic of China") and countries of the [Eastern Bloc](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc "Eastern Bloc").

### United States involvement [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Salvador_Allende&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: United States involvement")

The United States opposition to Allende started several years before he was elected President of Chile. Declassified documents show that from 1962 to 1964, the [CIA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA "CIA") spent $3 million on anti-Allende propaganda "to scare voters away from Allende's FRAP coalition" and spent a total of $2.6 million to finance the presidential campaign of [Eduardo Frei](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Frei_Montalva "Eduardo Frei Montalva").<sup id="cite_ref-UsFrei_45-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-UsFrei-45">[43]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-1969congress_46-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-1969congress-46">[44]</a></sup>

The possibility of Allende winning Chile's 1970 election was deemed a disaster by the [Nixon administration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_administration "Nixon administration") that wanted to protect American geopolitical interests by preventing the spread of Communism during the [Cold War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War").<sup id="cite_ref-111"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-111">[107]</a></sup> In September 1970, then United States president [Richard Nixon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon "Richard Nixon") informed the CIA that an Allende government in Chile would not be acceptable and authorized $10 million to stop Allende from coming to power or unseat him.<sup id="cite_ref-Hinchey_112-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Hinchey-112">[108]</a></sup> A CIA document declared, "It is firm and continuing policy that Allende be overthrown by a coup."<sup id="cite_ref-113"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-113">[109]</a></sup> [Henry Kissinger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger "Henry Kissinger")'s [40 Committee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/40_Committee "40 Committee") and the CIA planned to impede Allende's investiture as President of Chile with covert efforts known as "Track I" and "Track II"; Track I sought to prevent Allende from assuming power via so-called "parliamentary trickery", while under the Track II initiative, the CIA tried to convince key Chilean military officers to carry out a coup.<sup id="cite_ref-Hinchey_112-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Hinchey-112">[108]</a></sup>

Some point to the involvement of the [Defense Intelligence Agency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Intelligence_Agency "Defense Intelligence Agency") agents that allegedly secured the missiles used to bombard [La Moneda Palace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Moneda_Palace "La Moneda Palace").<sup id="cite_ref-114"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-114">[110]</a></sup> In fact, open US military aid to Chile continued during the Allende administration, and the national government was very much aware of that although there is no record that Allende himself believed that such assistance was anything but beneficial to Chile. During [Richard Nixon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon "Richard Nixon")'s presidency, United States officials attempted to prevent Allende's election by financing political parties aligned with opposition candidate [Jorge Alessandri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Alessandri "Jorge Alessandri") and supporting strikes in the mining and transportation sectors.<sup id="cite_ref-115"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-115">[111]</a></sup> After the 1970 election, the Track I operation attempted to incite Chile's outgoing president, [Eduardo Frei Montalva](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Frei_Montalva "Eduardo Frei Montalva"), to persuade his party ([PDC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Democracy_(Chile) "Christian Democracy (Chile)")) to vote in Congress for Alessandri.<sup id="cite_ref-ciaActivities_116-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-ciaActivities-116">[112]</a></sup>

Under the plan, Alessandri would resign his office immediately after assuming it and call new elections. Eduardo Frei would then be constitutionally able to run again (since the Chilean Constitution did not allow a president to hold two consecutive terms, but allowed multiple non-consecutive ones), and presumably easily defeat Allende. The Chilean [Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_of_Deputies_(Chile) "Chamber of Deputies (Chile)") instead chose Allende as president, on the condition that he would sign a "Statute of Constitutional Guarantees" affirming that he would respect and obey the [Chilean Constitution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilean_Constitution_of_1980 "Chilean Constitution of 1980") and that his reforms would not undermine any of its elements. Track II was aborted, as parallel initiatives already underway within the Chilean military rendered it moot.<sup id="cite_ref-117"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-117">[113]</a></sup> During the second term of office of [Democratic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States) "Democratic Party (United States)") President [Bill Clinton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton "Bill Clinton"), the CIA acknowledged having played a role in Chilean politics before the coup, but its degree of involvement is debated. The CIA was notified by its Chilean contacts of the impending coup two days in advance but contends it "played no direct role in" the coup.<sup id="cite_ref-118"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-118">[114]</a></sup>

Allende in 1972

Much of the internal opposition to Allende's policies came from the business sector, and recently released United States government documents confirm that the United States indirectly<sup id="cite_ref-covert_92-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-covert-92">[88]</a></sup> funded the truck drivers' strike,<sup id="cite_ref-119"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-119">[115]</a></sup> which exacerbated the already chaotic economic situation before the coup. The most prominent United States corporations in Chile before Allende's presidency were the [Anaconda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaconda_Copper "Anaconda Copper") and [Kennecott](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennecott_Utah_Copper "Kennecott Utah Copper") copper companies and [ITT Corporation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITT_Corporation "ITT Corporation"), International Telephone and Telegraph. Both copper corporations aimed to expand privatized copper production in the city of [Sewell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewell,_Chile "Sewell, Chile") in the Chilean [Andes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes "Andes"), where the world's largest underground copper mine "El Teniente", was located.<sup id="cite_ref-multinationals_120-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-multinationals-120">[116]</a></sup>

At the end of 1968, according to [United States Department of Commerce](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce "United States Department of Commerce") data, United States corporate holdings in Chile amounted to $964 million. Anaconda and Kennecott accounted for 28% of United States holdings, but ITT had by far the largest holding of any single corporation, with an investment of $200 million in Chile.<sup id="cite_ref-multinationals_120-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-multinationals-120">[116]</a></sup> In 1970, before Allende was elected, ITT owned 70% of Chitelco, the Chilean Telephone Company and funded [El Mercurio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Mercurio "El Mercurio"), a Chilean right-wing newspaper. Documents released in 2000 by the CIA confirmed that before the elections of 1970, ITT gave $700,000 to Allende's conservative opponent, Jorge Alessandri, with help from the CIA on how to channel the money safely. ITT president [Harold Geneen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Geneen "Harold Geneen") also offered $1 million to the CIA to help defeat Allende in the elections.<sup id="cite_ref-121"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-121">[117]</a></sup>

After General [Augusto Pinochet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet "Augusto Pinochet") assumed power, United States Secretary of State [Henry Kissinger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger "Henry Kissinger") told President Nixon that the United States "didn't do it" (referring to the coup) but "we helped them... created the conditions as great as possible".<sup id="cite_ref-122"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-122">[118]</a></sup> Recent documents declassified under the [Clinton administration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_administration "Clinton administration")'s Chile Declassification Project show that the United States government and the CIA sought to overthrow Allende in 1970 immediately before he took office ("[Project FUBELT](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_FUBELT "Project FUBELT")").

### Relations with the Soviet Union [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Salvador_Allende&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Relations with the Soviet Union")

Political and moral support came mostly through the Communist Party and unions of the Soviet Union. For instance, Allende received the [Lenin Peace Prize](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenin_Peace_Prize "Lenin Peace Prize") from the Soviet Union in 1972. At the same time, there were some fundamental differences between Allende and Soviet political analysts, who believed that some violence or measures that those analysts "theoretically considered to be just", should have been used.<sup id="cite_ref-Leonov_125-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Leonov-125">[121]</a></sup> Declarations from KGB General [Nikolai Leonov](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Leonov "Nikolai Leonov"), former Deputy Chief of the First Chief Directorate of the KGB, confirmed that the Soviet Union supported Allende's government economically, politically and militarily.<sup id="cite_ref-Leonov_125-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Leonov-125">[121]</a></sup> Leonov stated in an interview at the [Chilean Center of Public Studies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centro_de_Estudios_P%C3%BAblicos "Centro de Estudios Públicos") (CEP) that the Soviet economic support included over $100 million in credit, three fishing ships (that distributed 17,000 tons of frozen fish to the population), factories (as help after the 1971 earthquake), 3,100 tractors, 74,000 tons of wheat and more than a million tins of condensed milk.<sup id="cite_ref-Leonov_125-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Leonov-125">[121]</a></sup> In mid-1973, the Soviets approved the delivery of weapons (artillery and tanks) to the Chilean Army. When news of an attempt from the Army to depose Allende through a coup d'état reached Soviet officials, the shipment was redirected to another country.<sup id="cite_ref-Leonov_125-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Leonov-125">[121]</a></sup>

Allende is mentioned in a book written by the official historian of the British Intelligence [MI5](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI5 "MI5"), [Christopher Andrew](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Andrew_(historian) "Christopher Andrew (historian)").<sup id="cite_ref-126"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-126">[122]</a></sup> According to [SIS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service "Secret Intelligence Service") and Andrew, the book is based on the handwritten notes of KGB archivist defector [Vasili Mitrokhin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasili_Mitrokhin "Vasili Mitrokhin").<sup id="cite_ref-The_Sword_and_the_Shield_127-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-The_Sword_and_the_Shield-127">[123]</a></sup> Andrew alleged that the [KGB](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGB "KGB") said that Allende "was made to understand the necessity of reorganizing Chile's army and intelligence services, and of setting up a relationship between Chile's and the USSR's intelligence services."<sup id="cite_ref-Allende_128-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Allende-128">[124]</a></sup> The Soviets observed closely whether the alternative form of socialism could work, and they did not interfere with the Chileans' decisions. [Nikolai Leonov](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Leonov "Nikolai Leonov") affirmed that whenever he tried to give advice to Latin American leaders, he was usually turned down by them, and he was told that they had their own understanding on how to conduct political business in their countries. Leonov added that the relationships of KGB agents with Latin American leaders did not involve intelligence because their intelligence target was the United States. Since many North Americans were living in the region, the Soviets were focusing in recruiting agents from the United States. Latin America was also a better region for KGB agents to get in touch with their informants from the CIA or other contacts from the United States than inside that country.<sup id="cite_ref-Leonov_125-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Leonov-125">[121]</a></sup>

## Crisis [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Salvador_Allende&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Crisis")

On 29 June 1973, Colonel [Roberto Souper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Souper "Roberto Souper") surrounded the presidential palace, [La Moneda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Moneda_Palace "La Moneda Palace"), with his tank regiment but failed to depose the government.<sup id="cite_ref-129"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-129">[125]</a></sup> That failed coup d'état – known as the _[Tanquetazo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanquetazo "Tanquetazo")_ ("tank putsch") – organised by the nationalist _[Patria y Libertad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patria_y_Libertad "Patria y Libertad")_ paramilitary group, was followed by a general strike at the end of July that included the copper miners of El Teniente.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (November 2019)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

In August 1973, a [constitutional crisis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_crisis "Constitutional crisis") occurred, and the [Supreme Court of Chile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Chile "Supreme Court of Chile") publicly complained about the inability of the Allende government to enforce the law of the land. On 22 August, the Chamber of Deputies (with the Christian Democrats uniting with the National Party) accused the government of unconstitutional acts through Allende's refusal to promulgate constitutional amendments, already approved by the Chamber, which would have prevented his government from continuing his massive [nationalization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalization "Nationalization") plan<sup id="cite_ref-geomundos_130-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-geomundos-130">[126]</a></sup> and called upon the military to enforce constitutional order.<sup id="cite_ref-Se_desata_la_crisis_131-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Se_desata_la_crisis-131">[127]</a></sup>

For months, Allende had feared calling upon the _[Carabineros](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carabineros_de_Chile "Carabineros de Chile")_ ("Carabineers", the national police force), suspecting them of disloyalty to his government. On 9 August, President Allende appointed General [Carlos Prats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Prats "Carlos Prats") as [Minister of Defence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_National_Defense_(Chile) "Ministry of National Defense (Chile)"). On 24 August 1973, General Prats was forced to resign both as defense minister and as the [commander-in-chief of the army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilean_Army "Chilean Army"), embarrassed by both the [Alejandrina Cox incident](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandrina_Cox_incident "Alejandrina Cox incident") and a public protest in front of his house by the wives of his generals. General [Augusto Pinochet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet "Augusto Pinochet") replaced him as Army commander-in-chief the same day.<sup id="cite_ref-Se_desata_la_crisis_131-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Se_desata_la_crisis-131">[127]</a></sup>

### Resolution by the Chamber of Deputies [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Salvador_Allende&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Resolution by the Chamber of Deputies")

On 22 August 1973, the Christian Democrats and the National Party members of the Chamber of Deputies joined to vote 81 to 47 in favor of a resolution that made accusation of disregard by the government of the separation of powers and arrogating legislative and judicial prerogatives to the executive branch of government, among other alleged constitutional violations.<sup id="cite_ref-132"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-132">[128]</a></sup> The resolution asked the authorities to "put an immediate end" to "breach\[es of\] the Constitution ... with the goal of redirecting government activity toward the path of law and ensuring the Constitutional order of our Nation, and the essential underpinnings of democratic co-existence among Chileans."<sup id="cite_ref-Chamber_of_Deputies'_resolution_133-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Chamber_of_Deputies'_resolution-133">[129]</a></sup> The resolution declared that Allende's government sought "to conquer absolute power with the obvious purpose of subjecting all citizens to the strictest political and economic control by the state ... \[with\] the goal of establishing ... a totalitarian system" and claimed that the government had made "violations of the Constitution ... a permanent system of conduct".<sup id="cite_ref-Chamber_of_Deputies'_resolution_133-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Chamber_of_Deputies'_resolution-133">[129]</a></sup>

Specifically, the government of Allende was accused of [ruling by decree](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruling_by_decree "Ruling by decree") and thwarting the normal legislative system; refusing to enforce judicial decisions against its partisans; not carrying out sentences and judicial resolutions that contravened its objectives; ignoring the decrees of the independent General Comptroller's Office; sundry media offenses, including usurping control of the National Television Network and applying economic pressure against those media organizations that were not unconditional supporters of the government; allowing its supporters to assemble with arms, and preventing the same by its right-wing opponents; supporting more than 1,500 illegal takeovers of farms; illegal repression of the [El Teniente](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Teniente "El Teniente") miners' strike; and illegally limiting emigration.<sup id="cite_ref-Chamber_of_Deputies'_resolution_133-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Chamber_of_Deputies'_resolution-133">[129]</a></sup> Finally, the resolution condemned the creation and development of government-protected socialist armed groups, which were said to be "headed towards a confrontation with the armed forces". President Allende's efforts to re-organize the military and the police forces were characterized as "notorious attempts to use the armed and police forces for partisan ends, destroy their institutional hierarchy, and politically infiltrate their ranks".<sup id="cite_ref-Chamber_of_Deputies'_resolution_133-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Chamber_of_Deputies'_resolution-133">[129]</a></sup>

### Allende's response [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Salvador_Allende&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Allende's response")

The resolution was later used by Pinochet a way to justify the coup, which occurred two weeks later.<sup id="cite_ref-134"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-134">[130]</a></sup> On 24 August 1973, two days after the resolution, Allende responded. He accused the opposition of trying to incite a military coup by encouraging the armed forces to disobey civilian authorities.<sup id="cite_ref-135"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-135">[131]</a></sup> He described the Congress's declaration as "destined to damage the country's prestige abroad and create internal confusion", and predicted: "It will facilitate the seditious intention of certain sectors." He observed that the declaration (passed 81–47 in the Chamber of Deputies) had not obtained the two-thirds Senate majority "constitutionally required" to convict the president of [abuse of power](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_of_power "Abuse of power"), thus the Congress was "invoking the intervention of the armed forces and of Order against a democratically-elected government" and "subordinat\[ing\] political representation of national sovereignty to the armed institutions, which neither can nor ought to assume either political functions or the representation of the popular will."<sup id="cite_ref-La_respuesta_del_Presidente_Allende_136-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-La_respuesta_del_Presidente_Allende-136">[132]</a></sup>

Allende argued that he had obeyed constitutional means for including military men to the cabinet at the service of civic peace and national security, defending republican institutions against insurrection and terrorism. In contrast, he said that Congress was promoting a coup d’état or a civil war with a declaration full of affirmations that had already been refuted beforehand and which in substance and process (directly handing it to the ministers rather than directly handing it to the president) violated a dozen articles of the then-current constitution. He further argued that the legislature was usurping the government's executive function.<sup id="cite_ref-La_respuesta_del_Presidente_Allende_136-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-La_respuesta_del_Presidente_Allende-136">[132]</a></sup>

Allende wrote: "Chilean democracy is a conquest by all of the people. It is neither the work nor the gift of the exploiting classes, and it will be defended by those who, with sacrifices accumulated over generations, have imposed it ... With a tranquil conscience ... I sustain that never before has Chile had a more democratic government than that over which I have the honor to preside ... I solemnly reiterate my decision to develop democracy and a state of law to their ultimate consequences...Congress has made itself a bastion against the transformations ... and has done everything it can to perturb the functioning of the finances and of the institutions, sterilizing all creative initiatives." Adding that economic and political means would be needed to relieve the country's current crisis, and that the Congress was obstructing said means; having already paralyzed the state, they sought to destroy it. He concluded by calling upon the workers and all democrats and patriots to join him in defending the Chilean constitution and the revolutionary process.<sup id="cite_ref-La_respuesta_del_Presidente_Allende_136-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-La_respuesta_del_Presidente_Allende-136">[132]</a></sup>

## Coup [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Salvador_Allende&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Coup")

He stated that his commitment to Chile did not allow him to take an easy way out, and he would not be used as a propaganda tool by those he called "traitors" (he refused an offer of safe passage).<sup id="cite_ref-147"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-147">[142]</a></sup> Juan Seoane, Chief of President Allende's Bodyguard at the time of the events –and who was with Allende until moments before his death– declared in an interview reported by the [University of Chile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chile "University of Chile"):<sup id="cite_ref-148"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-148">[143]</a></sup>

> "Allende began to say goodbye to us one by one, he gave us a hug and told us ‘_Thank you for everything, comrade, thank you for everything_'”, and then he said that he was going to leave last. He walked to the end of the line with his AK, turned around behind a wall, and then he shouted, '_Allende doesn't surrender_…!'. The shot was heard as fifteen meters from where we were". (Reports in [El Tiempo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Tiempo_(Colombia) "El Tiempo (Colombia)") and other Latin-American media confirmed Allende´s last words).<sup id="cite_ref-149"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-149">[144]</a></sup>

Shortly afterwards, the coup plotters announced that Allende had committed suicide. An official announcement declared that the weapon he had used was an automatic rifle. Before his death he had been photographed several times holding an [AK-47](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AK-47 "AK-47"), a gift from [Fidel Castro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro "Fidel Castro").<sup id="cite_ref-150"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-150">[145]</a></sup> He was found dead with that gun, according to contemporaneous statements made by officials in the Pinochet regime. In an interview with [David Frost](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Frost "David Frost"), Allende's first cousin, [Isabel Allende](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Allende "Isabel Allende"), said that, at a family lunch nine days before his death, Allende had said that he would either stay till the end of this term of presidency or he would be taken out feet first.<sup id="cite_ref-151"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-151">[146]</a></sup> Lingering doubts regarding the manner of Allende's death persisted throughout the period of the [Pinochet regime](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinochet_regime "Pinochet regime"). Many Chileans and independent observers refused to accept on faith the government's version of events amid speculation that Allende had been murdered by government agents. Pinochet had long left power and died when in 2011 a Chilean court opened a criminal investigation into the circumstances of Allende's death.<sup id="cite_ref-152"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-152">[147]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-153"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-153">[148]</a></sup>

> British ballistics expert David Prayer said Allende died of two shots fired from an assault rifle that was held between his legs and under his chin and was set to fire automatically. The bullets blew out the top of his head and killed him instantly. The forensics team's conclusion was unanimous. Spanish expert Francisco Etxeberria said: "We have absolutely no doubt" that Allende committed suicide.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Guardian_154-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-The_Guardian-154">[149]</a></sup>

[Isabel Allende Bussi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Allende_Bussi "Isabel Allende Bussi"), the daughter of Allende and a member of the [Senate of Chile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Chile "Senate of Chile") told the BBC that: "The report conclusions are consistent with what we already believed.

Public acceptance of the suicide theory had already been growing for much of the previous decade. In a post-junta Chile where restrictions on free speech were steadily eroding, independent and seemingly reliable witnesses began to tell their stories to the news media and to human rights researchers. The cumulative weight of the facts reported by those witnesses provided enough support for many previously unconfirmed details relating to Allende's death.<sup id="cite_ref-Gonzalez_159-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Gonzalez-159">[154]</a></sup>

Memorials to Allende include a statue in front of the [Palacio de la Moneda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palacio_de_la_Moneda "Palacio de la Moneda"). The placement of the statue was controversial; it was placed facing the eastern edge of the [Plaza de la Ciudadanía](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza_de_la_Ciudadan%C3%ADa "Plaza de la Ciudadanía"), a plaza which contains memorials to a number of [Chilean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilean_people "Chilean people") statesmen. However, the statue is not located in the plaza, but rather on a surrounding sidewalk facing an entrance to the plaza. His tomb is a major tourist attraction. Allende is buried in the [general cemetery of Santiago](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_General_Cemetery "Santiago General Cemetery").<sup id="cite_ref-161"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-161">[156]</a></sup>

November 1973 <sup id="cite_ref-174"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-174">[169]</a></sup>[USSR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USSR "USSR") postage stamp. Probably the first Allende stamp, released after the coup.

One of the first [postage stamps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postage_stamp "Postage stamp") to commemorate Salvador Allende, released after the [1973 coup in Chile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_coup_in_Chile "1973 coup in Chile"), was the [Soviet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") one. It was issued just two months after the event and had a circulation of 3.8 million. The issue was designed by the painter A. Kovrizhkin and bore the title "Salvador Allende, President of the Republic of Chile, Laureate of the Lenin Peace Prize, 1908 - 11.IX.1973".<sup id="cite_ref-175"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-175">[170]</a></sup>

A stamp was released by [Magyar Posta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magyar_Posta "Magyar Posta") in [Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary "Hungary") in 1974 shortly after the September 11, [1973 coup in Chile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_coup_in_Chile "1973 coup in Chile") that ended the socialist government of Salvador Allende. The stamp bore an image of Allende that had become popular during his election campaign in 1970.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Two other stamps, both on the tenth anniversary of the coup, represent extreme reactions to the event. [Scott](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_catalogue "Scott catalogue") [Cuba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba "Cuba") #2605 shows the burning presidential palace of [La Moneda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Moneda "La Moneda") ("The Mint") and a picture of Allende.

In contrast, [Chile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile "Chile"), still under the military dictatorship of General [Augusto Pinochet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet "Augusto Pinochet") at that time, issued Scott [Chile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile "Chile") #656, labeled "Ten Years of Liberty," celebrating the decade since the fall of Allende and the rise of the _junta_.<sup id="cite_ref-Child05_176-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-Child05-176">[171]</a></sup>

## Public perception [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Salvador_Allende&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Public perception")

Allende is seen as a significant historical figure in Chile. The former [social-democratic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social-democratic "Social-democratic") president [Ricardo Lagos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo_Lagos "Ricardo Lagos") honored Allende as a humanist and a statesman.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_160-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende#cite_note-:0-160">[155]</a></sup>

In the run-up to the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States this month, a leading Chilean university, the University of Concepción, held a series of panel discussions on their legacy. The program referred to the events as 'the other Sept. 11.'  
    'Other' because, in Chile, Sept. 11 is best known as the date of the country's own national tragedy: the 1973 U.S.-backed coup against leftist President Salvador Allende that ushered in over 16 years of military rule.
