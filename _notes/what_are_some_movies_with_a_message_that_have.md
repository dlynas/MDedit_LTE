## What are some movies with a message that have been commonly misinterpreted?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/pcfd95/what_are_some_movies_with_a_message_that_have/](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/pcfd95/what_are_some_movies_with_a_message_that_have/)

> Someone recently posted about American Sniper and it got me thinking about the message of that movie and how so many people see it as a pro war movie when its actually very anti-war and probably one of the best anti-war films ever made. 
> 
> Fight Club is also another film where the intended message of anti-capitalism has seemingly been lost and actually people have taken the opposite meaning from it.
> 
> What are some other films that had important messages but have been misunderstood, misinterpreted or had the message manipulated?

	Whether a film is pro or anti-war can be very subjective. Some people tend to think that just because a film shows the horrors of war and struggles of a soldier it's "anti-war," but it could be argued that gritty realism is part of a modern militaristic fantasy. The lonely warrior who feels lost in the regular world but at home on the battlefield is a fairly common trope in war films these days, and I'd say that archetype can be considered a pro-war heroic figure that attracts certain types of people to the military.

		This is how I feel about the film. It feels like a "when the world is in danger, only one man can save it" type of movie but for a man in the US military. 
		
		It is a well made film, but the whole movie sort of feels like a person holding up a sign saying "Support Our Troops" instead of working to help the troops. Does that make sense?

			The movie even goes out of its way to show that the main character joined the military out of a sense of responsibility or whatever. The hardships he faecs as a result are burdens he chose to bear, and we're supposed to respect him for it.

				Yup, which is why I'm glad the movie doesn't make an overt character moral judgement of him. 
				
				The real problem is the system that allows Belford to do what he does, get away with it, and then once he's caught gives him a slap on the wrist and lets him go free. 
				
				I think the most important line of the whole movie is (paraphrased): "In my blind panic I forgot the most important thing: I'm rich."

			I think that what made finance bros misinterpret the film is the real Jordan Belfort, who saw his chance and took it, i.e. keeps talking shit on the internet about the film and just talking about only the good things about himself and his life.

				*WARNING, SPOILER* I was thinking about the final scene, where many people misinterpreted the flyover shot as Travis’ soul leaving his dead body, leading them to believe that the final scene was a dream sequence. Scorsese actually said that was not the intention, which is funny because he likes to see it that way, but the viewers don’t give a damn what the filmmaker thinks. A very ambiguous scene.

			> Goodfellas
			
			Personal opinion here but I think the movie boils down the [last three minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MedC8kTa9XY) with Henry Hill watching his wise-guy life disappear due to his own self destruction with drugs. "The hardest thing for me was leaving the life...we had it all just for the asking. Today everything is different, there's no action. I need to wait around like everyone else. I'm an average nobody, I get to live the rest of my life like a shnook."

			* 🟦 **[ajclin01](https://www.reddit.com/user/ajclin01)** ⬆️ 17 _(2021-08-27 11:07:50)_

				It’s all very glamorized early on with the Copa scene and the giant wedding and whatnot. Tommy making Spider “dance” during the poker game is about when you’re reminded that these are, in fact, not good people

		* 🟧 **[jack3moto](https://www.reddit.com/user/jack3moto)** ⬆️ 3 _(2021-08-27 16:21:26)_

			But goodfellas literally solves this problem…. The first half of the movie is all the good. The second half of the movie is all the bad.  Once it peaks it’s all downhill and shows how shitty the life is.  The reason you finish the movie with Henry hill being paranoid of the helipcopter and wondering like wtf is this movie doing after being so captivating in the first half is literally Scorsese bringing it back to reality. The final 15-20 min leaves a major sour taste in your mouth, making you wonder if the movie was actually great? And that’s the genius of it.

		It has the same issues that anti war movies. Reading “War is a Force That Gives Us Meaning” highlights a lot of the issues with talking about it. The author relates to heroin addiction, yes what it does to you is horrible but it has such amazing highs that people don’t want to give it up. When they’re high they forget everything the addiction has taken from them. War gives you a sense of purpose and meaning like nothing else, but it will also take everything from you.

	Every Punisher movie ever that has been received as a revenge fantasy. Maybe though the movies and the TV show failed to convey how to properly interpret Frank Castle.

		The point of Punisher War Zone is that anyone doing parkour ***must*** be blasted with a bazooka.

	* 🟨 **[GentlemanBrawlr](https://www.reddit.com/user/GentlemanBrawlr)** ⬆️ 19 _(2021-08-27 09:02:07)_

		I mean, Frank Castle swings WILDLY based on who's writing him. &amp; the run that's most memorable to me (Welcome Back Frank, by Garth Ennis) really does feel like revenge fantasy (Garth Ennis very much tends toward that) - it even leans into the "I know what I'm doing is fucked up, so I'm not gonna let anyone else be fucked up like me," aspect of it when he takes down the copycat vigilantes he inspired.

		* 🟧 **[PunyParker826](https://www.reddit.com/user/PunyParker826)** ⬆️ 9 _(2021-08-27 12:03:38)_

			Ennis's later series, MAX, goes even further and implies that Frank is deeply disturbed, and always had dark urges, but the death of his wife and child was the "excuse" he needed to really let the beast out. That's why his war is on **"CRIME"**, which is such a broad, unapproachable concept, and not something smaller, like simply avenging their deaths. He *knows* he'll never be done, and deep down he likes that.
			
			It's led to some interesting stories, ones that aren't necessarily bound by Frank's war by itself. The Punisher's less of a character and more of a big, blunt object, one that people in a lot of diverse scenarios react to differently. "We have this straightforward, grounded conflict - let's drop a big monkey wrench (Frank) into it and see what happens."

			* 🟦 **[GentlemanBrawlr](https://www.reddit.com/user/GentlemanBrawlr)** ⬆️ 5 _(2021-08-27 13:05:28)_

				agreed on both Punisher Max &amp; Marvel writers using The Punisher more as a plot device than a character (Notable exception for Frank's appearance in Civil War &amp; the way he interacts with Captain America. That was SO GOOD) - which goes back to:
				 
				Frank Castle/The Punisher as a character is basically: "What if the person gets revenge &amp; just decides 'I'm still mad, so i'm just gonna keep killing people until I'm not mad anymore. i'll just make sure they're 'bad guys' so it's okay.'?"

			* 🟦 **[Blackcrow521](https://www.reddit.com/user/Blackcrow521)** ⬆️ 4 _(2021-08-27 18:37:47)_

				I love the Punisher MAX for the same reason I love the original Halloween. It's about an entity that is absolute. Michael Myers is a being that is absolutely evil and kills just because. Frank Castle in that run is the absolute necessary evil. And if anyone strays towards moral ambiguity they are punished for it. He is absolutely evil and malicious. The scene that always fucks me up whenever I think of that run is when he throws the woman at the impact proof glass over and over and over because she was involved in the sex trafficking plot. It's a fucked up series, but a wonderful character study and really dives in the idea of nuance, redemption and absolution.

				There are studies that back this up, but basically what happens is if a character is the protagonist, good or bad, people tend to root for them, and justify their actions. It might be subconsciously, but general movie going audiences have a hard time with the thought that just because a character is in the drivers’ seat it doesn’t mean you have to do this. 
				
				For Scarface specifically, I think some people also identify with the entrepreneurial spirit of it, but ignore the ending.

	I dunno about anti-capitalism, but my main takeaway of Fight Club was that all the people involved kept saying how they wanted to be free of control, to not be a part of the system, to not just be another cog in the wheel, but that's exactly what they ended up becoming anyway. They just didn't seem to realize it, somehow.

		Starship Troopers was **way way** ahead of its time, talking about Military Fascism and the exploitation of tragedy to justify brutalism. After a terror attack on home soil, the fascist state grows youth to fight aboard in an all out war with the bugs on the sand planet. Most of the Uniforms, especially in the Science Division, are inspired by Italian and Germanic fascist statesmen, and it's littered with war propaganda everywhere.
		
		The only reason this was made as a parody of fascism is because **the book was unironically** fascist propaganda. Nobody wanted to do a movie based off of a book that's purely worshiping military fascism, but Paul H Verhoeven (who made RoboCop AND Total Recall, both warning of police state 80's capitalism ideas of Reagan) stepped up to the plate and made it ironic and almost self-aware. It was a hard message to hear over the space blaster sci-fi movie that it appeared to be, surpassing most minds playing it off as just that. The movie wasn't properly appreciated until the early 2000's for it's satire.

		* 🟧 **[shamblesrock](https://www.reddit.com/user/shamblesrock)** ⬆️ 12 _(2021-08-27 05:30:21)_

			Verhoeven's great. He did it in Robocop too; during the news broadcasts and commercials. It's through those that you realize the extent of the dystopia Robocop is part of. Some actors act so positive, so happy, against what is going on in 'real life'. It makes them seen almost schizophrenic.

			The book isn’t fascist. Heinlein even wrote articles and letters refuting that it take. It is pro military, Heinlein has never hidden the fact that he was pro military. The book was optioned before the Verhoeven script even existed. It just languished not because it was to fascist to touch but because that’s what happens. A book gets licensed and sits. Verhovens movie and original script name was bug hunt at outpost 9. The producers thought it was close enough that there might be some copyright issues so they bought the book rights. Verhoven never read the book and was not out to make starship troopers. The script was reworked to include elements.

I kind of get how you could gloss over it if you missed the ending, but at the same it's made pretty clear in each scenario that he was ruining peoples day who didn't deserve it.

		Great choice. I think media like “Falling Down,” “Dexter,” and “You” do a really good job of twisting the role of protagonist and antagonist. If you’re able to think of the events from any other character’s perspective it’s pretty obvious that the protagonist is not the hero. You nailed it, all of these contain themes of both self-reflection and empathy.

			I think “ white guy power fantasy” is a poor choice of words. I can’t speak for these people but I could see viewing it as a white guy grievance fantasy. Like little things about being dismissed or held up by silly systems. Other people just deal with this stuff but this guy feels entitled to rage against them. Why does he feel that way?

			The issue with Interstellar was that there needed to be a reason why the beings that built the black hole tesseract had to do that instead of simply sending the quantum data to Murph directly themselves. Cooper's connection with Murph allowing him to communicate with her across time was a cool idea. The way it was contextualized for the audience in terms of love is what lead to the misconception the original commenter was talking about. Brand wasn't right when she made her love speech. She was just coincidentally giving Cooper and the audience a basic context to make sense of what was happening in the tesseract. It's not a bad idea but the execution is a little wonky

It's a weird phenomenon on Reddit where people say stuff like "I used to hate the love stuff in Interstellar, until I realised you're meant to view the scene as Anne Hathaway being crazy and emotional"
			
			When no, what she's saying is that sometimes you have to go with your gut feeling, and trust the love that you have for others. In the scene Cooper dismisses her, and she pretty swiftly takes him down with the "I hope you can be as objective when you have to make the choice between seeing your daughter again or another planet" or something along those lines. And of course the ending is essentially vindication for Brand, with Mann lying, Edmunds' planet being the best, and Coop's love for his daughter essentially saving the day

		500 Days of Summer is a movie I think every dude should watch at least twice. Women too probably, but I can't speak for their experience. 
		
		I watched it in highschool and was like "wow Summer is such a huge bitch. Poor Tom". Watched it years later and I had a completely new perspective. Tom didn't even really know this woman, outside of a few superficial common interests, and decided she was The One. He obsesses over her, putting her on a pedestal until she becomes something that's she's not. She's just a normal ass woman, not the answer to all of life's questions. 
		
		It's a great movie about self-delusion and how getting over someone usually means learning to see them as they are, not how you want them to be.

				No, he's not going to make the same mistakes. He changed; that's more or less the point of the movie.
				
				Seasons are often used to represent change, and stages in life. Spring can mean childhood, summer can mean youth, autumn can mean adulthood, winter can mean old age. 
				
				The movie is called "500 days of summer" because Tom is stuck in a stage of life. His youth is lasting too long (summers arent 500 days long). That's why he has that job outside of his field, and he's immature, etc. 
				
				At the end of the movie he grows and moves on to a more mature stage of life (is applying for a job in his field). That's why he meets a woman called Autumn.
				
				If the point were that Tom is going to keep making the same mistakes, he'd just meet another woman called Summer who likes indie rock. And the movie would just be called Eternal Summer.

			Yeah, the movie undermines its message a few times throughout the narrative. It also arguably depicts that Summer's "I don't want a serious relationship" attitude is wrong by having her get married within like a few months. It's easy to take the movie as "they just weren't right for each other," which isn't meant to be the point.
			
			I think a lot of the movies on this thread are actually indicative of a failure by the writers and filmmakers to properly convey their intended message. To say something is always misinterpreted is to say that there's a "correct" way to interpret film. Multiple interpretations can be justified.

	The intended message is NOT, as most people think, to burn down the past and put all that behind you and in the same way the movie is NOT shitting on Star Wars as a whole. The only one still doing or championing either idea at the end is the villain, who is left alone on the literal salt planet, screaming with rage and frustration.

	Hell, the movie literally ends with kids playing with Luke Skywalker action figures and a kid with Force powers holding a broom like a lightsaber and staring off into the stars. I really can't think of a better, or more literal, "we salute you Star Wars fans" send up.

	I don't entirely blame people that misinterpret TLJ. It's a flawed movie that really feels like it could have used at least one more serious pass over for the script, especially on the B plot. Another "problem" is that Adam Driver is so damn charismatic compared to Daisy Ridley that he tends to overpower her from a presence perspective in the scenes that they share, giving the false impression that the script is on his side.

			"Luke would never do something like that."
			
			"Adults aren't allowed to have temptations or make mistakes for the rest of their lives after conquering their inner demons."
			
			A huge part of the reason I love this film so much is it is so theme focused, including the characters. You can sum up Luke's entire current attitude and character in one action: tossing the lightsaber behind his back in disgust. That level of character work should be applauded.
			
			Edit: I especially think it's hilarious that people get defensive about Luke failing his students when 90% of the villains of the EU are fallen disciples of his. If anything he should have given up the whole new Jedi thing the FIRST time one of his followers became a genocidal psychopath.

		I just can't keep away from this, I've gotten absolutely brutalized for my opinions on Watchmen on reddit but I can't stop.  Sigh...  The thing about Watchmen is that it is art in the truest form: in that it is open to interpretation.  It can strike you as one thing at one time of your life, and another thing later.  When it comes to art it doesn't even really matter whether there is a better interpretation out there, or what the artist intended you to take from it, all that matters is what you take from it.
		
		Did Ozymandiaz save anything?  Open to interpretation.  He might have.  Was he interested in power that came from what he did?  Unclear.  Maybe.  
		
		You might have the BETTER interpretation of Ozymandias, but that better interpretation of him might mess up the interpretation of Rorschach.  Rorschach is "supposed" to be a bad guy who's inflexibility and absolute moral code make him a fascist.  But if Ozymandias is actually a bad guy and only Rorschach refuses to go along with his plan at the end, and its BECAUSE of those very qualities that are supposed to make Rorschach a bad guy, doesn't that change the message?
		
		Anyways, like i said, art.  The point is to discuss, reflect, and grow in the process, not to arrive at some kind of absolute answer.

		* 🟧 **[Bellikron](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bellikron)** ⬆️ 6 _(2021-08-27 18:50:40)_

			This is why I love the Watchmen HBO show.  Just like the comic, pretty much everything that happens on screen is morally gray.  Even the clearly evil white supremacists have that one grain of truth at the center of their organization, namely, that they know what really happened with the squid and are spreading that knowledge (packaged with some pretty terrible stuff).  This is similar to Rorschach's characterization in the original graphic novel (although it's worth noting that I think the Seventh Kavalry perverted Rorschach's ideology and that he would not have approved of their actions).  Like you mentioned, he is morally inflexible and brutal, but that also does lead him to be the only one willing to spread the truth at the end.  I suppose it's debatable whether that's a redeeming quality, and it depends on your interpretation of what Ozymandias did was right, but it's the ambiguity that makes him an interesting character.
			
			The movie doesn't hit the moral ambiguity nearly as well.  Ozymandias is just kind of dull, and I do feel like he's given more sympathy due to the fact that we're not allowed to see what a raging egomaniac he is.  The show does an an excellent job of showing how unfulfilled he is after years of no one knowing what he did.  If he really had the best interest of humanity at heart, just the belief that he saved the world would be enough.  But it's not.  He wants to be worshipped for it.

			Thanks. I think I like what you are saying here. Their was definitely a lot that felt open to interpretation and I like it that way.
			
			Especially within the context of watchmen. On the one hand it is trying to subvert Super hero tropes so having bad good guys and good bad guys was a way to flip that script (pretty sure everyone picked up on that aspect). 
			
			The other element is how the movie ties in with the cold war. Rorschach and Ozymandiaz make pretty good stand ins for the USSR and the US respectively. Having them both do really fucked up shit in pursuit of their ideal does enhance that message.

				>On the one hand it is trying to subvert Super hero tropes so having bad good guys and good bad guys was a way to flip that script
				
				I think that's close, but not quite right. It's not really bad "switch places" flipped script because the traditional "villains" are largely absent and nearly irrelevant.
				
				I think (and as you--or the other guy, I forget who I'm responding to--said, it's art and therefore open to interpretation) that the subversion is focused on just the one side--Superheros are awful, or at least would be in the real world. Each major character takes a type of hero or hero characteristic then dials it up to eleven to show you just how problematic that type of hero is and why. So it's not good bad guys and bad good guys so much as look at all the reasons this kind of thing is bad.

	Everyone thinks the Saw movies are about a killer who punishes people who do bad things, and that the message is to basically not do bad things or you’ll be punished.

	Jigsaw doesn’t kill people who do bad things. He kills people *who don’t appreciate their life*. In the first 3 films, at least. Post-Saw 3 they stupidly made him into an anti-hero type character, which led people to believe that it makes no sense for him to test people like a grieving father, a suicidal man, a cheating wife, etc 

	His philosophy is intentionally flawed in Saw 1-3. It’s no coincidence that when they made Jigsaw into a guy who punishes rapists/murderers to ‘teach them a lesson’, the movies became far less interesting

		* 🟧 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 3 _(2021-08-27 13:21:05)_

			Yeah but the whole point of what I’m saying is that the flaws in his philosophy are intentional in the first 3 films. Putting other people in harms way to teach someone to appreciate life was purposeful because Jigsaw is a villain in the first 3 films. They depict him as the embittered psychopath that he is, and never pretend like he’s anything else. He’s wrong and a hypocrite, and this is shown many times in the first 3 films. 
			
			In the later films that changes. He becomes a cult leader anti-hero who only tests bad guys. The producers bought into his philosophy and started to depict him as someone who’s actually doing good things. 
			
			In Saw 1-3, Jigsaw is depicted as a villain, and the flaws in his philosophy like you’ve mentioned- are 100% intentional. Post Saw 3, Jigsaw begins to change into an anti-hero cult leader who ‘has a point’, and thus any flaws in his philosophy are 100% unintentional. Hope that makes sense

		He does both of these things and is terribly inconsistent. I don't think the movies glorify his message as much as people claim. The people he "helps" never really learn, and we even see them taking unintended messages. Amanda turns into a murderous monster. Gordon still loses his family. There's a woman in I think Saw 5 who lost an arm, and in a support group she talks about how her life has only gotten worse and she now has trauma to deal with on top of everything else.
		
		If anything, the message might be that extreme tactics to improve our appreciation of life won't work. We can't force each other to change. It has to come from a genuine will. Jigsaw is therefore wrong because he believes he can change people.

		The movie absolutely gives you no detail about the war, only that it takes place in a war setting. It is primarily focused on Seita’s fruitless attempts to provide and care for his sister on his own and that’s it. Towards the end, Seita and by extension, the viewer, didn’t even know that war had ended. The story was written from Seitas point of view on how he couldn’t provide for his sister and that his careless decision making (not going back to his aunt) caused her death.  
		
		However It’s easy to see how it can be an anti war film because the war does affect the lives of the characters, the food shortage in particular which stressed them out a lot.

		This is an example of why creators aren't always authorities on their own works. Just because a creator says something doesn't make it unassailable truth.
		
		Takahata, the director and a staunch anti-war activist, said this with the reasoning that the movie can't prevent a war from happening. 
		
		Nosaka, the novelist who wrote the original story, says that the story is meant to articulate his guilt for the death of his own sister and has no political content.
		
		Both of these people are products of post-war Japan and the very war they're telling a story about. They had to believe that individuals were powerless to change Japan, that people were the war's environment rather than its participants. 
		
		Takahata is being overly idealistic or maybe pessimistic--his definition of an anti-war movie would mean that no movies could possibly be anti-war. He also has reasons to say that the movie isn't anti-war to respect Nosaka's feelings.
		
		As an expression of Nosaka's guilt, Grave of the Fireflies is like a story told by a victim, assuring the audience that everything that happened is the victim's fault, despite it being painfully obvious to everyone else that it isn't.

A lot of people from the outside assume that it’s a movie that just wallows in how sad and miserable the people are, and how terrible the consequences of war are. But it’s not about that. It’s a personal story of youth, guilt and regret - set in the backdrop of WW2 Japan.

				A person feeling deep regret for choices made as a child to survive a war *is* the big bad scary thing about war this movie depicts. It's worse than firebombing, naval warfare, or dismembered limbs on Omaha Beach, and it's just as much a part of war.

	*Toy Story 3*

	I can’t believe how many people think it’s about “endings” and “finality” and “letting go of your childhood.” When in reality it’s literally about the complete opposite.

	I chalk it up to marketing. The film pushes the “doom and gloom and emotion of going off to college” idea pretty hard in its trailers. And, the beginning of the film does as well. The characters are *absolutely* convinced that Andy going off to college will be the end of their lives as they know it.

	Except…it isn’t.

	There’s a specific moment in the film that pushes this point to the characters, and that’s when they are in the incinerator. Literally accepting “THE END” only to find out that…oh, wait, no…that wasn’t the end. Suddenly, there’s very little in terms of characters fearing the future, because they realized that that big looming thing they were so anxious about…wasn’t the end of the world.

	Immediately after this, they are presented with the option of going after Lotso, and…they don’t. Why? Because they don’t need to. Because it shows how they’ve developed beyond the need for closure.

	When they get donated to Bonnie, it then becomes about the “new beginning” aspect of their lives, rather than an ending. They are now able to continue their lives.

	It’s important to note that Andy is not the main character of the story, and the idea that his saying goodbye to the toys is the same as the audience saying goodbye never quite made sense to me. 

	It’s saying goodbye to Andy, and the toys having the ability to feel loved once again. Them getting exactly what they wanted.

	I try not to overthink it, you get what you want out of films. At least that’s the way David Lynch would put it. Whatever your interpretation is of a film is right because it’s what you get out of it. People tend to get really upset when I say that though. Sure the director might have had a message in mind but I think any good writer/director allows the viewer to take what they want out of what they make. Even more beautiful when you rewatch films after 3-5 years, what you felt then might be different now.

	Nolan introduced Batman's "no kill" rule as kind of straw target because the narrative appears to teach the character that there are scenarios where killing is the exigent solution and he *definitely,* *willfully* kills people who get in his way.

	In that sense, Snyder's Batman is the same Batman who - unlike Nolan's Batman - simply "lived long enough to become a villain."

	These films offer a critique of the character with no avenues for a happy ending outside some external redemption.

	* 🟨 **[Jekkelstein](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jekkelstein)** ⬆️ 32 _(2021-08-27 01:54:44)_

		Nolan never introduced the No Kill rule to Batman. He was simply the first to adapt that to the big screen, and for the better imo. Way too many times his no-kill rule comes in the comics. A world without violence, something he knows too much of, is a world he fights for. 
		
		In a realistic setting, this wouldn't work because our Prison system is trash and Batman would be a villain for overpopulating them. However in a movie sense, not killing the criminals and instead tying them up like Spiderman does and leaving them for the cops actually fits because he leaves them for Gordon. He gets to sleep knowing he didn't kill a father of a child and become the monster that he fears most, and Gordon gets to sleep at night knowing he's not letting a man play judge jury and executioner in leather tights.
		
		Also Battfleck killing thousands of goons like it's churning butter is ironically awful because then he just *forgets* about killing the Joker. His line in ZSJL "I will fucking kill you" has **no** impact because he doesn't follow a no-kill rule. Now if Nolan's Batman said that, shook. Love Ben Affleck, I've met him, so believe me when I say Snyder's Watchmen fantasy on all superheros is pretty ill.

		It was the 90s Animated Series that gave Batman a strict moral code against killing, because the censors wanted it clean for kids.

	* 🟨 **[ScreenElucidator](https://www.reddit.com/user/ScreenElucidator)** ⬆️ 13 _(2021-08-27 00:40:06)_

		It is, a bit. It's a narrative rule. It's more like "I'll *try* not to kill people. I believe in fair trial, not extrajudicial killing", but the movie doesn't charge Bruce with that when he careens into a garbage truck in TDK. It's more that he doesn't really kill *in the narrative*.
		
		 Snyder's movie is the opposite. The narrative says "He *could* kill, he doesn't care if he does at this stage, and ( more importantly ) **people would die IRL.**"
		
		 All those YouTube clips showing Affleck's kill count misunderstand this. Snyder, who was trying to project Watchmen onto his DC heroes, wanted a world where ... it's more saying "If Batman punches a guy in the face with knuckledusters, they *would* die. People don't shrug off grenade blasts."
		
		( OTOH, Snyder might've confused fans with lack of clarity on the One Rule. Still, he acknowledges it ; more than Burton did. )
		
		Batman fans often misunderstand the difference between the way the various scripts treat this in live action ; the Bat world works on a kind of magical contrivance - that Bruce can employ that level of brutality on criminals without **very probably** killing/maiming/permanently disabling them.

		* 🟧 **[Generic_On_Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Generic_On_Reddit)** ⬆️ 10 _(2021-08-27 07:14:48)_

			Well, all superhero universes exist on the basis of magical contrivances. Some are explicit and the entire point, the powers, while others are implied or fuzzy, like how these powers still don't respect physics. (Ex: Heroes catching people out of the air and not breaking their bodies in the process.)Batman specifically is always a case of walking contrivances. Always knowing what he needs to, having the plan that will work, having all the materials no matter how rare, etc. 
			
			> Snyder's movie is the opposite. The narrative says "He *could* kill [...] **people would die IRL.**"
			
			> [...] Snyder, who was trying to project Watchmen onto his DC heroes, wanted a world where ... it's more saying "If Batman punches a guy in the face with knuckledusters, they *would* die. People don't shrug off grenade blasts."
			
			Also, while what he does would generally kill people in real life, the punishment he takes from various villains would also kill people in real life. Ditto for most heroes and action genres in general, Batman's criminals are not the only ones that benefits from "That should have killed them!" Batman's criminals should be dead. But Batman should also be dead. As should Robin(s), Green Arrow, most people being saved and pretty much anyone else we can identify as a normal human. The Flash should also be dead for reasons I don't think are covered by the speed force. Being in peak physical form does not protect your skull from cracking. 
			
			This is a long winded way of saying their universes work on different rules of physics and human anatomy/survivability. And my point is that it doesn't excuse Snyder's decision that Batman kills people. In Nolan's universe, Batman's tactics are not lethal. In Snyder's, those same/similar tactics are lethal. Thus, Batman in Snyder's universe would use different tactics. He would adjust his approach to be non-lethal. 
			
			And this is observable in any hero. Superman will drop the entire force of the sun on your skull... if you're Doomsday, but not if you're Lex Luther. Spider-Man will drop a crane on you... if you're Sandman, but maybe not if you're Vulture. Captain America will drop a shipping container on another hero... if they're Spider-Man, but probably not any of the normal people fighting on his side in civil war. They adjust their tactics based on perceived survivability. Change the rules of survivability and the tactics change. If bullets **weren't** lethal, he *would* use them. If punches **were** lethal, he *wouldn't* use them. If any force at all was lethal, Batman's combat would be knockout gas and tranquilizer darts, and he would shoot automatically expanding pillows to where he thought the criminals head would land, and that setup wouldn't even crack Batman's top 50 most contrived gadgets. 
			
			This is not to say I have a problem with a Batman that kills. I don't like Snyder's Batman, but I think having a Batman that kills create compelling character dynamics, especially if it's a gradual shift. However, it is **always** a reflection of the character, the world doesn't factor into it since the character's actions are based on the rules of that world. The character knows those rules and decides what to do based on their desired outcome, it's a character decision. That's *probably* my issue with Snyder's Batman. It actually *does* feel like a mere response to grimness or realness and isn't acknowledged enough to be an actual character feature. Saying this would happen is not interesting and it doesn't dissect Batman's character. I don't need a movie that reminds me of what is or isn't lethal in real life. Give me character development, please.
			
			TL;Dr - my response to "IRL, Batman's tactics would kill people" is "IRL, Batman would use different tactics.

Really it's a movie that's a character study and shows what type of social climate allows those types to come to be. You're not supposed to root for Arthur you're supposed to pity him. I feel because the movie isn't inherently trying to lean one way or another politically that's interpreted as sympathizing with extremist culture when it's simply pointing out how these people can happen. Movie critics saying it was stigmatizing mental illness missed the point the movie was trying to express.
