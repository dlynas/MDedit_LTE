“**Ur-Fascism**” or “**Eternal Fascism: Fourteen Ways of Looking at a Blackshirt**” (in Italian: _Il fascismo eterno_, or _Ur-Fascismo_) is a renowned [essay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essay "Essay") authored by the Italian [philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher "Philosopher"), [novelist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelist "Novelist"), and [semiotician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotician "Semiotician") [Umberto Eco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umberto_Eco "Umberto Eco"). First published in [1995](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995 "1995"), this influential essay provides an analysis of [fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism "Fascism"), a [definition of fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_fascism "Definitions of fascism"), and discusses the fundamental characteristics and traits of fascism. Drawing on Eco's personal experiences growing up in [Mussolini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mussolini "Mussolini")'s Italy and his extensive research on fascist movements, the essay offers valuable insights into the nature of fascism and its manifestations.

## Overview\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ur-Fascism&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Overview")\]

"Eternal Fascism: Fourteen Ways of Looking at a Blackshirt" delves into the core characteristics of fascism. Eco outlines fourteen key elements or traits, which he refers to as "ways," that commonly appear in fascist movements. While not all these traits are present in every fascist movement, together they create a recognizable pattern. The essay is structured around these fourteen ways, providing an in-depth exploration of fascism as a multifaceted and adaptable ideology.<sup id="cite_ref-Eco1995_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ur-Fascism#cite_note-Eco1995-1">[1]</a></sup> He argues that it is not possible to organise these into a coherent system, but that "it is enough that one of them be present to allow fascism to coagulate around it". He uses the term "[ur-fascism](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ur- "wikt:ur-")" as a generic description of different historical forms of fascism. The fourteen properties are as follows:

1.  "**The cult of tradition**", characterized by cultural [syncretism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism "Syncretism"), even at the risk of internal contradiction. When all truth has already been revealed by tradition, no new learning can occur, only further interpretation and refinement.
2.  "**The rejection of modernism**", which views the rationalistic development of Western culture since [the Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment") as a descent into depravity. Eco distinguishes this from a rejection of superficial technological advancement, as many fascist regimes cite their industrial potency as proof of the vitality of their system.
3.  "**The cult of [action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(philosophy) "Action (philosophy)") for action's sake**", which dictates that action is of value in itself and should be taken without intellectual reflection. This, says Eco, is connected with [anti-intellectualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-intellectualism "Anti-intellectualism") and [irrationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrationalism "Irrationalism"), and often manifests in attacks on modern culture and science.
4.  "**[Disagreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissent "Dissent") is [treason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason "Treason")**" – fascism devalues intellectual discourse and critical reasoning as barriers to action, as well as out of fear that such analysis will expose the contradictions embodied in a syncretistic faith.
5.  "**[Fear of difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear#Uncertainty "Fear")**", which fascism seeks to exploit and exacerbate, often in the form of [racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism "Racism") or an appeal against [foreigners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(law) "Alien (law)") and [immigrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration "Immigration").
6.  "**Appeal to a frustrated [middle class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class "Middle class")**", fearing economic pressure from the demands and aspirations of [lower social groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class "Working class").
7.  "**[Obsession with a plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory "Conspiracy theory")**" and the hyping-up of an enemy threat. This often combines an appeal to [xenophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia "Xenophobia") with a fear of disloyalty and sabotage from marginalized groups living within the society. Eco also cites [Pat Robertson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Robertson "Pat Robertson")'s book _[The New World Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_World_Order_(Robertson) "The New World Order (Robertson)")_ as a prominent example of a plot obsession.
8.  Fascist societies rhetorically cast their enemies as "**at the same time too strong and too weak**". On the one hand, fascists play up the power of certain disfavored elites to encourage in their followers a sense of grievance and humiliation. On the other hand, fascist leaders point to the decadence of those elites as proof of their ultimate feebleness in the face of an overwhelming popular will.
9.  "**[Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacifism#Criticism "Pacifism")**" because "**[life is permanent warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_war#In_socioeconomics_and_politics "Perpetual war")**" – there must always be an enemy to fight. Both [fascist Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany") under [Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler") and Italy under Mussolini worked first to organize and clean up their respective countries and then build the war machines that they later intended to and did use, despite Germany being under restrictions of the [Versailles treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles "Treaty of Versailles") to not build a military force. This principle leads to a fundamental contradiction within fascism: the incompatibility of ultimate triumph with perpetual war.
10.  "**[Contempt for the weak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauvinism "Chauvinism")**", which is uncomfortably married to a chauvinistic _**[popular elitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_narcissism "Collective narcissism")**_, in which every member of society is superior to outsiders by virtue of belonging to the in-group. Eco sees in these attitudes the root of a deep tension in the fundamentally hierarchical structure of fascist polities, as they encourage leaders to despise their underlings, up to the ultimate leader, who holds the whole country in contempt for having allowed him to overtake it by force.
11.  "**Everybody is educated to become a [hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero "Hero")**", which leads to the embrace of a _**[cult of death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult#Destructive_cults "Cult")**_. As Eco observes, "\[t\]he [Ur-Fascist hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Man_(utopian_concept)#Fascist_New_Man "New Man (utopian concept)") is impatient to die. In his impatience, he more frequently sends other people to death."
12.  "**[Machismo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machismo "Machismo")**", which sublimates the difficult work of permanent war and heroism into the sexual sphere. Fascists thus hold "both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality".
13.  "**[Selective populism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_populism "Right-wing populism")**" – the people, conceived monolithically, have a [common will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_will "General will"), distinct from and superior to the viewpoint of any individual. As no mass of people can ever be truly unanimous, the leader holds himself out as the interpreter of the popular will (though truly he alone dictates it). Fascists use this concept to delegitimize democratic institutions they accuse of "no longer represent\[ing\] the voice of the people".
14.  "**[Newspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak "Newspeak")**" – fascism employs and promotes an impoverished vocabulary in order to limit critical reasoning.
