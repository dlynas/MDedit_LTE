## An exposé from the Washington Post has revealed that top Biden officials knew Israel was systematically targeting Palestinian family homes and civilian infrastructure in bombings as early as October 27th – the same day the White House said it would impose “no red lines” on Israel’s genocide. Biden has continually lied and broken the law in order to keep arming and backing Israel’s assault. That makes him more than complicit in genocide: he’s actively responsible for it.

Biden could end Israel’s brutal assault on Gaza tomorrow. Instead, he’s going out of his way to provide Israel with the weapons and diplomatic cover it needs to keep killing Palestinians. Enough is enough.
