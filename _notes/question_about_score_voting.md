## Question about Score Voting

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/EndFPTP/comments/18r5rqn/question_about_score_voting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EndFPTP/comments/18r5rqn/question_about_score_voting/)

> Often when people criticize score voting they are quick to mention the min-max problem. What I‚Äôm wondering is if there was a ranked version of score voting where candidates are ranked as opposed to scored so that no two candidates can be given the same score. This would eliminate the problem of minimizing all the candidates you don‚Äôt like by giving them all zeros and maximizing all the candidates you like by giving them all fives, in favor of more even rankings. Of course since the numerical values are switched the lowest sum/average would be the winner as opposed to the highest sum/average. Any way I‚Äôm curious if something like this has already been proposed or debunked and am looking forward to hearing y‚Äôall‚Äôs thoughts!

	That‚Äôs [Borda count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count), simply using the rankings instead of points values assigned to rankings. Not a good method for public elections.

		Borda with equal-ranking allowed is quite similar to Score. Basic flaw in many systems is requiring a result from a single poll. Runoff voting is much better than instant runoff because the decision to vote essentially factors for quantitative shift in voter turnout because of absolute preference strength. Low turnout is considered ‚Äúbad‚Äù but it can improve results if we assume the decision to vote or not reflected preference strength. Top-two runoff has a flaw that doesn‚Äôt bite so hard if a true majority ‚Äî if required by the rules and as defined by Roberts Rules.

			Borda count with equal rank is just confusing hard to use Score. If you want to bullet/anti bullet vote you have to invent some fake write in candidates to fill out the ‚Äúunused‚Äù ranks, and there‚Äôs an infinitely low score unless you bound the ranks, limited only by how want fake write ins the voter can come up with/fit on the ballot

			* üü¶ **[Abdlomax](https://www.reddit.com/user/Abdlomax)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2 _(2023-12-26 15:22:14)_

				‚ÄúConfusing‚Äù depends on the expectations of voters. Then you imagine that the voter who is confused by simple instructions will be sophisticated enough to imagine a value in fake write-ins. The instructions should not tell them how to vote, but how the votes will be counted. It is Score N, where N is the number of different ratings possible (including the rating of a blank as zero). ‚ÄúHard to use‚Äù is highly speculative if a system has never been tried, and especially if details about voter instructions are not specified. There are many issues here that have been badly confused for decades by biased advocates, political arguments based in a two-party system, and sometimes outright lies, particularly by FairVote.
				
				Score Voting normally has a fixed number of scores, though the rules could allow more, depending on the number if registered candidates qualified, could be plus one if write-ins are allowed.
				
				The number one problem in most political systems is the allowance of an election without an absolute majority of marked ballots approving of the winner. That is undemocratic. In Roberts Rules of Order, a ballot with a mark on it is effectively a vote for NOTA. No marked ballots are disqualified. The democratic rule is very clear. No organizational decision is made without an absolute majority of votes. A tie is an election failure and the whole process must be repeated.
				
				Write-ins are rare, but have, in at least one case, elected a write-in.

					There are infinite rankings possible if you allow write ins, that adds confusion
					The only way to give two candidates the equivalent of a 5 and a 0 in Score/STAR is by having, or inventing, 4 other candidates to put between them, that‚Äôs confusing and hard to use.
					My point is that in every way the same effect is easier and more obviously achieved via actually using a Score system than kludging it up from rankings that allow equal ranks

					* üü• **[Abdlomax](https://www.reddit.com/user/Abdlomax)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1 _(2023-12-26 16:24:29)_

						It is enough to allow only one write-in. You are describing Borda, not a rank-limited Score ballot. When I was working very actively on voting systems there were no serious considerations of unbounded scores. We considered Range 10 to be adequate. If you have *very strong preference* the rational strategy is to top score your favorite, bottom score any *unacceptable* candidates, and then rate the others intermediately in between, easier if equal ranking is allowed. If it comes down to those two, equal ranking is equivalent to an abstention on that pair, which is fine.
						
						STAR is a quite new method.
						
						Equal ranks are intrinsic to Score, yet it is easy to vote with decent instructions. It is forcing people to make a choice when they don‚Äôt have a strong preference that could make it difficult. The Wikipedia article on STAR actually cites a source claiming that Runoff Score could ‚Äúsave our democracy.‚Äù I could not read the source, but the article violates Wikipedia Reliable Source, primary sources and advocacy organizations being extensively used.
						
						But Top-Two Runoff Score showed less Bayesian Regret than Pure Score in Warren Smith‚Äôs simulations.

		To be clear, there's an effect that strategic score should use minimum and maximum values, so you might as well use approval.  But approval really is good enough, so...

		* üüß **[xoomorg](https://www.reddit.com/user/xoomorg)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2 _(2023-12-26 12:27:29)_

			Right, that's what I mean about there not actually being a *problem*.  
			
			It's also not guaranteed that everybody will min/max in the first place, since that's only the best strategy when there's perfect information.  When you're unsure of the relative ranking of two candidates (where you approve of both of them, just one slightly more than the other) you can "hedge your bet" by assigning non-min/max scores.  That can prevent (e.g.) your second-favorite from beating your first-favorite in the event that the race is close -- but still allow you to specify your preference for your second-favorite over everybody else.
			
			A related objection to approval is that people will bullet-vote.  That's also not true, especially for score voting where intermediate scores are available.  Even with approval voting, then voters still have an incentive to vote for whichever leading candidate they prefer most *as well as* any other candidate they approve of even more (including -- *always* \-- their genuine first-preference.)

				>Even with approval voting, then voters still have an incentive
				
				In theory, sure. In all of the multiple real-world elections we've seen so far with AV, about 10% or so of the population actually 'approves' for more than 1 person

				* üü™ **[xoomorg](https://www.reddit.com/user/xoomorg)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2 _(2023-12-26 16:45:22)_

					So?  All we can do is remove the obstacles, we can't *force* people to vote any particular way.  Maybe it's a matter of political inertia that would dissipate over time as people got used to the new system that didn't have a "spoiler effect" and realized they *can* approve more than just the lesser of two evils.  Maybe most people really do approve of just one candidate, when it really comes down to it.  It doesn't really matter.  The point is that their optimal voting strategy would be to approve of whichever front-runner they prefer, as well as everybody else they prefer more than that (up to and including their first-preference.)
					
					There are other (arguably) good reasons to dislike score and/or approval, but concerns over min/max scoring and bullet-voting are not among them.

					* üü• **[unscrupulous-canoe](https://www.reddit.com/user/unscrupulous-canoe)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2 _(2023-12-27 11:53:51)_

						Yes, the St. Louis election shows that the average voter did not approve of more than 1 candidate. A much higher number of approvals must have come from a small subset of voters. Per Wiki Fargo's 2nd AV election for mayor had 1.6 approvals per ballot- so basically the same result. A large plurality of voters only 'approve' 1 candidate. (As an FYI Clay Shentrup is a single-issue activist for AV, so not a great source of objective analysis).
						
						The history of AV shows that various organizations like the IEEE tried &amp; then eventually discarded it as, again, most voters only vote for 1 candidate. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval\_voting#Other\_organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting#Other_organizations)
						
						Dartmouth College famously experimented with using AV for several years, but abandoned it due to extensive bullet voting. I'll counter your 1 example election with 5 examples- as you can see, about 10% of voters would only ever vote for more than 1 candidate

							You've dramatically shifted the goalposts here. In the prior comment, you said _all_ real-world approval elections feature **90%** of the ballots exhibiting bullet voting. 
							
							Even FairVote disagrees with you: they estimate a 60% bullet voting rate in the Fargo 2022 example. As we both know, FairVote's agenda is to depict IRV as better than approval. And here, distributional assumptions _do_ matter to calculate this rate, unlike the mean approvals per ballot measure (that you criticized from coming from Shentrup's medium page, who, for the record, also advocates for score). (similarly, your 90% claim does not hold for Fargo 2020 or St. Louis 2021)
							
							That said, the bullet voting rate isn't a particularly meaningful metric to gauge the quality of an approval election. A high bullet vote rate can even be expected/optimal depending on the number of candidates and voters' preferences. In the Fargo 2022 case, 65% of ballots approved Mahoney, so I would label this result as a success. 
							
							
							Moving away from real-world governmental elections, the Dartmouth rationale is incoherent: if bullet voting is a concern, why force bullet voting by switching to plurality? Nevertheless, bullet voting is only mentioned twice in their 53-page [report](https://web.archive.org/web/20081010114456/https://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/features/governance/report-083007.pdf), so I'm not sure if this was the primary motivator. also thanks for the FairVote spreadsheet

								Using averages is not moving goalposts- in general, over a large-enough sample size, 90% of voters don't use multiple approvals. That doesn't mean each individual election hews to 90% exactly. 'Fargo 2020' was an election for city commissioner, I'm guessing the number of votes was probably in the hundreds. That's a very obscure election pulling in a particularly weird group of politics-obsessive voters. Anyways, you used 2 examples, so I countered with 7, including Dartmouth and the IEEE. You might find say the experience of the Mathematical Association of America interesting- 79% of voters bullet-voted.
								
								[https://web.archive.org/web/20181218010629/http://www.nyu.ed[u/gsas](https://www.reddit.com/user/gsas)/dept/politics/faculty/brams/theory\_to\_practice.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20181218010629/http://www.nyu.ed[u/gsas](https://www.reddit.com/user/gsas)/dept/politics/faculty/brams/theory_to_practice.pdf) 
								
								For example, London used the supplementary vote for decades- a kind of IRV where you can only rank 2 candidates, and the 2nd one only if you want to. They eventually abandoned it- because again, 90% of voters didn't choose to use that 2nd ranking. Same experience when parts of the US tried to using Bucklin IRV decades ago.
								
								There's a more clever argument somewhere that only 10% of voters using it is still OK, because that can affect elections on the margins. But the idea that most voters are using it is empirically false

									Again, you're arguing a different point. Your original statement is _all_ real-world approval elections feature approx. 90% of the ballots exhibiting bullet voting. You used a universal quantification, so this only takes **one** counterexample to be shown false (see above). 
									
									Similarly, you've created a strawman here: "But the idea that most voters are using it is empirically false." I have never claimed this, and even cite examples where this is false.
									
									&amp;nbsp;
									
									With that out of the way, Brams notes that the MAA 1987 election is more of an exception to the dominant tendency: "In 12 of the 16 multicandidate AV elections analyzed in the four societies, the winners were AV-dominant. In the four elections in which there was not an AV-dominant winner, the pattern is similar to that in the 1987 MAA election shown in Table 2." In the [1988 MAA newsletter](https://maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/pubs/focus/past_issues/FOCUS_8_3.pdf), Brams recommended the ballot instructions be updated to explain that voters can select as many candidates as desired, which suggests there may have been some confusion (as this was their first election using approval). Further, the MAA continues to use approval to this day, so bullet voting must not be a serious problem in their eyes.
									
									Then you bring up supplementary vote‚Äîthis is a non-monotonic voting system, so I struggle to form a correspondence with approval voting.
									
									Finally you claim Bucklin IRV was abandoned in the US due to (the equivalent of) bullet voting. First, your 90% claim doesn't hold for Duluth Minnesota 1915. Second, your claim is ahistorical; this system was struck down for constitutionality reasons in multiple localities https://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/deliverdocument.asp?citeid=53555 &amp; https://case-law.vlex.com/vid/brown-v-smallwood-19-890192686

										I am sorry that you interpreted a Reddit comment that super-literally. I don't really find it productive to engage with that level of Internet pedantry, hounding someone over multiple days over sentence construction. Around 90% of voters don't 'approve' of more than 1 candidate, I've given you far more examples than you've given me (I think you had 2?) I feel comfortable with the statement and don't really need to add anything to it. Everything else you've included here is a non-sequitur (I never made any claims about why Bucklin was abandoned, just noted how many people used it). I think we've reached a good stopping point here discussion-wise

							>Yes, the St. Louis election shows that the average voter did not approve of more than 1 candidate. A much higher number of approvals must have come from a small subset of voters. ...  A large plurality of voters only 'approve' 1 candidate.
							
							What?  The math doesn't show this.  Let a=fraction of "1 approval" voters, b=fraction of "2 approval" voters and c=fraction of "3 approval" voters.  The relevant equations are: a+2b+3c=1.56; a+b+c=1.  The solution can be expressed as a=0.44+c and b=0.56-2c.   We expect c to be fairly small since there are only four candidates.  So when c=0.01, we have a=0.45 and b=0.54.  When c=0.04, we have a=0.48 and b=0.48.  It's only when c>0.04, do "1 approval" voters become a plurality.  They become a majority when c>0.06.
							
							And the "average voter" approved of 1.56 candidates according to the reported results, so the statement in your first sentence does not make any sense.
