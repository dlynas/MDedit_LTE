## I had a big request on how to change habits after yesterdays post.
For anyone that isn’t British, pubs are like taverns, and bars are more like speakeasy hangouts? I don’t know how to describe it, but trust me, they’re different and they have a major cultural association to different behaviours and expectations. If anyone wants to help me differentiate pubs and bars I’d be grateful ha.

Please don’t even bother commenting if you’re triggered that you don’t want to stop drinking. I’m not insinuating nor telling anyone they should. Im just giving out tips for those who have asked me how to do it.
