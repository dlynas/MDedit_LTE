From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

In [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") and [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science"), a **first principle** is a basic [proposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition "Proposition") or [assumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom") that cannot be deduced from any other proposition or assumption. First principles in philosophy are from [first cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_cause "First cause")<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> attitudes and taught by [Aristotelians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelianism "Aristotelianism"), and nuanced versions of first principles are referred to as [postulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postulate "Postulate") by [Kantians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantian "Kantian").<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") and [formal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_logic "Formal logic"), first principles are referred to as [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom") or postulates. In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and other sciences, theoretical work is said to be from first principles, or _[ab initio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_initio "Ab initio")_, if it starts directly at the level of established science and does not make assumptions such as empirical model and parameter fitting. "First principles thinking" consists of decomposing things down to the fundamental [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom") in the given arena, before reasoning up by asking which ones are relevant to the question at hand, then cross referencing conclusions based on chosen axioms and making sure conclusions do not violate any fundamental laws. [Physicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist "Physicist") include counterintuitive concepts with [reiteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration "Iteration").

## In formal logic\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=First_principle&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: In formal logic")\]

In a formal [logical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_system "Logical system"), that is, a set of [propositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition "Proposition") that are consistent with one another, it is [possible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_possibility "Logical possibility") that some of the statements can be deduced from other statements. For example, in the [syllogism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism "Syllogism"), _"All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; Socrates is mortal"_ the last claim can be deduced from the first two.

A first principle is an [axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom#Mathematical_logic#Logical_axioms "Axiom") that cannot be deduced from any other within that system. The classic example is that of [Euclid's _Elements_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements"); its hundreds of geometric propositions can be deduced from a set of definitions, postulates, and common notions: all three types constitute first principles.

## Philosophy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=First_principle&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Philosophy")\]

In philosophy "first principles" are from [first cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_cause "First cause")<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> attitudes commonly referred to as _[a priori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori "A priori and a posteriori")_ terms and arguments, which are contrasted to _[a posteriori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_posteriori "A posteriori")_ terms, reasoning or arguments, in that the former are simply assumed and exist prior to the reasoning process and the latter are deduced or inferred after the initial reasoning process. First principles are generally treated in the realm of philosophy known as [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology"), but are an important factor in any [metaphysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics") speculation.

In philosophy "first principles" are often somewhat synonymous with _[a priori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_knowledge "A priori knowledge")_, datum and [axiomatic reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_reasoning "Axiomatic reasoning").

### Ancient Greek philosophy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=First_principle&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Ancient Greek philosophy")\]

In [Ancient Greek philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_philosophy "Ancient Greek philosophy"), a first principle from which other principles are derived is called an _**arche**_<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> and later "first principle" or "element". By extension, it may mean "first place", "method of government", "empire, realm", "authorities"<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> The concept of an _arche_ was adapted from the earliest [cosmogonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogonies "Cosmogonies") of [Hesiod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesiod "Hesiod") and [Orphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphism_(religion) "Orphism (religion)"), through the physical theories of [Pre-Socratic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Socratic_philosophy "Pre-Socratic philosophy") and [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato") before being formalized as a part of [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics") by [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle"). _Arche_<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> sometimes also transcribed as _arkhé_) is an Ancient Greek word with primary senses "beginning", "origin" or "source of action":<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> from the beginning, οr the original argument, "command".<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> The first principle or element corresponds to the "ultimate underlying substance" and "ultimate indemonstrable principle".<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

#### Mythical cosmogonies\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=First_principle&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Mythical cosmogonies")\]

The heritage of Greek [mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythology "Mythology") already embodied the desire to articulate reality as a whole and this universalizing impulse was fundamental for the first projects of speculative theorizing. It appears that the order of "being" was first imaginatively visualized before it was abstractly thought.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

In the mythological cosmogonies of the Near East, the universe is formless and empty and the only existing thing prior to creation was the water abyss. In the [Babylonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonia "Babylonia") creation story, [Enuma Elish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enuma_Elish "Enuma Elish"), the primordial world is described as a "watery chaos" from which everything else appeared.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> This watery chaos has similarities in the cosmogony of the Greek mythographer [Pherecydes of Syros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pherecydes_of_Syros "Pherecydes of Syros").<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> In the mythical [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece "Greece") [cosmogony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony "Cosmogony") of [Hesiod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesiod "Hesiod") (8th to 7th century BC), the origin of the world is [Chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_(cosmogony) "Chaos (cosmogony)"), considered as a divine primordial condition, from which everything else appeared. In the creation "chaos" is a gaping-void, but later the word is used to describe the space between the Earth and the sky, after their separation. "Chaos" may mean infinite space, or a formless matter which can be differentiated.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> The notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> The conception of the "divine" as an origin influenced the first Greek philosophers.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> In the [Orphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphic "Orphic") cosmogony, the unaging [Chronos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronos "Chronos") produced [Aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_(mythology) "Aether (mythology)") and Chaos and made in divine Aether a silvery egg, from which everything else appeared.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>

#### Ionian school\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=First_principle&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Ionian school")\]

The earliest Pre-Socratic philosophers, the Ionian material monists, sought to explain all of nature ([physis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physis "Physis")) in terms of one unifying _arche._ Among the material monists were the three Milesian philosophers: [Thales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales "Thales"), who believed that everything was composed of water; [Anaximander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander "Anaximander"), who believed it was _[apeiron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apeiron_(cosmology) "Apeiron (cosmology)")_; and [Anaximenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximenes_of_Miletus "Anaximenes of Miletus"), who believed it was air. This is considered as a permanent substance or either one or more which is conserved in the generation of rest of it. From this all things first come to be and into this they are resolved in a final state. This source of entity is always preserved.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> Although their theories were primitive, these philosophers were the first to give an explanation of the physical world without referencing the supernatural; this opened the way for much of modern [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science") (and philosophy), which has the same goal of explaining the world without dependence on the supernatural.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>

Thales of Miletus (7th to 6th century BC), the father of philosophy, claimed that the first principle of all things is water,<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> and considered it as a substance that contains in it motion and change. His theory was supported by the observation of moisture throughout the world and coincided with his theory that the Earth floated on water. His ideas were influenced by the Near-Eastern mythological cosmogony and probably by the [Homeric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeric "Homeric") statement that the surrounding [Oceanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanus "Oceanus") (ocean) is the source of all springs and rivers.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>

Anaximander argued that water could not be the arche, because it could not give rise to its opposite, fire. Anaximander claimed that none of the [elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element "Classical element") ([earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), [fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire "Fire"), [air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air "Air"), [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water "Water")) could be arche for the same reason. Instead, he proposed the existence of the [apeiron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apeiron_(cosmology) "Apeiron (cosmology)"), an indefinite substance from which all things are born and to which all things will return.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> _Apeiron_ (endless or boundless) is something completely indefinite; and Anaximander was probably influenced by the original _chaos_ of Hesiod (yawning abyss).

Anaximander was the first philosopher that used _arche_ for that which writers from Aristotle onwards called "the substratum" ([Simplicius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicius_of_Cilicia "Simplicius of Cilicia") Phys. 150, 22).<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> He probably intended it to mean primarily "indefinite in kind" but assumed it also to be "of unlimited extent and duration".<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> The notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality and Anaximander's description was in terms appropriate to this conception. This _arche_ is called "eternal and ageless". (Hippolitus I,6, I;DK B2)<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup>

Anaximenes, Anaximander's pupil, advanced yet another theory. He returns to the elemental theory, but this time posits air, rather than water, as the arche and ascribes to it divine attributes. He was the first recorded philosopher who provided a theory of change and supported it with observation. Using two contrary processes of [rarefaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rarefaction "Rarefaction") and [condensation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensation "Condensation") (thinning or thickening), he explains how air is part of a series of changes. Rarefied air becomes fire, condensed it becomes first wind, then cloud, water, earth, and stone in order.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> The _arche_ is technically what underlies all of reality/appearances.

#### Aristotle\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=First_principle&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Aristotle")\]

[Terence Irwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Irwin "Terence Irwin") writes:

> When Aristotle explains in general terms what he tries to do in his philosophical works, he says he is looking for "first principles" (or "origins"; [archai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arche "Arche")):
> 
> > In every systematic inquiry (methodos) where there are first principles, or causes, or elements, knowledge and science result from acquiring knowledge of these; for we think we know something just in case we acquire knowledge of the primary causes, the primary first principles, all the way to the elements. It is clear, then, that in the science of nature as elsewhere, we should try first to determine questions about the first principles. The naturally proper direction of our road is from things better known and clearer to us, to things that are clearer and better known by nature; for the things that are known to us are not the same as the things known unconditionally (haplôs). Hence it is necessary for us to progress, following this procedure, from the things that are less clear by nature, but clearer to us, towards things that are clearer and better known by nature. (Phys. 184a10–21)

> The connection between knowledge and first principles is not axiomatic as expressed in Aristotle's account of a first principle (in one sense) as "the first basis from which a thing is known" (Met. 1013a14–15).

### Modern philosophy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=First_principle&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Modern philosophy")\]

#### Descartes\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=First_principle&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Descartes")\]

Profoundly influenced by [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid"), [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes "Descartes") was a [rationalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalist "Rationalist") who invented the [foundationalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundationalist "Foundationalist") system of philosophy. He used the _method of doubt_, now called [Cartesian doubt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_doubt "Cartesian doubt"), to systematically doubt everything he could possibly doubt until he was left with what he saw as purely indubitable truths. Using these self-evident propositions as his axioms, or foundations, he went on to deduce his entire body of knowledge from them. The foundations are also called _[a priori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori "A priori and a posteriori")_ truths. His most famous proposition is "Je pense, donc je suis" (_I think, therefore I am_, or _[Cogito ergo sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito_ergo_sum "Cogito ergo sum")_), which he indicated in his [Discourse on the Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_on_the_Method "Discourse on the Method") was "the first principle of the philosophy of which I was in search."

Descartes describes the concept of a first principle in the following excerpt from the preface to the _[Principles of Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_Philosophy "Principles of Philosophy")_ (1644):

> I should have desired, in the first place, to explain in it what philosophy is, by commencing with the most common matters, as, for example, that the word philosophy signifies the study of wisdom, and that by wisdom is to be understood not merely prudence in the management of affairs, but a perfect knowledge of all that man can know, as well for the conduct of his life as for the preservation of his health and the discovery of all the arts, and that knowledge to subserve these ends must necessarily be deduced from first causes; so that in order to study the acquisition of it (which is properly called \[284\] philosophizing), we must commence with the investigation of those first causes which are called Principles. Now, these principles must possess two conditions: in the first place, they must be so clear and evident that the human mind, when it attentively considers them, cannot doubt their truth; in the second place, the knowledge of other things must be so dependent on them as that though the principles themselves may indeed be known apart from what depends on them, the latter cannot nevertheless be known apart from the former. It will accordingly be necessary thereafter to endeavor so to deduce from those principles the knowledge of the things that depend on them, as that there may be nothing in the whole series of deductions which is not perfectly manifest.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>

In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), a calculation is said to be _from first principles_, or _[ab initio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_initio "Ab initio")_, if it starts directly at the level of established laws of physics and does not make assumptions such as empirical [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_model "Physical model") and [fitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_fitting "Curve fitting") parameters.

For example, calculation of [electronic structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_structure "Electronic structure") using [Schrödinger's equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_equation "Schrödinger's equation") within a set of approximations that do not include fitting the model to experimental data is an [_ab initio_ approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_initio_quantum_chemistry_methods "Ab initio quantum chemistry methods").
