## Norman Finkelstein, whose own parents were survivors of Auschwitz and Majdanek concentration camps, explains to us what the Holocaust Industry is. 

If you haven’t read The Holocaust Industry by Norman Finkelstein I can’t recommend it enough considering current events.

"I was wondering if you could tell us what the Holocaust industry is.
Basically, it's the exploitation of the colossal suffering of Jews during World War II,
for political and then for a certain period, financial gain.
A political gain was basically using Nazi Holocaust as a club to silence criticism of Israel.
At some point, this Holocaust compensation racket the extraction of money from European governments
in the name of what we'll call needed Holocaust victims began.
Several figures come out about $20 billion,
where coerced from European governments, mostly on fraudulent grounds.
And then there was all this schlock nonsense,
which basically is used to defend Israel and deflect criticism of Israeli policy.
You can usually tell this literature because it asserts or insists on the absolute uniqueness of a Nazi Holocaust,
the claim that no people in a history of humanity have ever suffered, the way Jews suffered.
And that's clearly an ideological claim.
You can't intellectually prove things like that, but it's almost absurd to want to prove them.
The purpose is fairly straightforward.
That is, if people have uniquely suffered, then they can't be held to conventional moral and legal standards.
So, for example, if you say that Israel tortures Palestinian detainees,
and then you're told, remember the Holocaust, or if you're told that Israel illegally demolishes the homeless of Palestinians,
you're told, remember the Holocaust, the point being that because Jews suffered uniquely,
it somehow excuses these by any other standard crimes. "
