## Jon Stewart kicks off The Daily Show’s election coverage with a wellness check on America’s two chronologically challenged candidates: Joe Biden and Donald Trump.

"These two candidates, they are both similarly challenged, and it is not crazy to think that the
oldest people in the history of the country to ever run for president might have some of these
challenges. Now, Democrats will say that any criticism like this, especially a Biden, is unfair,
because you just don't know Biden, like they know Biden.
President Biden, who I've been around numerous times just in this last year, is sharp. He's focused.
He's bright. He is sharp, intensely probing, and detail oriented, and focused.
This is a man who is sharp, who is on top of his game, who knows what's going on.
He's smart. He's on his game. I was in almost every meeting with the president, and the president
was in front of and on top of it all, coordinating and directing leaders who are in charge of America's
national security, not to mention our allies around the globe.
Did anyone film that?
Because if you're...
If you're telling us behind a scene, see, it's sharp and full of energy, and on top of it,
really in control and leading, you should film that.
That would be good to show to people, instead of a TikTok, where he goes,
we see he's in charge. You see, I like cookies.
Of course, when it comes to Republicans, they've got a different strategy for their 77-year-old candidate.
Well, first of all, Donald Trump is not an old man.
He's an old man! He is objectively an old man on a human scale. Trump is objectively old.
If he was a tortoise, I would tell him as a tortoise at 77, oh, young man, go off and enjoy college.
But he's not a tourist. He's not a tortoise. That is not being agious. That is being human life's
fan-ist.
One thing we know for certain is this.
We have two candidates who are chronologically outside the norm of anyone who has run
for the presidency in this country, in the history of this country. They are the oldest people
ever to run for president, breaking by only four years the record that they set!
The last time they ran, they are at the age. They are objectively old. They're at the age.
There are no more age-related milestones to hit. They got the error or peak card. They've got
social security. They've got their movie discounts. There is no, oh, wait till you hit 88,
you get to drink and drive. No!
The only thing left to them is a today's show smuckers shout out.
You know what? I think we've got a new name for our election coverage.
In Dec. 2024, Antiques Roadshow.
We're not suggesting neither man is vibrant, productive, or even capable.
But they're both stretching the limits of being able to handle the toughest job in the world.
What's crazy is thinking that we are the ones as voters who must silence concerns and criticisms.
It is the candidates job to assuage concerns, not the voters job not to mention them.
And look, I'm not trying to be cruel. I don't want to have to do this on my first day.
Come over here.
Look at me.
Look what time I've brought.
Give the kids a treat of a lunar surface here.
Look at this.
I'm like 20 years younger than these.
This.
Look at this. They wish.
You know.
You know, you know, there's a truth.
And if you think like, oh, 20 years isn't that long, this is me 20 years ago.
Yeah.
I agree.
And perhaps it was my mistake for sleeping in a meat dehydrator.
Look, Joe Biden isn't Donald Trump. He hasn't been indicted as many times.
Hasn't had as many fraudulent businesses.
Or been convicted in a civil trial for sexual assault.
Or been ordered to pay defamation and had his charity's disbanded.
Or stiff to shit down a blue collar.
Trace many tired.
Should we even get to the grab the pussy stuff? Probably not.
But the stakes of this election don't make Donald Trump's opponent
less subject to scrutiny.
It actually makes him more subject to scrutiny.
If the barbarians are at the gate, you want Conan standing on the ramparts not
So what's the good news?
That was not rhetorical framing.
I'm literally asking you.
Look, the next nine months or so
and maybe more than that depending on the coup schedule.
They're going to suck.
You're going to be getting emails with insane subject lines like
hello, John. It's Chuck Schumer.
Donald Trump is right behind you with a knife.
Don't name.
You're going to get indicted with robo calls and push polls and real polls.
People are going to tell you to rock the vote and be the vote and vote the vote and finger-bang the vote.
And it's all going to make you feel like Tuesday, November 5th is the only day that matters.
And that day does matter.
But man, November 6th, ain't nothing to sneeze at or November 7th.
If your guy loses bad things might happen.
But the country is not over.
And if your guy wins, the country is in no way saved.
I've learned one thing over these last nine years.
And I was glib at best and probably dismissive at worst about this.
The work of making this world resemble one that you would prefer to live in is a lunch
pale fucking job day in and day out.
Where thousands of committed, anonymous, smart, and dedicated people bang on closed doors
and pick up those that are fallen and grind away on issues till they get a positive result.
And even then have to stay on to make sure that result holds.
So the good news is I'm not saying you don't have to worry about who wins the election.
I'm saying you have to worry about every day before it and every day after.
Forever.
Or wrong.
On the plus side, I am told that at some point the sun will run out of hydrogen."
