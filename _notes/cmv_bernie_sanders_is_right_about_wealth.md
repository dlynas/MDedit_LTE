## CMV: Bernie Sanders is right about wealth inequality.

> I am a hardcore capitalist. I am not rich... I simply just believe in this. I like the idea that I can become a billionaire through hard work. So the idea of Bernie taxing the hell out of billionaires seemed very off putting to me. Because while it may help me now I thought, IF I got to that position in my life (disregarding the chances of that actually happening) it would just be ridiculous. The taxes I mean.

		>An apt comparison would be homeownership. If you buy your house for $300,000 and you get it appraises 10 years later and it's worth $500,000 that doesn't mean you had an additional income of $200,000 over those 10 years. You wouldn't declare that income until you sold
		
		Funny you should use this as an example because every single year you pay taxes on the value of your house.  It's called property tax and it's essentially a wealth tax on the middle class.  And when the value of your house goes up, it get's reassessed and you pay more.  The idea that a wealth tax is impossible is pure fiction.
		
		The major complaints are under-reporting, and change of value of things like art.  This is nonsense.  
		
		1) Assessments can and should be low, anything is more than nothing.  
		
		2) People don't keep the majority of wealth in art or hard to assess items, its vastly property and financial assets

		>The farmer's land, his means of production, is currently taxed with a "property" tax. (It's actually a "real estate" tax. The tax is on the full value of the property, even if he has huge mortgage so that in effect, he owns only a small portion of it.) However, all the money held by the investor class in stocks and bonds, their "means of production," escapes untaxed.

			But you owning land deprives someone else from using that land possibly more productively than you. Land value taxes encourage efficient use of land. You owning stock in a company doesn't deprive anyone else from using that stock more effectively than you. Most economists, even very very liberal ones, would say land value taxes are good and wealth taxes are bad. If you want rich people to pay more in taxes, increase the rates of when they convert their wealth to liquid currency (income and capital gains for example).

				Couldn’t someone leverage the equity to make more money through a loan or something? And couldn’t one person theoretically do it more efficiently than someone else? I don’t get the deprivation angle you’re going for.

				* 🟪 **[stoneimp](https://www.reddit.com/user/stoneimp)** ⬆️ 3 _(2020-03-08 09:18:17)_

					When you own land, what you really own is exclusive rights to it's use. What you really own is the ability for only you to build on it or use it's resources. That deprives others from using it more effectively. If someone home sits on top of a huge copper deposit, as much as you value your house, society as a whole would benefit from you moving and extracting that copper. You refusing to do that is depriving someone else from extracting that economic worth out of that land. Or imagine a corporation was sitting on a big plot of land near the center of DC (where land value is high because of its location near other things), not building anything on it. I'm sure many commuters would appreciate an apartment complex being built there. So we tax a lands value because it's a way of incentivise a use it or lose it mentality to land, which is inherently scarce, we can't create more of it.
					
					That's not equivalent to owning stock in a company or other assets. We don't need to encourage a use it or lose it mentality with stock, how would someone use stock more effectively than someone else? It either pays dividends or you can sell it later. You owning a printing press for example does deprive people from using that printing press, but it is not inherently scarce, you could buy a different one, or if it was exclusive technology at the time, wait until the patent expires and build your own. Plus we have sales taxes that we extract some value from the temporary deprivation of value from others.

				I apologize if my response came off as hostile to you in any way.  I just get really frustrated with this narrative that IMO is just being pushed by the wealthy and people seem to just swallow it.  I'm not against other additional options and I actually think that the wealth tax should be quite small, maybe between 1-4%.  I also agree with another person on the thread that said the system is broken and needs to be fixed independently of a wealth tax.  That said, I see no other way of dealing with the wealth that has already been sequestered except maybe a massive overhaul to the estate tax and enforcement, even adam smith said that a massive sequestration of wealth is anathema to captalism.

					Sometimes, we have to live with the problems that we have created, and move into a new paradigm where we stop the problems of the past from happening again. We can work towards solutions that limit the power that wealthy have in society (totally on board with that) and we can work on creating a healthier society that values things like happiness more than wealth in the future. We can also prevent the wealth inequality from passing to the next generation through modifications to the estate taxes (I have other strong beliefs here). Finally, we can tax consumption of things that are damaging to society (carbon, extreme luxuries) to help incentive society into the right direction. Once we have tried this low hanging fruit, tackled the easier wins, and have society moving in a better direction, perhaps we can return to a wealth tax as an idea. For now, it is far to complex and radical of a change IMO to be tried as the first step in fixing our problems.

			> 1) Assessments can and should be low, anything is more than nothing. 
			
			What is being taxed now is already more than nothing so this seems like a filler argument that doesn't add to the conversation.  
			
			&amp;nbsp;
			
			> 2) People don't keep the majority of wealth in art or hard to assess items, its vastly property and financial assets  
			
			You still have to figure that out though because if you make those items exceptions people will potentially use hard to assess items to store their money.  There is always a way around in a single point of valuation system.  
			
			Do NOT underestimate people's ability to circumvent a system.  My mind goes to how some gambling parlors reward you in trinkets that you take next door to "sell" to them for money.  Because they are not technically the same business they avoid the gambling laws in their country that prohibit cash money payouts.
			
			&amp;nbsp;
			
			And that's assuming they stay in the country with the money.  What if they took their money out of country and stored it somewhere where it was technically someone else's wealth?  [What if they lobbied in another country to make loopholes or tax havens?](https://youtu.be/SFKnv1YzI3k)  I'll say it again, single point of valuation systems will always be worked around.  VAT is good because VAT happens at so many levels that cannot be avoided that it's nearly impossible to dodge.  
			
			&amp;nbsp;
			
			> 3) The number of people that need to be assessed is relatively small  
			
			Where are you drawing your cutoff?  Is it only billionaires or is it millionaires?  Because when you're talking net worth someone who makes 100k a year can easily be a millionaire.  But we don't consider 100k to be super rich.  However a Net worth of 1 million is already top 10% of all net worth and is over 10 times the median net worth of 97k.
			
			So are we going to go full on 1% only?  Top 1% starts at about 10 million.  Top 1% is 3.7 million people.  While that's small relative to the total population that's still 3.7 million people.  3.7 million people who need in depth assessments of valuations that can change significantly every year is still a ridiculous amount of work.  You'd need alot of manpower for that alone.  
			
			&amp;nbsp;
			
			> 4) What if my house is assessed at 500k and I pay property taxes on 500k and then I sell it for 400k? Nothing, does that mean we do away with property taxes? No  
			
			It's always so nice that after paying 200k to finally own a home you'll still end up paying a couple thousand a year for the privilege of having purchased it.  For your average person a home is not an income generator, it's something that costs you money and it's something you invested a significant amount of your financial income for decades into and you're never done paying with it.
			
			If you bought a ~200k home all your purchase did is lower your monthly payment from like $1,000 a month to $200 a month.  Home maintenance costs average out at around $800 a year.  So the cost of your house actually goes from something like $1,800 a year on average to $1,000 a month on average.
			
			&amp;nbsp;
			
			You never actually own it and you need to pay not only maintenance on it but to keep paying for the house itself (via property taxes) forever or it gets taken from you and then sold for the profit for others.  [You can lose your house and have it sold out from under you for less than $9 lol.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unpaid-property-taxes-cost-michigan-residents-their-house/)
			
			&amp;nbsp;
			
			So while this serves your point, TBH property taxes are actually pretty shitty for the average citizen.  It's a no win game.  You pay decades of income for the privilege of paying slightly less to live there and never actually own something.  Especially since your house can just get eminent domained and the "just compensation" is often well below market value.
			
			I'd say a car is a better example, but they depreciate considerably and also require maintenance.  At least you actually own a car and don't have to keep paying for more than maintenance once it's paid off though.

				The point of the post above is it’s not going to help if implementing it is so complicated and burdensome on society as a whole. All company owners selling large amounts of stock every year hurts everyone with a 401k and hurts the governance of that company. For private industries it means annual fire sales of business assets, that makes jobs less secure since your department might get liquidated to pay taxes.
				
				So the whole point is it doesn’t hurt just billionaires it hurts everyone
				
				I also want to note I’m not complaining about billionaires paying more taxes, specifically considering wealth instead of income creates these issues. Income is generally in a form that is transferable which makes paying taxes on it straightforward. Wealth is not like that, wealth has deep roots that are not easy to cut without damaging the rest of the forest

			How do we do that, though, without massive invasions of privacy? Income is generally reported by employers, but wealth?
			
			You would need to have your assets appraised, and disclosed to the government. The government would need to be able to obtain bank account information for every citizen... and it still wouldn't keep the wealthy from skirting what you propose. Trusts or the like, for example.
			
			And then a portion of everyone's property goes to the government (in the form of money). Year after year. It amounts to nationalizing the more successful businesses and people. It requires extremely invasive breaches of our Right to Privacy.
			
			It's hard to justify that.

				I feel like it's important to clarify that the general *you* is not exactly appropriate here, since the tax would only apply to the .01 percent of people who have household wealth greater than $32 million.
				
				Reporting household wealth to the IRS is already something wealthy people have to do to pay the estate tax. Bernie's plan uses the estate tax model and applies it to living people on an annual basis. With regard to trusts, the plan specifies that assets transferred into a trust are considered owned by the grantor of the trust until that person's death. The plan also includes exit taxes that make it much more expensive to move the money offshore than to pay the tax.

					So, then, it's ok to infringe on the citizenry's right to privacy, as long as it is no more than 1 out of every 10,000? Are there any other rights this applies to? Protection vs cruel and unusual punishment? Can we torture, as long as we limit it to 31,000 people or less? What about protection vs unreasonable search and seizure? If we limit it to just 31,000 people annually, can police just barge on in to search you?
					
					I am not sure if the "it's not that many people" is an argument that applies to denial of human rights.
					
					>Reporting household wealth to the IRS is already something wealthy people have to do to pay the estate tax.
					
					No person ever has to report their wealth for estate tax. Not a single one. Because estate tax is not levied on the living. And the dead don't have many of the rights that are afforded to the living.
					
					So, no. The only reporting that is done on wealth is when the estate of a corpse is disclosed.
					
					>Bernie's plan uses the estate tax model and applies it to living people on an annual basis.
					
					And that is the big difference. It would be applied to living people **with rights**. Unless you want to argue that everyone who buries a corpse should be charged with unlawful detainment, for denying that corpse's basic freedoms.
					
					The living and the dead have VASTLY different rights.

				Whats worse is by Bernie’s own estimates his plan would eventually eliminate all billionaires. I think he made an estimate of taking 18 years. He would also reduce the wealth of many multi millionaires with less a billion. 
				
				This means his tax base for wealth tax revenues is shrinking every year, in 15 years it will be a small percentage of the revenues in year 1.
				
				But guess what, his spending plans that this wealth tax are to fund do not drop every year. He kills his funding but not his spending.
				
				We need to raise revenues just to pay the bills today, never mind all of Bernie’s additional spending plans.
				
				
				**Ideas to increase revenues to fund current $1 trillion a year deficit**
				
				All but one will hit the very wealthy the hardest.
				
				Increase the estate tax by large escalating percentages to avoid becoming an aristocracy. Top rates of over 70%.
				
				Tax dividends at much higher marginal rates. 
				
				Tax stock buybacks like dividends. (a corporate tax). 
				
				Tax merger and acquisitions over a billion or two by 30%. 
				
				Tax corporate cash reserves over x percentage of annual sales.. (Forces a dividend payment, which will be taxed at a higher rate.)
				
				Have a minimum 15% corporate tax on annual net positive cash flow.  (will greatly increase corporate taxes with out raising rates on profits.)
				
				Over 3 years make a full inflation adjustments on federal gas tax.  It is now a fixed amount per gallon (not a percentage of cost) and has not been raised since the the 90’s, meanwhile cost of road maintenance has increased every year. (It’s meant to be a road infrastructure use tax)

			I see you're giving a few deltas out for people essentially saying 'Bernie's right about the problem but his solutions won't work'. 
			
			I suggest you might want value a bit of research into the proposals themselves and the argument by the economists and other experts who support them, as they have actually thought a lot of this through and have answers to many of the objections raised.
			
			The Champions of the status quo on the moderate left and across the right like to use this tactic of asserting progressive alternatives 'wont work' while depending on the listener's unlikeliness to look into it too hard. The bigger the change proposed the more outlandish and unlikely it seems, but obviously the proposals must have some merit otherwise so many educated people, who debate this stuff for a living, wouldn't be sticking by it.

				Exactly, there are many major economists that have argued in favor of things like the wealth tax, often with large scale analysis behind it. Of course, 40+ page economics papers don’t tend to be conducive to a Reddit change my view.
				
				For the wealth tax, check these out:
				
				https://prospect.org/power/billionaire-class-created-failed-wealth-tax-giving-pledge/ (this is a good article that examines how the ultrawealthy who have been dedicated to giving away money, have still been seeing their net worth rise, since return on capital is quite high and giving away billions is a large logistical feat - i.e. their form of wealth taxing themselves isn't working)

				https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century
				
				https://taxjusticenow.org/
				
				One thing worth noting - if Bernie's wealth tax was passed in 1982, Bezos would still have over 50 billion dollars today. I agree it is a difficult thing to implement, and some countries have failed (I believe due in part to setting their wealth level too low, whereas Bernie only taxes the 0.1%). This is discussed in some of the links above.
				
				This book would be the best overview: https://taxjusticenow.org/#/book
				
				As far as not believing in taxes on property - we already have that, and it acts as an effective wealth tax at a higher percentage for middle class than the rich (since their home is a much larger percent of wealth).

					Interesting links.  I'm not going to read all of them in one sitting, but I picked one interesting one for now (http://bostonreview.net/edward-wolff-wealth-tax) to think about.
					
					It's quite dated (many of the countries it lists following the wealth tax have since repealed it - Germany in 1997 for example - AFAIK only Spain, Norway, Switzerland and Belgium still have it in Europe) and proposes to follow the Swiss system.  Switzerland is a super special country and using it as a basis for Sander's plan is nonsense.  The wealth tax in Switzerland is on the Canton level and is thereby super easy to avoid.  Furthermore, you can offset any debts you have, so in practice you simply keep a permanent mortgage on your home(s) to avoid paying.  I also believe it's fairly low and significantly lower than Sander's rate.
					
					> I believe due in part to setting their wealth level too low, whereas Bernie only taxes the 0.1%
					
					I think this is a super interesting point which I've somehow not encountered before.  I think it has merit.  The other major difference AFAIK is that Bernie's rate is significantly higher.  I'm not confident such a higher rate increases the chance of success.
					
					I certainly agree that the academic discussion around this topic is interesting, but the practical failures of the system in so many attempts requires a response (maybe one of your links faces this problem directly).  Setting the wealth level higher is certainly an attempt (which does suffer the downside of generating less revenue) but I'm not very convinced it solves the fundamental issues, especially at the rate Sander's is proposing.

						I'd suggest following up that one with the other Boston Review article - which is quite recent. That addresses many of the issues with enforcing a wealth tax, including the comparisons to Europe. Additional reading on that here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/wealth-taxes-often-failed-in-europe-they-wouldnt-here/2019/10/25/23a59cb0-f4ff-11e9-829d-87b12c2f85dd_story.html
						
						The rate question is addressed in that article as well, but if you really want the in depth discussion on this, including analysis of the history of US taxes, other forms of tax, etc, check out this book: https://wwnorton.com/books/the-triumph-of-injustice
						
						The Brookings paper is shorter, and goes into much more technical analysis on the wealth tax, setting rates, the issues with enforcement and capital flight, etc.
						
						Thomas Piketty is probably a must read for understanding the 1% -> 8% rate advocated by Sanders (this rate only effects people with tens of billions since Sanders proposes a progressive wealth tax) and some tax experts. This is because rate of return on capital has been much higher than economic growth, so for a tax to really reduce current inequality, you'd have to tax at higher than the gap, since wealth grows at a fantastic rate once you are a billionaire (see the first link and how billionaires are struggling to lose net worth after deciding to donate their money).

						My issue with that survey question is that it treats this as an either/or, when no policy proposals suggests not using current reformed tax methods as well.
						
						As Saez says in that survey: current “wealth” tax structures (capital gains, estate tax, etc) can have wealth taxation delayed for decades. Right now, if a wealth tax were enacted, Zuckerberg would be paying on his wealth - meanwhile with estate or capital gains, a large portion of his wealth may not see taxation until decades after it has been earned. Between the time of his initial major gain in wealth, and his taxation, that wealth is generating return on investment, so he could be becoming wealthier and wealthier for decades before actually paying the tax. This compounding wealth generation would be mitigated by having wealth tax at present, so that portion of wealth doesn’t compound into an even larger amount, while at the same time that tax revenue can be used to address real current problems that may have even been caused by the things that gained him his wealth (paying for tech regulation, etc).
						
						As well, in the time frame of decades, the structure in which he gained wealth may have changed. For instance, using immense wealth to influence policy to the effect of cutting at capital gains/estate tax as has been done the last 40 years. The delay of time for traditional taxes gives the rich ample ways to carefully avoid the tax, either through loopholes or even direct policy influence.
						
						The actual final question itself is incredibly broad (as some participants themselves point out), and simply states, “A public policy goal that could be accomplished with a well-enforced wealth tax could be equally accomplished with modifications to the existing federal taxes - for example, revising the estate tax and/or capital gains.” The issue is: *what* public policy goal are they talking about? There are many goals to consider with a wealth tax. How do we know each economists considered them all? Which one in particular were they imagining as the example public policy goal? What changes to the existing federal taxes do they imagine? The question hides much of the nuance, where you can have various people being lumped into the agree/disagree group, while talking about entirely different and contradictory reasons for agreeing/disagreeing.

				I will admit that I am biased against Bernie, but there are a few problems with your answer. 
				1. The phrase "but obviously the proposals must have some merit otherwise so many educated people... wouldn't be sticking by it" is the appeal to authority and appeal to majority fallacy. Just because intelligent people support it does not mean on it's own that it is good, and nobody is claiming his ideas are without merit. 
				2. The idea that listening to best people supporting it would present the idea fairly as well is also flawed. Why say something like Champions of the status quo, and imply that the naysayers are biased, and imply that the best supporters of the left are not also biased? The arguments I have seen posted here have plenty of good arguments against subjects like the wealth tax, that I have not read a good rebuttal to, but perhaps I have not read deep enough into the comments.
				
				Wouldn't the best solution be to listen to both the naysayers and the supporters and come to a conclusion on your own?

			You've missed 50% of the problem (apart from the fact that the only wealth taxes are focused on).
			
			The fact that wealth is hard to measure and that the richest among us tend to derive most of their income from wealth isn't a coincidence. Partly, the wealthy hold most of their income in wealth precisely because it is hard to tax. You've actually hit the nail on the head, in the sense that you've clearly outlined the largest issue today in inequality.
			
			What a wealth tax represents more than anything is a firmer stance on enforcing taxes. People with lots of money move income into wealth (preferring stock benefits over income bonuses) precisely because it is hard to tax. Why do you think overvalued art is bought in the first place? Why do you think people set up shady trusts offshore? To avoid taxes. A wealth taxes addresses this problem by removing these channels or making them less attractive. And Norway very effectively addresses this issue by keeping people from moving wealth abroad. America does not.
			
			Inequality is a problem and a wealth tax is a method to resolve it. Not a perfect one, but still better than doing nothing.
			
			It's true that wealth taxes might be difficult to appraise in some cases, but this isn't a reason to throw them out the window. Saying it's hard to tax wealth doesn't mean that wealth concentrated among a very small amount of people isn't a problem. Would you say having dictators isn't a problem if it is hard to measure power?

			It won’t reduce ownership; people worth decimals less than Bezos used to pay up to 90% of their income to taxes, back when America was originally “great”. The main issue is getting the rich to play ball and stop buying out our representatives. The laws can never change or be negotiated if they continue stonewalling by enforcing the wildly false narrative that rich people not paying taxes is good for the economy. 
			
			Even though the rich already pay some 90% of the taxes, that to me shows they can afford to pay a tad more. I could use my 33% to drag myself out of debt and establish myself in the economy I am apparently at fault for ruining. It’s either that or they need to give a national baseline wage increase across the board. One or the other.

		> the wealthy need to have their income and spending taxes more
		
		Do you mean they need the "taxes" more (as in, they need to keep their money more), or was that a typo and you meant to say that they need to have their income and spending *taxed* more?
		
		> What about more esoteric assets, like private businesses, property, buildings, art, etc
		
		There's already a precedent for that: property taxes.  People often have different ideas of what a property is worth.  Different buyers would pay vastly different amounts for a given property, based on the location, the view, the safety (as in, flood danger), etc.  Most governments also have a way to dispute property tax assessments, so there's also precedent for what to do if someone disagrees with their wealth tax assessment.
		
		> Who is going to find this whole operation?
		
		You mean find hidden wealth?
		
		> What about people right at or near the threshold?
		
		Any wealth they have over the threshold is subject to the wealth tax.  If you only have 30 million dollars, you don't pay anything.  If you have $33m, you pay wealth tax only on the amount over $32m, so 1% of 1m, or $10k, an effective wealth tax rate of 0.03%.
		
		> Is the government going to have to keep an indexed list of all citizen's assets and liabilities so they can track how much someone is worth to know who to apply the wealth tax too?
		
		The government already has much of that information.  They could easily have a lot more if they just required insurance companies to report what people are claiming as assets to be insured.  But, just like income tax, the government won't necessarily know.  It will have to rely on people following the rules.  Some people will regularly break them, like waitstaff who almost always under-report their tips on their taxes.  But, of course, if someone is audited and they are found to have under-reported their wealth, they will be forced to pay a punitive fine.
		
		> Firstly, what does that do to Amazon share prices that are surely in most pensions and US index funds?
		
		It will give fund managers a chance to buy Amazon stock at a discount near tax time.
		
		> is it really fair for him to slowly lose the control he does have in a company he founded?
		
		Yes.  If he wanted to keep control he was never under any obligation to go public.  He chose to go public.  That meant he both lost controlling interest in the company, and made a fortune.  Now he would have to give up a small fraction of that fortune, and lose a bit more control.
		
		The vast majority of private companies won't hit this $32m limit, and will never be subject to a wealth tax.  Once you're listed on the stock exchange, you can potentially become much more wealthy, but in exchange you have to give up some control of your company.  If you do get ultra wealthy after going public, you might have to pay a wealth tax.
		
		> What about other wealthy people that would lose control of their companies by selling stock to cover the wealth tax?
		
		Bernie Sanders' wealth tax proposal only applies to people worth $32m or more.  We're not talking about someone with a hair salon or pizza shop needing to sell the shop to cover this tax.
		
		The proposed wealth tax would be 1% on the $32m-$50m wealth and 2% on the $50m-$250m wealth.  That's significantly lower than typical rates on a savings account.  The average annualized total return for the S&amp;P 500 over the last 90 years is about 9.8%  So, if someone worth $200m had $150m in their business and $50m in index funds, they could easily make their ~$4m payment using the index funds, and never have to touch their ownership of their main business.
		
		As for someone like Bezos, isn't it a good thing that they're forced to slowly sell off their multi-billion-dollar companies?  Wealth inequality is a big problem, but I'm sure that the power someone has from controlling a multi-billion-dollar company is much worse.  What if Bezos got a speeding ticket when driving through rural Montana and out of annoyance decided that Amazon would no longer ship to Montana?
		
		> How do we value that business and how does the owner extract the wealth from that business to pay the tax?
		
		Isn't this the exact same scenario as property taxes?  If someone is assessed a high property tax and has no liquid wealth, they may be forced to sell or reverse-mortgage the property.  
		
		> What if this person cannot sell the art because no one will pay the price the owner or appraiser thinks it is worth?
		
		Again, the same issue as property taxes.  Sometimes the assessment is wrong and it has to be re-assessed.
		
		> What if the art is sentimental and the owner values it higher than the appraisal?
		
		Again, you pay no wealth taxes on your first $32m, 1% on $32-$50m and 2% on $50-$250m.  If you have sentimental art worth $200m and can't find $4m somewhere to cover it, I guess you'll have to sell.
		
		This is the kind of decision that people often face over property taxes.  Take someone who lives in the home they grew up in Seattle.  Housing costs go up because Bezos and other Amazonians keep buying up property.  Eventually someone can't afford to pay for the property taxes where they live, so they have to sell and move.
		
		Why should regular people have to deal with a tough decision like that, but billionaires get to hold onto sentimental pieces of art valued at $250m?
		
		tl;dr: We already effectively have wealth taxes, they're just called "property tax" and only apply to wealth in the format of buildings.  As a result, anybody wealthy enough to have a house pays a wealth tax.  For most people, the wealth tax covers a significant fraction of their total wealth, since most of their wealth is in their home.  Once you get rich enough, you start owning things of value other than just property.  Once that happens, less and less of your property is subject to this wealth tax, so your effective wealth tax rate goes down and down.
		
		Jeff Bezos will presumably pay property tax on his new $150m house.  Assuming his property tax is about 1%, that means he's paying $1.5m/year in "wealth" taxes (a.k.a. property taxes).  Given that his net worth is something like $120b, his effective wealth tax rate will be about 0.00125%

			I'm not sure that that is a good parallel. Property follows a pretty easy formula based on the sales of homes near you and the historical value of your home. Private companies can theoretically be done the same way through comparables, but any good private equity analyst will tell you that it is a poor way to do it on its own. A LOT of work and due diligence goes into the valuation of private firms and that's a big reason why PE funds and investment banks can make so much money. Any office that is trying to value every private company with an owner worth more than 10M will receive appeals and potentially lawsuits on most of them.

			Insurance companies only insure assets and companies are only worth their book value to an insurance company. If you are suggesting net worth of an individual is only tied to their book and not the market valuation, you are going to significantly undervalue most people that this tax would hit. For example, Amazon has a book to price ratio of about 20 and Bezos would only be worth about 6 billion and not 121 billion.

			That doesn't make sense. Why penalize someone for allowing regular people to buy a piece of a company's means of production? Amazon pays generous stock and option packages to their employees as do many public companies. This gives their employees a real reason to want to see their company succeed since they are also owners in their company's production. 
			
			Also, it is still unrealized wealth. He can't "spend" amzn shares, and he was proportionally hit with larger capital gains taxes after amzn ipo'ed.

			This is actually somewhere where I disagree with the person you were responding to. Bezos wouldn't sell to the general market and risk driving down the price by hitting it with a 12B  sell order. He would sell it in private transaction sto parties with the appetite to buy it in large chunks. This would consist of major banks, other ultra-wealthy, and worst of all: sovereign wealth funds.

				> Any office that is trying to value every private company with an owner worth more than 10M will receive appeals and potentially lawsuits on most of them.
				
				Of the things mentioned, the valuation of private companies would definitely be the hardest.  You can't really know what a private company is worth until someone tries to take it public and you see what people are actually willing to pay for it.
				
				When you're talking about tens of millions of dollars, appeals and lawsuits seem lucky.  There would likely be some frivolous ones too, unless you had to pay court fees / reappraisal costs if you lost your appeal / court case.
				
				It seems likely there would be some kind of standard formula applied based on things shown on accounting balance sheets.  Then it would only be a dispute about intangibles, like the actual value of any patents or copyrights the business owned, or the value of their trade secrets.
				
				If a business owner wanted to lower his/her wealth taxes as much as possible, he/she'd probably try to minimize the value of those things.  But, that could come and bite the owner in the ass if they ever had to sue for patent infringement or copyright violation.
				
				I know Switzerland has wealth taxes, but I don't know how they handle things like that.  Maybe the Sanders Administration could learn from them.
				
				> Insurance companies only insure assets and companies are only worth their book value to an insurance company.
				
				I was thinking of using an insurance company's valuation for things like art, buildings, antique cars, etc.  It would be useful for things like that because if an owner tries to claim his da Vinci painting is only worth $100k to reduce his/her wealth tax burden, the insurance on that painting would only cover $100k if it's stolen.
				
				> That doesn't make sense. Why penalize someone for allowing regular people to buy a piece of a company's means of production?
				
				You shouldn't think of it as a penalty.  It's not a penalty, it's a tax.
				
				In addition, they're not being taxed because they are allowing people to buy into their company.  They're being taxed because they're incredibly wealthy.  I'm simply saying it's a red herring to claim that it forces people to give up control over their companies.
				
				Bezos isn't worth $120b *despite* only owning 16% of Amazon, he's worth $120b *because* he only owns 16% of Amazon.  His decisions in the past to dilute his ownership to grow the company are the reasons he's so rich today.
				
				If someone values their control of the company more than they value growing the company or getting rich, they're much less likely to ever hit the $32m value where the wealth tax starts kicking in.  So, when you're saying that people might have to sell off part of the company they own to pay their wealth taxes, that's mostly going to affect people who have already chosen to sell off part of their companies.
				
				> Amazon pays generous stock and option packages to their employees as do many public companies
				
				Amazon pays generous stock and option packages to *some* of their employees.  Other employees don't get to take bathroom breaks.  The benefits of taxing the ultra-wealthy would certainly be felt by Amazon employees who are so poor they have to work at a company that doesn't let them take bathroom breaks.
				
				As for the white collar workers, how would it hurt them if their boss has to sell off a few of his shares to pay his wealth tax?  Unless those employees are worth more than $32m themselves, they won't be paying a wealth tax, and won't have to sell their Amazon shares.

					Let me hit this one first because I find the story about how this happened kinda funny. They used to be paid  stock incentives before the minimum wage increase (even though only some new employees actually made the minimum wage). The stock options were a cheap way to boost warehouse pay without actually affecting the book. Since a minimum wage required them to raise the floor, the average hourly Amazon worker actually got a pay cut of about 1k per year, more if you look at how they weakened their cash incentive pay structure to pay for the minimum wage.

					Both generally follow the same formula. Lawsuits are usually over lost revenue, not the immediate value of the patent. The value of those patents would be low until someone violated the patent. You're going to see a lot more patent trolls if you want to tax intangibles.
					
					>I was thinking of using an insurance company's valuation for things like art, buildings, antique cars, etc. It would be useful for things like that because if an owner tries to claim his da Vinci painting is only worth $100k to reduce his/her wealth tax burden, the insurance on that painting would only cover $100k if it's stolen.
					
					Intangibles aren't insured for obvious reasons. So I was wrong, if you used insurance valuation styles, you have to decrease Amazon's asset value by another 36 billion. Amazon is currently worth around 97 billion in net assets and I'm pretty sure I'm overestimating. If you take another 36B out of that, you're looking at a valuation of about 61B. That's nowhere near the market's 946B. Amazon wouldn't care that it is only valued at 61B since that's all they want insured anyway.
					
					>If someone values their control of the company more than they value growing the company or getting rich, they're much less likely to ever hit the $32m value where the wealth tax starts kicking in. So, when you're saying that people might have to sell off part of the company they own to pay their wealth taxes, that's mostly going to affect people who have already chosen to sell off part of their companies.
					
					Lol, you haven't met a lot of rich people. Let me tell you that the whole "do what you love, you'll never work a day and it'll make you rich" is a myth. Rich people are rich because they are lucky, opportunistic, and usually ultra-paranoid about losing control. Bezos is more of an outlier. I'd look further, but I'd say *most* companies that have their founder at the helm usually have a 51%+ stake. Two examples off the top of my head are Zuckerberg and Bloomberg. Private equity is usually a lot worse.
					
					>I know Switzerland has wealth taxes, but I don't know how they handle things like that. Maybe the Sanders Administration could learn from them.
					
					That's easy, their wealth tax is =1%> and assets maintained there pay less than what they would here already. I'm not sure you want a Swiss tax model. There is a good reason that they are still considered a tax haven. Most countries in Europe that had a wealth tax scrapped them because of issues that are being brought up here. The biggest being that many companies simply moved their capital out of the country. In France that caused unemployment to rise by 2%.
					
					
					
					I'm not saying that wealthy people shouldn't pay more, but a wealth tax is a bad way to go about it. It would never get implemented in the US and was only suggested for political flash by Sanders and Warren. The best way is really to improve the capital gains system. It's still a wealth tax of sorts, but is harder to avoid and doesn't directly affect business operations.

I'm definitely not saying that formula would be very accurate, but it if the alternative is that each company is independently evaluated with a team of accountants and lawyers.  I couldn't see the government doing that.

						Isn't that like saying that the value of the car was low until someone stole it?
						
						> You're going to see a lot more patent trolls if you want to tax intangibles.
						
						The patent system needs a major overhaul anyhow.  Maybe that should be done at the same time as the creation of a wealth tax.
						
						> Amazon is currently worth around 97 billion in net assets and I'm pretty sure I'm overestimating.
						
						Sorry if this wasn't clear, but I'm only talking about things like art, buildings, antique cars, etc.  When calculating the contribution towards someone's total wealth that those represent, the government could use the same valuation the owner gave to the insurance company.
						
						I'm not suggesting you use that to provide a value for a public company.  There's already a valuation for a public company: its share price.
						
						Bezos' wealth is almost 100% Amazon, but let's look at someone who inherited a fortune, like a modern day Vanderbilt or a Rockefeller. They probably have a few shares of Standard Oil or some railroad shares.  Since those companies are public, that component of their wealth is pretty easy to calculate.  Then, they will own some art, mansions, antiques, etc.  This is where you can look at the reported insurance value of those things.  Combine the wealth they have from shares in public companies, with the insurance value of the art and antiques, and you have a good idea of their wealth.  You can tax them on that value.
						
						> most companies that have their founder at the helm usually have a 51%+ stake
						
						I don't know if that's true, but very few major companies still have their founders as president or CEO.  I would assume that private equity is different, because part of the deal with going public is that you tend to have to give up more control.
						
						But, even if it is true, as you said, most have 51% or more.  They have already sold off nearly half their companies.  If they wanted more control, they could always try to have the company buy back shares.
						
						The point is, it's a wealth tax.  It's not an attempt to steal a company out from someone, it's a tax on their total wealth.  Similarly, a property tax isn't an attempt to force someone to sell their home, it's simply a tax on the value of that home.
						
						> There is a good reason that they are still considered a tax haven.
						
						Mostly for workers, because the income tax in Switzerland is so much lower than it is in most of the rest of Europe.  One way they manage to balance the books is to have a lower income tax, but to also have a wealth tax.
						
						> Most countries in Europe that had a wealth tax scrapped them because of issues that are being brought up here.
						
						Europe mostly scrapped wealth taxes because they were being imposed on a country-by-country basis, and not Europe-wide.  That would be like NY imposing a wealth tax and NJ not imposing one.  It would simply cause people to move across the border to NJ.  You'd keep the same dollar, same bank accounts, same car, your kids might even be able to keep going to the same schools.  If the entire US imposed a wealth tax, you'd have to move to Europe or Canada to avoid it.  That's a much bigger change.

							>Isn't that like saying that the value of the car was low until someone stole it?
							
							Pretty much, and it's why people try to raise the values of damaged or lost goods when dealing with insurance. But it's a little different. Cars are physical assets with an initial price and an estimated depreciation. Intangibles generally aren't, so they are worth whatever the company wants to say that they're worth. Kinda like how I can say the shitty watercolor art I made in 2nd grade is worth 2 million dollars. For all intents and purposes, it's worth 2 million dollars right up until the moment I try to sell it.
							
							>'m not suggesting you use that to provide a value for a public company. There's already a valuation for a public company: its share price.
							
							That's kinda sketchy though. Market prices for a company can fluctuate wildly throughout the year. Worse if a company reaches insolvency. The guy you responded to explained this already but my point is that we already tax people on the market value of their shares when they sell. You could build a much more stable, cheaper system, that would raise more money in the long term by raising the top capital gains rate. It would have much of the same effect you are looking for.
							
							>I don't know if that's true, but very few major companies still have their founders as president or CEO. I would assume that private equity is different, because part of the deal with going public is that you tend to have to give up more control.

							51% is a significant number for owners. When you own 51% of voting shares, you have unilateral control of the board and people that have it will die on a hill defending it if they risk a hostile takeover. They don't need more than 51% and they will refuse to give up any more.
							
							>The point is, it's a wealth tax. It's not an attempt to steal a company out from someone, it's a tax on their total wealth. Similarly, a property tax isn't an attempt to force someone to sell their home, it's simply a tax on the value of that home.

								> Or keep it a lot simpler and let the market value it by taxing their wealth every time it gets turned into liquid cash.
								
								That doesn't help matters when Bezos gets annoyed at getting a speeding ticket in Montana and decides that nobody in Montana can use Amazon products.
								
								Wealth is power long before it's converted into liquid cash.
								
								> Pretty much, and it's why people try to raise the values of damaged or lost goods when dealing with insurance
								
								They try to raise their assessments of the values of damaged goods, they can't actually change the value of the goods.
								
								> they are worth whatever the company wants to say that they're worth
								
								Well, no, they're not.  They're worth whatever price they'd fetch on the open market.  Because they're not on the market, their value isn't currently known.  That doesn't mean that they're worth whatever the owner claims they are.
								
								> For all intents and purposes, it's worth 2 million dollars right up until the moment I try to sell it.
								
								That's because the value is meaningless up until you tried to sell it.  If you were being taxed on its value, then the value would no longer be meaningless.
								
								> Market prices for a company can fluctuate wildly throughout the year
								
								Yes, but at any moment in time, the value of a company is what people are willing to pay for it at that moment.  Unlike property taxes, you actually have a perfect idea of what a company is worth on a specific day and time because people are actually buying and selling the company at that moment in time.
								
								> we already tax people on the market value of their shares when they sell
								
								That doesn't address the fact that wealth inequality is a problem.  Bezos could choose to convert only $100k of his wealth to liquid cash every year, but his wealth would give him massive power over other people.
								
								I agree that the top capital gains tax should also be raised, but that alone doesn't address wealth inequality.  The only thing that would would be to tax that wealth.
								
								> When you own 51% of voting shares, you have unilateral control of the board
								
								Yes, obviously.  And if you were forced to sell 4% of your remaining shares you'd drop to 49% ownership and lose control.  But you could buy back your company's stock and boost your ownership from 51% to 53% before tax time, then when you sold your shares you'd still have 51%.  Or, you could make outside investments and sell those off to pay your wealth taxes so you didn't need to touch your main company's ownership.  It could be that in a post-wealth-tax world, people would want to keep 60% of their companies rather than 51% to give them some wiggle room when it came to tax time.
								
								> but it will slowly take people's company's away from them
								
								Only if that company is their main source of wealth and they don't have enough other sources of wealth to offset it.  Similarly, a property tax doesn't intend to take people's homes away, but if they get to a point when the house is worth too much, they could be forced to sell their house to pay their property taxes.
								
								> I don't agree with property taxes for many of the same reasons.  They are a big reason why gentrification is such a problem. 
								
								From what I understand, near San Francisco, property taxes are only changed when a home changes hands.  That means that people who have lived in a house for 20 years aren't forced out of it when the neighbourhood around them goes up in value.  But, that causes its own problems.  Many people aren't willing to sell their homes because they've locked in a low property tax.  As a result, they're living in places that are far too big for them, and that they can't afford to properly maintain.  And the lack of available housing drives the prices of anything that does become available way up.  That causes its own set of problems, because now new people coming to SF can't afford housing unless they're making 5x the national average wage.  That drives up all the prices in an area, which means that the people who have lived there all their lives can't afford to go out for dinner.
								
								It's hard to know what things would be without a property tax at all.  The only places I know of that don't have one are niche tax havens for the ultra-rich.  But, since property taxes are basically regressive wealth taxes that kick in once someone's rich enough to own a house, it might be worth trying a non-regressive wealth tax.
								
								> Or renounce your citizenship and move your assets off shore.
								
								If you try to renounce your citizenship and you're worth more than $2m you have to pay an exit tax:
								
								"[The Exit Tax is computed as if you sold all your assets on the day before you expatriated, and had to report the gain](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2017/02/27/renounce-u-s-heres-how-irs-computes-exit-tax/#cc98d34287d4)"  So, that's not going to help you.

									Lol, that'll go over well with his investors. Large companies aren't really used as weapons to settle personal squabbles since the CEO will be punished by their board and the general market.

									I'm not sure I see the difference. Assessed value is real value until you provide a new assessment.

									That's exactly what they're worth. We can squabble over semantics, but if I say that won't sell you my watercolor for anything less than 2 million, it's worth 2 million. If I fold and sell it for 10 bucks, it's suddenly only worth 10 bucks. Until you resell it, it will only be worth 10 bucks as far as the government is involved.
									
									Conversely, if I invent nuclear fusion and say it's only worth 1 cent but I want to hold onto it for sentimental reasons, it's only worth 1 cent.

Unlike property taxes, you actually have a perfect idea of what a company is worth on a specific day and time because people are actually buying and selling the company at that moment in time.
									
									So at what time of year do you use to assess a company's value? 3 weeks ago my spy puts were worth next to nothing on the market, now they're up over 100%. Tomorrow they could be worth pennies again. What number would you tax me on?
									
									>Yes, obviously. And if you were forced to sell 4% of your remaining shares you'd drop to 49% ownership and lose control.

									You'd run the risk of crushing market liquidity as qualified investors stop taking speculative positions. Also, this is basically the reason something like this simply will not make it to the floor. You're going to face the full force of the financial sector rallying against you. Even after 2008, Dodd-Frank was somewhat difficult to push through without the majors input. In 2006, it would have been unthinkable.

									I'm lost, Bezos wields his power as a CEO. That is somewhat tangential to his ownership in Amazon. Bezos wouldn't be able to live his lifestyle on 100k alone. He liquidates a bit over a billion each year to push into other projects like Blue Origin, other companies, and fund his lifestyle. He faces the highest cap gains rate every time he does that.

									That's not the case everywhere. In most places your home is regularly reassessed and you pay taxes on the new value unless you appeal. SF has a lot of problems caused by over intervention and the general growth and type of economy they have. Even if SF didn't have property taxes, people would be getting squeezed out by the market rates for homes being a tantalizing opportunity for people who have been there for a while to leave. It's basically turning into the next New York. Everyone is highly qualified, everyone makes a lot, and everyone wants to be there.

									You're thinking of Florida. That's generally just old people who's entire net worth is tied up in illiquid assets.
									
									
									
									We could achieve the same result with higher capital gains taxes and a better estate tax. Is your problem with those just that money == power? Because you aren't going to solve that with a tiny 2% wealth tax, all you're going to do is throw a big wrench into the system with relatively little to show for it.

										> Assessed value is real value until you provide a new assessment
										
										Except when nothing is riding on the assessment, nobody cares too much whether the assessment is reasonable or not.  If it's part of your tax calculations that's different.
										
										>  invent nuclear fusion and say it's only worth 1 cent but I want to hold onto it for sentimental reasons
										
										Then if you patent it and someone infringes your patent, the most they could owe you is 1 cent.  If it's a trade secret and it's stolen, the damage to you is 1 cent.
										
										> I say that won't sell you my watercolor for anything less than 2 million, it's worth 2 million. If I fold and sell it for 10 bucks, it's suddenly only worth 10 bucks. Until you resell it, it will only be worth 10 bucks as far as the government is involved.
										
										Exactly, so if you want to claim it's worth $2m for insurance purposes, you can't be upset if the government includes that as part of the assessment for a wealth tax.  You can't list it as being worth $10 for the purposes of a wealth tax but $2m for insurance.
										
										> So at what time of year do you use to assess a company's value?
										
										Do what they do for foreign currencies, and use the yearly average value.

										A pretty good sign that it's a good idea.
										
										> That's not the case everywhere. In most places your home is regularly reassessed and you pay taxes on the new value unless you appeal.
										
										I agree, most places have property taxes that are updated every year, which leads to gentrification when sources of money move nearby.  In SF the gentrification isn't the result of people being forced out of their houses because the property taxes get to high.  They're forced out because the general cost of living gets too high.  The effect is the same, but maybe it's a bit slower in SF than in other places.
										
										The only places I know of without a property tax at all are tax havens that serve a niche population of ultra-rich people
										
										Since property tax is basically a regressive form of wealth tax, the fact is that the US basically already has wealth taxes.  The difference is that they're the most severe for middle-class home-owners, and they're insignificant for the ultra-wealthy.
										
										So, what Sanders is proposing is a form of wealth tax that, unlike current wealth taxes, is progressive rather than regressive.
										
										> You're thinking of Florida
										
										Not sure what you mean.  Florida has property taxes.
										
										> higher capital gains taxes and a better estate tax
										
										Capital gains taxes tax income, not wealth.  Estate taxes tax inter-generational wealth transfer.  Property taxes tax wealth, but unfortunately they're regressive taxes.  The only way to tax wealth is a wealth tax, not capital gains taxes, not estate taxes.
										
										> Is your problem with those just that money == power?
										
										Money isn't power, but money confers more power.  And yes, that's my general issue.  And you aren't instantly going to solve it with a 2% wealth tax, but over time you will erode that power with a 2% wealth tax.
										
										> all you're going to do is throw a big wrench into the system
										
										What wrench?  So far you've argued that it's difficult to value things, and that it seems unfair to business owners.  You haven't described any wrench it would throw into the system.
										
										It seems strange that you would argue that a regressive wealth tax (the status quo) is fine, but a progressive wealth tax would throw a wrench into the system.

		Great reply, provided a lot of valuable insight for me and other Bernie supporters I'm sure. I looked up how Bernie would go about the implementation. 
		
		>Under current law, the IRS is already required to assess the net worth of the wealthiest Americans when they pass away, to calculate estate tax liability. A federal wealth tax would require the IRS to make the same assessment on an annual basis for the wealthiest Americans. Steps would also be taken to streamline the process for purposes of the wealth tax.
		
		>For assets that are difficult to appraise, the Treasury Department would have the option of allowing taxpayers to have appraisals done periodically instead of annually. The Treasury Department would establish the average rates of appreciation for several classes of assets. Those appraised only every few years would be assumed to appreciate in the intervening years at the average rate established for their designated class.
		
		>Assets placed in a trust would be treated as owned by the grantor of the trust (by the person giving assets to the trust) until that person’s death.
		
		**How it's enforced** 
		
		>In order to ensure that the wealthy are not able to evade the tax, the proposal includes a number of key enforcement policies. 
		
		>- **First** it would *create a **national wealth registry*** and significant additional third party reporting requirements.
		
		
		>- **Second** it includes an increase in IRS funding for enforcement and requires the IRS to perform an audit of 30 percent of wealth tax returns for those in the 1 percent bracket and a 100 percent audit rate for all billionaires. 
		
		
		>- **Third** the wealth tax includes a 40 percent exit tax on the net value of all assets under $1 billion and 60 percent over $1 billion for all wealthy individual seeking to expatriate to avoid the tax. 
		
		
		>- **Finally** the wealth tax proposal will include enhancements to the international tax enforcement and anti-money laundering regime including the strengthening of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.
		
		After reading your detailed reply and checking the policy details I'm not confused but skeptical that this could be efficiently done. I do agree with the policy on paper and do like the general idea overall but things like creating a wealth registry, additional audits and third party appraisals - I can see lots of headache for everyone involved.
		
		What it looks like this takes aim at specifically is taxing all those caveats you laid out that contribute to "wealth". Meaning for the vast majority of Americans in the middle-class wealth is physical property, tangible assets - whereas the 1% have mostly liquid or intangible assets. I do see the wealth tax being beneficial in terms of tracking and appraising the value here but can see complications with fixed assets like furniture, antiques, etc. 
		
		I feel like after reading some art should already be appraised as it's considered a tangible asset - I don't know how all that works but if things like this are filter out due to as you mention, owner appraisals, sentimental value and other issues then it could be a little easier to assess.

			Thanks. I did read Bernie's stance on the wealth tax on his site. Some of the posts here have changed my view slightly. I am still going to stick to my pragmatic stance that a wealth tax would be difficult to implement, and likely impossible to get through congress.
			
			To your post, I would just address the following;
			
			>  I do see the wealth tax being beneficial in terms of tracking and appraising the value here but can see complications with fixed assets like furniture, antiques, etc.
			
			A lot of people would take issue with this and say it is none of the governments business what people own. I don't believe American's trust the government on a whole enough to let this happen, on both sides of the aisle.

				I see, I should have clarified there - I see value in assessing tangible assets. Just because I know there's a lot of loopholes there in buying new property to skirt taxes or claiming business expense. Beyond that though I do agree. I don't think the IRS should come knocking and appraising paintings, antiques or furniture. 
				
				I have an issue with middle class families being stuck with a tax bill and the burden of paying large sums while companies get away with paying $0. You did lay out how all that works but I don't know liquid assets are just that right - it is "cash on hand" in a way. What I don't like there is then Bezos being stuck paying on it 3 times, that's not fair - but neither is a single family getting stuck paying thousands more in taxes at a higher rate than businesses
				
				I wish it was easier to nail down tax evasion but it's a bit of an art by now - Cayman islands two story office buildings that house 15,000 companies ought to be a thing of the past. Companies opening factories in the US or selling product in the US only to move production to a poor country and exploiting workers ought to be a penalized and a thing of the past too.

		What about taxing reinvestment in businesses? Basically something pretty similar to a VAT policy. For large and highly profitable business like amazon, Apple, google, and the sort. I don’t have a full plan in mind, and I recognize this could lead to issues like offshore investments or slower development, but I think our laws could easily bring the hammer down on offshoring investments if it wanted/needed to, and the lost investment in a private company would be greatly outweighed by the added public services. 
		
		I work in a lab elementary school in a pretty decent district and the school itself is solid, but we are simply not equipped to handle some of the trauma these kids go through and many of them aren’t getting any help at home. Quite a few have lost their parents in the last couple years even. This is a predominately white suburban school. I’m not talking about a title 1 school. We’re not even close to the struggles they face and we still don’t have the resources to provide what people expect. 
		
		I don’t even want extra pay. I’m fine. I’m not walking around with money bags hanging on my shoulder, but I live okay. I do work two jobs, but I’m fine with it since it lets me work in a career I care about. What I want is a TA in every grade, preferably every classroom. One teacher is not enough to provide for these kids. Did I mention these kids have trauma like their parents dying or going to prison? It’s sadly not that uncommon for a school with a few hundred kids to have 10+ kids experiencing things adults don’t even cope well with. A team of district psychologist/counselors would be great for getting these kids mentally healthy before they step out into adulthood and are on their own. 
		
		You might say “well why the hell should a school be doing all this?” Well, quite frankly it’s because no one else is going to do it if the parents or schools don’t. Too many parents won’t, and too many schools wish they could but don’t have the resources so they do their best. Kids also spend more time with their teachers and at school in a year than they do with their parents. We see it day after day and even great parents often don’t know their kid is having these issues. One of our fifth graders has been on suicide watch multiple times throughout the year. At the end of the day, for a lot of the kiddos, school is the only safe, positive, and consistent aspect in their entire life. That’s not to mention that many parents pretty much expect the school to raise their kid. If we could, we would. Every educator I know makes darn well sure they give everything they can to make sure these kids make it. So many of them really don’t though. 
		
		I like to think having more funding would help a lot. The money is out there. It’s just a matter of getting it funneled into schools. I’d also like to clarify that I don’t think this funding is necessarily needed for the education part of schools. Teaching kids how to think and solve problems from an academic angle doesn’t cost much money. But it’s Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. Without the lower levels being met, the lesson plans may as well be better if being group therapy. Nobody is going to convince me that money is better spent on Amazon’s R&amp;D than the children our politicians love to say they care about.

		I want to start by saying I support this comment 100%. I agree that a wealth tax is not the correct way to handle the current situation in the US in terms of massive imbalance in wealth. To add another point to your argument as to why this won’t work; I’d like to start by saying Bernies plan only addresses the surface issue that we all see, wealth inequality. What needs to be addressed is how this is occurring. I would be a full supporter of this wealth inequality if everyone made an honest income; because if it was all honest and I was still mad about it, that makes me a hater. If bezos made all of his money honestly, nothing should be done. But what is occurring is massive behind the scenes cheating that only a select few really knows any details about. And sometimes, it’s not even behind the scenes; ex. The amazon tax loophole. Those are things that NEED to be eliminated. We as Americans need to stand up against the corruption and back end cheating, not taxing them more because they will still keep cheating their way through the system. The amazon tax example is just one of many that occur. If we tackle the rooted issue of how this is happening, everything will correct itself in due time because the guidelines america has set for business allow for a true capitalist nation; which would provide less of an imbalance. 
		
		How can we do this? First things first; the loopholes and loose ends of the thousand of guidelines need to be corrected and become bulletproof. This has to happen first because when it comes down to the final stage of this, court, we can’t allow lawyers to again find ways out. Secondly we would need multiple people of power who are honest Americans to start going after these people. Investigations needs to be done and done fast so these people can’t find a way to pay their way out. These people need to be held accountable for their actions and it shouldn’t be taken lightly. This has gotten way to far out of control and simply taxing their dirty wealth isn’t going to fix the issue. Taking heavy legal action on them and fining them accordingly is the way to get money out of the rich. After all, you don’t acquire millions of dollars being stupid; minus gambling and lottery of course.... these people are smart and they will find a way around a wealth tax but when a judge say “guilty your punishment is this fine” they ultimately have no way out. 
		
		Can they keep taking it to court and dragging it out? Yes. Which is likely. Can they have lawyers fight their way out? No. if all of the loose ends and loopholes were eliminated, they’d have no leg to stand on; theyre cornered. The lawyers can browse literature all they want but if there is no way out because everything was triple checked and corrected before all of this occurred; here comes the money from the rich. We simply can’t allow things loopholes like the amazon tax error to exist; they need to be found and corrected. 
		
		This is just my 2 cents from how I view it, if you think I’m wrong or misinformed, im pretty easy to converse with; let me know. And I am aware this would be extremely difficult and need thorough planning before it took place; it’s all just an idea, maybe a crazy one.

				Not in theory. You could just make it so that if an item is exempt from the wealth tax, then it would be taxed as income when you convert it to money. Like capital gains currently. But like if someone has a billion just sitting in a bank, that would get taxed at whatever percent every year, which incentivizes the person to spend/use that money, which stimulates the economy.

		There is a problem, both in politics in general and in American politics specifically, which I think your comments clearly demonstrate. Namely, the misleading potential for a simply numerical solution to social problems.
		
		Of course, to an extent, this is one of the wonders of the modern, and to a larger extent, digital eras - our capacity as a society to examine economic, political, etc. data and form proportional, effective responses. So one can be forgiven for acting as if the single metric we should consider, in the example of a wealth tax, are the directly related economic consequences. Others in this thread have done a much better job at outlining these specifics, and I mean in no way to suggest that they should not form a significant factor in our deliberations.
		
		I do not, however, believe that a wealth tax in the US would primarily function as an economic adjustment, as a direct and baggage-free form of government wealth redistribution. The primary reason for any form of wealth redistribution in this country is to alter the culture, the way the government and citizen organizations enforce laws against the extremely wealthy, not merely to provide the, also necessary, mere redistribution of economic power. 
		
		A large part of the reason people like Bezos have been allowed to accumulate wealth to the obscene levels which we are today becoming aware of is the way people with monetary power are treated. You and several others have mentioned how difficult it would be, simply from a logistical standpoint, to implement the sort of auditing and appraisals necessary to enforce a wealth tax in any real way. And yet, at least monetarily, this system would undoubtedly pay for itself by multitudes. Currently the IRS almost never audits the wealthier percentage of the population. Because of the logistics, potential for frivolous lawsuits, and various political considerations, it is not viewed as worth the time for the agency literally in charge of federal tax enforcement to do their job when it comes to the population universally known as the motivated and capable tax evaders. 
		
		So it is not as if the existence of multi-billion dollar businessmen is some simple wound in our political system which, outside of our field of vision, has festered and corrupted the whole body politic. Nor is a wealth tax is not meant merely to clean and repair the wound. It is an announcement that the established system is no longer protecting the wealthy at the cost of the weak and vulnerable. It is the government manifesting and accelerating a shift in cultural attitudes which no longer allow for a system with two different sets of rules for people based on how much money they have, how much power they wield.

		This is pretty much spot on.  People don't understand finances and economics and you've laid out clearly the problems with people trying to implement wealth taxes.  
		
		Yang is not perfect, but it's the fact he had actual realistic plans like this that made me support him.  Bernie *feels* good, but none of his plans are actually realistic.  We can't switch to renewables faster than 50 years because construction alone of all the new power plants would take that long.  The wealth tax is a bust for actually trying to tax the rich both because of unintended ramifications and they'd just dodge it anyways (there are always ways in a single point of valuation system).  And medicare/college for all have similar concerns as to not only their viability but their ability to even be enacted in 8 years, much less 4.
		
		&amp;nbsp;
		
		I like the end game, I like the goal, but I like being sold ralistic steps towards progress.  Dreams are nice, but if you make plans based on dreams then 100% it's going to be subverted either by the opposition or by your own optimism making you not take proper steps/time to reach those dreams.  
		
		&amp;nbsp;
		
		You need realistic, concrete, tangible steps to create progress.  It may not be near as sexy as a dream, but it's what works.  But unfortunately that's the catch 22 because people are not going to vote realistically, they are going to vote idealistically.  Whether that happens to be "Drain the Swamp"/"Build that wall" or "wealth tax"/"Green New Deal".  IMO both are equally dubious dreams sold to the respective ideologues.  But, and this is important, the people voting for such dreams DO want things to be better.  They just don't have realistic ideas of the effort, time frame, and care that it takes to get there.  So they vote for candidates proposing highly unrealistic plans, because they want it now now not later later.

		And a huge portion of the reason Amazon has been able to reach such an incredible valuation is because of the tactics the organization has adpoted to *avoid* paying nearly any tax whatsoever.
		
		And according to Business Insider, he makes about $8.9 million a year. He is by no means suffering, so taxing him more than near zero a year wouldn't make him suffer in the slightest.

			A strategy that the wealthy use to avoid capital gains tax is that instead of selling the asset, they just take out loans that are secured against the asset. This way they can unlock cash and not have to pay capital gains tax.
			
			This could be used to delay capital gains tax for generations.
			
			What I would like to see more discussion of is assessing for capital gains tax more often than is currently being done. I think a good time to assess capital gains tax is when loans are taken out against that property. When loans are taken out, a valuation is done (typically by the bank) and the valuation is agreed upon by two parties (just like in a sale) and cash, from the loan, is available to pay the tax without forcing sale of any property. So assessing capital gains tax in a loan event would get around the problem of valuation and availability cash that OP has stated above.

		Bezos' wealth is always a talking point, but how many of his employees are happy with their pay and how it provides for their families? I don't know the number. But, we always go after the comparison of CEO and lowest level person, but that lowest level person may be happy to have that job or to see Amazon putting up a warehouse in a struggling area. 
		
		I've seen similar arguments about why somebody would buy an exotic car and not spend the money helping the homeless, etc. But, that car is built by humans with technical skills who are paid to use those skills in new ways each year, building better and better products. Even when you factor in logistics and marketing and HR functions, each car supports hundreds or thousands of workers, all of which could be perfectly fine with their wages/benefits - without any care for what the CEO makes.

		Also, upstream sanctions/taxes. All companies both domestically and internationally are upheld to the same national standards. If you pollute, you are proportionally taxesd or sanctioned. You have bad labor standards, same deal. Other countries shouldn't get the added value of having less regulations. They simply shouldn't be allowed to come to market. That would limit the exodus of wealth from the country. That would bring back jobs. That would raise wages. It would also raise prices and fuck the economy. But conceptionally, it would be so beneficial. It would reward investing in your own economy, your own people. We have become so disconnected from the necessary development of the people of our nation because we have been outsourcing to globalism for 35 years.

	* 🟨 **[plartoo](https://www.reddit.com/user/plartoo)** ⬆️ 1 _(2020-03-07 19:04:13)_

		I’ll play devil’s advocate and try to address some of the difficult problems you are seeing with wealth tax. Keep in mind that I’m all for taxing the super rich (like more than a hundred millions of dollars in net worth), but I’m not a supporter of Bernie in a lot of things he propose (like blindly supporting unions, slashing student loans which would cause inflation and devaluation of what higher education really means to a lot of the populace, to name a few).
		
		>Well, first you have to value that wealth. For something like stocks, when do you do that? Do you take the value of the stocks as of December 31st at the market close? Do you use the value of the stocks at the beginning of the year? Do you average the value over the year? I am sure we could probably figure this out.
		
		You already admitted that we can figures this out. E.g., we can accept a middle ground assessment like average appreciation of his stocks over the past year.
		
		> What about more esoteric assets, like private businesses, property, buildings, art, etc. Is the government going to hire an army of appraisers? What if someone disagrees with that appraisal? Do they get to appeal? Who do they appeal too? Who is going to find this whole operation?
		
		The IRS and local tax authorities already do that. 
		
		> Bezos is an easy target as he is clearly over the threshold of the wealth taxes being proposed. What about people right at or near the threshold? How do we know when they have crossed it? Is the government going to have to keep an indexed list of all citizen's assets and liabilities so they can track how much someone is worth to know who to apply the wealth tax too?
		
		IRS already do this for some high net worth people. In fact, IRS already has our historical tax filing documents. So it’s easy to keep track of it (unless, of course, these rich people hide their stuff in offshore places, which is where we need more leg work and IRS employees to track down). Again, the IRS will need to be bigger, which can be good and bad depending on which line of the political spectrum you fall into. To me, I have no problem hiring more government workers at least in its income department (i.e. the IRS).
		
		> Okay, say we solve that. Now we have a list of people whom the wealth tax applies to and how much they owe. Now it is time to collect. So back to Bezos. He has about $140 billion. Per Sanders's plan, he would essentially be paying an 8% wealth tax (yes, there are marginal rates but let's just get into the neighbourhood of what he would owe). Let's call it $11 billion So, Bezos needs to sell stock to cover this. Well, if he sells a stock he has to pay income tax on that because as he sells he would be realizing his gains. The tax rate on capital gains over half a million is 20%. So, he would actually need to sell about 13 billion to cover the income tax and the wealth tax.
		That has two effects. Firstly, what does that do to Amazon share prices that are surely in most pensions and US index funds? Secondly, what does that do to Bezos's ownership of Amazon as his share of ownership decreases? I believe he owns about 12% of Amazon. So he isn't at risk of losing control, but is it really fair for him to slowly lose the control he does have in a company he founded? 
		
		No. Remember, it’s not just Bezos who will lose his shares. Other rich people and inanimate entities like pension funds who are invested in Amazon stock will also lose their control over Amazon. So all in all, Bezos (in relative terms) does not lose control of the thing he founded.
		Retail investors and pension funds who bought AMZN stocks would adjust their stock purchasing behavior to account for that swing in price. That’s what capitalism (and on a meta level, evolution) is about.
		
		> What about other wealthy people that would lose control of their companies by selling stock to cover the wealth tax? As Bezos unloads his shares, the price of Amazon stock is also sure to fall. That means Bezos's worth has taken a triple hit; wealth tax, income tax, and now share price decrease.
		
		I disagree. You already said his income is puny (nowadays CEOs pay almost zero salary to themselves), so he won’t suffer from income tax. He’ll get hit by wealth tax and in my opinion, it’s fair. The share price decrease will be baked into the stock price increase over the year. The market will do its job.
		
		> And that is the simple case, where the assets are fairly liquid. What about someone with their wealth in a private business? How do we value that business and how does the owner extract the wealth from that business to pay the tax? That is over my head. An accountant would need to weigh in on that.
		
		Yep. We (both you and I) shouldn’t form an opinion, “Hey, wealth tax is impossible!”, without knowing these nuances. The way I see it is, the accounting and budget aren’t particularly rocket science (as a computer engineer who took quite a few engineering classes, I can tell you that even rocket science isn’t that difficult and most of the discipline that we don’t have formulas for, we experiment many, many times until we can predict the behavior via approximate models). Same thing can be done with taxation and a lot of government policies. People need to be open to the idea of experimenting first and use common sense (based on solid, fair and long-term-view based reasoning) to address the issues. 
		
		Let me give you a quick example to one of the questions you stated here, “How do we value that business and how does the owner extract the wealth from that business to pay the tax?” Every business has net profit (revenue minus operating expenses and raw materials used in production, etc.) We can use that as a starting point for valuing that business’ last year added value to its wealth and levy tax on it. Simple right? If they want to grow their business (like putting some of that money into research or hiring more people), they can claim credit for that next year. I believe that’s what IRS is already doing, but of course, some business people will use accountants to hide their money by channeling it into various other grey areas that we common folks cannot even fathom (like “Oh, I bought a BMW that is for the business and based on IRS rule that is passed by congress, thanks to persuasion by the lobbyists that we hired, we can claim tax credit for that.”). Those are the kind of tax loopholes that we must eliminate and simplify the tax code dramatically.
		
		> What about someone that has a large chunk of their wealth in property, or art? Take the later for example of a more complex case. Say we have an individual who has a large art collection. That art is appraised at millions of dollars. Some of these appraisals are based on what it might fetch at auction or by what the buyer paid. What if this person cannot sell the art because no one will pay the price the owner or appraiser thinks it is worth? What if the art is sentimental and the owner values it higher than the appraisal? How does this person raise the funds to pay their wealth tax?
		
		Well, then we tax the appreciation of these properties year over year. In fact, that’d help solve one of the biggest issue we are facing now (shortage of affordable housing) because rich people horde on it. If the rich person doesn’t want to pay tax on an art because he or she might have a difficult time offloading it, even better for us common folks because most of these arts will end up in galleries and public museums, so millions of people can enjoy it as opposed to just one rich person hanging it in their bedroom.
		
		> I could go on. It's just so complicated, and unnecessary. The wealth tax isn't going to work, and if it does what will society have to do to get it to work? There are easier options. Yang's VAT comes to mind. The downside is that it is regressive, but that is easily fixed by excluding daily essentials like food, and housing. You can't escape a VAT. You spend money in the country you pay the VAT. Additionally, we could be taxing things that cause negative knockdown effects, like carbon, pollution, waste, etc.I agree that the wealthy need to be taxed more, I just disagree that a wealth tax is the way to do it.
		
		All I wanted to say is that do NOT ever say, “It’s impossible. It’s too complicated”. Life is full of complicated things and with human ingenuity, integrity (fairness to the society we live in), and common sense, we can overcome and solve many of these seemingly complicated issues.

			I will address some of your points with respect to mine. Appreciate a devil's advocate.
			
			Firstly, I never said that a wealth tax is "impossible". I did say, and do believe, it is more complicated than other possible solutions. In my post I mentioned the VAT, in other posts in this thread I have mentioned estate taxes, and increasing capital gains. In terms of experimentation, we should start with the simple ideas before the more radical ones. On a scale of simply to radical, wealth tax is on the radical side. IMO, we should nudge society into the correct direction, instead of trying to rebuild it or significantly change it. You are right, that human ingenuity can solve a lot of complex problems. One of the easiest ways to do this is to not create the complex problem in the first place. IMO, this is what a wealth tax does. It creates a complex problem when it isn't needed.
			
			Secondly, one of your primary points is that we already have methods for determining wealth. Fair. The difference, as you kind of allude to, is that we don't do it at scale. That is where I see the issues arising. How much would we have to spend to raise additional income? If we look at the four European countries that have a wealth tax, Spain, Norway, Switzerland, and Belgium, their wealth taxes produce 0.55%, 1.1%, 3.6%, and basically nothing as a percent of state income. Is that worth the effort? Is that worth the complexity and hassle? Is that worth giving up a level of privacy for individuals for those income levels? (Source for income %ages: https://www.businessinsider.com/4-european-countries-wealth-tax-spain-norway-switzerland-belgium-2019-11). Again, there are easier options to raise state income that will disproportionately hit the wealthy as previously mentioned.
			
			Thirdly, you are correct we can value *private* businesses in the manner you have outlined. I don't know that it truly addresses the issue of wealth though especially since you aren't speaking to the wealth of a business, but instead it's income. Most corporations already do the things you speak of to reduce income for tax filing purposes. I agree that loop holes need to be closed, and with a wealth tax that calculates the value of a business in the manner you suggest, I believe that would increase the exploitation of these loop holes since there would be more at stake. If you want to valuate the wealth of a business, I would think that assets minus liabilities would be a better approach, but then how does an owner of such a corporation then transfer that wealth to the government? If the majority of their wealth is in this corporation then do they have to transfer control to the government? Or do they have to sell their holdings to other private investors? If we have a wealth tax of 4%, after 17 years an individual would have transferred just over 50% of their company to the government or other individuals.
			
			I will leave it there. I will admit my art example isn't my strongest argument. I used that more to highlight what I see as being a possible complex situation that I don't think the average supporter of a wealth tax truly considers.

		I forget where I heard it, but there was an interesting idea for handling the assessment of art, cars, etc: let the person claim a value under the condition that the government may buy the item for that value with no negotiation. The government would presumably only buy the item if the claimed value was too low.

			What about the inverse of that - if the government wants to value your painting at $50 million and tax you off of that, you have the right to sell it to them for that value.  They would make sure their assessment is in line.
			
			
			Personal anecdote, the state I live in has property tax for your vehicle.  So when you register it they plug the make, model, and year into a system and it estimates the value and they tax you based on that.  My car has had a lot of issues and been in and out of the shop quite a bit.  When they told me what the estimated value was I jokingly replied "if I could actually sell it for that much I would do it in a heartbeat."

		While the answer is incredibly complex, if you've paid attention to his development on this issue, he appears to have a vision that is pretty comprehensive i.e. not just "Bernie supports mass immigration and foreign worker visas" and "spending billions... to give healthcare to foreign nationals".
		
		Step 1: DACA approvals, establish (faster, efficient) path to citizenship for all other current residents. I.e. make citizens quickly of those who want to be here and benefit from national plans.
		
		Step 2: Push/work towards universal health care. Pricey, but saves average middle class money overall (swaps private costs for public costs and eliminates profit motive from providing healthcare).
		
		Step 2A: Roll back or renegotiate trade deals to curb further job exportation. Long negotiation process.
		
		Step 2B: Limit health tourism (it's in his plan).
		
		Step 3: New citizens increase the tax base by ~5-10M, assuming not everyone would want to be a citizen.
		
		That's at least how I see it, personally.

		Interesting post. I would say we need to do wealth distribution to fix the current symptoms. But we also need to design a system that empowers the workers and middle class instead of the upper class. The sentence "1% gained their immense share of the wealth, not by taking it, but with complex policies designed to lower wages and increase the consumer base. Things like mass immigration, mass illegal immigration, global trade deals, outsourcing, anti-union laws, etc." really helped me understand this topic a lot more.

			I am still not sure what the best solution here is.  Looking at the most extreme examples of wealth the obvious solution suddenly seems like a bad idea.  Take Bezos for example, his wealth is entirely made up of the shares he holds of a public company.  Taxing that directly is essentially forcing someone to give up part of their ownership, so that's out.  Taxing shares he sells is fine but MOST of the money he has ever had is tied up in unsold shares so he would still have a huge net worth regardless of taxes.

			Mass immigration is taken advantage of by the rich because there’s no legal protection so they can be paid less. Bernie’s legal immigration policies will prevent the rich from exploiting the labor of the oppressed instead of leaving them to suffer since they’ll be coming to the US anyways.

				'mass immigration' is probably the smartest term to come out of the 21st century.
				
				It's just such a piece of genius, a term which will get a far right skin head neo nazi racial puritan and a middle aged office worker who wishes there were a few more pubs and fish and chipperies, and maybe a few less polski skleps, to agree with eachother on the gargantuan topic that is 'immigration policy'.
				
				Someone that thinks that any non native Brits coming to the UK is 'mass immigration', and someone that thinks that maybe the public services can't support 1 million plus people coming in every year.
				
				And the newspapers have absolutely ran with the ambiguity of the term to sell paper and stoke the narrative, and more and more people find themselves agreeing that 'mass immigration' is a problem, but you'll have trouble bringing together more than a handful that actually agree on what the bloody term means! The question is really - what number constitutes mass immigration? 
				
				There is no number, it's just a phrase used for any immigration by people that don't like or uncomfortable by immigrants. 
				
				I say this from a British perspective, but the same is true everywhere. 
				
				The reality is that academic study after academic study has found that immigration, even from uneducated immigrants, has a negligible effect on deteriorating conditions with respect to wages and jobs. The reality is that the people that benefit most from immigration are.. natives, who are pushed into higher value (and hence paid) work providing services for a larger population base.
				
				>He’s also against global trade deals like NAFTA which so famously took millions of jobs from Americans
				
				This is also an outright fabrication. Jobs were not 'lost', they were shifted into more value added areas.

		In comparison, in France, university costs 9k a year to the state, we pay 400€ out of it, and with natural inflation over the time, there is no degree that's not worth 9k a year for 2-8years, over a life of work.

		I’m not for “free” college and I don’t expect others to pay for other people’s schooling. But your public university tuition has increased over 200% since 1980. This is a fact. Do you know what has not increased 200% since 1980? Wages. Also, where is the justification for this drastic increase in tuition? There’s not one.
		
		So while I don’t think the general public should be responsible for paying for every basket weaving or low income major, I DO think these majors should be actually affordable for someone that does want to pursue it and not be chained to lifelong debt. The government needs to get involved on setting limits on tuition, book prices, etc. because no matter how you cut it this massive increase in price is inexcusable. 
		
		Lastly, this is someone who chose a major that would undoubtedly provide a job on graduation and was fortunate enough to have their college paid for. This is not for my own self interest, but I know when people are being screwed over.

		The degree shouldn't cost 100k in the first place. It costs that much because of inflation in educational expenses, like textbooks and tuition, which have been occurring because of a lack of cost-effective alternatives and inelastic demand for education. Compounding that expensiveness is the predatory student loan industry, which further inflates the cost of schooling because you now have to pay interest on top of the principal cost of the education.
		
		If you provide free schooling alternatives and remove the predatory lending, the cost of education should come down, which is a net good for society (hence why it is worth paying for). As a society, we want as many people to be educated as possible. That is good for everyone.

		>Transnational corporations use things like foreign worker visas and mass immigration to lower wages for Americans.
		
		What studies have you seen that attribute immigration to low wages? What defines "Mass Immigration"?
		
		There's  already a massive limitation on work visa's. As someone else already pointed out, only 65,000 H1-B visas(permanent high skilled jobs) are  allocated each year. That is about 0.04% of the working population in  the US, or around 0.02% of all citizens. [https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/employment-based-visa-categories-united-states](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/employment-based-visa-categories-united-states)
		
		This research paper has some good statistics on how immigration has an impact on wages. [https://www.nber.org/papers/w12497.pdf](https://www.nber.org/papers/w12497.pdf)
		
		Here's part of the conclusion:
		
		>We  find robust evidence that U.S.- and foreign-born workers are not  perfect substitutes within an education-experience-gender group. This  fact, and the yearly adjustment of capital to immigration, **imply that average wages of natives benefit from immigration,even in the short run.**  These average gains are, in the short and long run, distributed as a  small wage loss to the group of high school dropouts and wage gains for  all the other groups of U.S. natives. The group suffering the biggest  loss in wages is the contingent of previous immigrants, who compete with  new immigrants for similar jobs and occupations
		
		I'm  also wondering exactly where you got the whole "Bernie loves  immigration" bit? He is Pro-DACA, but those people are people that are *already here*.  It seems you've adopted the conservative talking point of "All  Democrats just want open borders" approach. There's no evidence of this,  of course, unless you attribute them being against an arbitrary wall as  "open border" policy. It's similar to calling people that criticize  Israel Anti-Semites.
		
		>Simply  taking money from the rich and giving it to the poor doesn't  work. The  1% gained their immense share of the wealth, not by taking it,  but  with complex policies designed to lower wages and increase the  consumer  base. Things like mass immigration, mass illegal immigration, global  trade deals, outsourcing, anti-union laws, etc.
		
		Alright,  so let's talk about these. I've already covered immigration, but let's  actually focus on the policies of both parties for a second here in  contrast to what you're saying.
		
		Immigration:  If it was a problem, which I've shown it not to be, Republicans would  increase the fine on companies for hiring illegal immigrants, and ICE  would **target the** **workplaces** of those companies to enforce these laws. **Republicans have not done that**, and instead, they've voted on an arbitrary wall that keeps out much [less than half of all Illegal immigrants](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/10/683662691/where-does-illegal-immigration-mostly-occur-heres-what-the-data-tell-us).
		
		Trade Agreements: Here's the vote on NAFTA. Much more Republicans supported it than Democrats [https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/103-1993/h575](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/103-1993/h575)
		
		Anti-Union: Do... I really need to say which party is the Anti-Union party? I mean, Reagan was the famous destroyer of unions in the 80's.
		
		> Instead, we should design a system  that empowers the workers and middle class instead of empowering the  upper class. Instead of having our laws work for the 1%, while trying to  get crumbs from them to live, we should look at the policies that made  them hoard wealth and reverse them.
		
		What policies exactly make the rich "hoard their wealth"? 
		
		The easy answer is there are no specific policies that make people hoard their wealth, it's a natural occurrence once someone accrues a frankly absurd amount of wealth. There's simply no way to spend billions of dollars in a lifetime, and you can simply sit on it or *hire other people* to game the stock/real-estate/investment markets to make endless amounts more. For example, Bill gates has donated something around $36 Billion just to the Gates Foundation(and has donated $50 Billion of his wealth to charity), and he's still the second richest person in the world? 
		
		This is exactly what a wealth tax is combating, the inability for billionaires to spend their wealth, to improve the lives of tens of millions of people in this country.

Instead of Bernie fighting against the policies that lowered income and wealth for the middle class, he now supports those polices
		
		As someone who have been working at a multi-national corp and have hired/worked with so many of the foreign workers, I have to remind you that there are only 65000 foreign worker visas available **per year**, and the company and the workers have to meet a lot of stringent criteria (such as proving that they earn at least average or above average of market rate--based on Department of Labor's statistics--for the positions they are applying work visas for). The US economy has 130 millions full-time employees [https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat08.htm]. So that number is 0.05% of US full-time work force for each year. Also, most of these workers are in tech or finance related sectors (not blue collar). 
		
		Do some of the employers cheat the system? You bet (I'm going to be very politically-incorrect here. To my best knowledge, I notice that the firms that cheat the most are owned by Indian founders--such as Cognizant, WiPro--because India has a massive population with plenty of willing IT sweatshop workers who will take employers' abuse. But those are few). Most of the big corps like mine (top 4 in the industry that we operate in), and other big tech companies like Netflix, Uber, Google, FB, Apple, Amazon, and thousands of other legitimate US corps really do follow these stringent procedures set up by USCIS (US immigration department) to apply for work visas for their foreign workers. 
		
		Sure, these foreign workers are bound to the companies and they are likely to be abused by the companies (not in terms of salary because like I said, it's part of the required proof that the companies have to pay above or equal market rates for these workers and trust me, it's not easy to get around). But that must be and should be fixed by USCIS by untying the foreign worker's visa from employer (right now, the visa is employer sponsored). That would have a positive side effect of providing freedom for foreign workers to look for better paying jobs easily and the capitalist market will take care of raising salary levels for everyone (including US citizens) across the board. Another truth that I wanted to tell you is that in general, these foreign workers, being first generation (most of them are wanna-be) immigrants and all, work harder than the US-born workers. Plus, these foreign workers pay full tax just like you and I do, and they cannot even claim other government benefits with their foreign visa status (which I believe is inhumane but understandable).
		
		I agree with you about illegal immigration. I believe it's the illegal immigrants (including asylum seekers, who fake their stories about how they were oppressed and such in their home countries; I have seen quite a few of them since I used to rent and live in Queens, NY) and some family-based immigration policies who have overall negative impact on the long-term prospect of this country's social safety net system. E.g., allowing parents of the US citizens who are older than 50 years old (who have never positively contributed to the US economy and paid FICA taxes) to apply for green card and not restricting them from applying for government benefits; after all, it's their citizen children who sponsored these parents, so it's fair that these children must take care of their parents' healthcare instead of these parents eventually getting Medicare after they become citizens. Having said that, even some of the young illegal immigrants, they do contribute positively to the economy and I believe that we should let them come out of the shadows, and use their human resources to promote their future (thereby, preventing them and their next generation from creating a burden to the country in the future).

		"Wealth is unlimited. "
		I don't exactly think so. There is a limited amount of wealth in this world. That's why if you google the amount of wealth in this world you'll get a number. Yes we can create more wealth, but how exactly does that work? When we create more wealth it goes to big corporations mainly.
		
		"The simple fact someone has a lot, doesn't mean others will suffer."
		In this case it does, because there are systemic problems in our economy. Student debt and medical debt being two of the big ones. To tackle these problems we cannot simply raise taxes on the lower and middle class because it would just make the problem worst. We need to raise taxes on those among us who have more.

			The whole idea of capitalism and liberalism is that while wealth is finite at any moment, it is infinite as it can be created by an idea that solves a problem that exists at the time of creation. We can absolutely create more wealth. How do we do so? Maybe by investing what we already have into R&amp;D for the future (see Google's work in making Internet standards better or Amazon's move toward being a cloud provider). But this can only be done for companies that already have the funds, so there must be something that comes earlier... 
			
			Usually, wealth is created by starting a company that provides value to people or society as a whole. Companies like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Walmart, and Netflix who provided HUGE value to society through their products and services were all founded to solve a problem. They solved their respective problem, and potentially many more, growing more valuable as a company because of the solutions they provided. So you could say that the idea/solution plus the execution upon that idea is the added value for society. So why shouldn't the person who came up with that become wealthy with the company? If we believe that capitalism lifts all boats in the end, shouldn't we want to incentive this?
			
			Now, I agree that these companies still need to pay their fair share of taxes. Companies should not be allowed to offshore all their profits and treat it as an expense. I don't have an answer on how this can be done unfortunately, but I know many smart people are working on it every day. However, true R&amp;D should be encouraged.
			
			Next, many of these companies have a way to go in how they treat their employees. Amazon and Walmart could raise wages for warehouse workers; Microsoft could be more conscious about their employees values regarding how their tech is used; Spotify could pay artists who are the backbone of their business more per stream. However, taxing individual's wealth, wealth that is tied up in the company itself, is not going to solve these problems as it creates as many issues as it attempts to solve.
			
			These taxes are a band-aid solution at best, assuming it is executed perfectly. We need to solve the actual problems, not try and cover it up by taxing the people who, contrary to what many people believe these days, provided a valued service to society and should be able to reap the benefits.

			Or phrased in another way, why do you want a solution of "we need more funds to pay for it", rather than "let's force providers to provide these services for cheaper"? If you think the wealth generation of these corporations is the problem (the "scams" they are), why is subsidizing them through wealthy tax payers the way to go?

				To turn your question on it's head, is there a level of wealth inequality that is good? Studies of wealth distribution in the US in the 1950s, generally regarded as one of the more prosperous ti es shows a relatively even distribution with a very high corporatetax system that encouraged reinvestment to employees via tax breaks. The current levels of inequality are high, I recall the equivalent distributions being similar to that of Uganda.
				
				There is empirical evidence that a less stark income distribution between upper and lower incomes leads to more stable societies and a healthier civic life. Couple that with the fact that concentration of wealth decreases the velocity of money actually serves as a net decrease in the economic activity of the society.

				That’s like saying “No one can agree on the best speed limit for everyone for this road, so we should just do away with speed limits altogether.” Just because there isn’t clear line to say whether 40 or 45mph is the best answer for a particular area doesn’t mean that 90mph is just as good.
				
				In the context of wealth inequality, I can’t say what the best balance of wealth is, but I can still say that someone who works two full-time jobs shouldn’t be struggling to survive while a CEO lounges in his third yacht and pays nothing in taxes. The lack of a clear line does not mean the entire continuum is equally moral.

And we as people of the world only have two main ways to deal with that, via taxing them (i.e. reducing their wealth and by proxy their power) and via adding legislation which helps take money out of politics (i.e. reducing the effect of their wealth).

				I believe the thinking that wealth inequality is just a numerical problem doesn't address the actual problems it creates.
				
				 If wealth inequality merely meant I have to drive a Honda but someone gets to drive a Tesla, it wouldn't be a problem because I can still get around. I still have my needs met. What is a problem is that Bloomberg can flush 500 million dollars on a terrible campaign that brought to light many of the awful things he has done as mayor but I can't go to the doctor without being financially ruined.
				
				The problem with wealth inequality is that a few people have more money than they could ever spend while many people are unable to afford their basic needs. Shelter, Food, Healthcare, Transportation, Education, things we could easily provide for people are locked away because the people who control it choose to deny it to anyone that does not already have wealth.

				I think a stronger argument could be made that wealth should not be generational. I think a reasonable cap ($10,000,000 worth of assets?) could be set and anything beyond that at a person’s death is liquidated and the funds used to pay for infrastructure/public wages/etc.
				
				This of course requires systemic change because so much wealth is held by companies formed by wealthy individuals, but actually addresses the root of the problem. Families holding assets for generations that never re-enter circulation. Kids basically winning the lottery at birth while other can never escape poverty.
				
				I think a lot of inequality stems from that. Just because your parents were wealthy doesn’t mean that you should also be through no effort of your own. You’ll have enough of a leg up based on their connections and instruction and the opportunities they provided to you. If you work hard, you’ll be rich too. If you don’t, you’re hosed. Meanwhile, a poor kid can bust their ass their whole life and never achieve any level of wealth. The “American Dream” of affording a house, vacations, food, healthcare, etc. on a single income is dead for most people. But for a very small percentage, their parents and grandparents and great grandparents got lucky and worked hard and now they never actually have to contribute anything to society and can coast through life.
				
				Capitalism is fine as long as your financial progress is your own and you’re responsible for building your own boat. When 1 in 100 are born on a privately owned luxury cruise ship, 4 are born on decent sailboats, and the other 95 are dropped in the ocean and told to find driftwood, you get a system where most people spend most of their lives struggling to build a raft. I’d suggest that at the end of life, your kids who had the benefit of being born on your boat and having your building materials available be responsible for their own boat, while whatever you’ve built gets repurposed for the good of everyone in the regatta.
				
				Not quite communism, not quite socialism, hard work still rewarded, parents still able to pass the benefits of their hard work to their kids, but an end to people making millions/billions solely by having millions at birth and doing nothing else.

				I wouldn’t say meaningless. It can get to a point where the distribution of wealth it’s skewed enough that too many young (therefore uninformed) need to take dangerous chances on loans for college to get on an even playing field for instance. Wealth inequality can hurt income mobility pretty powerfully. 
				
				I definitely agree it’s not innately a bad thing, and it’s often used incorrectly to demonstrate how unfair the market is. But it certainly can and will get to a point where the value of labor decreases enough to the point where people can’t afford many of the goods and services that could be offered and/or developed. 
				
				R&amp;D in the medical field for instance gets something like 200BN/yr from private profit. 30-40BN/yr from public funding. R&amp;D will often be the first to go, directed from the shareholders, when people stop being able to afford the inflated prices. This holds pretty true across every sector I think. In the long run this is pretty objectively bad and will cause greater market stagnation. 
				
				I should get more detailed sorry. But I think the solutions Bernie proposes in general aren’t great and the really bad ones won’t happen anyway. However, I’m pretty sure reducing wealth inequality with capital gains/VAT/consumption taxing can be really good both short and long term if done right.

		Wages have stagnant for decades and the cost of living continues to go up. That's unacceptable. Anyone working full time deserves a living wage. Right now, millions of Americans can barely afford rent even with two jobs. We're living in a crony capitalist system run by oligarchs. You can't defend this broken system with any semblance of morality when so many are suffering while those at the top have more wealth than they can spend in multiple lifetimes. The level of greed in this country, from slave wages, to ridiculous medical expenses, to insane student debt- is not only wrong but indicative of a mental illness among the rich. We're the last developed country in the world without a proper healthcare system and people are brainwashed to think spending more for less is somehow better. Yet we spend trillions on a military we don't need. Billionaires dodge taxes like they change socks. People die to preventable diseases because the cost of something simple like insulin is $700 a month out of pocket. If you recognize these issues and support it, then you may literally be a sociopath.

	I bet this will change your view: those graphs are misleading because a huge number of extremely well off privileged people are counted as having zero wealth. Think of it. Everyone who is on track to be a doctor lawyer or engineer, or is a newly minted one of those things gets counted as having zero wealth until like their 30s.

Are you in terrible shape if you start off in your adult life with zero wealth and then retire in the top 10%? Is it horrific inequality needing a remedy if you are 20 and have $1000 in the bank with 20k in debt and your grandpa has 800,000 in the bank? What should you have in the bank after a lifetime of work? Well guess where each would be on that “shocking” chart?

	Yes but there are a lot of issues with the wealth tax the Bernie proposes. I actually made a post criticizing bernie's polices, and the wealth tax is one of them. Here's the [post](https://www.reddit.com/user/LordeRoyale/comments/fe8t8f/a_critique_of_bernie_sanders_policies/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share).

	Edit: [https://taxfoundation.org/wealth-tax/#Intro](https://taxfoundation.org/wealth-tax/#Intro). This article by the tax foundation explains the issues with the wealth tax pretty well. 

	Bernie is a huge proponent of the Wealth Tax, which sense considering his position on wealth inequality. A wealth tax is problematic for two reasons, its complexity and flight. Firstly, how exactly would wealth be quantified? How would assets, such as art, that are not available on the market be measured? How would you measure the wealth of a company that makes no profit due to re-investing the money? There are many questions that Bernie doesn't seem to answer.

	Next, Bernie's wealth tax is extreme. His proposed tax is 2-4% from 32 million to 1 billion, 5% until 2.5 billion, 6% until 5 billion, 7 percent until 10 billion, and 8% on anything over that. Most of the wealthy have their money invested in assets, real estate, and stock, so they will be forced to liquidate their assets in order to pay this tax. This can be extremely concerning for them, and frankly, being an American citizen isn't worth losing the majority of your net worth, so many billionaires will just renounce their citizenship and flee, which in itself is disastrous for the economy.

	The wealth tax also discourages international companies from expanding into America, since the sheer taxes would lead to a net loss in revenue. So all in all, a wealth tax is extremely damaging for the economy, which is why its been repealed in the majority of countries it was instituted in. The countries that do have it, on the other hand, reduced the rate until it is insignificant at &lt;1%.

	The best way to fight wealth inequality is through the [Land Value Tax](http://www.landvaluetax.org/what-is-lvt/).

What I would still argue is Bernie is the only candidate that will push for any reform on any of this and even if the only thing he can do is overturn citizens united the detangling of corporate wealth and government policies would be overwhelming worth it. It’s very hard to see a wealth tax working with these arguments, but also I couldn’t see Bernie implementing any of this with an iron fist I see him open to compromise and that he proposes extremes to showcase how bad things have gotten.

	Wealth inequality is a natural and normal part of a universe with differing abilities and scarcity. 

	The reason why people have different amounts of money are due to the fact that people are not equal. There is a fundamental inequality between people which is normal and natural. 

	If we look at things from a societal standpoint, it is the top percentage of individuals in any field who lurch humanity forward. If we could Thanos snap every fast-food worker (who had it as a career not because they were merely young) we would see some effects on society and the economy but overall humanity would not be put backwards by any significant measure. But imagine that you did the same thing for the pioneers of the home computer? The removal of a small amount of significant pioneers would set humanity back significantly. Bill Gates is a billionaire, and rightfully so, the amount of productivity and amount of sheer wealth created by Bill Gates far exceeds the amount of his net worth -- and the same could be said for every other tech billionaire. 

	In fact, society would be worse off if Bill Gates took a position at say, a car dealership or became a lawyer and made $300K a year than I would imagine the removal of every fast food worker.

	Then shouldn't it make sense that the state should simply get out of education?

		Everyone does have a differing ability level that is true. That means we should have differing incomes, also true. However, you are mistaken because wealth inequality goes further than this. Wealth inequality is intergenerational, unfair, and does not benefit society. Income inequality is fair, and does benefit society.
		
		As well as this I would be remiss if I did not say - yes those among us who create amazing products or innovations should be rewarded of course. However, the sheer scale is way way off. The top 1% hold more wealth than the bottom 90%. You must admit that is MASSIVELY unjust, especially considering how much of building a successful product or innovation comes from nepotism.

Which is why government programs were so prosperous and people could easily make a living wage. Then Reagan came in and dropped the rich tax to 23%, since then is hasn't ever gone above 36%. Government programs have been being cut down to the minimum and unless you join a union it's not easy to make a living wage with basic employment. Billionaires don't make jobs, the number of customers for their product dictates the number of jobs needed to support their demand. But they do control whether or not they pay a living wage.

		You don't want to attack the lord, they protect you surfs from the other lord. You don't want to attack the slave owner, their plantation provide raw materials for the entire county. This line of argumentation has never held up. Not all jobs come from the ultra wealthy. Something like 80% of employees work for small businesses that arent run by 100 millionaires and billionaires. We could also empower people to start their own businesses or worker co-ops. We don't need obscenely wealthy people for their to be jobs. The current system is not the only way things can work.

		> I’m cases like Denmark **the poor pay more in effective taxes.** That’s right... you use more public sources and you pay more.
		
		And the poor paying higher taxes in these countries is great because they actually get value from the government. The money is invested in them and not a Rube-Goldberg machine of subsidies and other policies that will supposedly trickle down but has been shown over and over again to not.
		
		> Stop attack a group because they are wealthy. You do not penalize those who drive the economy and are the ones who employ most of the people.
		
		Except working people drive the economy by actually doing the work. The wealthy are only valuable because they have been given the majority of societies resources. Wealth is not a measure of merit, sometimes it correlates to merit but it's been the case less and less, see the current President or Bloombergs abysmal debate performances.

		Last time I checked, any government that provides a social service (any modern government) such as Police, Fire, Social Security etc is technically a socialist country. 
		
		As far as taxation, billionaires and their companies get many subsidies (aka money) from our government as a handout (Oil, Gas, Utilities, Amazon, etc), which are making their executives very wealthy. Are you saying this is OK for us tax payers to flip the bill for this? There are videos from Robert Reich (a well known economist) which completely destroy your whole argument.

		The idea that the rich are job creators is mostly nonsense. Jobs are both done and created by workers. Common people are the heart of any economy and the reason for both supply and demand. It's a cyclic system resting on their shoulders entirely just like any other cyclic system. You wouldn't say rain happens because clouds exist, you'd say rain happens because oceans evaporate water vapor for clouds to exist.
		
		Bernie has many ideas but lets go over just one since you were vague. He has the most comprehensive health care plan that's been requested ever. So, you're technically right in that what he's doing is unprecedented. The method however isn't in that he requests it be done through a single-payer system. On that issue, that has been done successfully in many countries - all of them spending much less than Americans for healthcare.
		
		On almost all policies it's inarguable that Bernie is a social democrat. He has maybe one policy that is democratic socialist leaning and zero that are socialist. You're either being hyperbolic or you don't know what these terms mean.
		
		What EU countries run on a regressive tax? I'm not a tax expert but your example of Denmark doesn't follow here. If you're talking about VATs as a regressive tax those are curtailed purposefully in mind towards not hurting the poor in most places not only Denmark. That would be a rather disingenuous example vs income taxes in America as it's largely incomparable. In general, your example of Denmark uses progressive and proportional tax rates based on income. I know it's a topic you glossed over with a broad brush but details are necessary to get anything of value.

	>It's just not fair the rich have so much and the middle and lower have so little

	The middle does not have "so little"

	Download AGI data from IRS. It fits very well to ideal exponential curve

	For example if you divide all taxpayers into 20 stratas, each next strata X% less in size and earning Y% more in wealth, you got X=5% and Y=35%. 

	X% is measure of competition and Y% is a measure of a reward. The fact that the real Lorenz curve fits so well to it indicates that there is freedom of movement between stratas resulting in this exponential distribution. 

	That creates tremendous stimulus for the previous strata to work harder.

	The curve deviates from ideal only at both ends. For extreme poor the reward is even higher for working harder: the value of Y% is noticeably higher. With the same competition as for middle class, you can improve your life much more in terms of percentage of current wealth. 

	And, yes. The benefits of working harder is also larger for the highest end of it. 

	The middle portion of distribution covers 50K AGI to 250K AGI. That's what you would say, broadly, middle class, with the same rules.

	And, finally, hard work is not enough. People are born different. There is no equality in the natural world. Some people are born with higher intellectual potential than others. They will be richer than you, just because how it is.

	You also need to be more focused than others, more willing to make difficult decisions, more willing to sacrifice your life and others. 

	That's the rule of the game. It's the backbone of all that humanity achieved. The perks of it: partial redistribution of wealth: rich share their wealth with the poor can only go that far. 

	And finally: hitting the rich has been implemented in Soviet Russia, in China, in Cuba and many other Second World countries in the world.

	None of these countries achieved any good in terms of competing with other countries. Countries with free market system developed faster, progressed faster, fed their poor faster. 

	You are wrong experimentally. 

	So stop bringing it up, Reddit. Your only chance is "revolutionary situation" when the country is suddenly subjected to catastrophic circumstances, like German or Russia after The Great War. 

	You are hoping for Russian scenario, but you might lose like in Germany.

	>But I think people think the way I thought because we think oh, well that's not fair. What do poor people do to deserve more wealth? So they can spend it on pizza and video games?

	To be honest, this sounds like a liberal caricature of a conservative (or maybe specifically a Boomer conservative).

	The standard Sanders &amp; Co. narrative is that they're just asking "the rich" (and that term is rarely well-defined. For Sanders it was millionaires up until a short while ago when he became on himself. Now it's billionaires.) to pay their "fair share." 

	Of course, when asked, their "fair share" is never given as a mathematical figure of any kind. It's a placeholder for "more" because if you asked people whether the top 10% of income earners paying 70% of the income tax burden was fair, most people would probably say that's fair. If you asked whether the top 25% of income earners paying 85% of the income tax burden was fair, you'd probably get several who start to say it's unfair in the *other* direction. But that's the current reality. 

	Keep in mind also that the top 10% are those making above around $140,000 a year, and the top 25% those making above around $80,000, so not the ridiculously rich. The top 1% (around $450,000 a year and above), as an aside, pay 40% of income taxes. 

	In other words, if the bottom 75% of the income earners is only paying 15% isn't fair (and the bottom 50% actually pay none or get money given to them in effect), then nothing is ever going to be fair enough for those people.

	He's right that it exists, but wrong in how it's perpetuated and how to fix it. I'll only tackle one aspect here.

	>School debt is a scam

	No, it's a symptom both of financial illiteracy (not just from the student, but their parents as well), as well as the glamorized narrative that a college degree is required to succeed in life. That is not something the government can - or should - fix. By wiping away college debt we are not only subsidizing people's bad decisions, but also screwing over the people who put in the effort to fulfill that debt obligation prior to. If school debt is a scam, it's one that parents are willfully putting on their own children. That's not on the government to rectify. Now if the government wants to offer a path to pay off that debt, but requiring some service, that would be perfectly fine; currently you can do that with 3 years of military service (including the Coast Guard) courtesy of the GI Bill, but if they wanted to expand on that and offer something similar in return for a stint in the Peace Corps or some other term of federal service, that would warrant some discussion.

	To the first point, to quote Mike Rowe: we are lending money we don't have to kids who can't pay it back to train them for jobs that no longer exist. The student loan crisis is not new, and while part of the problem is the uncontrolled upward climb of tuition and fees, it also owes in large part to just abysmal financial literacy. We still have people eschewing community college, choosing out-of-state (i.e: far more expensive) schools for non-educational reasons. It has been known for years that many college grads are underemployed or are working outside of their field of study - either way not using their degree. And yet despite all that, brand new adults and their parents still take massive loans every year, a few thinking their Bachelors in Underwater Basketweaving will have a great ROI, some hedging their bets that their debt will be forgiven eventually, others going purely for the "experience" of college across the country. Poor financial decisions like that should not be encouraged, and they definitely should not be forgiven at the expense of taxpayers.

	To the second point, we need to get away from the narrative that everyone needs to go to college. Kids feel pressured to go to university, to get that nice comfortable white collar job. We as a society actively dissuade people from trades schools, despite their fraction of the cost of a 4yr degree but comparable future salaries. "Trades are for dummies, you don't want to work with your hands your whole life, etc etc". As long as the myth is perpetuated that college is an absolute necessity to succeed, we will have parts of whole generations saddled with debt for a long time.

		ah, and to make this comment worth the "delta", it could be boiled down to or reframed like this: wealth inequality at level like it is now in USA (and current trend of increasing it), which is comparable to some banana republics, is not only unfair (different people have different notion of fairness), but is actually bad for capitalism itself.

	Wealth inequality exists, no arguing that. But is it a problem?

	The logical fallacy of it being a problem is that it is impossible decisively to answer the question, “At what point is it no longer a problem?” You will get as many different answers as you get answers. And, beyond that, on whose authority is it a problem? Yours? Your rich neighbor’s? Your poor neighbor’s? It’s all arbitrary. It really comes down to who do you believe has the authority to be the moral arbiter.

	If my neighbor works 80 hours per week and earns $2,000 per week, and I work 0 hours per week and earn $0 per week, we have wealth inequality at the end of the week, don’t we? But was any wrongdoing committed?

	Wealth inequality is only unjust to the extent that unjust actions are taken by individuals. This is where my olive branch comes in, because a lot of wealth is acquired through wrongdoing, typically via government in the form of subsidies, bailouts, special privileges, exemptions, conflicts of interest (insurance companies writing Obamacare). However, this is the minority. 

	Jeff Bezos is richer than Bernie Sanders because Jeff Bezos has helped more people in 20 years than Bernie Sanders has helped in 70 years. A lot of people may not like that statement, but it is unequivocally true.

	You also have to consider the fact that we have a corrupt monetary system based on fiat currency, which unjustly punishes the poor because they feel the burden of inflation infinitely more than a rich person does. By the time the money gets to the poor people in a society, the inflation has devalued each dollar significantly, whereas the person who touched the money first (that would be those who are closer to the banks, i.e. Wall Street), the devaluation through inflation has not been realized by the markets, so they don’t realize the effects. That is one of the main reasons that the middle class has been destroyed over the last 50 years- meaning the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.

	That’s my case.

	It is the natural and recurring result of human nature.  

	That bell curve we learned about in school is bullshit, human performance does not follow one:  

	https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2014/02/19/the-myth-of-the-bell-curve-look-for-the-hyper-performers/#7f4bb5606bca.  

	  

	Human capabilities follow a power curve, with a small percentage of hyper-performers at the top, the rest of about 20% on a descending curve below that, and about 80% dropping fast below that to the baseline of human ability. 

	  

	How people *think* things ought to be has nothing to do with the reality of how things *always* end up.  No,

	Jeff Bezos isn't a billionaire because he works hundreds of times harder than those at the bottom, he's a billionaire because he figured out a service that causes over 200 million  people to voluntarily give Amazon money every year.  

	   

	If you can get 5 million people to give you $5 per month for 5 years that's $1.5 billion dollars. Amazon has like 100 million paying them ~$10 per month just for Amazon Prime membership.  

	  

	You can try and change it, it's been changed many times in the past, but humanity always ends up back here as the driven minority who have skills well suited to the systems in place use them to get ahead and the majority who aren't and don't fall behind.  

	Most of Bernie's proposals are bullshit, they assume that the wealthy and the economy are static entities and that their screwing around with a bunch of taxes that triple Federal revenue will have no detrimental effects.  

	They also assume that some things can actually be solved, like homelessness, when they can't.

So that 'unfair money' is actually being spent on you and the 99.99%, in the form of making goods, providing services.

	>A side thought for you.  

	&amp;#x200B;

	The subreddit /r/badeconomics has a fresh post on Bernie's plans, and their potential economic impact.  Sanders definitely has 'his heart in the right place', but his ignorance of how laws impact economics is, unfortunately, a bad weakness.

	[https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/fejncq/bernie\_sanders\_financing\_plans\_do\_not\_add\_up/](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/fejncq/bernie_sanders_financing_plans_do_not_add_up/)

	> School debt is a scam.  

	You are right.  And when government-paid teachers and school systems get their money, then they encourage students to go to college even though it doesn't always pay off, it's basically a government-supported MLM.  And those aren't sustainable.

	Young people need job skills, a track record, and (gasp!) actual cash to start their economic lives.  Instead, Sanders is encouraging them to take years off and go to college, even though that benefit is ever-decreasing.  And then, he is tacking the bill on to the government, as if it's all going to go away.  Have you noticed the burdens of the post-WWII era going away?  Hint:  today's kids are going to be paying off their student debt in the form of taxes, all their lives.

	> Medical debt is also a scam. 

	You're right.  And the government should be fired, from top to bottom for the way they have screwed it up.

	And Sanders (and most other Democrats and Republicans, by the way) have presented a false dichotomy.  They have created a fucked-up system, and then confuse it for a 'free market' system.

	We could improve health care simply by making health care legal.  Instead, we handcuff the system, prevent cheaper ways of doing things, then sit with shocked Pikachu faces when the system doesn't work.

	Our current handcuffed system, is a 5/10 at best.  Medicare-for-All is an expensive system that may be a 3/10, may be a 6/10.  Same with other expansions of government health care.  

	Or, we could actually allow people real choices in health care, and create a system which is an 8/10 for people.  And for the poor, we could keep in place what we already provide, though I think that could be better handled, too.  But that is a separate thread.

	Clearly we do have a problem with wealth inequality. The question is, can the problem be solved without major bad side effects?

	For example, today US is by far the most innovative country. From software to space to biotech, EU is nowhere near US in the amount of innovation. One reason for this may be that we do have a bunch of people with dispensable resources and desire to throw them around for even better gains. Tesla was not founded in Europe by a European government. It was founded by an eccentric billionaire with way too much money to spend.

	If we get rid of these people, the center of innovation may move to China, for example.

	Second, a lot of the wealth of these billionaires are in their companies, not in their money. If you have a wealth tax, rather than an income tax, (a) you are going to make people sell assets to pay for it - and this for company founders to potential lose the control of their companies, and (b) how do you even value these assets? How much is a privately held company really worth? Which brings another question - how exactly did Bernie’s team come up with their estimates of the fiscal results of their tax?

	The problem with all this is that yes, we do have a problem, but the solutions could easily be worse than the original problem.

	Then there’s also a question of implementation. Say Bernie does become a President. Is he really going to implement any of what he promises? A President of the United States is not a dictator. They cannot create laws. The laws must come from Congress, and for that you need a large national consensus around the issue. Do we have a consensus about socialization of wealth? Heck, we don’t have a consensus about universal healthcare, a much much much easier subject. There is even a consensus within Democratic Party about this (not even healthcare) and there is a unified opposition Republicans. Is Bernie building this consensus? Is there a record of him throughout his career as a leader creating transformation? Nope and nope. So he promises shit that he cannot deliver and has no experience or skills delivering. Even if this was good shit, which is questionable, you ain’t getting it from Bernie.

	I think like with anything it may change after showing practice gave it for flaws. But that's the whole point with Bernie he's trying to shake the tree and see what was fruitful and what wasn't. He may not fully tax them the amount he says BUT he will tax them what they should rightfully owe in terms of how many breaks they've been getting. People who make billions are somewhat self-made and somewhat literally piggy-backing off society. Part of that is business choices... some business choices are bad for people but make the rich, well more rich. I feel like he's trying to take down those ideas and restrict the shittiness of our current situation but that's just my piece on the subject. **Regardless I'm biased because I also want Bernie to win; however bias or no bias at some point you need to rely on facts.** He won't be able to solve all the problems with four years in office but he sure as hell will see what he can get done.

	So, you uncover a lot of interesting things if you look at the math of what’s going on. You can google any of my claims, nothing is made up.

	The “dirty secret” of the Nordic countries is that the lower and middle classes have a much higher tax burden. The United States already has the most progressive taxation of any country in the world; proportionally the rich pay much more. 

	And even though Europeans get healthcare included in that burden, their free spending money is actually significantly lower than when compared to the US. The standard of living in Europe is lower. The poorest 20% of Americans are still better off than the middle class in most European countries (https://www.google.com/amp/s/fee.org/articles/the-poorest-20-of-americans-are-richer-than-most-nations-of-europe//amp).

	And then you have Bernie. In many ways he is a dinosaur from the 70s; his favorite policies are the those that have brought many nations to their knees. He has similar policies to the UK when it was the sick man of Europe. He looks to Sweden and Denmark as his model, but ignores that they repealed wealth taxes because they were devastating. 

	The Nordic Countries are successful today only because they followed the economics of Milton Friedman in the 90s and they liberalized their economy. Their socialist taxation schemes throughout the 80s devastated their economies. Even now they continue to privatize and liberalize the economy further. They have pretty free market economies (absolutely not socialist economies). Want to be like the Nordic countries? Slash the corporate tax rate, raise taxes on the middle and lower classes much higher than they are, and slash the regulations that make it harder to start and operate businesses. With the added tax income, you can have universal healthcare

	See I'm the opposite. I'm pro Bernie but I think his wealth tax is riddled by many economic dilemmas...adverse selection and moral hazard being among them.

	As an econ student, I understand the free economy is in many ways fixed and actively working against the poor AND middle class. Like for real, between interest rates, the way banks create money and government policy, the wealthy and their wealth are protected immensely.

	So higher income tax makes sense and would be in the interest of 99% of the US population. 

	I first tried to reason with his wealth tax, I really did. I recently watched an interview with Bill Gates (again a little bias as someone who adores the man), and he said something about how unfair a $100 billion wealth tax would be.

	I decided to fact check him and found an article that estimated how much the wealthiests' wealth would be reduced from Bernie's plan. I have yet to fact check the article itself but it claimed that we're looking at more than halfing their wealth. Again this is in the interest of 99% people, but is in blatant contrast to individual rights that Westerners value (opposed to collective right valued by other cultures). So in a way, for better or for worse, this tax is unamerian. 

	I find myself aligning with Gates. He agrees with doubling the wealth tax actually, just not to the extent that Bernie wants. Gates also stresses property taxes, which he believes are ridiculously low.

	Though, it is worth mentioning that people are so frazzled by one unjust policy on the top 1%, and seem to not care about the rights violations of various minority groups that happen day to day in the USA. Why all the sympathy for the people who have it easiest?

	I argue that it isn't wealth inequality, in and of itself, that is the problem. Rather it is the out sized derivative political and social power resulting from to the wealth that is the problem. I don't want to stop billionaires from being billionaires as much as I want to stop billionaires from having more say about my life than I do.

	I object to a billionaire being able to pick up the phone and talk personally to the US President   (or any politician) any time he wants. I object to a billionaire, as a practical matter, having the financial power over politicians that enables him to, in effect, cast a personal veto over any proposed legislation he doesn't like.

	As far as I am concerned, billionaires can keep all of their wealth so long as society finds a way to completely neutralize the political and social power (i.e. control over media messaging)  that is currently derived from wealth. 

	The problem is, for the life of me, I haven't yet figured out such a system (at least not a rational/practical one ... an impractical concept might involve a law barring people with wealth above a certain limit from having any communication/contact (directly or indirectly) with any government official or office holder or exercising any control over any media - with a penalty of loss of 99% of your assets for a violation. The idea being ... you can live the life of a billionaire or you can participate in government and/or the media, but you can't do both.

	Billionaires don’t get wealth from nothing. They employ millions of people and provide services millions of people, including yourself, purchase and enjoy. You make these purchases because you believe your money is worth less to you than what you are getting and they believe that your money is worth more than what they are losing. Both parties are happy but now that people see how much the producer earns, they feel cheated somehow. The truth is that while the middle class is disappearing, it is because most of them are ascending into the upper class, not getting poorer. If you still have an issue with these people earning more, feel free not to buy from them, but don’t demand that the government take a higher percent from them to make you feel better even though a vast majority of that money won’t go to you.

	> I can become a billionaire through hard work.

	I really appreciate the train of thought you walked through in your OP, and I'm not here to change the view you are asking to be changed, and instead just want to offer one tiny bit of food for thought on this one idea (and it's maybe already an idea you've rejected, in which case, sorry to waste your time!): that anybody can become a billionaire through hard work.

	Assuming a person could make an average salaried worker's wage in the US, and save it all, not spend a dime on rent, food, or other expenses, it would take that worker [21,000 years to accumulate 1 billion dollars.](https://qz.com/1723454/this-is-how-long-an-average-us-worker-needs-to-become-a-billionaire/)

	And yet, billionaires insist that, if you want to become a billionaire, you need to be the hardest working person in your workplace, you need to work 7 days a week, 12+ hours a day, and [never take a bathroom break.](https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/mike-bloombergs-how-to-get-rich-advice-is-absolute-worst.html)

	Why do billionaires insist on this? Because the only way to become a billionaire, besides inheriting it, is through *the exploitation of other people's labor.* That's why billionaires tell you that if you work your ass off you can become a billionaire too, because if they can get thousands of people to work their ass off, billionaires can **exploit** that labor to fill their own coffers.

	The fantasy of becoming a billionaire by being a hard worker is hardwired into the myth of the American Dream. It's a myth. It's the myth that we buy into--that maybe someday we could be billionaires too--that *allows* the billionaires to fill their purses off the exploitation of our labor.

	If we had an Olympics for "hard work," and could identify the hardest working person in the world with absolute certainty, the most likely scenario is that person is living in poverty.

		This is such unfortunate case of financial illiteracy. When you earn money, you don't keep it under the mattress to build wealth. 
		
		You INVEST your earnings to make more money. You stated it would take 21,000 years to accumulate a billion based on the average U.S. income being reinvested. 
		
		The stock market has average a return of 12% over the past 100 years. [Invest the average U.S. salary every year and you'll have over a billion dollars in 69 years](https://imgur.com/a/4ORVEm0).
		
		
		
		
		You don't become a billionaire or even a millionaire by working a job. You have to create value and own the value you create. You don't work a job as a cog to build wealth. You have invest and take on risk, but that risk creates return and wealth.

	Bernie is economically clueless and out of touch. France tried and abandoned a wealth tax like he proposes. Sweden tried and abandoned a financial transactions tax like he proposes. Bernie likes to say that his proposals are common in places like Denmark, but the Danes are saying he's too radical for them. https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/10/bernie-sanders-too-socialist-for-denmark/

	from another angle, "the rich" and "the poor" are just abstractions, not real people. in reality the majority of individual Americans are in the top 20% of earners AND the bottom 20% of earners. only at different times in their lives. the top 1% of earners has the highest turnover rate of any income bracket in America. only about 3% of Americans are in the bottom income bracket their entire lives, and they're usually seriously disabled people who simply can't work. see Economic Facts and Fallacies by Thomas Sowell

	There is nothing wrong with being rich and wealthy. The problem is when all the wealth increasingly collects to the richest families who use their power to ensure the system captures them even more wealth.  It's an unsustainable system and eventually the people on the bottom will feel they don't have much to lose.

	We want more people to get wealthy but we also want those people to pay increased taxes and we want tax dollars spent on smart, universal benefits to all citizens. That way EVERY American from birth has a basic platform to build from. Maybe they'll be a few less billionaires but we jump start more millionaires overall. 

	America has been good to the most wealthy among us. Is it crazy for them to pay back the public and fund the next generation of Americans? Instead of focusing on the re-distribution of wealth we need to pre-distribute wealth to all people born American citizens and let them rise or fall from there. Teddy Roosevelt understood that without a progressive tax structure, wealthy families would just become more and more powerful in America. That's why TR, a progressive Republican, introduced the estate/wealth tax as a remedy. These are old ideas. Thomas Paine advocated for a wealth tax on land funding a citizen's dividend for all Americans.

	There is one key data point that is never included in these wealth inequality infomercials: age.

	Since we’re talking about wealth here and not income, age is a very relevant metric since older people have had more time to accumulate wealth. I bet you that if those 100 people in the video was lined up according to age rather than according to wealth, very few of them would have to switch positions in the line.

	Just to clarify further: say you have one person who’s 30 years old with a degree from an OK but not great university making about $100,000 a year. She lives in a rental home and only has minor savings, in addition to $30,000 in student loan debt.

	Then you have another person who’s just turned 65 and retired. After working hard for 45 years and saving what he could of a below average wage his retirement income adds up to about $30,000 a year. His mortgage is fully paid off and he has no student debt however.

	In the video you linked the former person would be among the people furthest to the left; one of the poorest, or at least one of the least wealthy, people in America. The latter person would be in the top 20%, even though I think most would agree that the former is better off and better set for the future than him.

	None of the above speaks neither for nor against Bernie’s wealth tax since it only targets households with assets of $32 million or more, I just thought it worth pointing out since it never is in the videos. As for Bernie’s wealth tax, my chief objection to it regards its enforcement.

	One general problem with wealth taxes are that they essentially become voluntary - if you want to evade them, you have the means to do so. There is no such thing as airtight legislation, so if you have $1 billion I can guarantee that you’ll be able to hire a team of lawyers and tax experts that can find loopholes and ways around the wealth tax. This has been the experience of France, Sweden, Austria, Germany and a bunch of other European nations. They all at some point introduced wealth taxes for either financial or punitive purposes, and they all found out a few years later that 1) enforcing the tax costs more money than it brings in, and 2) it’s negatively impacting our economy that the richest people are actively exporting their capital and putting it to work elsewhere. Most of the democratic countries of Western Europe had a wealth tax at one point or another in the past, today all countries except for three have abolished them.

	I know that one of the key points of Bernie’s wealth tax is ”implementing strong enforcement policies”, but I just don’t think that’s going to cut it. Tons of countries have tried it for decades without finding a way to close enough loopholes to make the taxes ”profitable” for the government, so I doubt that Bernie’s rough outline for a wealth tax includes a miraculous solution that nobody else ever thought of.

	I do want to ask how you'd feel if the tax plan was more directed somehow either at 1) the corporations that are nominally worth these amounts and/or 2) the market(s)/shareholders that are representing or holding a lot of this speculated value?

	Would changes like that, intending to have the same ultimate effect of halving the holdings of billionaires and using the now-tax-income money for other programs, make the tax process itself more palatable?

		Not OP, but since a wealth tax is so difficult to maneuver, I'd be into both 1 and 2 you've presented.
		
		Side thought: Taxing the corporations with that profit makes sense to me, especially when most of them exploit the "regular people" working for them and have processes in place that deliberately screw them. The way shareholder protection works in that a company's sole mission has to be profit otherwise shareholders can pitch a fit? Fuck the shareholders. All stakeholders should be considered when setting up business practices. The big bad shareholders don't care about anything but the $$$ in their pocket.

	He is correct about inequality, he is incorrect in implementation and cost. **My concern is the COST WILL FALL ON THE MIDDLE CLASS OVER TIME. The data presented is not completed factual and has been cherry picked to meet campaign promises.** 

	&amp;#x200B;

	**I believe you shall reap the value you bring to society.** We have seen such a huge shift in wealth due to availability and monetization of technology. Google brought us searching. Amazon brought us comprehensive delivery services. Netflix brought us subscriber based entertainment service. Apple brought us the iPhone (it costs too much? Why do the American people continue to buy an inferior product? You can buy an android for less with the same capabilities). With technology you can now reach millions of people for $1. I believe there are more opportunities today than ever before. We have nearly unlimited KNOWLEDGE at our fingertips.

	&amp;#x200B;

	**\*\*CONTEXT\*\***

	This is a response I wrote on Facebook.

	&amp;#x200B;

	Unsustainable.  Bernie’s numbers are CHERRY-PICKED data from studies which made  assumptions.. It’s so naïve to believe that this cost over time wouldn’t  be passed to the middle class American people. Sander’s base says “look  at his proposals”. Sander’s numbers shows you the absolute BEST CASE. I  would love to see an actual well known economist openly support Sanders  plans. Lastly, it also assumes the  abolition of private healthcare which is infeasible. I guarantee the  supreme court will rule in favor of private choice - like almost all  other countries with public healthcare.

	Sources  below: I highly recommend you read more into the details of the plans.  Perhaps you will see the misinformation once you take a deeper dive.  It’s hard to be an unbiased skeptic when you desperately desire change.  There is a lot of misinformation out there and fact checking everything  we read is extremely difficult.

	I am starting to  see why the older generations have bashed on Millennials in the past. I  have seen much less anti-millennial rhetoric in recent years which is  great because it doesn’t help to bash people based on stereotypes.  However, I can still agree on the fact that millennials tend to be  overly entitled, but the truth is with the rise of the internet  (democratization of technology) - you have more opportunities than ever  before. You can now connect with others and generate business value at  rates unseen in previous decades. We have more opportunities at the  American dream than ever before. Although Trump is a buffoon, he has  been paramount in minimizing unemployment and energizing our workforce.  Our system is highly dependent on maximizing labor. A welfare state  would destroy the American economy and the American people would be left  footing the bill. The next quote is actually what I am a huge advocate  for - apprenticeships.

	“The President has worked to  expand apprenticeship programs, helping Americans gain hands-on  training and experience with no student debt.”

	“In  terms of income tax increase, Senator Sanders has already proposed  increasing the top statutory federal tax rate from about 43 percent to  77 percent – which, after accounting for interactions and state and  local taxes, is most likely above the revenue-maximizing level. Although  more revenue could be raised from high earners other than those at the  very top, we estimate it would likely be very difficult for Senator  Sanders to fix the debt simply through income tax increases on higher  earners alone. Rather, significant broad-based tax increases would  likely be required simply to keep the debt at its current post-war  record-high levels.”

	Wealth inequality has pretty much always been a thing, since the dawn of time. Some people always manage to accumulate a ton more wealth than the rest of us. Either through dubious methods or someone just being really, really smart. Think Jeff Bezos starting Amazon. You can hate him for being wealthy but you can't hate him for the way he got that wealth. He worked his ass off for it, happened to be rather intelligent and used everything he had at his disposal to grow that wealth. He even built a pretty amazing website that offers competitive pricing that we all can benefit from. He's providing a service. That's how it should work and you shouldn't get pissed at the guy offering a useful service just because he has a ton of money from that endeavour, of which he took all the risk to grow. 

	It's pretty much the natural state of things. Be in capitalism, monarchy, socialism, dictatorship,  etc etc. It's less about whichever of those systems is currently being, heh, monetized, it's something that will always happen and is definitely not something that only happens under extreme capitalism. Communism for example still has a "1%" within its heirchery. 

	The only time it ever really becomes an issue is if the population at large feels like they can't afford the basic's to survive. Sometimes even if they do have those basic needs met if they can't enjoy some of the "perks" that humanity has to offer we tend to get a bit pissed off.

	To me the important thing to measure isn't "How much richer is Jeff Bezos than the average person" and is more "Can the average person afford the basics." Some people think we're hitting that breaking point already and some don't.

	The problem with Bernie's argument is that he's saying that because people like Jeff Bezos and Mike Bloomberg are super rich that's somehow directly causing a problem for the rest of us. I"m not sure I agree with that. Another issue with Bernie is that he wants you to believe the super rich don't pay taxes. That's just a bold face lie. Yes, corporations dodge taxes all the time but check out Bill Gates talking about the issue of how much personal tax he pays. It's....quite a lot. Dude won't even touch the subject beyond that because it's more complicated than Bernie wants it to be and Gates is smart enough to know the current climate and that he isn't going to get any sympathy despite almost certainly paying more in taxes each year than the combined user base of Reddit.

	In the end, Bernie is a populist. Not unlike Trump in that he's willing to use lies of omission to rally support for the cause of "That rich man is finally going to pay his dues!" and he refuses to go into the actual nitty gritty knowing that won't get the support that "Rich people bad. Poor people good" gets.

	I believe this is why the majority of Bernie's supporters tend to lean towards the younger generations. No offense to anyone on the younger side here on Reddit but let's face it, you just aren't as well informed on the subject as you think you are and Bernie isn't about to give you full details because it ruins his chances of being elected. Eventually, if you're lucky you'll have friends or family that work really, really hard, say, at building up a catering company. They'll work for 10+ years 7 days a week and then maybe they get an offer to sell that catering company. Now, all of a sudden. They're worth 10 million dollars. They are now 1000x richer than you and the rest of your friends. Is that such a terrible thing? Do you resent them or are you happy for them? It's hard to see examples like that, like I have, and think "Those assholes, how dare they have that much more money than me!". For me, i'm happy for them. They fuckin' earned it.

	Always be wary of the guy promising you everything you could ever want. History has shown us that even if you elect those people, you don't get anything close to what was promised.

	Wealth inequality is like a cough. It is a symptom of an underlying issue, not the issue itself. Sure, you could Bernie it up with a political cough drop, but...that won't do anything about the pneumonia.

	Wealth inequality is the result of a game that awards the most "points" for investment, yet has a high floor for entry into it.

	You can get long and flowery with it, but that's the long and the short of it. As a very, very right wing person, it is in no way contradictory in my view to say that the current system is flawed, but to also say that Bernie's "democratic socialism" is also ridiculous. Both have major flaws.

	Billionaires become billionaires because (1) money snowballs as a natural result of compounding interest/ROI, and (2) the barriers of entry and the costs of doing business vanish at higher price points.

	The first is completely fine. It is a natural result of basic economics. The second is the underlying "pneumonia" that is the issue. As a very basic ELI5, a local bookstore has to pay a ton of taxes that Amazon doesn't through clever accounting. This means that the local bookstore has disproportionate fixed costs, and if you think about it, that the government acts as an enforcer for Amazon.

	The socialistic solution of a wealth tax tries to solve the nonexistent problem of the first point, when the real problem is the structural flaws in the second. Eliminate clever accounting advantages by either eliminating the exemptions/deductions for investment, or by shifting taxation from business tax to a VAT tax.

	To open up investing to the poor, there are a plethora of solutions depending on your political leanings. I think a UBI funded with VAT (which captures a ton of money that "the billionaires'" megacorps use effectively tax free currently) and tariffs could work to give everyone enough cashflow to leverage that into meaningful investments like real estate, business creation, or inventory purchasing. If you're left wing, mandate that 5% or so of the shares of all companies over $Xm gross revenue must be held in trust with all dividends split evenly among employees. This basically is UBI, but done through a more traditionally socialistic lens.

	Those are just two radical ideas, but there are tons of others you could do to help people get over the "you have to have 5 digits paid down" hurdle to entering the capitalist side of the market. You could tweak rates, subsidize or exempt down payments, require banks to have a certain percent of their loans to go to people under a certain income, or any other of a host of solutions to fix that problem. 

	TL;DR: The Bernie Sanders "eat the rich" crowd don't solve the real issue, which are barriers to entry and competitive advantages the government gives megacorps.
