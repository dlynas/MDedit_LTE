1/?) How to get dangerous very quickly: a thread. It's getting bad. Pretty soon you'll be able to draw maps around where people you love can and can't exist safely. And with this attack on our ability to exist hate will be emboldened to attack. Y'all, we need to get dangerous.



2/?) This thread is specifically for anybody who isn't armed at the moment, and needs to go from 0-60 as fast as possible. No judgements. No "you should have done this ages ago" statements. Just straight up advice to get yourself able to fight back against hate ASAP.

3/?) This thread is going to be hyper compressed as well. I'm going to be linking to other channels and videos that have the info you're going to need, as well as a few of my own. Remember, you're mastering a wide topic quickly. This will take some energy on your end.

4/?) First of all, gun safety. There's four basic rules. Be aware of your target and what's beyond it. Don't point the gun at anything you don't want to kill. Keep your finger off the trigger until you want to kill the target. Assume every gun is loaded.

5/?) There are two main types of guns and gun thinking. Handguns suck at doing damage, they're easier to conceal, less stable, and (generally) use less powerful rounds. Long guns suck at being hidden, their size makes them easier to stabilize but much harder to conceal.

6/?) Handguns shooting is it's own skill. You aren't going to master it overnight, but there are lots of great resources for getting yourself up to speed as fast as you can. Paul Harrel's series on accurate handgun shooting is INCREIDBLY useful here.

7/?) Paul Harrell's videos are worth checking out. Dry but full of useful information if you're going to need a gun to keep you or your loved ones alive. This one is on ways of carrying concealed which is just as important as accurate shooting.

8/?) Get used to the idea that you're going to have to shift some of your daily happenings. Including what you regularly carry to make sure it includes tools to stay alive and tools to stop attackers.

has a great video on ideas for this.

9/?) If you're going to be doing something that involves discreetly helping others, a pistol is most useful. Which one will work best for you will vary, wildly, but if you're at the "need one this week" stage either ask me personally or watch this:

10/?) Long guns are not going to be easily concealed, but they have advantages in accuracy and they are more effective at stopping an attacker. Open carrying should always be done with consideration to the population - remember, you want the folks you protect to feel safer.

11/?) Don't get a Taurus. Don't get anything from SCCY. Don't get a Hi Point. These may seem tempting due to their ridiculously low price point but that price point comes from significant build quality issues that mean I wouldn't trust my life to them and you shouldn't either.

12/?) If you're going to buy used, make sure someone who knows what they're doing looks at the gun itself before you pay for it. Don't buy used online unless you're comfortable rebuilding the thing. Remember you're going to need a holster, ammo, and possibly other accessories.

13/?) The cheapest handgun I would recommend/trust my life on them going bang consistently and trust as an all around handgun: PSA Dagger. $299, it's "not a Glock" because Glock didn't make it but other than that it's a third gen Glock 19 down to using Glock mags and parts.

14/?) If your main concern is someone breaking into your home, a long gun may be preferable. Despite the size, they are often easier to control as you do so with your whole body and handguns you leverage with only the ends of your arms.

15/?) Pump shotguns have more recoil, but all guns generate dirt and shotgun ammo is particularly filthy. Pumps are arguably the most reliable but depending on cleaning schedule YMMV. Do not "pump to scare." First thing a bad guy hears is an instruction or a bang.

16/?) Red dots are your friends. Gun lights are your friends. Don't have a fair fight, have every advantage. Having a flashlight for your home defense situation is also important, and it should be one separate from the gun - remember, only point the gun at stuff you want to kill.

17?) Practice. Practice a lot. Don't let yourself get flustered or "stop" mid practice. If you get caught on clothing, keep going. If you fumble a bit, keep going. The people coming to get you are not going to slow down to let you redo your draw. Practice drawing and dry firing.

18/?) Do the wrong thing fast, as

teaches. Practice. Time it. Remember, nobody rises to the occasion, we merely fall back on our training. That goes for more then just shooting. Take this entire training and go to a course when you can: [stopthebleed.org/training/](https://t.co/kGIe29EuTq)

19/?) Remember: the people we're fighting aren't playing fair. They're coming after us and they will not hesitate to use details of your life against you. OPSEC is beyond important and something you should start adapting to any discreet activism. [opsec101.org](https://t.co/SWftgc0bHq)
