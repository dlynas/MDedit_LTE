Imbert said when comparing offers of financial aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with a ‘very attractive’ loan being offered by the Chinese government, it's a 'no-brainer'.

Speaking at a virtual media briefing today hosted by the Finance Ministry, Finance Minister Colm Imbert clarified his statements regarding a decision not to apply for IMF assistance.

> “With respect to the Chinese loan, my statements were in the context of insinuations being made...that there were structural adjustment conditions associated with the Chinese loan.”
> 
> “It was in the context of a statement I made that we have no intention of accessing funding from the IMF at this time.”

He added that countries that applied for IMF assistance are required to adhere to various fiscal requirements referring to Jamaica and The Bahamas.

He said by contrast, the terms of a loan agreement offered by the Chinese government has a ‘very attractive’ interest rate of two per cent:

> “With the Chinese loan, there’s nothing like that…all they said is that as part of their outreach programme and foreign policy development, they are lending money to Trinidad and Tobago and therefore 15 per cent of the money they’re lending us must be spent on ‘Chinese elements’ and that could be anything, equipment, vaccines, medical supplies…it’s not a conditionality \[as with the IMF\].”
> 
> “The Chinese loan has a very attractive interest rate of two per cent. The IMF is 1.05 per cent, so there isn’t much to choose between them. If you’re making a judgement call…one loan, no structural adjustment, you don’t have to retrench people, you don’t have to de-value your currency, etc. etc….and then another…you have to do all kinds of terrible things…that’s a no-brainer, obviously you’d go with the one that doesn’t have any structural adjustment conditionalities associated with it, especially since the interest rates are very close, just one per cent apart.”

In an [update on the country's financial situation on May 21](https://tt.loopnews.com/content/imbert-heritage-and-stabilisation-fund-currently-us57b-543451), Imbert said government had entered into an arrangement with the China Development Bank (CDB) for budget support of US$204 million, of which 15 per cent must go toward ‘Chinese elements’. 

Imbert said the country’s net public sector debt was $126.2 billion as of the end of April 2021, while the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio was at 85.5 per cent.

He said the country has eight months of import cover to date.
