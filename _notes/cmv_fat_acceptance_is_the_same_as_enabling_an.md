	So for me, what changed my mind was clarifying two things:

	1. How prevalent anti-fat bias is in medicine and popular culture, and

	2. How things like fat acceptance and Health At Every Size (HAES) have a meaning beyond the fringe internet stuff

	To the first point, like all social movements, fat acceptance and the body positivity movement arose in response to external pressures - namely, that fat people are generally treated worse by the medical establishment ([1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25432989/), [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/oby.2008.636))  and are portrayed very poorly in media ([1](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/health/16essa.html), [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/ijo200822)), for no other reason than their weight. There is a strong perception that obesity is primarily a result of personal choices or lifestyle ([1](https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/ssj/25/1/article-p7.xml), [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0838.2004.00399.x-i1)) when that is not really supported by medical evidence ([1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1741-7015-11-41), [2](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230304239_2)). As a result, there is a lot of implicit and explicit bias, in medical professionals and otherwise, that fat people have to contend with ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3930920/#R16), [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/0801745), [3](https://www.proquest.com/openview/dda6afbde4ebf3f31bc116d8ce8c6f07/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=35035), [4](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0048448), [5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/oby.2003.142)).

	To the second point, while you typically see Health At Every Size  portrayed in a very fringe way on sites like Reddit, it does have a professional meaning. [This article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1681635/) does a pretty good job of explaining the movement from a medical standpoint, but essentially it's a movement among professionals to promote a more nuanced and patient-centric approach to weight management and physical intake. There are a growing number of studies that suggest that this approach is more effective in reducing physiological measures like blood pressure/lipid levels long term, improving psychological health outcomes, and, somewhat ironically, in sustained weight loss ([1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002822309014357), [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002822305003226), [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002822309014357), [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/08020124), [5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/oby.2007.638)), when compared with traditional dieting and behavioral strategies. It's already become standard for dealing with disordered eating: as of 2009, The Academy for Eating Disorders, Binge Eating Disorder Association, Eating Disorder Coalition, International Association for Eating Disorder Professionals, and National Eating Disorder Association all explicitly support an approach that focuses on health measures rather than weight ([Source](https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/AEDWEB/b9c7a708-8c22-4dd4-bf39-bd59fca8ab6d/UploadedImages/Press_Releases/ED_Orgs_Join_Forces.pdf)). It's a pretty new approach, and there is definitely more research that needs to be done before it becomes mainstream, but even if the HAES movement isn't perfect, it's clear that our current conversation about weight in relation to health is too narrow. To put it in context, imagine if, in treating alcoholism, the only number your doctors cared about was your BAC - if you're legal to drive at your checkup, congrats, you're healthy! I'm sure you know that alcoholism is much more complicated than that, and while yes, if your BAC is high all the time it's probably bad, focusing on just that number does a disservice to a lot of patients. The same could be said for our focus on weight.

	Honestly, I get it, there's some really extreme stuff that gets posted on the internet, and it can be frustrating as someone who's seen the harm that grossly disordered eating can do to patients. But what all these doctors in the studies above and the fringe Twitter people have in common is they're both trying to address a problem in the way we discuss, diagnose, and treat weight-related issues in this country. While I would never try to convince you that everyone on the internet who advocates for body positivity is 100% right, I hope you can agree that there is a problem with how things are currently done.

		I dont think either of the articles you linked are really arguing that weight isn't a result of lifestyle. More that we've been unable to change people's weight/habits. I think it's rather ignorant to suggest that weight is, with few exceptions, anything other than a reflection of lifestyle.

			So that's a really interesting question! I linked some similar posts to the commenter below you (at least on my screen), but in the past 114 years our understanding of the causes of obesity has gotten a lot more complicated. [This article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/obr.12266) that I linked previously has an interesting review under the section "Understanding from basic science" about the disconnect between strictly energy-balance based recommendations and our growing understanding of how the body controls adiposity. There's also a big conversation about genetics - [this article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11892-010-0153-z) does a good job reviewing some of the genes they've found, although it's a bit lacking since it only looks at SNPs basically. [This article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6226269/) is also interesting, but the sources are also worth checking out - I was particularly intrigued by the Bouchard monozygotic/dizygotic studies which found a much higher concordance between identical twins than fraternal for obesity. Let me know if any of that is paygated/the link doesn't work!

* üü© **[nightfire08](https://www.reddit.com/user/nightfire08)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2k _(2021-08-09 11:18:12)_

	Addiction is a response to untreated mental illness, with a genetic component thrown in, which is why it‚Äôs so much more prevalent in populations that lack access to mental healthcare. It‚Äôs self-medication gone awry.

	So, shaming addicts, or ostracizing them for their addiction gives them yet another painful thing to self-medicate about. 

	Acceptance isn‚Äôt the same as enabling them- but treating them as ‚Äúless than‚Äù just makes the problems worse, and recovery harder. 

	You could say the same with obesity. It‚Äôs well established that people eat as a stress response- and what‚Äôs more stressful than being shamed for your body? It becomes a vicious cycle. 

	So, not ‚Äúaccepting‚Äù fat people makes their problems worse, and makes it harder for them to overcome them. 

	It‚Äôs not about saying obesity is physically healthy- it‚Äôs about recognizing two very basic, simple truths:

	1: People can‚Äôt be shamed into psychological health

	2: People with diseases like addiction or obesity are still People, and deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, because that‚Äôs what people deserve. 

	There‚Äôs a third one in there:

	3. It‚Äôs not your job to ‚Äòhelp‚Äô anyone get healthy, so commenting on their weight, unless you‚Äôre their doctor or personal trainer, is not appropriate, and what you should do is mind your own business and not give advice, as you would with any other physical ailment, because you don‚Äôt know the whole story. 

	So, ‚Äúfat acceptance‚Äù isn‚Äôt about enabling bad behavior, it‚Äôs about not being an asshole to people who are already struggling.

	EDIT: 

	For the people who are posting things along the lines of "but I shame people because shame WORKS!" I'd refer you to this peer-reviewed medical study saying that it doesn't with obesity, and in fact makes the problem worse. This isn't the only one- a cursory google search will confirm this. So, now you have actual data that refutes your firmly held belief, and like a rational human being, you should change your view and behavior, right?

		Œî Great points - thank you. your comment particularly has made me realize that I have carried a big chip on my shoulder in regards to my own lack of support - perhaps, seeing 'acceptance', whether it's for addiction, being overweight, etc., touches a nerve because it was so absent in my earlier life.

			Another major difference between the two is that nobody can abstain from food forever like is recommended to addicts for their given addiction. I actually lost a decent amount of weight when I was ~20 years old because I simply stopped eating for about a year. Every 3 days or so I‚Äôd have something small but it was seriously so much easier for me to simply say, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt eat and deal with being hungry‚Äù, than it ever was to say ‚ÄúEat this but not that, and only this particular amount of this.‚Äù My relationship with food was based around negative emotions and undiagnosed bipolar. Turns out eating yourself to sleep is a pretty common way to self medicate just like drinking yourself to sleep is. I‚Äôd tried everything up until that point. It might sound dumb or not make sense to people but when your relationship to food isn‚Äôt healthy, every meal is a potential misstep and the guilt that comes from slipping up can be insane to deal with and more often than not perpetuates the unhealthy relationship with food and unhealthy behaviors. Food is a lot less avoidable than abstaining from drugs/alcohol because it‚Äôs not this objectively unhealthy thing we can just avoid. It‚Äôs just a fact of life. I have addicts in my family who have overcome heroin addiction but can‚Äôt overcome their relationship with food. I think it‚Äôs different for everyone obviously and certainly not trying to downplay anyone‚Äôs addiction here. I just think there is a different adjustment being made when someone loses weight and that‚Äôs why it may be treated differently.

				And it's also something that can hit you at an early age. People are starting to realize that old school parenting (i.e. "you can't leave the table until you eat everything on your plate") often leads to eating disorders and obesity. If you grow up in a "eat until you burst" kind of family, you're gonna find it difficult to moderate yourself as an adult.

					Yup I grew up in a household like this. You‚Äôre basically using positive and negative reinforcement to encourage kids to feel over full. And then they get to the point they don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre finished with a meal until that feeling of ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt physically eat more‚Äù hits because that‚Äôs what was encouraged for years. That along with the fact that a big meal at the end of a day is a great way to get a reliable dopamine kick, and the food coma that follows shortly after being the closest you ever feel to ‚Äúnot anxious‚Äù, you learn to use it as a coping mechanism. Sure, you may have an existential crisis or at minimum a panic attack later when you realize this is yet another day you didn‚Äôt solve the problem that bothers you the most in life. But at least while you‚Äôre eating, none of that matters.

					Ok, so I‚Äôm an alcoholic, and I‚Äôm one of the rare ones that was able to reduce my drinking from ‚Äòholy fuck‚Äô to a completely reasonable level (I have one drink a couple nights a week now).   There‚Äôs a big difference between stopping using that substance 100%, and having to reduce it down but still use it.   I would honestly say reducing requires more willpower.     
					
					Every time you have a drink (or eat a meal), you‚Äôre presented with the CHOICE to either drink/eat what you originally were going to, or say fuck it and drink/eat what you ACTUALLY want to (which is way more than you should‚Äîremember, you‚Äôre *addicted* to this substance, it feels *good*, you want to do it until you can‚Äôt anymore).   Every single time, you‚Äôre tempted and have to choose between doing what you want and doing the right thing.  Especially once you‚Äôve had one drink or started eating and have gotten a ‚Äòtaste‚Äô, like a teaser.   It‚Äôs HARD to keep your willpower going when you have to make this choice every time.   Whereas alcoholics/other addicts have the option to just not drink or whatever AT ALL, food addicts don‚Äôt and are forced to make that choice multiple times a day, every single day.    It‚Äôs much harder to moderate than cut out completely.

					Recently there was a post on r/unpopularopinion saying that fat acceptance is wrong and obese people are making a choice to be fat and putting undue stress on the health system. (Paraphrasing here but that was the gist.)
					
					My immediate thought was it isn‚Äôt a single choice, it‚Äôs hundreds of choices. Every day. Every meal. Every time you have to make a decision that will impact your weight. And since genetics is super fun, you have make the right choice almost every time or you won‚Äôt lose weight.  Oh, and it never ends. It‚Äôs not like you lose the weight and then can celebrate and stop making the ‚Äúright‚Äù choices. It never ends because (genetics again!) your body will try and get you back up in weight for survival. 
					
					And if you grew up learning bad eating habits, or you have a condition like ADHD where eating is one of the rare times your brain gets to hit the ‚Äúhappy‚Äù button, you can be screwed. It‚Äôs an uphill battle. 
					
					I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs one we shouldn‚Äôt still try, but sucks when some folks think that we‚Äôre waking up and going, ‚ÄúYup, still want to be a burden on society because cheeseburgers are tasty.‚Äù

						Thanks for this comment, it really nails something I‚Äôve been feeling. I lost 100 pounds a couple of years ago, stayed in shape for a while, and then put 50 back on. It never felt like a big shift, I never felt like I was doing anything on purpose, it‚Äôs just like one day I was like, ‚Äúshit, I‚Äôm fat again.‚Äù Losing weight this time is even harder because I worked so hard for so long, and then the progress disappeared so quickly and easily, so it feels more daunting now. 
						
						Also, ADHD can be a real killer when you‚Äôre trying to control your eating. It‚Äôs an executive function problem, and an impulse control one. This whole process showed me that my own will power and effort are kind of less powerful than my medication, which is a bummer to discover.

							I mean it‚Äôs both a bummer and not. Having adhd isn‚Äôt a failure in will power. Adhd is in major part caused by the frontal lobe literally being too small. It‚Äôs literally the anatomical shape of the brain that‚Äôs wrong, and it‚Äôs unrealistic and way to much pressure to put on yourself to expect your will power to overcome bodily limitations. We would never except someone who suffers from epilepsy to ‚Äúwill power themselves‚Äù out of a seizure so you shouldn‚Äôt hold yourself to that standard

				As a recovering heroin addict alcoholic but just general addict to be safe it‚Äôs pretty common for food to be the next source for comfort a lot of addicts lean on. They always say when you quit drinking you‚Äôll lose weight but I gained weight I needed sweets 24/7. I believe that‚Äôs because your body is so used to the sugar that‚Äôs in alcohol that it craves for it this my excessive amount of Hershey‚Äôs and almonds.

			One more point to add - obesity is different from other addiction disorders in that it is impossible to hide. It's like if you had a constant sign on your forehead saying how many drinks you've had or how many times you've shot up over the last year. 
			
			Even if you're working hard to improve and making good progress, people will still see that sign and judge you without any other context. Like, if you have a sign on your forehead that says "Shot up 178 times in the last year" people will think you're an addict and treat you like one, even if you quit cold turkey 6 months ago.
			
			And weight loss is *slow*. 1-2 pounds a week is generally about the maximum rate you can sustainably go without causing serious medical issues. So, if you weigh 400 pounds, and really bust ass 24/7/365, diet religiously, and hit the gym harder than all your skinny friends, then after a year you might be able to get down to 300 pounds. And people will still just see you as a lazy cheeseburger-guzzling fat fuck.

			I really appreciate this response to a very good comment. I completely identify with why you thought the way you did about addicts, and if you‚Äôre not already aware you‚Äôd be shocked by how common this mode of thought is among former addicts. Quitting without support is (reasonably) a point of pride, to the point that it can sting to see others achieve the same result easier than you did. It feels unfair, because it is unfair! But just remember that you were wronged when you didn‚Äôt receive help, not when others did.

			I'm very obese, because of my medication. I exercised 1 hour a day rigorously 5 days a week and ate 1200 while weighing my food. Lost 20 pounds a year. That is too much to maintain especially I'm suffering from really bad depression. Tried to restrict my food and I kept gaining weight. My old psychiatrist told me there is nothing she can do, so I am suffering for 8 years. I tried to moderately exercise 3 times a week with 1400kcal. No change in my weight. I am very depressed because my weight. I can't bear to go outside because I will be shamed. I avoid pictures being taken because I'm so ugly. I can't even find a relationship because I'm so fat and ugly. I am always scared when people see me. I know their look and it hurts me inside. I have been bullied when I was a kid and have been emotionally neglected by my parents. I was not allowed to go outside on my own so food is my coping mechanism and I have a trauma that I have to keep eating or something bad might happen.
			
			Fortunately a new psychiatrist tells me that there is a medication to offset my weight gain. This is like a miracle to me and I'm scared she might take it back. I just want to feel normal again.

				This. Medication can absolutely mess with your weight gain. I was on a strict 1100 calories diet to lose weight. Only food made from scratch, minimal wheat and rice, overall a healthy diet. I lost nearly 1 kg a week. Then last fall I started on antidepressants for my chronic pain (specifically fibromyalgia which I've had for somewhere around 12 years). My weight didn't just stagnate - I continued on the same diet and my weight increased again. No change in workout or the things I ate. I became so desperate that I went down to around 600 calories in a day to see a change and at that point I could hardly function because I had no energy. At this point I've just accepted that I am slightly overweight (with most of my extra weight stuck on my hips) while being able to eat enough to function. I'd 110% rather be slightly overweight than quitting my meds and go back to being in a constant state of agony.

				Very much this. Negative comments about my body/weight have always sent me directly into a binge eating spiral. I was raised by an extremely fat negative mother who would regularly make comments ranging from "you could stand to miss a meal" to "no one will ever love you" while resorting to the mcdonalds drive thru for almost every meal. Once I turned 16 and started driving I almost never ate in front of her, but I'd gorge on the same fast food she'd raised me on in alone in my car. I dropped significant weight when I moved out on my own and reduced contact with her. When I got into my first really positive, sexually fulfilling relationship the weight melted off and I hit a normal BMI for the only time in my life. Eventually that relationship ended and I found out he'd been telling other women online he liked me better bigger, and that sabotaged the shit out of me; I've since then put all the weight back on and any negative comment about my weight or body makes me feel like I'm 16 again. Shits hard.

				People who fat shame can't keep using that excuse to fat shame people especially when it's scientifically proven to be ineffective. Fat acceptance is really about people who fat shame need to accept their fat shaming is for their own comfort and isn't for the benefit people they're shaming.

			To be fair I understand why you might feel that way. Alcoholics are treated quite poorly, both in life and in culture. We need to lean away from that if we actually want to help ppl. The way alcoholism changes your body is a bigger challenge than most realize. The changes to brain chemistry alone are enormous and that's why we need to lean into compassion bc it is not weak to need help to get over addiction. I worry the shame drives more away from getting help.

			In addition. The science of enduring weight loss is... not encouraging. People can loose weight sure, but it tends to come back. Again and again and again. 
			
			The people who do tend to survive are people who maintain constant vigilance against their own biology, they're white knuckling it for the most part. Counting calories all meals every day, going to bed hungry and so on.
			
			I don't think it's really comparable. You do not in fact have a *very* basic biological drive to drink alcohol. But you do have that drive for food. Overweight people have managed to very slightly miscalibrate their calorie drive (it takes like a glass of milk too much a day to gain weight steadily enough that it's noticeable) and we actually don't know how to fix that, the best we can do is "live in constant conflict with your biological nature while still keeping plenty of chances to fuck up around you at all times" and that's just not that doable. Being shamed does not help that situation, it just makes people feel even more bad so it's kind of an asshole thing to do.

				I think your suggestion that people who have lost Wright tend to gain it back is a bit off base. Ive personally lost 80lbs. Ive kept it off for years. What I have noticed is that people think the extra weight is the problem. Its not. Its the persons lifestyle that really needs to be adressed. 
				
				When i first started my weight loss, I made very small changes. For instance, i cut out most breads and pasta. I switched from rising crust to thin crust. I started a workout schedule, and when i got bored id set challenges for myself. I did a 5k. I joined a jiujutsu and boxing class. The reason people seem to gain weight back is that they crash diet their way to a healthier body but they never make the PERMANENT lifestyle changes.

		Honestly, I think a big part of unhealthy food habits or food addictions is that there is no "cold turkey". You have to eat or you die. It's much more difficult to be forced to consume what you are addicted to or reliant on just to survive. I believe this makes it more difficult for some people to overcome.

			100%. As someone who has struggled with my weight for much of my life, I've never had a problem other things that people consider addictive because I am able to put them aside and go on with my life. I can't do that with food, and many times when you are hungry you just go back to what is familiar and easy, which in many cases is stuff that isn't particularly healthy.

		I'd like to push back on this point. To continue to analogy to addiction, the addict needs a strong social support net of people who are aware of the issue, and are actively trying to help. Sometimes that means emphatically helping them get away from the bottle, etc.
		
		I think the key here is...you can't self-appoint yourself as the "fixer". The person needs to consent to your assistance first, and likely, they should've asked you in the first place. You don't just go around randomly lecturing people.

	I think the premise that a person can only be overweight due to a debilitating addiction similar to alcoholism is flawed from the start.

	Yes it's possible for someone to be overweight due to a food addiction but it's also just as likely that they can't afford healthy food, their metabolism makes losing weight difficult, they don't have time in their lives to exercise, etc.

	Alcoholism or other drug addictions are 100% a direct result of an abuse of an unnecessary drug. Someone overweight might have the exact same relationship with food as a thin person, not to mention that everyone has to eat. You can't avoid food.

	The other major difference is that due to the very visible nature of being overweight (as compared to some other addictions), overweight people are often subjected to cultural and interpersonal ridicule in ways that, lets say, an alcoholic will rarely be.

	A functional alcoholic can go through life without anybody suspecting they have an addiction, while an overweight person is often reminded of their difference in large and small ways daily. And even if their alcoholism were public, the response is often compassion as opposed to either ridicule or shaming that an overweight person often receives.

	That's what the fat acceptance movement is in response to. It's telling overweight people that their value as a person is not dependent on their weight.

		Metabolic conditions that genuinely cause people to gain significant weight are very rare, and can usually be controlled by not over eating.

			CICA is true, but you also have to keep in mind that there are factors that contribute how many calories are burnt for an individual. There are also possible issues with certain hormones that regulate your appetite that can factor in.
			
			For example, I take a [medication that increases ghrelin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18579280/), the hormone that is responsible for feeling hunger. So pretty much i feel intensely hungry all the time, which is maddening. Sure, I can just ignore the hunger, but have you tried sleeping while in intense pain from hunger even though you've met your daily caloric intake? It's easy to say "just don't eat" until your body is screaming at you that it needs food that it doesn't actually need.
			
			Bodies are complex machines and a lot of factors can come into play with obesity. 
			
			You can also factor in issues like thyroid or insulin levels messing with your metabolism or the amount of hunger you feel. Feeding is an innate survival drive that is hard to contend with. Sensitivity is necessary in dealing with people with certain medical conditions or people who need certain medications that can effect hunger.

They do extensive (and very good) reporting on extremism and fake news. One of their more recent projects is on China and Uighur genocide.
				
				Buzzfeed is an entertainment site that largely serves as an aggregator for general internet shenanigans. Buzzfeed is not journalism. Buzzfeed News, however, is. Buzzfeed News is a reliable source, particularly in areas regarding internet culture. They do great, important work and it's unfair to lump them in with the Buzzfeed creators.

			These are good examples and it helps a lot, but a definition would be useful as well, especially when you say something like:
			
			> I am NOT saying that anyone should be treated cruelly.
			
			What does that mean to you?
			
			
			I think I generally agree with your line of reasoning. But I also think many people misinterpret what advocates of body positivity mean - though I wouldn't consider myself an active advocate. Not to say that the people you have in mind don't exist, but I'm not sure if they are the majority. Some more convincing counterpoints are:
			
			
			- Unlike what some others here say, eating less or more healthy will actually help for everyone. Still, not every body treats food the same way. That doesn't explain a BMI of 40+ - but being slightly overweight may be partially explained by your body type. Many just want to stress that having such a different body type is okay.
			
			
			- In the cases above, it wouldn't be unreasonable to expect society to be (somewhat) accomodating.
			
			
			- Being slightly overweight, even if you have a slim body type, can be illustrative of a choice. Just as there is an incredible amount of accomodation for people who (moderately) like booze, it isn't weird that those overweight expect a (partially) similar treatment. The example of towels can then be similarly non-friendly to customers as saying that 'we don't pour booze, you should just stop drinking'. Plus, there is generally similar acceptance towards accommodating many other addictions or hobbies (or both), e.g. smoking.
			
			
			- In cases of (heavy) morbid obesity, this can coincide with what amounts to an addiction to food. This is also what you seem to believe. While it is fair that we do not have enable, the response is often that people should just 'eat less'. In essence that is true, but it is similar to telling an alcholic that they should just 'stop drinking'.
			
			
			- In the example above, the question then also remains whether or not you are in the place to try and force a change of habit - and whether this is achieved by what you do. Do we really believe a significant amount of morbidly obesed people lose weight because the towels are too small on a holiday? I don't think we have established at all that we are *enabling* anything by accommodating their current state. Should those people not at least be able to order larger-sized towels at a fee? Why not? I don't think that is being as enabling as selling cigarettes, which we may expect from many hotels (I even think it is less bad).
			
			
			I'm not saying there aren't extreme cases, but I think many advocates are thinking of these examples. In many cases it is simply a spectrum (and personal perspective) for at which point this treatment becomes 'cruel'. I think the examples you mention are good examples of it going too far. The more extreme people can *still* make that last point quite convincingly - is it really the business of a hotel (or anyone) to be considering the health or body size or type of their customers?

	As a fellow alcoholic, let me explain something. Being an alcoholic gives you ABSOLUTELY ZERO grounds of experience on the issue of obesity.

	There is not a daily need for you to use your drug of choice in recovery. You do not need alcohol to live. You will not die if you never drink again.

	Now do you understand why food addiction and chemical addiction are NOT the same?

	This post remaining up is a lightning rod to attract people who have that harmful view. You do not get to boost yourself with the apology at the end. If you have learned the mistake you made posting it, you need to delete it.

	I think it's best to see this tendency as perhaps an overcorrection of the constant and universal shaming of obese people in every area of life. I myself am obese (working on it) and many people I know are as well, and I don't know of anyone that demands unfair accommodations, etc. we usually just don't want people to be rude. 

	And I saw a few comments about how obese people will often criticize a doctor as being fat phobic. And maybe sometimes that's a bit of a defense mechanism, but it's also against the tendency of doctors/people to dismiss the concerns of fat people. Like saying "oh you're just fat, lose weight and you'll be fine" and maybe not trying necessary tests or also thinking of other possible causes for an issue. Maybe you disagree with how common it is, but I think it's pretty obvious on it's face that fat people are often dismissed as being "just fat." so it would make sense to me that it can happen.

	And your furnished with booze argument, what does this even mean? Are fat people showered with pizza out of nowhere? Or demand free food? No they just want to do what they want and exist. 

	And I'm friends with some alcoholics (congrats on the 6 years sober by the way!), and I don't treat them negatively or tell them what they shouldn't or should do unless they asked me to look out for them. That happens with my obese friends too. We're all struggling, we all do things that are harmful to us at points, and we're all hoping to improve and dealing with that journey.

	And do fat people demand to be the equivalent of a drunken mess? People don't want to be around drunk people because of how people act when they're drunk. If I eat an entire pizza, I just get tired, I'm not belligerent or rude or loud, etc. 

	So the acceptance thing is just recognizing that life is hard and people want to feel valued, loved, attractive, etc. as much as we can. Obese people usually KNOW that there's an issue or potential issue, even if they're pushing fat acceptance stuff. So when we don't want people to bash us over the head with why that's wrong, it's because we already have our own issues around the subject and don't need you, a stranger, to put your input in.

	Last thing, I think the food being different than drinking thing is because food is a necessary aspect of life, which is why our entire society, for the most part struggles with it. I have binge eating disorder and have been addicted to food my whole life (it can be really upsetting and dark), and the fact that it's always there and necessary makes it feel like I'm always dancing with the devil, so to speak. So even the accommodation thing, we have accommodated overweight people because our entire country (America) has generally skewed that way, so that even people now that are considered thin would have often been considered a bit heavy 80 years ago, right?

	As someone who definitely needs to lose a few pounds, you know what strategy is the LEAST effective in motivating me to lose weight?  People making fun of me for my weight.  People telling me that I need to lose weight, when it's none of their goddamn business. People mocking me at the gym for actually trying to lose weight.  There have been [actual studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6565398/) showing that fat shaming only makes people "sicker and heavier."

	If fat people don't try to lose weight, we're called out for being unhealthy, gross addicts.  If we do try to lose weight, we're ostracized from those spaces because people don't want to look at our gross bodies.

	"Shaming people" because of their weight has only ever caused harm.  Not only in discouraging fat people from getting the help they need, but also in [causing eating disorders](https://news.llu.ed[u/health](https://www.reddit.com/user/health)-wellness/how-weight-shaming-can-lead-serious-eating-disorders) \- particularly in young girls - who are so terrified of becoming fat that they harm themselves into becoming skinny and malnourished.

	EDIT: Holy crap, y'all are toxic as hell. Love how absolutely *nobody* in the comments is acknowledging either the study I linked showing that fat shaming literally just makes obesity worse, or that fat shaming has contributed to eating disorders.

	> I see NO difference between this and demanding that, because I'm genetically an alcoholic, I should be furnished with booze and allowed to be a drunken mess.

	The fat acceptance movement isn't demanding fat people be showered in donuts and pizza. We live in a strange society. On the one hand, the portions of our food are massive, cheap, easily available, and addictive. The advertising for it is everywhere, fast food is everywhere.

	Then on the other end we have our nations beauty standards. Skinny is beautiful. Actors in movies and t.v will be incredibly in shape. The roles of fat people are extremely limited (when was the last time you saw a fat leading actor or love interest). In magazines and on Instagram Photoshop is rampant, making already hard beauty standards almost impossible to live up to.

	So with one hand our society forces food into our face, and with the other it slaps us and says "you're so ugly we can't even show you in our media"

	I used to be fat. I hated my body the entire time. It made me depressed, it affected me socially and academically. I was never under the illusion it was healthy to be fat, very few people are. And even after losing the weight I still have issues with how I perceive and judge my own body. 

	Fat acceptance isn't saying being fat is healthy, but it is saying you shouldn't hate yourself just because your fat.

Maybe a somewhat overweight man with a ‚Äúdad bod‚Äù like Al Roker, but never an obviously plus size woman.

	How we address obesity as public health problem and how we treat individual obese people are two different issues. We can try to fix society-wide problems that lead to rising rates of obesity without blaming or needlessly punishing individual people. A cursory search for "how to approach an addict" yields a lot of results like [this](https://www.healthline.com/health/addiction/helping-an-addict#talk-to-them), that say you shouldn't use blaming language or get angry when you try to broach the topic with people. I think the same is true for obesity -- there's nothing to be gained from being mean or blame-y (indeed, people such as [Roxane Gay](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/02/roxane-gay-bad-feminist-sisterhood-fake-orgasm) have published extensively about how shame is a big factor that contributes to obesity). Fat acceptance isn't about accepting obesity as a society, it's about not judging individual people and making life even harder on them than it already is.

			Because of context. Going around telling people about health risks without being asked is generally annoying behaviour.

				They don't, though. They go "yeah, I know. I should quit..."
				
				They don't go "excuse me, are you my doctor? There's no actual proof that smoking is bad for you. I know a smoker who's a marathon runner and has perfect bloodwork. I keep coughing up blood but all my doctors do is tell me to quit smoking instead of just fixing the problem I came in for! Smoking != unhealthy." Never met a single smoker in my life who didn't acknowledge that it was harmful.
				
				The original idea of fat acceptance was literally just "stop being a dick." It's now morphed way beyond that, to the idea that actually it's not unhealthy at all. Beating a dead horse here but Tess Munster was on the cover of Cosmo. We shouldn't be glamorizing not being able to stand up under your own power. If they had put an anorexic model on the cover there would have been a national outcry about glamorizing unhealthy eating disorders and such. I think it's safe to say it's gone way beyond the original intention, and is only going further in that direction.

				Thats a really interesting and insightful point equating obesity with smoking. The same effort that is put into eliminating smoking should be put into eliminating obesity. They are both very serious preventable medical problems. Many of the same strategies would work. Tax the heck out of foods with high fat or sugar content. Have advertising bans eg no junk food ads targeting children. Public health campaigns. Higher health insurance rates for fat people. All these things were done for smoking on grounds of public health so why would targeting obesity be any different. In the west obesity is far more of a problem than smoking.  In Texas there is a whole hospital the specialises in surgery and treatment of the morbidly obese.

					I think it's a bit more nuanced than that.
					Suggesting there are no health risks to obesity is inaccurate and I would definitely disagree with anyone posting that. 
					
					However, it is also true that doctors are human too amd subject to their own biases. Fat people are likelier than thin people to not have doctors treat other, unrelated conditions they have because doctors don't look deeper into it and simply attribute their health issues to their weight. There have been cases where something as serious as cancerous tumours weren't caught on time because doctors didn't think it was necessary to investigate and simply recommended that their patient lose weight. It may not even be a conscious bias, but the effect is still real.

					There is a problem with doctors being lazy and blaming all health issues on being overweight.
					
					I once went to the doctor to get an IUD when I was six weeks postpartum and was about 30lbs overweight from the pregnancy (don't tell me you aren't supposed to gain weight while pregnant, pregnancy fucks with your metabolism sometimes) and I got a lecture on my weight when a) I was aware I was overweight and b) it had absolutely no bearing on getting the IUD. The doctor got super embarassed and left the room when I pointed out to her that I had just given birth. The lecture was so humiliating that it also sort of sent me into a downward spiral back into my eating disorder. 
					
					It isn't so much that doctors shouldn't bring up weight, but it's important that they bring it up when it's actually appropriate in the context of the health issues being addressed and it's very important that it's done tactfully. You never know what a person's background might be with things like eating disorders, mental health issues, or other contributing factors that aren't in their control. Educating patients about the health risks of obesity is very important, but sensitivity is vital.

					It's not that much different from how when women go to doctors.
					
					When a women goes to a doctor to complain about any pain or discomfort, the doctor almost always goes to their menstrual cycles and their sex life. Pain in your side? Must be mensural cramps. Light-headedness? Libido. Then bam, you have pancreatic cancer or a dying liver that could've been detected had the doctor performed some basic tests.
					
					For fat people, it's the same song and dance but replace menstruation and sex with weight and diet. Never mind the fact that being fat doesn't negate healthy eating and healthy exercise, and never mind the fact that not all health issues have to be tied to weight. Obviously, an obese person negatively reacting to reports about high cholesterol is one thing, but someone whose health constantly gets reduced to their weight, and not any other factors, that can get extremely grating when you're just trying to figure out what's wrong with you.

					I 100% agree to that being ridiculous behavior, however social media is not representative of society at large.
					
					Looking at twitter too much makes one really believe that the US is in the middle of some darwinian free-for-all tribal war, but talking to people in real life I find that these extreme believes are really the exception.
					
					Some underlying mechanics of social media, or maybe media/ attention economy in general, really emphasize the extreme opinions...

					One of my best friends has a family history of gallbladder issues, most women in one side of her family have had to have theirs removed across a spectrum of body types. My friend had to visit close to 10 doctors before she found one that would even consider the procedure without her dropping weight for at least a year first. She's overweight, not obese. She's struggled with her weight her whole life but did have a few years at an ideal BMI when she was younger and poor with no health insurance; she still ended up in the emergency room multiple times during that period with gall stones. Yes, her overall health would likely improve if she lost weight, but that doesn't invalidate the fact that her overall health and quality of life would be better without the damn gallbladder. Thats what people mean when they talk about doctors being fatphobic; they refuse to treat anyone who's not at their ideal BMI, even though you can be fat AND having an issue.

					The problem is the doctors that suggest that health risks are ONLY linked to obesity and ignore other health risks fat people face by blaming everything on them being fat.
					
					Fat people aren't deluded into thinking there are no issues or risks associated with their weight, but they also know their bodies pretty well and if they come in with a serious health concern and the first or only suggestion doctors have is "lose weight" when there's something more serious going on, it can be life-threatening.

						It makes it harder for doctors to diagnose a person when they're wearing the source of hundreds of ailments already.  They're not magic, and they are required by logic and duty to start with the most obvious answer and continue from there. This is where the  "think horses, not zebras when you hear hoofs" comes from.  All the more reason obesity is dangerous. And obese patients are not the only ones who experience this, rarely does anyone with a serious issue get immediate answers or a full diagnosis on their first visit. It took eight years to find out my trap muscle had been paralyzed. Because I was 5'9" 115lbs the assumption was I had poor muscle tone and needed to strength train and gain weight. Frustrating life ruining and mentally damaging yes, but their recommendations were completely logical for the info they had.   No one is being discriminated against for being fat. Being fat prevents accommodation.

						I mean, at some point Occam‚Äôs razor kicks in. If there are 20 explanations for why your knees hurt, and I‚Äôm actively observing one of them in action right now, then that‚Äôs going to influence my thinking a little bit.
						
						Add in the fact that American healthcare basically treats patients like items on an assembly line and asks too much from too few providers, I can understand why patients would perceive that doctors ‚Äúonly‚Äù see being fat as the issue, and I can see why some doctors (obviously not all of them) fail to dig deeper.
						
						Now, the presence of an easy explanation does NOT absolve a doctor from doing due diligence and trying to get to the true root of the problem. But if 100 patients present with the same symptoms (say, knee pain) and ‚Äúfat‚Äù is the most likely explanation for 80% of those cases, then it makes sense to start there as a treatment point for everyone, and explore alternative explanations once the more likely ones are exhausted.

I have an aunt who is without a doubt morbidly obese and she has gone through doctor after doctor because every single one tells her all her health issues relate to her being obsess: because they do! This isn‚Äôt a doctor not seeing other issues, it‚Äôs obesity being so terrible for human beings that treating any other ‚Äúunderlying condition‚Äù that aren‚Äôt serious disorders takes away from the fact that obesity makes every other health issue harder to fix. That bad knee from 2 decades ago? Yea it‚Äôs still fucked because you weigh 400 pounds and never once put effort into physically rehabbing it. So don‚Äôt put all fat people into a box, there are absolutely ones who completely blind themselves to the fact that being that heavy is drastically unhealthy and the vast, VAST cause of their health concerns. They literally refuse to accept it, in a large part because of this narrative of fat acceptance to the extreme, where legitimate health concern is treated as bigotry. I‚Äôve had in depth conversations with my aunt, I don‚Äôt want to see her dead because she simply couldn‚Äôt stop eating, and I‚Äôm not trying to say all overweight  people are like this. But to say that there isn‚Äôt anyone out there using this narrative of fat acceptance as an echo chamber to completely ignore the health issues that being morbidly obese brings on is naive. There are really not a lot of doctors out there telling people that they have no health concerns other than being fat, it‚Äôs people focusing on that because it‚Äôs causing 90% of the issues and stubborn humans being like ‚Äúthat doctor just told me I‚Äôm fat‚Äù. I‚Äôve literally been in the room for those convos for the person to walk out and be like ‚Äúthey just want to tell me I‚Äôm fat‚Äù and in actuality it‚Äôs  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hear about how my shitty choices have crippled my life, so that doctor must be an idiot‚Äù.

							How exactly does all of that insinuate that all they see of you is fat? Obesity is a major health problem that effects every part of your physical body and mentally. If a doctor says that your problems originate from being obese he or she is most likely right.
							
							This is the problem with Fat acceptance movement. You are self victimizing yourself by putting the blame on people with a profession that for literally most of their life have studied and worked on diagnosing people. This is just nothing more than refusing to accept the problems you have. Sure there are situations where doctors make mistakes. But those are outliers and in no way an epidemic of doctors who miss diagnose obese people and only blaming it being "fat".
							
							Instead of blaming doctors accept that most of your health problems are from being obese. If you have a problem with doctors giving you advice on how to fix your health problems than no one else can help you. And that is by your choice.

		Often the base definition gets twisted by the personal lens.

	OP, I can see that after all these comments, this thread has cooled and you have made edits to your post. I hope you will still see this comment, and hopefully, it can help change your mind. 

	I‚Äôm an addict, addicted to food. At my largest I was 730 pounds. I carried it well (relatively‚Ä¶) usually people that size need to be lifted by cranes and flatbed trucks. I was still riding my motorcycle and driving my Jeep. 

	I was never one for fat acceptance. I was ashamed of who I was and what I looked like. Through a roller coaster of events, I dropped to a 1200 calorie a day diet and only worked out on days that had the word day in it. it took years but I went from 730 down to 230. 

	I was proud of how much I had lost, but had nothing but empathy for people who were bigger because I know how bad it sucks. You‚Äôre in a hole with a shovel and it only gets deeper. 

	Something extraordinarily traumatic happened, and I fell off the wagon. Not only did I go back to eating 4,000 calories a day but I started drinking and I never drank before. I gained 150 pounds In a year. So now I‚Äôm 380. If you look at just my height and weight, I am technically morbidly obese. But when people meet me, they don‚Äôt know my history. They don‚Äôt know that yeah, I‚Äôm huge by most every standard, but I used to not be able to fit through doorways. I would break office chairs. 

	I‚Äôve been stable at this weight for 18 months. 1-2 pounds off, 1-2 pounds on. I‚Äôve gotten back in charge of my life. I‚Äôm not an advocate for fat acceptance. But I accept my weight, and I‚Äôm damned proud of my current weight, given that I was once twice as big. 

	Point is, don‚Äôt automatically think that people who are proud of their bodies are embracing unhealthy addiction. I‚Äôm fighting it every day, and I wish people were more compassionate and empathetic.

	I'm not sure if I can add a lot of content that hasn't already been covered. But I'll try from the perspective of a fat person. 

	First, I don't have the option of quitting food. I've quit soda because I don't have the capacity to moderate my intake, and if I don't drink it regularly, it tastes nasty.  

	Second, moderation and healthy habits are hard. I've been working with a nutritionist. I'm adding fruit and vegetables to snacks and meals. I am trying to add activity to my day to day life that I can keep up indefinitely. 

	Third, nature and nurture. I've never been skinny. I was 170lbs in middle school despite shotput and martial arts. My grandparents made sure I had healthy food,  but they were of the age of depression. It was normal that I was forced to finish my food or called upon to finish someone else's. I worked my ass off and joined the military. The only times my weight was halfway decent was when I was working 12 hrs shifts and was too busy to eat regularly,  or when I worked out twice a day (45 minutes of cardio, plus 15-30 minutes of other exercises) 5+ days a week. I don't have the mentality and drive to do that. 

	Four, diversity. I have a cousin that looks like she could be broken in half like a twig. That's healthy for her. She eats when and what she wants to eat.  Humans are not all built the same. I only wish it were so easy for me. 

	Five, social/ society. I'm required to have a job as well as my husband. That doesn't leave a lot of time or energy for meal prep. Grabbing food fast equals high taste reward, low health reward. Furthermore, healthy food tends to be much more expensive (unless you have and take the time to prepare it) and has a lower shelf life. Lastly, getting food that my husband, my child, and I like is... problematic. He could live on fast food. Bitter tastes and odd textures turn him off to most of the weirder, but healthier, foods I like. 

	Six, impossible body types. Healthy doesn't necessarily mean skinny (though, obviously obesity isn't healthy). Try to find a picture of a natural woman that is depicted a desirable beauty. It doesn't exist. Men are heavily pressured as well, but at least dad bods are becoming accepted.

	So, here I am, a fat sack of shit. I'm trying to get through the day to day. Any little dose of serotonin that helps make it more palatable helps... and food will always be easily available. The other side of it is I know I need to be healthier. I know I have to work harder to be healthier. 

	But, people treat you like you have no worth if you're fat, like fat is the worst thing you can be. Like there aren't innumerable toxic traits that skinny people have that are over looked because you can't tell at first glance. 

	I realize alcoholism isn't a disease, any more than obesity. That some people are more inclined to it. That it is destructive to your health, and only that person can decide to become better. 

	But the fact is, that fat people exist. Their habits really don't put other people in danger (unless you count teaching the behavior, which In desperately trying not to). They are customers, and they are asking for accommodations within reason. Which companies likely don't want to do because it will increase their costs. 

	And frankly, I'm tired of being conditioned to feel like being fat is the worst. If there is anything wrong with me, it's because I'm fat. I am ugly, undesirable, and worthless as a human being because I am fat. I can't be pretty, bright, a delight, or anything positive unless it's despite being fat. 

	I guess it was easy a just giving up something. Whether it was chocolate, coffee, etc. But nutrition isn't that easy. I know giving up an addiction isn't easy (there are plenty of people that smoke or vape. It seems so easy to quit to me, but I've never smoked, so I realize that I just don't know how hard it is.) I can only speak from my perspective.

	To answer your question, I can support the addict without enabling the addiction. 

	Corporations ARE already enabling obesity (low quality, high calorie foods and beverages are everywhere and cheap). Hotels needing accommodations are a false equivalent.

	Double Plus good new speak.  To understand "fat acceptance" we need to identify the two disconnected meanings for the word/phrase and talk about them independently.

	Fat Acceptance "A" is exactly what you talk about.  It's helping the alcoholic get more booze and stay drunk.  It's building up a body of apologetics for why it's not really the drunk driver's fault they murdered a family of 4 while too drunk to stand up.  This Fat Acceptance "A" exists to make the land whales feel better about themselves because "It's a thyroid problem", not "why in hell did you eat 16 big macs today"

	Fat Acceptance "B" is basically AA for obese people.  Shaming and abuse is probably why they are fat in the first place.  That Big Mac never judges them.  Doubling down on making them feel bad about their weight is just going to result in them doubling down on the number of Whoppers they eat.  Having that person who can't walk a mile be greeted with smiles and encouragement when they are trying to do a lap around the park will encourage the behavior of walk a lap around the park.  This "don't shame fat people for existing in public (particularly when they are up and walking around getting exersize and just doing what they need to do so they can lose weight)" is a truly life changing thing for people trying to improve themselves.

	>I see NO difference between this and demanding that, because I'm genetically an alcoholic, I should be furnished with booze and allowed to be a drunken mess.

	Is someone providing these obese people with food and taking away their responsibilities to  work and buy their own food?

	Society in general doesn't have a problem with alcoholics who don't drive drunk,show up to work able to perform their duties, don't spend their paycheck at the bar,  and have healthy relationships with the friends and family members in their life. But be honest, if you were in addiction recovery you almost certainly didn't fit that bill.

	Fat acceptance falls in line with an ideal we were all (hopefully) taught as kids. Outward appearance does not equal worth. That‚Äôs all it boils down to. 

	I also urge you to look at it from the opposite lens. Many many young girls are obsessed with the idea of *not* being fat, and are then shown ‚Äúfat‚Äù women by media, so they starve themselves to not be that way. But if we take away fat as a derogatory term, that breaks the chain.

	You need food to live. You don‚Äôt need alcohol or drugs to live. So even if it is food addiction, it‚Äôs a lot more complicated to combat than other substances that a person can walk away from and avoid forever. Food addicts will constantly be faced with their problem and triggers for the rest of their lives. 

	But there is a much bigger group of obese people who‚Äôs bodies will stay the same shape no matter how little they eat. It‚Äôs a very ignorant way to view people just because of the size of their bodies. Sure some people are capable of shedding weight and controlling their size with diet and exercise, but they are a relatively small group of people. For the majority, things like metabolism, hormones, menstrual cycles, thyroid issues, autoimmune disorders, type 1 diabetes, etc. will all affect size and weight beyond their control. It‚Äôs great to be healthy and have complete control of your body, mind, and life, but you need to understand that you are the very minute minority. Most people around you are fighting an intense battle that they never asked for or wanted, and the rest of us have no idea. All we see is fat, one symptom. And we assume that‚Äôs the only problem they have.

	The issue seems to be muddied waters. What "fat acceptance" started as was don't be a dick to someone just because they are fat. Fat people were pretty much seen as universally ugly despite any other features. For anyone with addiction or who uses food as a comfort to deal with mental illness (me included) this leads to depression and disillusionment. The basic thought becomes "I'm ugly, and if I lose weight I will still be ugly, so why bother." This leads to someone who was fine in any other respect to stop any kind of care, including mental health care and personal hygiene. In the same way that anyone should love yourself despite your flaws, it's ok to be proud of other physical traits despite being overweight.

	It's also because obesity is a clearly visible vice, so people are more confident in being judgmental. You can't glance at someone and know they have a gambling addiction, or are an alcoholic, or are addicted to cocaine, but you can tell a person is fat from a mile away and we all know it.

	It also affects healthcare, and not in the ways you expect. It is clinically irresponsible for a doctor to not tell an overweight person to lose weight, but is also irresponsible for them to brush off complaints as "solely due to weight." In the same way people get brushed off because "it's just anxiety" or "it's just your period" or "it's just aging," being fat generally leads to getting worse healthcare. Especially when the weight is a symptom of underlying causes.

	Of course there are apologists who take it too far. Nobody should be shamed for wanting to lose weight. Excess fat is detrimental to health on physical, physiological, and mental levels. However, the depression that comes with a stigma may discourage a person from even trying. Even if you are not perfect, you can be fat and *relatively* healthy. If you walk several miles a day, then eat a whole cake, you will be fat and suffer any joint pain/damage due to the excess weight, but your blood pressure and other health factors will benefit from the aerobic exercise.

	If you look at this CMV you can see how Fat acceptance is needed and not the same as an alcoholic acceptance. fanboy_killer said the fat acceptance movement went too far because there were a few overweight woman in a magazine. This is hilarious because there are still magazines, commercials, and movies that show drinking as a fun harmless pass time. Let‚Äôs not forget that ‚Äútraditional‚Äù models are unrealistically skinny and have caused many girls to have eating disorders to live up to that false image.

	> The specific article in question that made me write this was all about how a hotel did a poor job of catering to 'plus-size' people due to the fact that towels and toilets were "too small." I am not advocating for cruelty or 'shaming,' but rather, this notion that the world should change instead of oneself.

	The issue here is that these accomodations are not going to make it harder for fat people to lose weight, it's going to cause other issues, from mild stress due to too-small toilets and towels, to musculoskeletal issues caused by poor posture and accomodations. 

	I'm quite tall, and I have problems with my rib cage simply because I have had poor back support from almost every chair I've ever sat in since middle school. The same applies to people who are overweight. Tacking these issues onto someone who is already overweight is only going to make it harder for them to lose weight, especially if they are stress eaters or have other problems.

	Without the article I can‚Äôt know if the receptionist was rude, or how fat was the lady, but they can‚Äôt call it discrimination if the toilets are regular size just as you can‚Äôt call discrimination if their bathroom is not safe enough for you if you pass out drunk inside during an episode‚Ä¶ 

	It‚Äôs just an hotel buying the best toilet they can according to their metrics of average customers.. 

	If you want people to accommodate a very specific need you have, there are other options.

	It‚Äôs not like fat people instantly aren‚Äôt fat anymore the second they try to do something about it. A lot of them fight an internal battle all the time about their diet or lifestyle. 

	Accepting is not the same as enabling. Sometimes acceptance and love can help people overcome difficulty in their lives. 

	If we vilified addicts for what they were, I think a lot of addicts would have a harder time recovering. Sure, some of them may be driven to quit due to shame. But remember that there‚Äôs a downside to fat shaming too. Like all the girls (and boys) who hurt themselves due to anorexia or bulimia.

	We already have alcoholic acceptance. 

	We don't blame the alcoholic (well, entirely) for becoming an alcoholic, and we support their struggle to control their addiction. 

	The same is true of fat people, except a lot more people don't accept that having a genetic predisposition to becoming fat is a factor, nor do they accept that fat people aren't just lazy assholes who purposely eat until they're gigantic.

	Very few fat people want to be fat people. Science just literally doesn't know how to go about helping them not be fat anymore. Anyone who says "just eat less and exercise more" isn't technically wrong, but they're an asshole and have no idea about the complexities of the situation.

	When a human body and brain acclimatizes to being obese, it seems to somehow reset the brain into thinking that is the normal state. So when people start to diet and exercise, the brain starts screaming for more calories and slashes energy expenditure as much as it can.

	So a man who used to be obese can sometimes have to subsist on a full meal *less* a day than a man who has never been obese, all while his brain is screaming for more calories. Very few people have the mental fortitude to actually bear up under such an onslaught and maintain a lifestyle change. 

	Either way, fat acceptance isn't about encouraging people to be fat or enabling them. It's about accepting them for who they are and not hating them for being fat. Most fat people suffer quite a lot trying to get rid of the weight, and they also have major problems with finding desirable partners, and they have issues getting jobs and so on.

	It's not like being fat is great fun for anyone really. Fat people don't need to be treated like shit on top of having hard to control health issues.

	A lot of body positivity isn‚Äôt because they think being fat is healthy or okay, it‚Äôs because due to whatever cards in life they were delt they gained weight. Most people just want to be accepted and have cool clothes and most of us are trying to work on it but that is far easier said than done.

	I grew up in a family that already had eating disorders, my parents overate and they still do and they would give me far too much food. Well I also have ADHD, and because of that my impulse control when it comes to food is non existent. So when I get to buy my own food I can buy better snacks for impulse eating like low sodium sunflower seeds or veggies, but my parents do not support me no matter how many times I tell them to stop buying me these big ass meals from places they insist on eating out instead of cooking and a lot of places they eat dont have healthy options. So bad impulses from my mental disorder and no support from the people who feed me.

	I could go on and on about my struggles with weight loss, but my fingers are getting tired cause Im typing this up on mobile so hopefully this gives you a better undrstanding. Most of the people who glorify being fat are a minority and should be ignored because most people realize its not heathly and they are trying, they just want to be treated fairly and have support cause that does help along the way.

	But yeah I promise it isnt body positivity enabling my addiction or most other peoples and it never has. I am sure there are people out there that make excuses for themselves but a large majority do not and so you shouldn‚Äôt treat all fat people like they are part of that minority just cause you or someone else met 1 person or maybe even a few like that online.

	When people see you holding a beer people don't automatically presume you to be an alcohol addict, and ‚Äãassume all problems that come with alcohol addiction to also apply to you. 

	When people see you as fat people presume you to be a food addict that is unable to control their food addiction, and assume all problems that come with food addiction to also apply to you. I mean, that's the position you're taking in this very post itself lol. 

	The problem with that presumption is that you don't actually know whether they're a food addict or not just by looking at their body shape, just like how people can't tell if you're alcoholic if they just see you holding a beer. That's not how you judge if a person is addicted to anything at all, addiction is about behaviour and not about looks. You can't actually tell anything about a person's behaviour or lifestyle or actual health from how they look either.

	Since you know nothing about their behaviour or lifestyle or health, why would you assume them to be an addict? It just doesn't make any sense at all. We need to stop pretending that fat shaming actually has anything to do with the behaviour or the health of the person they're shaming. It's always about looks and only looks. 

	Judging people by how they look is bad because not only it's lookism aka discrimination by looks, you're also going to be factually wrong most of the time. It's also important to remember that there are a lot of people who are called fat aren't actually fat, they're just called fat because the people fat shaming them thinks they are. 

	Fat acceptance has less to do with fat people and more to do with the people doing the fat shaming. There will always be fat people around in society.  People who fat shame need to accept that their fat shaming has nothing to do with the supposed altruistic concern for fat person's behaviour or lifestyle and rather everything to do with their own discomfort at seeing a fat person. People who fat shame act out because of that discomfort and created an actual form of discrimination in society that affects both fat people and people who aren't actually fat but judged as fat. People who fat shame really just need to accept that fat people exists and get over it.

	It‚Äôs more like harm reduction IMO. Obesity and substance abuse are two major public health crises, neither of which have been handled well by Western (namely American) society. 

	We‚Äôre learning that stigmatization is a huge driver of negative outcomes for both obesity and substance abuse, so just as people advocate for more access to, say, opioid agonist therapies like suboxone and decriminalization of personal drug use, people are also advocating for a less shame-focused approach to wellness. 

	There are people who claim both are ‚Äúenabling,‚Äù but in reality the harm reduction model prioritizes small/realistic goals and removing obstacles. In regards to obesity, that might mean creating an environment in which people feel comfortable exercising in public, or are protected from size-related trauma that could perpetuate their unhealthy habits.

	I really doubt that most people who strive to be body positive would say claim it‚Äôs a good thing to ‚Äúlet‚Äù people be obese. I think they instead recognize that another person‚Äôs weight is most likely none of their business and that it‚Äôs more helpful to be kind and welcoming to someone despite their struggles. Most of us need to heal on our own volition, in our own time.

	I have had a hard time with people in my family who are obese. I worry greatly about their health, but I had to make a conscious decision to accept them for who they are in this moment. Would I engage in unhealthy behaviors with them? No, but I‚Äôm always going to strive to make them feel loved and do what I can to help them when a) they are explicitly asking for my help and b) the help I can provide is appropriate and realistic.

	Have you ever lived with or lived or even *known* an addict? Because it‚Äôs a constant, self destructive cycle. My sibling is an alcoholic. Before they were sober, they would drink every night to sleep, drink in the morning to psych themselves up for life and work, and drink during the day to maintain some sense of emotional stability. 

	Could totally accepting ‚Äúfatness‚Äù lead to some unhealthy behavior? Sure. But if someone eats healthily enough, or even if they don‚Äôt and they‚Äôre fat for genetic or medical reasons, does it really matter? Not eating low fat options or always getting a salad is not at all comparable to someone drinking to get through the day ir taking cocaine to feel normal. 

	Sure, addiction and being overweight are both unhealthy. But your logical is incredible infantile if you think they‚Äôre the same. One is a state of being that can be caused by many things, and can remain even if you work out and eat healthy. The other is a medical condition, that is not a state of being but a constant need that has to be controlled. They‚Äôre not even remotely the same thing and only someone with no knowledge of addiction, fatness and a child‚Äôs sense logic would ever think accepting someone for being overweight and not shaming them is similar to giving an alcoholic a bottle of booze.

	To add on to everyone's opinions, fat acceptance is merely not ridiculing or treating someone different because of their weight. Addictions are complicated issues stemming from genetic and mental health components.

	I was over weight my whole life. I was pissed that my brother and I ate all the same foods growing up but I was chubby by 5 years old and my brother has and is tall and slender. I resorted to weight loss surgery in adulthood because I just yo yo dieted my whole life seemingly never making progress. 

	Let me tell you it was SHOCKING how much better I was treated when I was skinnier. I'm not even exaggerating. I had never been treated so nice in my life by strangers. It was honestly a little destabilizing to see a whole other world you're living in that is dependent on your weight.

	Fast forward 3 years and I've regained all my lost weight due to a binge eating disorder caused by undiagnosed bipolar disorder. (Which are my only medical issues. I'm shockingly healthy as my dr points out) I'm back living in the 'I just want to make it through the day without looks of disgust by strangers' world. I'm not asking for special accommodations, sure larger towels or larger airline seats would be nice. Lets be real, those seats are uncomfortable for most anyway.

I don't want to hear about how I'm going to hell for not believing in god, killing myself with smoking or alcohol, a monster for being gay, a cunt for being a lesbian, disgusting for being overweight, soft for not hitting my kids, etc from any random person.

	Just leave people alone, it's their life stop trying to get in other buisness to avoid working on yourself. If they want to clog their arteries then that's their buisness, sure tell your family if you are concerned but stop giving unsolicited advice to strangers.

	Let‚Äôs dig deeper beyond the surface. There are multiple factors that contribute to the growing population of overweight and obese Americans.

	- Proper nutrition isn‚Äôt taught in schools.

	- Added sugar (which is extremely detrimental to health for countless reasons) is included in the vast majority of readily available foods

	- Nuancing the above: the vast majority readily available and economically affordable foods in supermarkets contain processed carbs and added sugars: both of which will take years off your life and make your shortened life uncomfortably unhealthy.

	- The tendency for healthcare specialists to resort to drugs to cure problems created by lifestyle and dietary causes. Again addressing the symptoms rather than the root causes.

	These factors are influenced by and to no surprise benefit one particular minority group: the elites. The pharmaceutical companies. The companies that run and own the majority of the world‚Äôs food supplies. Those that are in power.

	There is no profitability in Heath, only in sickness. Let‚Äôs stop pointing the fingers at each other and address the problem at its core. 

	It‚Äôs none of our (citizens) fault that many people are fat, but is all of our responsibility to educate ourselves and help each other make better and healthier lifestyle choices.

	>I see NO difference between this and demanding that, because I'm genetically an alcoholic, I should be furnished with booze and allowed to be a drunken mess. 

	To a certain degree, you should. When a severe alcoholic goes through a rehabilitation program, part of that program includes giving them either alcohol or benzodiazepines. The reason for this is that if a severe alcoholic quits drinking cold turkey, there's a very real chance they could die. There's also a very real chance they could relapse.

	Despite what some media displays and the views of certain fringe groups, our cultural message towards addiction is constantly shifting closer to one of acceptance. Oregon decriminalized all drugs because there's significant evidence that doing so helps citizens escape addiction. Intervention programs involve loved ones expressing concern, not disdain. Successful rehabilitation programs work from a position of positive reinforcement and necessary forgiveness. It's what's been proven to work.

	If your view is that we should treat obesity as a form of addiction, perhaps you're right. If you think that we treat addiction with scorn, you're off the mark. As a culture, addiction is treated with love and acceptance, to the best of our abilities. Getting better every day.

	You're painting with too broad a brush.

	For the sake of your argument, let's assume that fat people got that way because they have weak personalities, overindulged, and took no steps to exercise. I think that covers the anti-fat bases. 

	So... Now you have Chuck the fat guy. Let's assume he's really fat, not just overweight.  None of the things that made him fat make him inherently incapable of working/providing for himself. Or of being an otherwise contributing member of society. 

	You have two choices here- culturally make things easy for Chuck so that he can freely travel (size-friendly seatbelts), attend work (presentable clothing, coworkers who don't show utter contempt), and attend to his hygiene (grooming aids, etc) OR you can say "fuck Chuck- he shouldn't have eaten that last ten tubs of mayonnaise" and not give him those things.  If Chuck becomes housebound and/or can't work anymore, Chuck goes from just being fat to being more of a drain on society than his increased health insurance costs already make him. 

	Maybe Chuck will lose weight, maybe he won't. But society being nice to him is cheaper than food stamps.

	Fat acceptance =/= obesity is alright and nothing should be done about it.

	This topic comes up almost every week and it's the same thing over and over again, and no one seems to grasp the concept that fat acceptance, for most of its history, was never about obesity being okay, actually.

	Fat acceptance broadly started in the 90's when being rail, waifishly thin was the norm. That norm was extremely damaging, because it requires so much work and self-denial that it was ruining people's bodies, mental-health, and wallets. Fat acceptance basically stated that being thick, hefty, rounder, whatever, is actually fine and that there's more to being healthy than having a trim figure. You can be plus-sized and eat perfectly healthy or have a wide waist-line while working out regularly, because people are built differently. 

	Obesity factors in how there's growing evidence to suggest that over-indulging in food has something to do with past traumas or other similar issues than just base gluttony, and that people who are obese don't need or deserve to be maligned or scorned by society since they're essentially fighting an uphill battle against their own bodies. No one is arguing that they should be able to eat how they want, medical expenses be damned, but that maybe there should be seats available to them on public transit, or that some might actually need canes and carts to navigate because their body is all worn down by their weight. It's obviously a complicated issue, but enabling obesity isn't on the table.

	>Second, your comments have made me realize that I have carried a big chip on my shoulder in regards to my own lack of support - perhaps, seeing 'acceptance', whether it's for addiction, being overweight, etc., touches a nerve because it was so absent in my earlier life.

	Just to follow up on this, the idea that "alcoholism is a disease" and not purely or primarily or a moral failing was intended for purposes of de-stigmatization and acceptance. Clearly not everyone believes that and lots of people see alcoholism as a personal failure of the alcoholic, but the intent is largely the same. 

	I'll also just add that comparing the two seems rather unhelpful. Alcoholism has a huge effect on the people around the alcoholic, from family, to coworkers, to people who share the road, etc. There's a reason that making amends is a step in AA. There may be effects on others as a result of obesity, but they're comparatively quite minor, which to me makes obesity largely a personal issue in a way that drug/alcohol addiction often is not.

	Fat acceptance != "fat is healthy"

	Being overweight is a health risk, a quality of life reduction, and generally shortens your lifespan. That said, so do half the things humans do. Fat people are less healthy, but they do not have less worth as a person, and that's what fat acceptance is (or should be) about.

	Much like with other addictions, there are also levels of severity. If someone is morbidly obese and struggles with mobility, someone reaching out and offering support is probably a good thing. If someone is in more or less good condition and is just on the fatter side because they like food, they probably don't need a full-blown intervention.

	Could I be much healthier than I am? Sure! I could spend much more of my free time working out and diet aggressively. Or... I could enjoy food and be comfortable that I'm only ever gonna be "kinda fit" and not an Adonis, and know that having fat stores on my body makes me a heavier person but not a worse one.

We sat at tables in a U shape, and directly across from us was a younger couple.  They were both extremely obese.  They came to class with bags of fast food breakfast.  I don't think it was their first breakfast, either.  They also carried with them a big bag full of sugary snacks and chips.  Just tons of junk food.  After they finished breakfast, they started digging into the junk food.  We had an hour to go get lunch, and they would come back with more bags of fast food lunch. I guarantee you they ate lunch then brought more lunch back to class.  When they finished their second lunch, they dove back into the junk food bag. 

	  

	They didn't stop eating the entire time we were in class.  I sat across from them for four days, and they did that every day. It was disgusting. I'm sure some people have glandular issues that can cause weight gain, but that is always manageable with a healthy diet and exercise. Anybody that obese has nobody to blame but themselves.  I'm sure that couple is not unique. That is probably common behavior for the morbidly obese, which is why I have no sympathy for them.  And I hope that particular couple wasn't allowed to adopt or foster a child, because they would only pass those unhealthy habits on to the child.

	Some people are having a hell of a time and can‚Äôt do anything about it.  I had 6 months where I couldn‚Äôt move my arm followed by a 6 month recovery from surgery where I couldn‚Äôt lift, run or do anything without a shoulder dislocation.  Got fat af and super depressed.  Took a long time to beat it and get back into decent shape.  All the people that talked shit to me made me pretty much stop giving af about people.  It was especially bad because prior to the injury I was a fitness freak that could bench 300+, run marathons and worked put 2+ hours per day, and I lost my career due to the injury.

	Telling people in insurmountable situations that they‚Äôre lazy because their fat is such a shit move, since all it will do is push them further into depression.  Some situations can‚Äôt be beat, and our body‚Äôs release of cortisol assures that the chronically stressed can only get fatter.

	I know you've already sort of "finished" but I'll throw in my two cents. I think with body positivity and fat acceptance it is important to discuss the context. Encouraging people who are not at their ideal weight to be confident at the beach is good. Telling morbidly obese people or anorexic people that they are healthy at any weight is not good. I'm not going to make a call about how much body positivity is each of those types of things but there are definitely both types of it out there.

	Someone saying "I don't like fat acceptance" sounds like someone saying "I don't like feminism". You need more context to get what they mean.

	*(I use feminism as an example because there were, not so much since maybe 4 years ago, a lot of radical feminists that would say "kill all men." I haven't heard this in ages and understand that's not what feminism is to most people.)*

	In order to be able to put the effort in to lose weight, you must value yourself first. That is what fat acceptance does. You can be healthier and better looking but you must be able to like who you are right now to have a chance at permanently making the changes necessary to improve.

	>Life isn't easy, people struggle against inherent, damaging traits, genetic or otherwise, all the time. I simply don't get why one should be 'accepted' while the other is deterred.

	I'm really tired of seeing this sentiment. A lot of people justify suffering by arguing that "it's just how it's meant to be". The whole point of humans progressing is to change the world and make it more comfortable for those who live in it. Just because some may suffer from a genetic disability doesn't mean that they don't deserve to live comfortable lives. I understand that what you're saying about having had an alcohol addiction. However, a person with an addiction would have a more comfortable life by making rehabilitation more accessible, less expensive, and less frowned upon. 

	P.S., congrats on being 6 years sober!

	As a fat person I wish there were more accommodations to help me lose weight. I do feel like an addict. Food is cheaper in bulk, there are no cheap, healthy, quick options if you need to grab a bite. Everything has loads of sugar in it.

	Lol are you seriously trying to argue that people just cannot lose weight? That‚Äôs insane. Good luck trying to find credible studies to back you up! 

	Of course, losing weight for some may be easier than it is for others. But everyone, (humans, animals...literally everyone) can lose weight through diet and exercise. 

	If your friends honestly cannot lose weight through true diet and exercise, then they must have a medical condition that they should get checked out. If they have no underlying medical conditions then what you‚Äôre saying absolutely makes no sense at all and the only logical explanation is that they are lying to you about their diet and exercise.
