## Power of the tongue

> How deep is your belief in “words are spells”? I feel like I’ve been in a self induced negative trance for a little over a year due to an illness I developed and I had an “aha” moment today and realize I’ve been speaking  shit over myself and my life and have the nerve to wonder why i am so lonely, depressed and terrible at retaining money. I want to change my life. I want to speak lovingly over myself and see what happens because to be quite frank i am sick of playing victim.

	Realizing that we are playing the victim role really is the first step in changing. I try to explain it too friends that I see torturing themselves but if it doesn't click its almost impossible to explain. Hard to say "Hey idiot stop pitying yourself." But I feel like I should.

	I feel ya. Was in there too. Exactly how mindfulness changed it. When you reach that tipping point:

	Option 1;

	“Shoul I now become resentful and bitter because that’s what’s life is?”

	Option 2:

	“How can I find a way to be more positive? And what am I willing to invest to pull it off?”

	I had to mindfully alter my self talk. "Words are spells" is limited in some ways. I can't alter reality directly. I can't think "I want my hair to turn purple" and it will.

	BUT...I can choose to dye it purple.

	AND...it is a great way to change the trajectory of other words.

	I come from an abusive background compounded by misdiagnosed chronic illness. My self talk was brutal and cruel. If I needed to get up and do something while in pain it might go like "It doesn't matter what you think or how you feel, just fucking do it" with a huge amount of angst/anxiety/pain/PTSD as propulsion fuel. Not good, not fun, bleak and contributing to suicidality and depression.

	Years later I have talked myself into better circumstances physically and psychologically. I couldn't talk my family into being less abusive, but I could choose to go no contact, which gave me the psychological space to alter my standards of how I let people talk to/judge me.

	I couldn't talk myself out of pain, but I could choose meaningful ways to be present through the pain and appreciate/create my own beauty and joy.

	Now if I'm having the same pained circumstances I don't bark at myself with impatient and cruel demand to be flogged without complaint. It would be more like "Hey, I know this is rough, painful and unfair. Life is just that way. You:ve got things you want to get done and you know why you want to do them. It matters and you can find the strength, patience and fortitude to find the right path. Be wise and don't give in to apathy or depression. You've come so far. I'm proud of you whether you do it or choose in wisdom that you have to rest. As long as you do no harm and do your best, be proud of yourself for the fight and the effort."

	Might be worth checking out Affirmations by Stuart Wilde. It’s a companion book to his original Miracle, which is only like 40 pages, but a great read in its own right. 

	The spoken word has great power. I even has this army captain I knew in Afghanistan while I was at Kandahar Airfield and he used to say to me, “Words mean things”. And that’s always really stuck with me.

	Reminds me of this mindfulness Ted talk by Shauna Shapiro - what you practice grows stronger

	Indeed. I had to change my internal monologue in order to get better. It was such an easy change. It doesn't make sense to be negative to myself if I want to feel better about myself. It was the medicine I needed.
