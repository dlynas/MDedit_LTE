## Which Countries are the Most Polarized?

How do you measure something that’s made headlines for half a decade but is still difficult to quantify? We’re talking about [polarization](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-polarization-of-politics-in-america/).

Even within the social sciences, polarization covers everything from racial segregation, to [labor skill levels](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227437438_The_Polarization_of_Job_Opportunities_in_the_US_Labor_Market_Implications_for_Employment_and_Earnings), to class divide, to [political ideology](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/03/how-politics-got-so-polarized).

### How Do You Quantify Polarization?

Edelman’s data on which countries are the most polarized comes from survey results asking respondents two very simple questions:

-   How divided is their country?
-   How entrenched is the divide?

The questions help bring to light the social issues a particular country is facing and the lack of consensus on those issues.

Plotted against each other, a chart emerges. A country in the top–right corner of the chart is “severely polarized.” Countries located closer to the lower–left are considered less polarized.

In the report, Edelman identifies four metrics to watch for and measure which help quantify polarization.

<table id="tablepress-2802"><tbody><tr><td>Economic Anxieties</td><td>Will my family be better off in five years?</td></tr><tr><td>Institutional Imbalance</td><td>Government is viewed as unethical and incompetent.</td></tr><tr><td>Class Divide</td><td>People with higher incomes have a higher trust in institutions.</td></tr><tr><td>Battle for Truth</td><td>Echo chambers, and a low trust in media.</td></tr></tbody></table>

Following Edelman’s metrics, countries with economic uncertainty and inequality as well as institutional distrust are more likely to be polarized. Below, we look at key highlights from the chart.

### Severely Polarized Countries

Despite being one of the largest economies in Latin America, **Argentina** is the most polarized country surveyed by a large margin. Foreign loan [defaults](https://www.reuters.com/article/argentina-debt-idUSKBN25S4HC), a high [fiscal deficit](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/argentina-economy-contracts-again-as-inflation-rate-nears-100-1.1862293), and now [surging inflation](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/argentina/overview) have created a perfect storm in the country.

**43%** of the Argentinian respondents said they will be better off in five years, down 17 percentage points from last year.

Along with fiscal upheaval, Argentinians are also dealing with [enduring corruption](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2021/index/arg) in the public sector and abrupt policy reversals [between governments](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/argentina-south-american-power-struggles-stability). Only **20%** of those surveyed in Argentina said they trusted the government—the least of all surveyed countries.

Here are all six of the countries considered to be severely polarized:

![🇨🇴](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1e8-1f1f4.svg) Colombia  
![🇺🇸](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1fa-1f1f8.svg) United States  
![🇿🇦](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1ff-1f1e6.svg) South Africa  
![🇪🇸](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1ea-1f1f8.svg) Spain  
![🇸🇪](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1f8-1f1ea.svg) Sweden

In the U.S., heightened political upheaval between Democrats and Republicans over the last few years has led to strengthening [ideological stances](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/) and to an abundance of headlines about [polarization](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/us-democrat-republican-partisan-polarization/629925/). Only **42%** of respondents in the country trust the government.

And in South Africa, [persistent inequality](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/southafrica/overview#1) and [falling trust](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/anc-support-falls-below-50-for-first-time-in-south-african-vote-1.1677127) in the African National Congress also check off Edelman’s metrics. It’s also second after Argentina with the least trust in government (22%) per the survey.

### Moderately Polarized Countries

The biggest cluster of 15 countries are in moderately polarized section of the chart, with all continents represented.

![🇧🇷](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1e7-1f1f7.svg) Brazil  
![🇰🇷](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1f0-1f1f7.svg) South Korea  
![🇲🇽](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1f2-1f1fd.svg) Mexico  
![🇫🇷](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1eb-1f1f7.svg) France  
![🇬🇧](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1ec-1f1e7.svg) United Kingdom  
![🇯🇵](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1ef-1f1f5.svg) Japan  
![🇳🇱](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1f3-1f1f1.svg) Netherlands  
![🇮🇹](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1ee-1f1f9.svg) Italy  
![🇩🇪](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1e9-1f1ea.svg) Germany  
![🇳🇬](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1f3-1f1ec.svg) Nigeria  
![🇹🇭](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1f9-1f1ed.svg) Thailand  
![🇰🇪](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1f0-1f1ea.svg) Kenya  
![🇨🇦](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1e8-1f1e6.svg) Canada  
![🇦🇺](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1e6-1f1fa.svg) Australia  
![🇮🇪](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1ee-1f1ea.svg) Ireland

Some are on the cusp of being severely polarized, including economic heavyweights like Japan, the UK, France, and Germany. On the other hand, smaller economies like Thailand, Kenya, and Nigeria, are doing comparatively better on the polarization chart.

### Less Polarized Countries

Countries with fair economic outlook and high trust in institutions including China, Singapore, and India are in the bottom left sector of the chart.

![🇮🇩](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1ee-1f1e9.svg) Indonesia  
![🇨🇳](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1e8-1f1f3.svg) China  
![🇦🇪](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1e6-1f1ea.svg) United Arab Emirates  
![🇸🇬](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1f8-1f1ec.svg) Singapore  
![🇸🇦](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1f8-1f1e6.svg) Saudi Arabia  
![🇲🇾](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1f2-1f1fe.svg) Malaysia  
![🇮🇳](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f1ee-1f1f3.svg) India

It’s interesting to note that of the seven countries in that sector, three are not democracies. That said, there are also more developing countries on this list as well, which could also be a factor.

#### Looking Ahead

Edelman notes that polarization is both “cause and consequence of distrust,” creating a self-fulfilling cycle. Aside from the four metrics stated above, concerns about the erosion of civility and weakening social fabric also lead to polarization.

As global events unfold in 2023—including looming worries of [a recession](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/survey-will-global-stock-markets-crash-in-2023/)—it will be fascinating to see how countries might switch positions in the year to come.
