## Which philosophers have written about the fact that technological innovations often seemingly promise to give us more choices in ours lives, only to become a new and more costly ‚Äúrequirement?‚Äù

	Ellul made a career out of this. His concept of *technique* is that technical approaches to xyz actually restrict our options - if I want to make a shelf, I can simply look up the "best practice" instructions for how to make a shelf^1 - "...technique transforms everything it touches into a machine." This then excludes "non-technical" factors that I might have included in my shelf if I had to figure it out for myself: aesthetic, ethical, or religious flourishes are some of the examples he gives. He made a point that efficiency has replaced all other values - the only concern for production is that we can make something that does x well on a mass scale.

	On a broader scale, he applies this is production, or, the technological production monism. Whenever a car is produced, it is produced to a blueprint created by [whoever designs cars]. The individual car-makers are removed from the process - they are a part of the machine, with their creative and otherwise value-derived existence reduced to "a servant to the machine". In *The Technological Society*, he compares this to the wide variety of polearms produced in the feudal period (the "pre-technical-domination" period)^2 which show the artisan's creative flourish, flexibility, skill, and disregard to absolute efficiency. In contrast, the technique of the car-maker *qua* machine and polearm-smith *qua* creative agent shows a change in relation to technology: one where man serves the machine's ends, one where the machine serves man's ends.

	He also gave [this pretty funny interview](https://youtu.be/BOCtu-rXfPk?si=1PigV69WUZL56FxI) where he mocks the "freedom" of everyone in France having a car on a public holiday. If you're short on time, it can be summed up as: "you are completely free to do whatever you want in this time, so of course you will go to the beach along with everyone else".

	As you point out, this eventually leads to frustration and rebellion whenever humans - in their irrationality - want to escape the monist system. The producer who wants to make something with aesthetic consideration must be prepared to be outperformed by the technical producer; the political who wants to take an ethical stand on something must be prepared to be outperformed by the technical politician; the individual who has religious reasons to oppose the liberal democratic tendency to wage war must be prepared to be oppressed by the technological society's demand for war.

	As with all system-builders, Ellul's work goes out on a limb and is easy to poke holes in after a point. But the central thesis is very interesting, if somewhat depressing.

	A couple additional places to look:

	Sheila Jasanoff has a number of works on technology and society broadly speaking, some of which get to this. *The Ethics of Invention* is one place to start.

	James Beniger's *The Control Revolution* is more about how technology, especially information systems, are used for social control. But that speaks to limitations on freedom.

	John Paul Russo's *The Future without a Past* is more narrowly focused on how technological innovation has threatened the humanities, both as an academic discipline and generally as a way of engaging the world. But, as part of that, it is about the loss of control/autonomy.

	Neil Postman's *Technopoly* is a classic on this topic. And Peter-Paul Verbeek's *Moralizing Technology* is a more recent, more philosophical investigation of *how* technology shape our experience of the world, including opening new options but also closing off others.

	You might want to check out Lewis Mumford's work on technology. His book *Technics and Civilization* I think is the first one on the subject he wrote, I could be wrong, I'm still new to his work. He wrote a lot about the history of technological development in society and how humans are shaped by technology. I've seen some eco-fascists cite him, but they were either misunderstanding him or intentionally misrepresenting him.

	Oh another person you might be interested in is Murray Bookchin. He wrote a lot about technology and creating human scale and democratic technologies.

		Cool. I actually own Mumford‚Äôs Technics and Civilization. I‚Äôll give it another go.  found it very abstract/not what I was expecting when I tried reading it decades ago. Maybe I‚Äôm ready now.
		
		ETA: Nope I have his City in History.
