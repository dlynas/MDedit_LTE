## NYPD Officer Pedro Rodriguez’s 4 misconduct cases have cost New York taxpayers $12,050,000. 

NYPD Sergeant Edwin Ching’s 7 cases have added $8,330,751 to the bill.

Both are still on the force.

The top 10 NYPD service members with the most expensive misconduct cases have cost $64,682,251 worth of the public’s money that could have otherwise gone to communities.

So long as NYPD leadership refuses to address the Department’s culture of impunity, New Yorkers will have to foot the hefty bill even as our communities struggle from years of divestment.
