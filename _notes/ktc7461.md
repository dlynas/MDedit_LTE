## Some people are 100% convinced that consciousness goes on after the body dies while others are 100% convinced that consciousness stops when the body dies. How can each side declare themselves right with such conviction?

	-People of all kinds seem to cling to/identify with their beliefs as if they're a physical part of them that need defending. 

	-People of all kinds also seem subject to ingroup ideology, not wanting to go against the tribe's narrative. 

	-People on both sides of this can be equally unreasonable and dogmatic. 

	-I suspect that those heavily on the survival after death side may be subject to the above, as well as fear of death skewing perception, though 

	-I've met people who have said that they find the prospect of eternity, living forever, etc. to be scarier to them than non-existence, so both sides could be said to be potentially motivated by fear. 

	-I think a lot of people heavily against beliefs of survival do so because their persona is heavily made up of "scientist", "intellectual", etc., they wrongly conflate scientific with atheist, physicalist, scientistic (ironically, as its an incredibly unscientific stance to hold to anything unproven dogmatically), and they fear acknowledging evidence that physicalism can't explain as they fear that if they do, that others will perceive them, just as they presently perceive others, e.g. as fools.

		Out of curiosity, do you have a horse in this race? Do you lean toward believing there is consciousness post death? 
		
		Also, do you hope for it or hope for nothing?

			>Out of curiosity, do you have a horse in this race?

			My main horse in the race is re: the overall reasoning of people in the debate, as opposed to the end outcome arguments. That's the present emotional motivation that fuels my interest in most of this discussion these days, as I presently find it quite frustrating that those wearing a mask of science are concurrently disrespecting it. 
			
			
			>Do you lean toward believing there is consciousness post death?
			>
			
			
			I'm still agnostic re: it, but the more I look into the research, the more stuff I find that's in favour of the survival hypothesis that emergentist, materialist, physicalist, atheist, naturalist models cannot explain. Further, considering the, at most times, full blown denial if not delusion of many people proposing to be pro science re: this stuff and ignoring empirical data, it ironically strengthens my leaning towards the survival hypothesis, as their refusal to acknowledge it, let alone refute it leaves me with little other logical choice. 
			
			
			
			>Also, do you hope for it or hope for nothing?
			>
			
			I hope for it, of course. I don't want to stop existing, and I especially don't want goodbyes re: loved ones to be permanent. 
			
			Though, as I think I mentioned in a previous discussion, I have already been through a long phase of coming to terms with emergentist models and death, for a while leaning way more towards consciousness not surviving, so I recognise the bias now. Ultimately, it doesn't matter though: empirical data is empirical data. I think that I have mistaken people confidently posing as being scientific, as if hanging out with the big kid in class (the dominant paradigm of materialism-physicalism, mistaking them and reporting them to be synonymous with science) to make themselves feel tougher, for them being correct. More and more, now though, it seems like a total farse.

				Thanks a lot for your in depth responses.
				
				You've likely looked into no-self in eastern philosophy and with that no-self teaching comes a sort of rebirth teaching which is very interesting and I find it compelling.
				
				My view is that we are all the same universe having unique perspectives and experiences. In this way we live on, but this individual personhood doesn't as it was only a sort of illusion to begin with.
				
				I find this comforting, and reccomend eastern philosophical teachings (which you probably are already familiar with anyway)

					Sure. My early years were heavily into a lot of stuff like this, at the expense of other areas of inquiry (modern psychology and psychotherapy, which is now my clinical area; Western philosophy, etc.). 
					
					I'm still open to it. 
					
					Presently, I find Hegel (at least Hegel proposed by Peter Kalkavage) to be the most *intriguing:  
					
					
					"Spirit comes to know itself, not through calm methodical inquiry but through passionate self- assertion. Spirit is spirited. As we see repeatedly in Hegel's examination of spirit's claims to know, this spirited self-risking is spirit's folly: all the claims fall to the ground. They do so because they are finite or partial, because they fail to capture the whole of truth. But the act of positing is also spirit's bravery. Spirit cannot make progress, or even make a beginning, without self- assertion and positing. It cannot become wise with out making a fool of itself. An extremist at heart, spirit, our human essence, is fated by the demands of its nature to learn through suffering."
					
					"Christianity makes up for this lack by assimilating mortality into the nature of God. It posits a God who "emp ties himself, into time, deathifies himself, and thus becomes present both to mankind and to himself: God suffers in the form of human history. This human-divine suffering is necessary in order for God to know himself and to become actual. Christianity also gives birth to the idea that God manifests himself in community. Both together-the divine as pure thinking, and the divine as the suffering God who is present in history and in human com munity-go together to produce spirit." 
					
					"All are stages on the way to the fully developed selfhood that is spirit." 
					
					"The history of philosophy, for Hegel, is the interconnected series of efforts to reach truth in a purely conceptual way. Wisdom emerges as a pro cess of becoming, and all the great philosophic systems of the past con tribute to the full flowering of wisdom." 
					
					
					"Spirit is not the divine puppet-master who plans everything out in advance and moves his story toward a providential end. Time is not a cloak that spirit wears but the outpouring of what spirit is. History is spirit wandering in its self-created labyrinth, searching for its self-knowledge and its freedom." 
					
					"Spirit learns by making itself present to itself. It does this by generating a world of knowing. It must first generate this world, or rather series of worlds, before it can know itself in and through that which it has generated, before it can ''wake up" to itself.17" 
					
					"History includes the play of contingency or chance. In revealing itself in time, spirit abandons itself to this play and therefore can neither recon struct its past ( until the final stage) nor predict its future. Spirit does not know where it is going until it gets there; it emerges rather than guides." 
					
					"This is the tragic dimension of spirit's journey and the more precise sense in which, for Hegel, learning is suffering." 
					
					"Finally, the shapes of knowing that embody man's effort to know the divine are also the shapes in which the divine, which is incarnate in man, comes to know itself."

						Hegels model of the spirit 'learning through suffering' seems to me to fit with a lot of eastern ideas of reality, to ultra simplify, that the universe is a sort of great game or learning experience to know every experience there can be. Good and bad, all part of the experience of living. Like "god" finding out what it's like to be all these things, laughing and crying.

							For sure. A lot of parallels. I find it to be the most well elucidated so far (I'm barely getting started with Hegel).
