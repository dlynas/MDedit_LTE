## You know, you can spend a lot of time trying to convince others of your beliefs or your actions — or you can simply let them not understand you. You can make peace with the idea that not everyone needs to understand you and what you are doing. Only you have to trust what you choose in life. 

Stop trying to explain yourself to people that can not hear you. Sometimes people never had the intention of truly listening. When we try and prove our choices or preferences.. we waste our precious energy and often end up feeling discouraged on our path. 

Trust your instincts. Trust your inner callings and preferences. It’s not about being rigid, perhaps your preferences will be different tomorrow. But today — own your truth. Own what is true for you. Stop trying to defend or justify your truth. You do not need anyone else to validate it, in order for it to be true for you.

Although at times it can be a lonely path to walk. Having your own truths and choices in life delivers you the exact situations and outcomes necessary for your growth. For your unique spiritual journey. The more you shy away from them.. the more you deny yourself the expansion that was placed on your path for a reason.
