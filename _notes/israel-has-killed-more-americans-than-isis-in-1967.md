## ⭕️ ISRAEL HAS KILLED MORE AMERICANS THAN ISIS...

• In 1967, Israel deliberately targeted and attacked the USS Liberty. The combined sea and air attacks killed 34 American servicemen and wounded 171 crew members.

• Since then, Israel crushed 23-year-old Rachel Corrie to death (2003), an American university student who was killed for defending the Palestinian people’s right to exist. In addition to this, occupation forces deliberately targeted and shot veteran Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Aqlah above her chest (2022).

• Since the beginning of this war, Israel killed a 17-year-old boy called Tawfic Hafeth Abdel Jabbar in the West Bank on January 19th, 2024.

→ At least 37 Americans have been killed by Israel.

⭕️According to various sources, including a database published by The New York Times, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Institute for the Study of War, and a Wikipedia article (Title: Killing of Captives by the Islamic State), ISIS killed four Americans: James Wright Foley, Kayla Jean Mueller, Peter Edward Abdul-Rahman Kassia, and Steven Joel Sotloff.
