## August Nimtz tells us that it's not enough to simply criticize the Democrats, that the left must put forward its own candidates as well. we'll be interviewing some socialist presidential candidates for one of our bonus Patreon episodes in March. we're also giving out stickers to new patreon subscribers at certain tiers. we'll share more details on Monday! until then, happy Saturday âœ¨âœ¨

	"People hate the choices they have right now.
	The idea that this is going to be a Biden and Trump election and so on is turning on so many people and working class needs to sound political party.
	If we don't have our own political party, this is what we end up with.
	I imagine the abstention rate as was the case in 2016, what 43% of the eligible electorate did not vote.
	I suspect it may be as high as that if not more than at this time.
	And boy, again, I can't think of a better time for the left to be put in forward this own working class candidates and zone.
	If the left doesn't have its own candidates going into the election, so all you're doing, you're allowing the Democrats to be voted by default.
	If you don't actually present your own candidates, not enough to criticize the Democratic Party.
	The question is, do you have your own candidates in the election?
	Listen to our full conversation with August NIMS anywhere you get your podcasts."
