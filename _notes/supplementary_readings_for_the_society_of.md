## Supplementary Readings for 'The Society of Spectacle'

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/1cfsz2o/supplementary_readings_for_the_society_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/1cfsz2o/supplementary_readings_for_the_society_of/)

> I'd like to know what supplementary readings would I be needing in order to understand in depth  Debord's Book 'The Society of Spectacle'. Though I've delved much into Psychoanalysis, Critical Theory and Sociology, I've my doubts about my capacity to understand the said book on the first glance. I want to make sure that I've appropriate supplementary readings at hand to know and understand the text. I'd be grateful for your help and guidance. Thank you in advance!

	"Guy Debord" from Anselm Jappe is a pretty consistent presentation of Debord's theory.

	While supplements might be helpful, I'm not sure they're essential for that text. I read it last month with just the translator's notes as a guide (translator was Ken Knabb, if that helps), and I felt like I understood it pretty well. I think the most important thing is to have a working understanding of Marx and Hegel. I'm not super well versed in either (especially not Hegel), but I'm familiar with the basic gist of their philosophies, and that seemed like enough to grasp Debord.

	Its not particularly difficult. It’s brief, separated into short aphorisms, and prescient enough that most of us have experienced a lot of what he’s getting at.

		Okay! I just felt that to truly and completely get it, I'd be needing supplementary Readings. But then I suppose one doesn't really fully get the text in first reading so I guess I'd first read through it slowly and gradually, and then go back again.

	Debord wrote "Comments on the Society of the Spectacle" decades later.

	Try reading my translation first, which includes helpful annotations and sidenotes that supplement the text [https://unredacted-word.pub/spectacle](https://unredacted-word.pub/spectacle) (free web version) also available in print [https://unredacted-word.pub/](https://unredacted-word.pub/)

	  

	from my foreward:  

	> My hope is to make Debord’s ideas more accessible to first time readers and to show how much more relevant *The Spectacle* is today than when it was first written.

	Are you interested in literature, strictly as tool for aiding understanding of course?

	'Young Adam', for example.

	But if you accept that suggestion, you might as well start pondering detournements.

			erm how about using other media, then?
			
			They don't only use dense theoretical text to express themselves, sometimes just as precisely.
			
			eg2. [Durutti (sic) Column ](https://factoryrecords.org/cerysmatic/durutti_le_retour_66.php)
			
			good luck
