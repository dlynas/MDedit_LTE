	ysk that absolutely anyone can edit any Wikipedia page, even you..... so pay attention to citations because some content is only as trustworthy as random strangers.

			Because this might be hard for some people to believe, I’ll elaborate a bit.
			
			First, a lot of the work is done by bots and tools. There are bots that automatically detect some kinds of vandalism and quickly revert it.
			
			There are, however, people who edit Wikipedia as a hobby. Oftentimes the more serious ones have tools that allow them to review edits, sort pages by most recently edited, etc. to allow them to catch and revert vandalism or unsubstantiated edits.
