	I think getting people to understand the money story is the most key part. Once someone realizes money is just a representation of an arbitrary amount of labor or capital, that’s what allows them to start “getting it”.

	In my view the most effective way to do this is to get people to understand the real reason they transact in their local currency: they have to pay taxes in that currency, and only that currency. You walk them through a scenario where instead of a salary, their job buys all their groceries, pays all their bills etc… but they never receive any cash.

	Come tax time, the IRS still requires you to pay taxes on the fair value of all the stuff you got. If you were given 100k in “stuff” you might owe 20k in cash to the government. But what happens now? You have no cash, so you’re forced to sell 20k of the stuff you got to pay your taxes. This need for people to pay taxes is why you accept payment in USD, because it would be a really big hassle to just receive goods and services in exchange for goods and services. This universal need for all citizens to pay a tax to the IRS is why everyone accepts dollars, because it’s the only way to avoid going to jail for tax evasion.

	From there I think it’s easier to understand that money is a government creation, not just some slip of paper we all arbitrarily agree is worth something. Once they see that it’s much easier to explain the mechanics of money creation via spending and money deletion via taxation.

	The African hut tax example works as well and is frankly more simple if you’re speaking to someone who is maybe younger and doesn’t file taxes yet. You just have to show them that the government spends first, then imposes and strictly enforces a tax to ensure it gets what it wants.

			> I’ll give you one last quick example here. The British went into Ghana in the 1800s to grow coffee. There was no monetary system in Africa at the time. There was no unemployment when you went out and visited the population. Everybody was helping each other out with jobs to do. It was a very social place. The men would hunt and fish and build the houses, and the women would take care of the children and do the food. The grandmother would help out taking care of the children. The people were doing things and there was more to do than there was time to do it. How did the British get them to work in the coffee plantation?
			
			> They came up with this brilliant idea. They told everybody there was going to be a tax on their hut. It was called a hut tax. Everyone had to pay, what, 10 Pounds a month, something. Tax. Or they would get their house burned down by the British. What happened? Everybody said all right, what do we have to do to get the money to pay the tax? ‘Ah, if you come to the coffee plantation we’ll pay you one Pound a day to work’. Sure enough, people starting coming over to work, to earn the money, so they didn’t get their house burned down. The tax, the monetary system, created the unemployment.
			
			> Then the British hired the people so they could get the money to pay the tax so they didn’t have their house burned down. They would spend the money first and pay people, and then collect the tax, right. And they spent more than they collected because some people saved them [Pounds] for paying taxes later.
			
			>But would they let them earn enough to pay the tax, or would they say, ‘No, we’re not going to do that and go burn your house down’? Of course not. They let them come work and earn all they wanted to pay the tax, and to save, so their houses did not get burned down. If too many people came to work, they would reduce the tax. They didn’t send the people home and burn their houses down like they’re doing today in the European Union.

	The tax or go to jail or get your hut burned down is a good one but it plays right into peoples feeling about tax being theft/violence and they shut down or come away with the exact opposite take on the system that’s counter productive. 

	I think it needs to be framed as an amazing feature of modern countries. We’ve got all these systems and checks and balances in place that we can utilize the government to accomplish great things that the market doesn’t provide. If we only have the careful analysis and political will. Hell it’s already being employed by the military. 

	Then you get into trying to wrap people’s heads around how their taxes don’t pay for things.

	Mine:   

	The reason Americans can't have social services or a social safety net is because of political will. As long as the real resources exist, Congress can fund anything they choose to- without raising taxes! MMT explains this.  

	  

	When you support either party of the duopoly, you are siding with corporate interests that work against society; D&amp;R politicians consistently favor their corporate donors at the expense of the common good of the citizenry.

		"Congress can fund anything they choose to- without raising taxes! MMT explains this."
		
		It explains the exact opposite. If you want more public sector, you have to suppress the private sector to release the resources you wish to hire. 
		
		That means putting taxes up. Then Congress can relieve the created unemployment by hiring people to do the public tasks it has decided to do.

		* 🟧 **[David_Corpus](https://www.reddit.com/user/David_Corpus) (OP)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-05-15 06:42:59)_

			Taxation is definitely part of the toolbox, but taxation isn't a hammer, and every resource isn't a nail. Taxation is only one of several potential strategies. "Putting taxes up" is not a required outcome to secure (in your example) labor. They could just decide to outcompete by paying more, but that makes the FJG look bad. I don't imagine looking bad matters to the USG, though. In example, they already compete by providing social services and a social safety net for their own employees.

				>"Putting taxes up" is not a required outcome to secure (in your example) labor. They could just decide to outcompete by paying more, but that makes the FJG look bad.
				
				I think you might be talking about different things here. What falls under "more public sector" is generally outside the scope of a FJG. When the government decides to actively do a thing, like build a bridge, or operate some new area of civil service, it has to compete with the private sector for engineers, contractors, trained staff and real resources to achieve whatever public purpose they're setting out to do. This necessarily involves some combination of paying more and/or offsetting measures to suppress the private sector.
				
				What's described there is a fundamentally different undertaking than a FJG deploying a fixed wage to absorb unemployed labor. See the types of work described in the pinned JG FAQ [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mmt_economics/comments/k5t1f1/federal_job_guarantee_faq/). It's different both in the nature of the work and in how the entire point of the exercise is *not* to compete.

				"They could just decide to outcompete by paying more"
				
				Which causes inflation, so no they can't. 
				
				> Prices going up and down can be the market allocating resources, not a problem of inflation. Inflation is the process whereby the government causes higher prices by creating more money directly through deficit spending, or indirectly by lowering interest rates or otherwise encouraging borrowing.
				
				> ...
				
				> A shortage means that the desired products don't exist. More money just raises the price. When that, in turn, causes the government to further increase the money available, an inflationary spiral has been created. The institutionalisation of that process is called indexing.

				* 🟪 **[David_Corpus](https://www.reddit.com/user/David_Corpus) (OP)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-05-15 11:37:55)_

					You just created Schrödinger's employees. If they (the desired products) don't exist, then providing a competitive compensation package doesn't suddenly make them exist. Mosler is not discussing labor as the products here. Paying labor more can result in inflation in the private sector, if the employer raises prices to compesate for those salaries. The same is not true of a money creator, like the federal government.

						"The same is not true of a money creator, like the federal government."
						
						The same is very true. Ask Warren. I did. And he agrees with me. 
						
						All increased spending comes with risk of inflation. MMT doesn't provide a free lunch, it explains what happens when you deploy the currency monopoly.

							In this scenario (which you narrowed yourself), the product of the labor is providing social services to the public. In the scenario of the federal government paying employees competitively to the private sector, it does not raise the price of a product. No one other than the federal government is billed. As such, why/how would it cause inflation?  
							  
							As I mentioned, taxes are not the only tool in the toolbox. Changing laws and regulations is also in the toolbox. Ending the existing health care model and fixing the prices of medical procedures will change the labor pool in itself.

								"In the scenario of the federal government paying employees competitively to the private sector, it does not raise the price of a product."
								
								You've forgotten that the outbid private sector entity still has the money to bid for something else - directly, or indirectly by passing the money back to shareholders or other employees via consequential wage rises. 
								
								And that's assuming it doesn't bid back, putting up prices accordingly - because the state has overbid the labour market and there is no slack to maintain excess supply and the function of competition. 
								
								The Job Guarantee has a two pronged function. It is to protect the worker against rapacious firms, but also to protect firms against rapacious workers. Forcing transition *to* the Job Guarantee is how the system stabilises in a monetary flow boom, and it is the tax drag that causes that to happen. 
								
								Taxes are always required to reduce monetary flow and to ensure resources remain unbid but for public sector spending during private sector booms. Those who believe MMT allows us to do away with tax changes need to start drawing up some balance sheets and doing some dynamic modelling.
								
								MMT shows that there is no free lunch. Discretionary spending still has to be paid for by somebody - just in physical terms, not monetary ones.

									I'm glad to see that you agree with me. Unfortunately the current people who pay for the latest bump in discretionary spending are in Gaza.    
									  
									It would be interesting to spell out exactly how discretionary spending is paid for in physical terms, for the "printing press goes Whirrrr" people.

		I whole heartedly disagree. 
		
		You are not making an economic or monetary argument, but a political/philosophical appeal. This is what turns people away from MMT.

		* 🟧 **[David_Corpus](https://www.reddit.com/user/David_Corpus) (OP)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-05-14 04:53:17)_

			  
			You are correct in that my "appeal" is what the MMT economists refuse to do. I am accurately calling out all of the politicians, based upon MMT. You are incorrect when you say it is not an economic argument... it absolutely is. 
			
			US conservatives oppose a social safety net because they have been convinced that their taxes will fund it. US liberals fall for the "How will we pay for it?" narrative. What I am saying is not only economically accurate, it changes the political landscape.   
			  
			If people are walking in lockstep with their duopoly party, they will reject the truths of MMT because it conflicts with the actions taken by their heroes. There is no inspiring them to educate themselves.

					Which conservatives think that? Not the Christians or the working class.   
					You cited the actual reason that corporations will not allow politicians to provide one. They want the citizenry dependent upon them. This is why the lobbyists to Obama &amp; Congress made health insurance directly tied to employment, linked to otherwise intangible compensation, and even complicated coverage continuity if/when employment changes.

	You have to frame an individualist point of reference.  You have to draw direct lines where the collectivism of MMT will benefit individuals even without oversight or reform on government capital misallocation.

	I.E. your argument would be that without trillions pumped into the economy via PPP and enhanced unemployment, the U.S. would have gone into a depression.  How you frame your proof after will determine a further discussion or an argument.

	You also need to be able to demonstrate why the private sector is more inefficient than the government at spending.

	Lastly, you cannot misrepresent the underlying fact that MMT ultimately views wealth as regressive.  Which is ironic considering Mosler is a former hedge fund manager living in St. Croix.
