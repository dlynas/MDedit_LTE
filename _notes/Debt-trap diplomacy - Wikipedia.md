**Debt-trap diplomacy** is a term to describe an [international financial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_finance "International finance") relationship where a creditor country or institution extends debt to a borrowing nation partially, or solely, to increase the lender's political leverage. The creditor country is said to extend excessive [credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit "Credit") to a debtor country with the intention of extracting economic or political concessions when the debtor country becomes unable to meet its repayment obligations. The conditions of the loans are often not publicized.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> The borrowed money commonly pays for contractors and materials sourced from the creditor country.

A [neologism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism "Neologism"), the term was first coined by Indian academic [Brahma Chellaney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma_Chellaney "Brahma Chellaney") in 2017 to contend that the [Chinese government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China "Government of China") lends and then leverages the debt burden of smaller countries for geopolitical ends.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> The term "debt-trap diplomacy" has entered the official lexicon of the United States, with two successive administrations employing that term. However, many academics, professionals, and think tanks have stated that China's lending practices are not behind the debt troubles faced by borrowing nations, and that Chinese banks have never seized an asset from any nation, and are willing to restructure the terms of existing loans.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Hameiri_2020_5-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-Hameiri_2020-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Bloomberg_News_2022_6-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-Bloomberg_News_2022-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-The_Diplomat_7-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-The_Diplomat-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

## Origin and background\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Debt-trap_diplomacy&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Origin and background")\]

In response to the [2007–2008 financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_financial_crisis "2007–2008 financial crisis"), [central banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_banks "Central banks") in the U.S. and Europe lowered [interest rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rates "Interest rates"), leading to low interest rates in private markets in those countries throughout the 2010s. This made those markets less attractive to investors, who turned more towards countries with [emerging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_market "Emerging market") or [frontier markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier_markets "Frontier markets") in pursuit of higher returns. In 2013, China, which was less affected by the 2008 crisis than the U.S. and Europe, started its [Belt and Road Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative "Belt and Road Initiative") (BRI), making loans available through its [policy banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_banks "Policy banks") and other state-linked firms for infrastructure projects primarily in the same sorts of emerging markets that private investors were focusing on. This led to China becoming the world's largest bilateral lender. As the decade progressed, many countries with low-income governments ran into [debt distress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_crisis "Debt crisis") in the wake of earlier large-scale borrowing, with the [IMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMF "IMF") estimating in 2019 that over 40% of such countries were in debt distress or at high risk of it.<sup id="cite_ref-Mosley_2023_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-Mosley_2023-9">[9]</a></sup>

It was in this context that Brahma Chellaney published his 2017 article "China's Debt-Trap Diplomacy", where he is widely credited with having coined the term.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Rowley_2020_11-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-Rowley_2020-11">[11]</a></sup> He claimed that China's BRI belied predatory geostrategic motives on the part of its government, aiming "not to support the local economy" in countries that took on loans through it, but "to facilitate Chinese access to natural resources, or to open the market for low-cost and shoddy Chinese goods." He further asserted that when these countries ran into debt distress, "it \[was\] even better for China," allowing China to pressure these countries into taking on more loans through it, ceding control of state assets to it, or aligning their foreign policy with it, in exchange for debt relief.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>

This hypothesis attracted wide interest, being covered in prominent newspapers like _[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")_ and _[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")_ and reiterated in foreign policy analyses by other academics, and inspiring anxiety in the governments of the U.S. and its allies.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Parker_2018_15-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-Parker_2018-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Brautigam_2020_16-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-Brautigam_2020-16">[16]</a></sup> The U.S. administration publicly endorsed the hypothesis; [Rex Tillerson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson "Rex Tillerson"), then the U.S. Secretary of State, decried China for "using opaque contracts, predatory loan practices and corrupt deals that mire nations in debt and undercut their sovereignty, denying them the long-term, self-sustaining growth," in a May 2018 speech aimed at African governments before starting an official tour there.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> Google returned around 2 million results for "debt-trap diplomacy" by November.<sup id="cite_ref-Brautigam_2020_16-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-Brautigam_2020-16">[16]</a></sup>

However, Chellaney's hypothesis was not universally accepted. It became the subject of controversy, with academics, journalists, and financial analysts publishing rebuttals.<sup id="cite_ref-Brautigam_2020_16-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-Brautigam_2020-16">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Rowley_2020_11-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-Rowley_2020-11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Ferchen_2018_18-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-Ferchen_2018-18">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> By 2023, according to the [Associated Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press "Associated Press"), a consensus had formed among experts that Chinese lending to foreign governments was "far too haphazard and sloppy to be coordinated from the top," coming from "dozens of banks on the mainland" without signs of any overarching geostrategic plan.<sup id="cite_ref-Condon_2023_20-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-Condon_2023-20">[20]</a></sup> The debt crises among low- and middle-income countries that had been growing in the late 2010s only worsened in the early 2020s with the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic "COVID-19 pandemic") and rising commodity prices due to the [Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "Russian invasion of Ukraine"), but although many of these countries did owe large sums of money to Chinese banks, many had also borrowed heavily from private investors and organizations like the IMF and [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank"), and China did not appear to be in a good position to benefit from many of these crises.<sup id="cite_ref-Mosley_2023_9-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-Mosley_2023-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Condon_2023_20-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-Condon_2023-20">[20]</a></sup>

In March 2022, [Bloomberg News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News "Bloomberg News") reported that despite China making the [Western world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world "Western world") uncomfortable with its large infrastructure projects in Africa, a deeper look into the evidence showed that the accusations towards China of doing debt-trap diplomacy in the continent, were "unfounded".<sup id="cite_ref-Bloomberg_News_2022_6-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-Bloomberg_News_2022-6">[6]</a></sup> _[The Economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist "The Economist")_ investigation found that China, although a big lender, accounted for fewer shares of loans compared to the [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank") and commercial loans.

The [Associated Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press "Associated Press") reported, in May 2023, that a dozen countries, including Pakistan, Kenya, Zambia, Laos and Mongolia, were on the "brink of collapse" under the weight of overwhelming foreign debt, "much of \[it\] from the world’s biggest and most unforgiving government lender, China." However, the analysts quoted in the article disputed the idea that this was in line with any grand geostrategic plan of China's, saying that there is "no single person in charge" of the lending as it comes from "dozens of banks on the mainland" and "is far too haphazard and sloppy to be coordinated from the top." Rather, they surmised that Chinese banks were reluctant to forgive or restructure foreign debt because of difficult economic conditions domestically.<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>

Minister of Finance [Colm Imbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colm_Imbert "Colm Imbert") said at a news conference,

> The Chinese loan has a very attractive interest rate of two per cent. The IMF is 1.05 per cent, so there isn't much to choose between them.

A May 2018 paper by Sam Parker and Gabrielle Chefitz from the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs posited three strategic goals behind China's lending: "filling out a '[String of Pearls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_of_Pearls_(Indian_Ocean) "String of Pearls (Indian Ocean)")' to solve its '[Malacca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Malacca "Strait of Malacca") Dilemma' and project power across vital South Asian trading routes; undermining and fracturing the US-led regional coalition contesting [Beijing's South China Sea claims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_disputes_in_the_South_China_Sea "Territorial disputes in the South China Sea"); and enabling the [People's Liberation Army Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army_Navy "People's Liberation Army Navy") to push through the 'Second Island Chain' into the blue-water Pacific."<sup id="cite_ref-Parker_2018_15-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-Parker_2018-15">[15]</a></sup>

A March 2018 report released by the [Center for Global Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Global_Development "Center for Global Development") said that between 2001 and 2017, China restructured or waived loan payments for 51 debtor nations (most of the BRI's participants) without seizing state assets.<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup>

In September 2018, W.

Deborah Bräutigam, a professor at [Johns Hopkins University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University "Johns Hopkins University"), described debt-trap diplomacy as a "meme" which became popular due to "human negativity bias" based on anxiety about the rise of China. According to a 2019 research paper by Bräutigam, most of the debtor countries voluntarily agreed to the loans and had positive experiences working with China and "the evidence so far, including the Sri Lankan case, shows that the drumbeat of alarm about Chinese banks' funding of infrastructure across the BRI and beyond is overblown ... a large number of people have favorable opinions of China as an economic model and consider China an attractive partner for their development."<sup id="cite_ref-Brautigam_2020_16-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-Brautigam_2020-16">[16]</a></sup> Bräutigam and Meg Rithmire said that the theory lacked evidence, and criticized the media for promoting a narrative that "wrongfully misrepresents the relationship between China and the developing countries that it deals with."<sup id="cite_ref-Brautigam_2021_47-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-Brautigam_2021-47">[47]</a></sup> According to their research, China had never actually seized an asset from any country.<sup id="cite_ref-Brautigam_2021_47-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-Brautigam_2021-47">[47]</a></sup>

In April 2023, the [Boston University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_University "Boston University") Global Development Policy Center published a brief to analyze eight examples of "supposed debt trap diplomacy cases" by China, and concluded that debt trap diplomacy was not the driver of China’s overseas lending and development finance policies, and that they found no empirical evidence to prove that China had intended to lend with the aim of seizing a strategic state asset, or gaining a strategic leverage if a borrower was unable to repay the debts.<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup>

A research paper published in April 2023 in the _Journal of the Indian Ocean Region_ sought to clarify whether or not debt-trap diplomacy existed. They were unable to find "Chinese intention to burden borrowing countries with debt in order to gain strategic assets in any case".<sup id="cite_ref-himmer_rod_51-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-himmer_rod-51">[51]</a></sup> The authors, Michal Himmer and Zdeněk Rod, did not detect an exchange of material assets or non-material assets for debt in the cases of Kenya, Malaysia, and the Maldives. In all analyzed cases, the governments of the borrowing countries actively sought out finances and loans out of personal and political considerations. Some of them directly asked for aid from China. While China often owns a significant portion of the state's debt, for example in Laos (40%) and Kenya (21%), constituting a real threat to the country, it does not prove the debt trap diplomacy narrative. No Chinese intention to obtain strategic assets was detected and only one debt-for-equity swap could be found concerning property in Laos. However, the circumstances behind the case are unclear. One problem with the debt trap diplomacy approach is the focus on the exchange of material assets for property but the study also took into consideration non-material assets. The study recommends revising the debt trap diplomacy approach to focus on the quantitative aspect of loans such as Chinese standards when it comes to loan policy and the finances of the borrowing countries.<sup id="cite_ref-himmer_rod_51-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-himmer_rod-51">[51]</a></sup>

Loans from China to build the Hambantota International Port have been cited as examples of debt-trap diplomacy.

In Chellaney's original 2017 article, he presented Sri Lanka as "exhibit A", asserting that China became Sri Lanka's top lender and second-largest trading partner under the "quasi-autocratic" presidency of [Mahinda Rajapaksa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahinda_Rajapaksa "Mahinda Rajapaksa"). He claimed that although [Maithripala Sirisena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maithripala_Sirisena "Maithripala Sirisena") defeated Rajapaksa in the 2015 presidential election with campaign promises to "extricate Sri Lanka from the Chinese debt trap" and then suspended work on Chinese-funded projects after taking office, Sri Lanka's increasingly-dire economic situation forced Sirisena's administration, in Chellaney's eyes, to take out more loans from China and "\[acquiesce\] to a series of Chinese demands," such as restarting the [Port City Colombo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_City_Colombo "Port City Colombo") project and selling China a $1.1 billion majority stake in the [Hambantota port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hambantota_port "Hambantota port"). To Chellaney, China's apparent interest in the Hambantota port had an underlying military dimension, as he asserted that China was docking attack submarines at Sri Lankan ports.<sup id="cite_ref-Cheallaney_ASPI_112-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-Cheallaney_ASPI-112">[112]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-113"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-113">[113]</a></sup> These accusations became a major focus of subsequent commentary, whether concurring with or aiming to refute Chellaney's overall hypothesis, with a particular focus on Hambantota.

As of May 2024, Hambantota port has transformed into a bustling transshipment center in the Indian Ocean, especially for vehicles, handling a monthly turnover of 700,000 units.<sup id="cite_ref-114"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-114">[114]</a></sup> Additionally, Hambantota is poised to assume a more significant role in bolstering the bunkering and oil refining sectors, while also holding promise as a potential hub for cruise activities.<sup id="cite_ref-115"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-115">[115]</a></sup> Tissa Wickramasinghe, the Chief Operating Officer of Hambantota International Port Group in Sri Lanka, said that the port was progressing as planned and fulfilling its intended purpose, and that the port facilitated almost 600,000 tonnes of [bunkering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunkering "Bunkering") operations last year, following the leasing of its bunkering facility to [Sinopec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinopec "Sinopec").<sup id="cite_ref-116"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-116">[116]</a></sup>

In contrast to various conditions imposed by the World Bank or IMF, China has attached few conditions to its loans to Sri Lanka, requiring no policy reforms or similar structural adjustments.<sup id="cite_ref-118"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-118">[118]</a></sup> The use of Chinese labor on the project funded by the loan is the only condition for most Chinese loans to Sri Lanka.<sup id="cite_ref-119"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-119">[119]</a></sup> Loans from China's government are estimated to be between 10 percent and 12 percent of Sri Lanka's external debts. However, when total loans, including commercial lending, are counted, loans from China overall rise to roughly 20 percent. It is not the dominant portion of Sri Lanka's debt stock. Instead international sovereign bonds, which are owned mostly by western private investors, make up 36.5 percent of Sri Lanka's external debt, and 47 percent of the total foreign debt repayments.<sup id="cite_ref-120"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-120">[120]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-121"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-121">[121]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-122"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-122">[122]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-123"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-123">[123]</a></sup>

In 2023, _The Diplomat_ had argued that the real cause of Sri Lankan debt crisis was due to the structure of the country’s debt itself, and specifically their exposure to ISBs issued at high interest rates. A significant portion of Sri Lanka's external debt had been owed to international sovereign bonds (ISBs) accounts, and between 2010 and 2021, the ISB portion of Sri Lanka’s external debt stock had tripled, and went up from 12 percent to 36 percent, and had grown to become 70 percent of the government’s annual interest payments, which cuts into the country's foreign reserves. In 2021, there was no immediate issue for servicing Chinese loans, but Sri Lanka had to repay US$1 billion in principal and an additional US$934 million in interest for the ISBs, which had then accounted for 47.5 percent of the nation's external debt servicing, and was twice the debt amount owed to China. Sri Lankan local media had suggested that when debt-servicing became difficult, Sri Lanka’s finance minister had attempted to turn to China to secure bilateral financing to avoid defaulting in the first place, but did not follow that path due to political reasons.<sup id="cite_ref-124"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-124">[124]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-125"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-125">[125]</a></sup> By September 2022, of the $35.1 billion in Sri Lanka's foreign debt, roughly 19% of it was owed to China, 7% to Japan and 5% to India. Private investors accounts for the largest share with almost 40%, in which most of it is in the form of ISBs.<sup id="cite_ref-126"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-126">[126]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-127"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-127">[127]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-128"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-128">[128]</a></sup>

Brahma Chellaney noted that China had gained considerable diplomatic leverage during the presidency of [Mahinda Rajapaksa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahinda_Rajapaksa "Mahinda Rajapaksa") and enlarged its footprint in Sri Lanka. When a new government took power, Sri Lanka was on the "brink of default" and the new government had no choice but "to turn around and embrace China again".

A second feasibility report, concluded in 2006 by the Danish engineering firm [Ramboll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramboll "Ramboll"), reached a similar conclusion. According to Bräutigam, the port in Hambantota had to secure only a fraction of the cargo which went through Singapore to justify its existence. When President [Maithripala Sirisena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maithripala_Sirisena "Maithripala Sirisena") took office in 2015, Sri Lanka owed more to [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan"), the World Bank, and the [Asian Development Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Development_Bank "Asian Development Bank") than to China; of the $4.5 billion in debt service Sri Lanka paid in 2017, only five percent was for Hambantota. Bräutigam was told by several Sri Lanka Central Bank governors that Hambantota (and Chinese finance in general) were not the major sources of the country's financial distress, and Bräutigam said that Sri Lanka did not default on any loans to China.

[Chatham House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House "Chatham House") published a research paper in 2020 concluding that Sri Lanka's debt distress was unconnected to Chinese lending, but resulted more from "domestic policy decisions" facilitated by Western lending and monetary policy than from Chinese government policies. The paper was skeptical of the claim that China could use Hambantota as a naval base (calling it "clearly erroneous"), and noted that Sri Lankan politicians and diplomats have repeatedly insisted that the topic was never brought up with Beijing; there has been no evidence of Chinese military activity at, or near, Hambantota since the port's lease began.<sup id="cite_ref-ChathamHouse_117-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-ChathamHouse-117">[117]</a></sup>

He also emphasised that Laos believed that the Chinese Government "will not let another socialist country fail"and hence repeatedly eschewed help from other international lenders in favor of Beijing. <sup id="cite_ref-170"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-170">[170]</a></sup>

## Pacific islands\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Debt-trap_diplomacy&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Pacific islands")\]

In 2019, Lowy institute completed a [systematic review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review "Systematic review") of the evidence on whether or not China was doing debt-trap diplomacy in the [Pacific Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islands "Pacific Islands"). Their findings were that China was not the main driver behind rising debt risks in the Pacific, nor was China the dominant creditor in the region. Only [Tonga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonga "Tonga") had China as a dominant creditor, but the researchers argued that this did not confer an advantageous position to China since they had to agree to defer repayments twice yet getting not much in return. They also found that Chinese lending terms were hardly predatory and that they "appear to be much more careful with loans", and concluded that "China has not been engaged in debt-trap diplomacy in the Pacific, as of yet". They also found the "overwhelming majority" of Chinese loans in the region are [concessional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concessional_funding "Concessional funding") enough to be deemed more as aid. However, they also noted that the majority of the Pacific nations that are currently indebted to China have little scope to take on more debts and recommended that China restructure their future approach to give more grant assistance, rather than more loans, to avoid overwhelming those nations with too much debts.<sup id="cite_ref-182"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-trap_diplomacy#cite_note-182">[182]</a></sup>
