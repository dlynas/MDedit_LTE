## Master List Of Left-Wing Youtube AND Podcast Channels - REVISED

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BreadTube/comments/9kwkxa/master_list_of_leftwing_youtube_and_podcast/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BreadTube/comments/9kwkxa/master_list_of_leftwing_youtube_and_podcast/)

> **Master List Of Left-Wing Youtube AND Podcast Channels**
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> \*\*\*NOTE: after a discussion with the mods I’ve taken out the original note here. Suffice to say the reason I put together this revised list was to add a number of channels I felt had been unfairly excluded. I’ve taken out a few controversial channels to comply with the mods request that i do so, as well as link to OP at his request. I thank the mods for allowing me to keep the rest of the channels I’ve added to the list. 
> 
> Newly Added channels not on OP:
> 
> Tovarich Endymion, BrendanMccooney, Red Star Video, Claudia Brown, SJW101, azureScapegoat, Benji Adam Wiskettes, DemocraticSocialist01, Comrade Hakim, FinnishBolshevik, Bat’ko The Manarchist, ProSocialism, Flea Market Socialist, KnowingBetter, and a few others!
> 
> As a socialist I don't believe masterlists should constitute any kind of intellectual property that should be protected, especially in context of a masterlist that is being shared to spread awareness of leftist channels shared with the leftist community. I believe the channels I added deserve recognition. I don’t mind sharing editing with the community — let me know what you’d like to add and I’ll try my best to accommodate within the word limit here. I’ve had to take out a few of the film related channels to make room for more directly politically related podcasts. 
> 
> I included the Podcast section in post and just removed the NEWS section of the original post, so that can be found in the OP (link in title). Also please note that to accommodate more podcasts and other more directly related leftist channels, I’ve had to remove some more film focused channels. Those can be found on the OP. Thanks comrades.

He has recently branched out into much more overtly political content, creating videos which refuted arguments in Cassie Jaye’s men’s rights film ‘The Red Pill’ and the videos of Prager University.

> [donoteat01](https://www.youtube.com/user/donoteat01): Brought to my attention through comments. A fascinating channel using the game Cities: Skylines to illustrate the socioeconomic impacts the urban planning of cities can have on people's lives, both through the development in cities in history and in their redevelopment today. If you're interested in class analysis this series will be perfect for you.

> [Folding Ideas](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyNtlmLB73-7gtlBz00XOQQ): While not too overtly political, a leftist sense of justice and morality is pervasive in all Dan Olson’s work on this channel. He creates very lengthy analyses of movies and cultural events like last year’s weird YouTube kids video algorithm. Perhaps his most politically potent work though is the video I’ll link down below.

While this political aspect is clear in all his reviews, often he does do videos exploring politics a lot more overtly such as below.

> [Lindsay Ellis](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG1h-Wqjtwz7uUANw6gazRw): Like Olson and Kallgren, Ellis started back in the day on That Guy With The Glasses, but has since transcended that prison into a phenomenal film critic. She uses dry humour and widely recognisable pop culture (her favourite subjects being Disney and Transformers) to look at intersecting social and political trends. While she’s often spoken from a feminist perspective, her recent work has begun delving into Marxist analysis in a way she’s very accessibly explained to the wide audience who watch her.

	Hi! I'd like to submit my channel (Curio) to be included here again. My channel is very small (400 subs) but I think people here would like my content. OP of the first Masterlist didn't add me to the list, but did add LackingSaint, seemingly on my suggestion. I don't know if this is because my channel is so small, but as I said, I really think people here would like my content.

	Here's the link to my channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJmlCcnfMlyPA2oSbb072QA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJmlCcnfMlyPA2oSbb072QA)

	I make video essays analysing media and exploring leftist ideas with the hopes that fans of those media will see our ideas positively through the lens of things they enjoy. I've done essays about Shadow of the Colossus, Bioshock, Wolfenstein and Fallout New Vegas. My most recent essay was about an argument I had with everyone's favourite pseudointellectual cryptofascist, Sargon of Akkad. Here's the link to that one:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2yDMdxXM8I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2yDMdxXM8I)

It was only a year ago and it was bad enough to get him banned from r/LateStageCapitalism, if you're interested you can [read more here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/63pstz/left_mods_response_to_hbomberguy_revelations/). I brought it up and got downvoted which is frustrating because I enjoy his videos and I agree he makes good content. But does nobody else find it hypocritical to bash people for not believing women and then hold up somebody who said he doesn't believe people? Is it really okay as long as they're on the left? I don't know.

	Their podcast is great, they have had great figures on there ex: Naomi Klein.

	I also recommend Deconstructed by Mehdi Hasan which is a podcast by The Intercept, great podcast and shorter than Intercepted (every episode is ~30 minutes).

		As the reviser of this list I want to make clear that I made a specific request to add the channels that I have mentioned in the note at the top of this post. I don’t think it’s right to censor YouTube channels with the notion that leftists somehow cannot decide for themselves what they should think or that one persons opinion should dictate your contextual and historical understanding of marxist theory and praxis. I had a sincere desire to simply add the channels I’ve added to his list, however we were unfortunately unable to reach any kind of compromise due to what I perceive as ideological rigidity. I did however comply with the mods request to remove one channel in particular that they deemed particularly offensive to them. 
		
		I am not myself an ML, however I believe they have a right to express their tendency. Many of these channels, including FinBol, use first and second hand sources with careful and nuanced deep dive analysis to make the arguments they make in their videos. It goes without saying, not every video on every channel is even about ML as a tendency. Democraticsocialist01 for example has excellent videos debunking Pinochet apologists.  
		
		I’m not particularly in favor of liberal or capitalist friendly channels as I believe capitalist atrocities make ones by Stalin et al pale by comparison, however I have left those channels in regardless. I believe our community is full of highly intelligent people who can make these distinctions for themselves after examining the arguments presented. It’s a shame that inter-left conflict over censorship is something we still have to deal with. Regardless, I hope you will check out the channels I added as well as the extensive podcast list, the latter of which was a group effort, thanks comrades for all your submissions and descriptions! Please spread all these channels around.

			Its almost as if we should vote on a list of good videos collectively so everyone is happy.  If only there was a way to sort by "best" "all time" after we voted on videos colectively🤔
			
			Actually the discourse we generate in making these lists is very refreshing compared to some of the commentless +50 videos. We should do this more often, but plan it ahead of time, and try to remember that we do it in good faith.
			
			I think some of the new descriptions of channels could be a great resource to copypasta for marking individual recommendations.

						Yeah I agree! The OP is really anti -ML — my thing is like even if you’re anti ML there’s a whole lot to learn from that perspective regardless. Apparently there’s some scandal in his personal life too ?? But the actual content in his channel is top notch. First and second hand sources, a coherent a holistic analysis , he’s very thorough.

								Yep. My sentiments exactly. I started seeing the USSR and the situation it was in post 1917 as a literal struggle for survival, and democratic centralism / a stratified party apparatus as a necessity for the nations survival. I started thinking more dialectically and structurally about the USSR rather than self righteously just calling everyone ML a defender of mass murder like I did when I first became a marxist. Any nuance, and careful broad analysis that dives into the actual system, organization, political and economic systems, and even does contextual deep dives into the purges is a really valuable resource that can help people broaden their understanding. I didn’t even know what I didn’t know before I actually listened to and watched ML channels.

										Finnish Bolshevik links to most of them on his channel links — red star videos is great I don’t think they are explicitly ML -/ their video on “why the right is wrong on free speech” is excellent and their explanation of tendencies is also very good. Austrian Leninist, marxist Leninist theory, and a few others. I haven’t watched all but he has some good channel links

	**Swampside chats** is probably my favorite leftist podcast at this juncture - the topics can be pretty niche ("here's this left-wing party that split in 1976," "here's this ultra-reactionary who wrote a manifesto") but it pulls off a combination of entertaining and intellectually serious that's p rare IME.

	**Behind the News** is more current-events-driven and less entertaining, but is still probably one of the best Serious Interview shows out there.

	Hey all — bshawwwwwww here, compiler of the revised list. I’ve been really busy with exams and work projects for the last few weeks so I’m pretty late to making this quick post. It’s not even really relevant now, but i thought i would just state my case in case anyone is interested in why i decided to make a revised list.  

	I logged on recently after weeks away I’m not sure why, but I got my original account banned a few days ago. I got a temporary suspension for 3 days during which I didn’t use reddit at all. Then today it turned itself into a full on ban. Very strange because i haven’t even used my account for a while. I have to assume this has something to do with me creating a revised, uncensored, democratized list. I’ve noticed there have also been a number of aggrieved posts by the original list maker regarding my revised list. 

	I’m not interested in reading those posts because frankly I don’t care for drama and I frankly do not respect anyone who sees a list of channels as his or her absolute property. I really don’t care. I’ll start a new account and find all my old subs. I’m here to try my best to spread information and awareness and to educate and offer resources to comrades. 

	A masterlist is an educational resource. That’s why it’s called a masterlist. By definition it demands comprehensiveness. You don’t have to like or watch ML channels but why would anyone want to ban them ? I’m not interested in hashing our who the list should belong to or why etc. or indulge a reactionary impulse towards an attitude of total private ownership of a list, particularly a censored list based on one users own biased ideological preferences. 

	Contextualizing and understanding different points of views helps us as leftists go understand history praxis and theory. Putting our hands over our eyes and not asking more fundamental questions about the USSR and the context behind its history is not helpful and it doesn’t help us win the war of ideas against reactionaries. We have nothing to apologize for for being socialists. How should we consider someone who says that the USSR didn’t fail it was defeated? Could Trotsky have been the one who was actually bad? Well how would we know if we only listened to trots? 

	This is not to say I necessarily identify as an ML myself, but even if I did that would be irrelevant to the entire purpose behind democratizing the list and allowing all leftists and even *some* liberals onto the list. My position is pretty simple on this — if I could take a vote from everyone on the subreddit and everyone wanted liberals to be on the list I would put them on the list. But I’m not going to restrict or take any leftist tendencies or channels that focus on particular tendencies out. 

	I was happy to negotiate and form a compromise with the mods and did take out the channel they advised me to do. I offered to even remove my revised list if the original compiler would leave 8-10 more ML friendly and other channels I had added into my revised list. Unfortunately I was met with stubborn, aggrieved petulance. Apparently it’s up to one person to decide for an entire community what constitutes an appropriate MASTERlist. Anyway...

	I believe that when we contextualize and understand the defenders of different figures and interpretations of Marxism we have more context and understand. That seems to me to be the whole point of dialectical materialism. At the end of the day my goal is to democratize the list and take everyone’s input. That’s why I added everyone’s contributions, and added and subtracted people and even added caveats and disclaimers onto peoples channels as I got more info from comrades. I want to give a thank you to all the comrades who help me to compile the podcast list. That was a collaborative effort and you all deserve credit. 

	Anyway obviously feel free to take anything from this list use it as you see fit. In fact now that i can no longer edit it i would encourage that if I’ve missed some great channels. Create new lists from it and edit as you want. It’s not my property — I see effort as collaborative and teaching and spreading awareness as a good in and of itself...hence nobody needs to ask me to use any of this. 

	In solidarity, bshawwwwwww

	this is a great list and helpful but I'm not sure how you left out The Young Turks which is the main and biggest one!!

	Others (mostly progressive/SocDem view)

	\-The Damage Report w/ John Iadorola\*

	\-Secular Talk w/ Kyle Kulinski\* (podcast only on Blog Talk Radio to my knowledge)

	\-The David Pakman Show\*

	\-The Ring of Fire

	\-Thomm Hartmann Program

	\-#NoFilter w/ Ana Kasparian\*

	\-The Humanist Report w/ Mike Figueredo\*

	\-The Rational National

	\-The Jimmy Dore Show\*

	\-Rebel HQ

	\-Progressive Voice (more like a gossip channel lol but still leftist)

	\-The Bitchuation Room w/ Francesca Fiorentini\*

	\-The Edge w Mark Thompson

	&amp;#x200B;

	All of them are on YouTube except the Bitchuation Room. I put an asterisk if I know they have a podcast too.

	&amp;#x200B;

	Sorry if some of these are already in your list...my computer keeps freezing on the long post but I didn't see these guys and I think they definitely deserve some love!

		A lot of these are great but I have been mainly focused on leftist. Handles , many of these are liberal or liberal progressive. I’ve put a few of them on the list previously, but I didn’t want to dilute the list with capitalists. Perhaps I can add a section specifically for liberal progressives though. Thanks for these, a few of them are on the list already :)

			The Party Switch video is probably best when it comes to this list. Definitely more moderate compared to the holy trinity.
			
			But probably closer to being a leftist than some people on this list.

	SWOTI (Someone's Wrong on the Internet): Hosted by Briahna Gray Joy and Joe Kunhilee, two leftist millennial POC. Entertaining and upbeat show that ranges from pop-culture to current events to dunking on centrist libs.

	I again really have to protest against Destiny being on this list, he's literally economically center-right. He is not left-wing by any coherent definition of the name.

	* 🟨 **[Stoople_me](https://www.reddit.com/user/Stoople_me)** ⬆️ 12 _(2018-10-03 08:19:40)_

		Depending on your views on platforming right-wingers, Destiny could be seen as being pretty useful to the cause. It's rare to see anyone from the gaming community platforming left wing ideas (he's socially pretty left). Personally watching him got me away from watching Peterson and introduced me to Contrapoints, so i guess it just depends on your perspective.

	* 🟨 **[bshawwwwwww](https://www.reddit.com/user/bshawwwwwww) (OP)** ⬆️ 2 _(2018-10-03 01:26:00)_

		That’s a fair point. I remember him as someone who did debate a lot of right wingers on an ideological front but I don’t see him being on the list as all that important. I’ve heard this from a few people. He seems to have a good amount of videos where he argues against ideological and cultural reactionary ideas, so I went ahead and added a note based on your feedback and moved him far down the list.

		While I enjoy the work these guys put out and have listened to Pod for a long time, I don’t think they are really BreadTube material. Left-leaning political commentary is all well and good don’t get me wrong, but BreadTube has always been more avowedly anti-capitalist and against State commodification of power than most liberal commentators are probably comfortable with.
		
		People like Ezra and David Plouffe are phenomenal at what they do, well-read and often quite funny. I’d recommend them to anyone left of center who cares about creating ethical polity. My problem with them though is that they’re not against unjust political power structures in the outright but only against the particulars. I get the feeling that having a liberal in charge of a shitty, exploitative system would be just fine with them and when shit hits the fan they’d either support the status quo because it has been so normalized to them, or would grind at a snail’s pace at any attempt to reform it, instead of rejecting it and starting over. 
		
		BreadTube should be about content creators who are bold in their views and “woke” enough to see the forest from the trees, although anyone left of center that isn’t a fascist is more than welcome.
		
		Edit: You didn’t have to delete your comment! For those that are curious, they recommended the podcasts Pod Save America (which is on our list btw), The Ezra Klein Show, Stay Tuned With Preet, Pod Save the People, and Lovett or Leave It.

		I don't know how the fuck you can listen to PSA and in the same breath recommend Pod Damn America (an actually good and actually leftist podcast).
		
		liberals' incoherent political positions are really wild.
