## In Defense of Donald Hoffman

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/consciousness/comments/17xqnlg/in_defense_of_donald_hoffman/](https://www.reddit.com/r/consciousness/comments/17xqnlg/in_defense_of_donald_hoffman/)

> I've seen a few people mention Donald Hoffman on this sub and I'm surprised that non-physicalists don't mention him more here. I saw people talking about him in derisive terms, saying that he's essentially a New Age author with no scientific value. That is a severe mischaracterization of him and I hope this post makes a case for his validity as scientist. I also hope to make a solid introduction to him for those who haven't heard of him before.
> 
> Donald Hoffman is an American cognitive psychologist and popular science author. He is a professor in the Department of Cognitive Sciences at the University of California, Irvine, with joint appointments in the Department of Philosophy, the Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science, and the School of Computer Science. He's known for his 2019 book [The Case Against Reality: How Evolution Hid the Truth from Our Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfMCn42RRfw)*,* in which he posits that space and time are actually an interface that we have evolved in order to make sense of the world so that we can survive. Essentially, he claims in the book that organisms that perceive reality as it truly is are always out-competed by organisms that evolve an interface that optimizes their ability to survive and reproduce. Donald has also published other books. [Visual Intelligence: How We Create What We See](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-02122-000) (1998) and [Observer Mechanics: A Formal Theory of Perception](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1989-98005-000) (1989) are just two.
> 
> Now, Donald is generally known for for his work with Conscious Agents, which has been the crux of his research for the last few years. He has been called a New Age guru, which I don't think is fair. None of his work has anything to do with any kind of quantum manifestation, ESP, auras, Chi, or anything of that sort. Moreover, he has been transparent about his work and has shared his ideas openly. Here are some of his interviews (The link to The Case Against Reality is an interview link with editor of Skeptic Magazine Michael Shermer).

His transparency about his work and collaborative approach are hallmarks of intellectual honesty and high regards for the scientific process. I hope this post gives you a good introduction into his work, in case this is the first time you are reading about him. I also hope that those that have thought of him as a New Age guru or Quantum Mystic can see that he couldn't be farther from it. His work is as rigorous as it is fascinating. I believe the science of consciousness will benefit greatly from his research.

	Sadly this shows how wedded people are to their ideologies.

	We, i.e. our brain, transform reality, whatever that may be, into neural patterns. Neural patterns are amodal to reality. But they still encode reality in some way.
  

	So much for the theory of knowledge. But this should not be confused or mixed with a theory of the brain, i.e. the question of how these neurons work together. And this in turn should not be confused or mixed with the question of how do I experience the world. There are two different perspectives on the same thing, namely the brain.
  

	From the epistemological perspective it follows that there is no objective truth, because we construct (our) reality, but only as a pattern in our heads, not out there.
  

	Looking at the brain shows that there are different perspectives from individual scientific perspectives that have no causal relationship.

			By objective truth I mean something transcendent that is true for the entire universe. In my opinion, there is no such thing apart from the fact that there is a universe. By truth we can only understand our truth. It is relative and refers to what we as humanity consider to be true. I am referring here to the philosophical concept of truth, which was idealistic in classical German philosophy, for example.

							I see it that way too. For me, reality is relativistic. How would a photon perceive the world. For it there might be 'normal' causality at the quantum level.
							We see the world 'neuronally', a photon would see the world photonically. For a neutrino there might not be a world.
							Therefore we cannot say anything about objective truths, not even about objective reality.

		>Can you expand on the concept of organism which truly experience reality? That's just a theorical concept right? What does it mean precisely?
		
		Donald Hoffman and his collaborators have proven mathematically that the probability of evolution designing an organism to accurately perceive reality is precisely 0%. Evolution prioritizes fitness above all else, it cannot build an organism to perceive reality accurately because that would detract from fitness. Organisms built to perceive reality accurately are outcompeted and quickly die out when you model evolutionary game theory.
		
		This has big implications for us as observers trying to understand reality. As Hoffman explains, our perceptual system is an interface not unlike a desktop interface. The qualities of the icons on our desktop interface, like size, shape, and color, are completely unrelated to the contents of the files/programs they represent. Other examples might be biohazard and radiation symbols. We understand what these symbols mean, they represent certain types of danger, but the symbols themselves are completely arbitrary.
		
		Our entire perceptual system is like this, it's an interface, not an accurate one-to-one correspondence with the structure of reality. And this extends to even fundamental concepts such as space and time. Like icons on a desktop, space and time are artifacts of this interface with no real meaning in reality. These concepts are simply useful tools for navigating the information space we're operating within.
		
		None of this means we shouldn't take our perception of reality seriously, you wouldn't carelessly ignore radiation symbols. We should take our interface seriously, but not *literally* because we know it's not providing "true" information, merely *useful* information.

			I really like Donald Hoffmans ideas and especially his approach. But "proven" is a big word here. If gave a convincing argument based on game theory and simulations. However it's not really this argument cannot be attacked. Sampling matters and there are people who came to other conclusions by picking different samples for the simulated evolution and came to different conclusions. 
			
			However. I think that this is probably the biggest plus for Hoffman. An approach that is attackable through different setups is actually a great thing.

			Thank you for that. I agree it would not be possible to sense every nuance of reality, it would require an infinite amount of sensors with an infinite amount of energy and an infinitely large brain. We just perceive enough to survive as efficiently as possible.
			
			Time and space though? Well, in a way, I somehow see it, make the brain faster, it will perceives more changes in less time which will make the world look slower to it. But besides that, a complete mental construct? That is an extraordinary claim, is causality a thing for Hoffman? Does events still happen linearly? I throw a ball at Hoffman, does he catch it? If he can't perceive it, does it hit him?

			* 🟦 **[Eleusis713](https://www.reddit.com/user/Eleusis713)** ⬆️ 5 _(2023-11-18 12:24:31)_

				>That is an extraordinary claim
				
				Mainstream physics has generally moved away from the idea that spacetime is fundamental for a variety of reasons. We need a new model of reality that projects down into spacetime. Spacetime is an emergent phenomena from deeper physics. So we already know from this angle that our concepts of space and time are not accurate representations of reality, they're simply useful models.
				
				It's also important to point out that we know that our scientific model of spacetime is far more accurate then our intuitive sense of space and time given to us through evolution. We know from Einstein that space and time and fundamentally the same thing - spacetime. But evolution didn't build us to have an intuitive sense that these concepts are connected because we never evolved in environments where high gravity warping space (and thus time) would be relevant to us at any point.
				
				Much like how we build models of the natural world using the scientific method, evolution does the same when building organisms. But none of these models, whether they're created through collective scientific effort or iterated on through evolution, are perfect representations of the world around us.
				
				Space and time are very useful mental models but those models are less accurate than our scientific model of spacetime which is less accurate than a future model in which spacetime emerges from deeper physics.

			I have a question about organisms that perceive true reality. How would we ever identify one due to our very lack of ability to perceive true reality ourselves? I guess what I am saying is that claiming that natural selection chooses for organisms that emphasize survival by not perceiving true reality may be accurate, however what evidence is there that conscious organisms would ever have the ability to perceive true reality? Maybe that is a fundamental aspect of consciousness?

	* 🟨 **[TheForestPrimeval](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheForestPrimeval)** ⬆️ 4 _(2023-11-17 23:10:33)_

		>Can you expand on the concept of organism which truly experience reality? That's just a theorical concept right? What does it mean precisely?
		
		As a point of comparison, start with an organism that *doesn't* perceive reality as it "truly is" -- us humans. For example, color is not really real. What's actually "out there" is electromagnetic radiation of various frequencies, which strikes photoreceptors in our retina, which, through transduction, relay electrical signals to portions of the brain that then generate an interior experience that we call color. But the radiation itself has no color. It is not even an emergent property of the radiation. It's just an experience that our brain generates. Hoffman would understand this experience as a sort of data compression heuristic that the brain employs in order to make efficient use of computing resources. In other words, if you had to understand the world around you by making sense of every light wave, let alone every individual photon, it would require such an enormous allocation of resources that such an organism would easily be out-competed by more efficient organisms that use gestalt-like patterns such as color in order to make sense of the world.
		
		The same can be said of sound. There *is no* sound out there. There are just pressure waves of air molecules, which are, themselves, silent. These pressure waves impact the structures of our ear. Again, through transduction, the audio receptor cells translate the impact of these pressure waves into electrochemical signals that parts of our brain interprete via an interior experience we call sound. Why? For the same evolutionary purpose that we see color. It's a data compression tool to make sense of the pressure waves.
		
		However, Hoffman takes it further than this. He says that not only color and sound are interior experiences generated by the brain as data compression heuristics. Even space and time itself are experiences that we have, rather than actual external realities. What's actually *out there* is unknowable, at least to us. We can only experience the representation of the "exterior world" generated by our brains, which likely bears little resemblance to what's actually "out there." 
		
		So an organisms that can perceive what's actually "out there" is what you're asking about. It's just that we can't define what that experience would actually be like. We just know what it's *not*, which is what we experience.

			Thank you for that. I find this very reasonable and in line with how I view things, except for time and space. Why is it necessary to add that concept to his model?

				It's not just intuition. He has worked on research of perception for decades that has led him to this idea. But just think about it: The brain has parts that create a sense of time and spatial relation, and those can be affected. When you take a drug like cannabis, for example, 2 minutes can feel like an hour. When you take a drug like DMT, 10 minutes can feel like thousands of years. You can also see people that have had brain injuries lose their sense of spatial relation, motion, etc.   
				
				
				The idea that space-time is not fundamental comes from a few physicists that are trying to define quantum loop gravity, which is hard to do in the framework of General Relativity, so they are looking into geomteric and mathematical structures that are not defined through space-time terms to derive formulations that space-time emerges from. They are not saying it's not real, but just an emergent structure that's made from some more fundamental geometry.

					The idea that time can be experienced differently is not particularly special to me, just look at the reaction speed of a fly, it perceives changes faster than us, but time is the same, the fly is just able to analyze and react faster due to how its brain process information.
					
					For example, add a few kilometres of axion between your eyes and your visual cortex. You'll see things with a delay that doesn't fit with what your ear hears. You didn't change the nature of time, you just distorted your perception of it.

				The conscious agent would be what reality is made from. Spacetime is a projection of their interactions. So I’m reality you would be made of those. But you perception of that reality is only a low resolution projection of the more complex structures themselves.

								I’ve already seen what other people are talking about, and I’m not convinced. They’re basically saying “it’s a religious idea, so it’s bunk to begin with” if you have a source on how the science is wrong and why it’s bunk, I’ll read it

										We can actually know a lot of things about what is outside of space-time because we have mathematical models. The amplituhedron is a dynamic geometry that is used to derive particle interactions in space-time with more simple calculations than working within the space-time framework.   
										[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplituhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplituhedron)
										
										This has been around for a while and there's a good amount of physicists looking to derive space-time from a larger mathematical set, especially since people have begun to look for quantum gravity, which is extremely difficult to fit into General Relativity, forcing people to look beyond constraints set by previously held ideas of the fundamental nature of spacetime.

										Also, I'll remind you that we have zero empirical evidence for the existence of dark matter and dark energy. they are parts of cosmological models that we have to make sense of what is essentially a big mystery as to why galaxies have more mass than they should and why the universe's apparent expansion is gaining speed. We don't have experimental evidence for either of them, and that's ok. Science is more than just empiricism.

										Lastly, coordination and cooperation with other physicists and scientists is a mark of proper scientific and academic rigor. You're saying it as if it's a weakness, but I instead find it a weakness to refuse to relate one's work to wider research projects and other disciplines. I don't know why you are saying it like it's a bad thing. Hoffman and his group have always been consistent in what they have adopted from other fields and they make their case through mathematical rigor. I don't see an issue since it is normal science to cross-pollinate information and ideas.

				He's actually pretty consistent on what he's drawing from when it comes to physics and the paper describes how they mathematically model their system. I don't think he's just adding things arbitrarily, unless you yourself see something in the paper that you believe is inconsistent or arbitrary.

						I guess you're saying that since he is drawing from a pool of physics research and he's just making an amalgam as he sees fit. Frankly, I disagree. He's drawing from contemporary science in a consistent manner. He's also stated in his interviews that his work has the possibility of failure. He has said that the work aims to start from conscious agents and from that be able to predict space time, particles, etc. There's a clear success/failure metric. I don't think you can classify that as fake science. If you have a specific part in his interviews or paper that you believe is inconsistent or arbitrary, I'd like to see it.

									Because things like space-time are based on physical phenomena, and this isn't, only whatever he says it is. It's backwards from empirical science. How could we even start with experiences to begin with, with his equations? We could keep doing this forever or change whatever is necessary to fit into it. But that's not what a disproof is.

										how do we even start with matter, either? there's so many definitions about what the physical is and it even boils down to abstract mathematical vector fields and equation sets when you get down to quantum physics and work by people like Max Tegmark.
										
										[https://www.math.columbia.edu/\~woit/wsj-tegmark.pdf](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wsj-tegmark.pdf)
										
										How is matter more privileged or easier to define? Matter is literally only fully defined and described through mathemitcal means.

										So this kind of stuff is allowed to go turtles all the way down but Donald Hoffman is somehow unprovable and unflasifiable?

	You seem like you follow this guy quite a bit.

	I am interested in looking at the precise way the simulations that he claims predict that perceptual agents are tuned for fitness not reality

		He has a lot of interviews and will talk about that in detail. My recommendation is to look at the Michael Shermer Interview because he’s getting healthy pushback there.

			I am uninterested in interviews, as him claiming he did certain simulations and what their results were don't really help me.
			
			I can't critique his work or replicate his simulations without knowing the precise method he used.
