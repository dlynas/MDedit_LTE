Babylonian cuneiform numerals

**Babylonian cuneiform numerals**, also used in Assyria and Chaldea, were written in [cuneiform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform_(script) "Cuneiform (script)"), using a wedge-tipped [reed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phragmites "Phragmites") stylus to print a mark on a soft clay tablet which would be exposed in the sun to harden to create a permanent record.

The [Babylonians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonians "Babylonians"), who were famous for their astronomical observations, as well as their calculations (aided by their invention of the [abacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus "Abacus")), used a [sexagesimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal "Sexagesimal") (base-60) [positional numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation "Positional notation") inherited from either the [Sumerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer "Sumer") or the Akkadian civilizations.<sup id="cite_ref-Chrisomalis_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_cuneiform_numerals#cite_note-Chrisomalis-1">[1]</a></sup> Neither of the predecessors was a positional system (having a convention for which 'end' of the numeral represented the units).

## Origin\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Babylonian_cuneiform_numerals&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Origin")\]

This system first appeared around 2000 BC;<sup id="cite_ref-Chrisomalis_1-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_cuneiform_numerals#cite_note-Chrisomalis-1">[1]</a></sup> its structure reflects the decimal lexical numerals of [Semitic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_languages "Semitic languages") rather than Sumerian lexical numbers.<sup id="cite_ref-Chrisomalis2_2-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_cuneiform_numerals#cite_note-Chrisomalis2-2">[2]</a></sup> However, the use of a special Sumerian sign for 60 (beside two Semitic signs for the same number)<sup id="cite_ref-Chrisomalis_1-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_cuneiform_numerals#cite_note-Chrisomalis-1">[1]</a></sup> attests to a relation with the Sumerian system.<sup id="cite_ref-Chrisomalis2_2-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_cuneiform_numerals#cite_note-Chrisomalis2-2">[2]</a></sup>

## Symbols\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Babylonian_cuneiform_numerals&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Symbols")\]

The Babylonian system is credited as being the first known [positional numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_numeral_system "Positional numeral system"), in which the value of a particular digit depends both on the digit itself and its position within the number. This was an extremely important development because non-place-value systems require unique symbols to represent each power of a base (ten, one hundred, one thousand, and so forth), which can make calculations more difficult.

Only two symbols ([![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Babylonian_1.svg/20px-Babylonian_1.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Babylonian_1.svg) to count units and [![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Babylonian_10.svg/20px-Babylonian_10.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Babylonian_10.svg) to count tens) were used to notate the 59 non-zero [digits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_digit "Numerical digit"). These symbols and their values were combined to form a digit in a [sign-value notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign-value_notation "Sign-value notation") quite similar to that of [Roman numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals "Roman numerals"); for example, the combination [![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Babylonian_20.svg/20px-Babylonian_20.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Babylonian_20.svg)[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Babylonian_3.svg/20px-Babylonian_3.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Babylonian_3.svg) represented the digit for 23 (see table of digits above).

These digits were used to represent larger numbers in the base 60 (sexagesimal) positional system. For example, [![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Babylonian_2.svg/20px-Babylonian_2.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Babylonian_2.svg) [![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Babylonian_20.svg/20px-Babylonian_20.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Babylonian_20.svg)[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Babylonian_3.svg/20px-Babylonian_3.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Babylonian_3.svg) [![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Babylonian_3.svg/20px-Babylonian_3.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Babylonian_3.svg) would represent 2×60<sup>2</sup>+23×60+3 = 8583.

A space was left to indicate a place without value, similar to the modern-day [zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number) "0 (number)"). Babylonians later devised a sign to represent this empty place. They lacked a symbol to serve the function of [radix point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_point "Radix point"), so the place of the units had to be inferred from context : [![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Babylonian_20.svg/20px-Babylonian_20.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Babylonian_20.svg)[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Babylonian_3.svg/20px-Babylonian_3.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Babylonian_3.svg) could have represented 23 or 23×60 or 23×60×60 or 23/60, etc.

Their system clearly used internal [decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal "Decimal") to represent digits, but it was not really a [mixed-radix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_radix "Mixed radix") system of bases 10 and 6, since the ten sub-base was used merely to facilitate the representation of the large set of digits needed, while the place-values in a digit string were consistently 60-based and the [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic "Arithmetic") needed to work with these digit strings was correspondingly sexagesimal.

The legacy of sexagesimal still survives to this day, in the form of [degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle) "Degree (angle)") (360° in a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle") or 60° in an [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle") of an [equilateral triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilateral_triangle "Equilateral triangle")), [arcminutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcminute "Arcminute"), and [arcseconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcsecond "Arcsecond") in [trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry "Trigonometry") and the measurement of [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time"), although both of these systems are actually mixed radix.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_cuneiform_numerals#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

A common theory is that [60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_(number) "60 (number)"), a [superior highly composite number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_highly_composite_number "Superior highly composite number") (the previous and next in the series being [12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_(number) "12 (number)") and [120](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/120_(number) "120 (number)")), was chosen due to its [prime factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_factorization "Prime factorization"): 2×2×3×5, which makes it divisible by [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_(number) "1 (number)"), [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_(number) "2 (number)"), [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_(number) "3 (number)"), [4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_(number) "4 (number)"), [5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_(number) "5 (number)"), [6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_(number) "6 (number)"), [10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_(number) "10 (number)"), [12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_(number) "12 (number)"), [15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_(number) "15 (number)"), [20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_(number) "20 (number)"), [30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_(number) "30 (number)"), and [60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_(number) "60 (number)"). [Integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer") and [fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics) "Fraction (mathematics)") were represented identically—a radix point was not written but rather made clear by context.

### Zero\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Babylonian_cuneiform_numerals&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Zero")\]

The Babylonians did not technically have a digit for, nor a concept of, the number [zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number) "0 (number)"). Although they understood the idea of [nothingness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothingness "Nothingness"), it was not seen as a number—merely the lack of a number. Later Babylonian texts used a placeholder ([![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Babylonian_digit_0.svg/30px-Babylonian_digit_0.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Babylonian_digit_0.svg)) to represent zero, but only in the medial positions, and not on the right-hand side of the number, as we do in numbers like 100.<sup id="cite_ref-lmnz_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_cuneiform_numerals#cite_note-lmnz-4">[4]</a></sup>
