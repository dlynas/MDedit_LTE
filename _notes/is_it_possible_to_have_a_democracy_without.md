## Is it possible to have a democracy without political parties?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/EndFPTP/comments/17rapwd/is_it_possible_to_have_a_democracy_without/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EndFPTP/comments/17rapwd/is_it_possible_to_have_a_democracy_without/)

> Not sure if fully in line with this sub, but I wonder: are political parties necessary for a democracy to function? What if we had a system in which every politician was an independent? They could have an ideology or be linked to political alliances, but not be a member of a political party themselves. Like Bernie Sanders and Angus King are today. Australia is seeing more independents as well.

While it does have advantages, it's not perfect either, because despite there being so many parties many people don't know who to vote for, there isn't a party that reflects all its voters' beliefs. Parties regularly collapse or break down as well, and the political landscape is very fragmented.

The median voter would be better represented and politics would be less polarized and divisive. Everyone is unique in terms of politics and this system would do more justice to that. As for how the government would be elected, that could happen through a presidential system with a popular vote, not an electoral college like the US has today. So no coalitions are needed and every vote matters.

	I do not see any practical difference between the two. People grouping together to pool resources and easing collaboration, or differentiating themselves from those with different opinions, is part of human nature. It is mostly irrelevant if there is "formal" membership system. "parties" will always exist in any kind of political system.

	The difference is if the political and governance systems require such membership to gain any semblance of power. Or if parties can be just informal grouping of like-minded politicians, hoping to push shared agenda.

	And in case of huge amount of representatives, it might make sense for parties to be official part of governance, so voters don't have to deal with hundreds of individuals and instead select between dozen-or-so groups of shared ideologies and agendas.

				The Democratic Party fights for the "urban" areas of Nebraska (Lincoln and Omaha), and the Republican Party controls the rest of the state.  Statewide elections have been safe for Republicans for quite some time.  Each party sometimes tries to color outside the lines, but ends up losing big when they do.
				
				For the U.S. Congress, it's all Republicans all of the time these days.  Since Republicans are the "opposition party" right now, there's not a clear leader of the party.  In Nebraska's Republican delegation, the main outlier is Don Bacon, but he is representing [Nebraska's 2nd district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska%27s_2nd_congressional_district), which the Cook Political report says is 50R/50D  
				 
				You can see how frequently all of Nebraska's federal delegation votes for Republicans here: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/
				
				I'm sure the Republicans in the state legislature who want to move into federal politics are very careful how they vote.  The Democrats in the state are grateful to get any votes for anything beyond [mayor of Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leirion_Gaylor_Baird).

					l'm not sure that is necessarily true but at the same time I only have one reference point.
					
					When Obama won NE-2 in 2008, GOP in NE wanted to switch allocation back to winner takes all.  That failed in spite of them threatening to withdraw support for those who didn't vote for it. It might have failed because since they are unicameral they have an abuseable filibuster.  Iirc most GOP voted for the change.  While it failed they just refreshed the gerrymander for NE-2 instead.  
					
					Obviously that is just one data point and could be the equivalent of using the same sex marriage vote in Netherlands to say there is no binding by the party.  That vote had members of most parties voting for and against and would paint the picture of that situation where new coalitions form for each issue but I suspect that might not be typical and just an issue where there was a free vote.
					
					I'm thinking NE might have a longer leash, it's officially non partisan but in reality it just takes a click to find out and things are similarly geographically polarized.

			I don't know if there is specific definition of "political party". What you imagine as "political party" is formal groups with membership, leadership and strict(ish) rules about following party agenda. While I can imagine a "political party" as more loose and formal group of politicians. Without clearly defined leadership or agenda.

		The biggest difference between the two, in European/Parliamentary systems, tends to be the power of the Party Whip; if the party has the power to effectively sanction representatives that step out of line, that forces them to represent the *party* rather than their constituents.

	It's possible, but rare. 

	Democracies must have freedom of association and expression in general. The degree to which this is used varies, but the basic idea is universal in a democracy.

	Elections require a group of people to vote for someone or another.

	There is competition for such positions naturally.

	Rational people create associations to make it more likely that someone will be elected who shares their opinions and who can create consistency in support for an idea or person. They tend to have common ideas or something else in common that unites them. 

	A large democracy like the United States or even medium sized ones like the Netherlands make it essentially impossible to suppress parties. The things that are closest to it in function that remain legal will take on characteristics like parties.

		The great advantage to (hypothetically) eliminating Party-With-Affiliation and/or Political-Organizations-As-Election-Vehicles, and only allowing Non-Profits that happen to be politically minded (ACLU, EFF, NRA, FairVote, etc), is that they would be more inclined to endorse &amp; support candidates based on those candidates' alignment with their ideological wheelhouse, rather than what letter happens to most reliably do so.  For example, in 2012, the ACLU rated Gary Johnson as high or higher than they rated Obama on all the sub-categories they cared about, but rather than endorsing *both,* they exclusively supported the Democratic Nominee.  Likewise, Johnson was better than Romney on the things that the NRA cared about... but they endorsed Romney because he was the Republican nominee

			Many countries allow for independents in special ways. Poland for instance, in their last election to the Sejm, a number of independents were actually elected with support from the parties in a broad list. 
			
			Also, some of these associations are not based on the same kinds of reasons for political support. The ACLU is a civil liberties organization, as its name obviously means, but some candidates that might be slightly less effective on civil liberties might be more useful for them overall if they in general are popular and effective enough to be elected in the first place and to organize an administration and effect legislation. What does Gary Johnson know about all the other tasks a President must do in 2012? 
			
			Gary Johnson might be more useful being elected to the Congress being able to advocate for that issue in particular and not the presidency, or perhaps an ombudsman position on civil liberties. 
			
			Most countries have electoral systems that allow for parties to run but also allow for others to run, same with presidents too, that try to account for all models of valid politics, such as a partisan system, a one party dominant system, a true two party system, a multi party system, or even one with little influence of parties of any kind. Electoral lists in Switzerland may be submitted by anyone who has a hundred or two hundred signatories. NGOs such as the Swiss equivalent of the ACLU may submit them as well, or help to sponsor those which are proposed by others. In principle, a candidate could be sponsored by multiple such groups and parties. NGOs may pick and choose candidates regardless of party and independents from any list they see fit to endorse. 
			
			The voters have as many votes as there are seats to elect in their canton, and the cantons are apportioned their share of the 200 seats based on their population. They could even vote more than once for a single candidate or for candidates from multiple lists or strike candidates off a list or write a ballot paper all on your own so long as the total number of votes doesn't exceed their canton's number. A vote for a candidate is a vote for their list too. This is called panachage list proportional representation. The votes for the lists are summed, and distributed proportionally, and the most popular candidates tied to the list are elected to the Swiss parliament.
			
			Ireland has a proportional system based on single transferable vote and is completely party agnostic, and works similarly to what I said about Switzerland. They also elect a ceremonial president by a ranked ballot to achieve a majority, although Ireland doesn't open nominations up broadly and only to sitting members of parliament or municipal councils or incumbent presidents seeking a second term.

				> some candidates that might be slightly less effective on civil liberties might be more useful for them overall if they in general are popular and effective enough to be elected in the first place
				
				Part of my thinking is that there's no reason that they should only endorse *one;*  as in Approval Voting, there's no reason to *not* support their favorite, and you can choose to support the Lesser Evil, too, if you wish.
				
				> What does Gary Johnson know about all the other tasks a President must do in 2012?
				
				Respectfully, you're asking what the candidate that had ‚â•75% ballot access, that had *the most* had experience as an Executive, by *decades*  ...knows about being an Executive.
				
				* Romney was always a legislator, which is a different skill set
				* Obama at that point had 4 years of executive experience, and his previous experience (as a legislator, activist, etc) left him (at that point) as one of the least effective presidents since some time in the 1970s (at least).  
				 * G.W. Bush?  Two term Governor, and effective
				 * Clinton?  Two term Governor, and effective
				 * G.H.W. Bush?  Former CIA official... not necessarily an executive experience, and probably the least effective from 1980-2008
				 * Reagan? Two term Governor, and effective  
				((What you think of *how* they used their skills is a different question from whether they could/did do so effectively)^)
				* Johnson had 8 years of Gubernatorial experience (government executive) and something like 20 years of private sector executive experience.
				* Jill Stein was a doctor, with no executive experience
				
				> Gary Johnson might be more useful being elected to the Congress [...] and not the presidency
				
				Precisely backwards; the skill set that lends one to being a good Executive is different from that which makes one a good Legislator, and vice versa.
				
				> The voters have as many votes as there are seats to elect in their canton [...] They could even vote more than once for a single candidate
				
				Ah, an allocative voting method.
				
				> Ireland
				
				I'm familiar; lived there for a bit.
				
				> a ceremonial president
				
				Not *purely* ceremonial; one of the powers of An Uachtar√°n is that to immediately refer a new law to their supreme court for judgement on its Constitutionality.  I don't know how often that actually happens, but it is a meaningfully-more-than-ceremonial power that they have.

					A president in this case has a lot of other kinds of constituencies I feel are separate from governors, like the way the president has to work with foreign governments and the military for one. Presidents by definition cannot have more than ten years of experience of being president as per the term limit amendment (there is a way to get 10 if you serve less than half of the term and get elected for two terms in your own right). Johnson had New Mexico, which isn't nothing, but is 1% the population the president has to govern. Even the most populous state is an eighth of the total population.
					
					Ceremonial wasn't meant to mean irrelevant, but non executive would be a more accurate description of their powers. Having always lived in a country with a monarch, right now King Charles, it is easy for me to keep these roles separate. 
					
					But Ireland's president is even less powerful than many like Austria and Italy's presidents who do have some genuine authority and legitimacy to even pick and choose cabinets at times, like when the current Austrian president sacked the chancellor after a no confidence vote and replaced him with a technocratic government for half a year pending new elections and coalition negotiations, and Italy's Mattarella has done similar things. Ireland's president has no such authority. 
					
					Approval voting would not be a bad way to choose a president, but given the kind of role a president plays, I prefer something of the kind where the president will be supported over opponents by at least half the votes. Don't read that definition into technical mathematical definitions, I know that condorcet definitions and other issues will make that weird, but in the final round of the presidential election, a majority of voters should have said We support you and not any other option on the ballot paper. It is necessary to have political legitimacy to do things like veto the directives of Congress, to constrain the Congress as to who may be appointed to public office including the judiciary with the powers it has over law, to direct the use of the UNSC veto, to recognize other countries via ambassadors and to revoke them, to refuse to leave office unless two thirds of the Senate convict them on motion of the House of Representatives, and similar.
					
					The electoral system changing itself would inherently change the game and who runs. People who might never try before would otherwise. Gary Johnson acted a lot like a protest vote, as did Steins. If they were not contributing to a spoiler effect, then people start to dig into their policies and ideas, and I think a lot of Americans would be very worried about things like the NATO skepticism of Steins and Johnson's views on which departments to delete. Suddenly a lot of those other parties might get very competitive and push out many people who run them today, as might districts and senate states today that would otherwise be unthinkable to touch, same in local governments and state governments as well and reorient a lot of plans and ways of working.
					
					What happens to the de facto use of the veto power for instance when a president is unlikely to have a majority of the legislators in either house support them but they also might vary between having enough votes to prevent an override alone to not having enough votes to countermand them under any circumstances, but it is highly unlikely that their strongest opponents have such a supermajority for themselves and it becomes up to blocs of swing legislators in each house? What happens to electing speakers and presidents pro tempore, both in states and the federal government, committee chairs and committee members, etc, when it becomes like this and these coalitions get formed? Appointing major officials when a president likely has neither a concerted bloc to support them but also not one that will categorically oppose them? That is hard to decide really.

						> A president in this case has a lot of other kinds of constituencies I feel are separate from governors
						
						Two things here.
						
						First, you're missing the forest for the trees; I'm not talking about the presidency, but about *executives,* which is about having the skills and mindset to optimally execute the role.
						
						Second, even the discussion of executive vs legislator skill sets is a red herring; my assertion is that there should be endorsements, plural, based on how well they align with the non-profit's goals
						
						> the way the president has to work with [...] the military for one
						
						1. Governors are in control of the National Guard, and State Guard (do most states have that, or is it just mine)
						2. The president rarely *actually* interacts with them to any meaningful degree
						
						> Presidents by definition cannot have more than ten years of experience
						
						...again, the question was ***executive*** experience, not *presidential* experience.
						
						Also, I'm talking about "at election," which means that *presidential* experience would be limited to (a day less than) 6 years, not 10.
						
						> Johnson had New Mexico
						
						8 years in NM ***and*** 20+ years as a private sector executive
						
						> I prefer something of the kind where the president will be supported over opponents by at least half the votes
						
						So have a minimum threshold, then, because such support is actually *less* likely with mutually-exclusive ballot types.  Oh, sure, IRV and Bucklin purport to create true majorities, but if those majorities must be *created,* they are scarcely more valid than those of Single Mark systems (given that Single Mark is literally equivalent to "Rank one")
						
						> We support you and not any other option on the ballot paper.
						
						The first part I agree with, the latter not so much.  
						
						There is literally no way to achieve that without either Single Mark *or* removal of candidates from consideration.  Both are artificial restrictions: single mark denies voters the chance to indicate support for other candidates, even if they *do* actively support them (see: Favorite Betrayal), while elimination paradigms, such as in IRV, is clearly, if not explicitly, intended to allow "honest/expressive" rankings because the method will effectively engage in Favorite Betrayal *for* the voter (when their favorite is an Also Ran)... but as we have seen from the Condorcet Failures, that doesn't actually result in the elections of candidates that are widely supported (both Burlington and AK 2022-08 elected the winner *without* a true majority of valid ballots, with 48.0% and 48.4%, respectively).
						
						Besides, if a voter supports e.g. a Democrat, why should the fact that they *also* support a Green matter?  If they, along with a true majority of voters, *actually support* the Democrat, does it really matter if some of them support the Green, or Libertarian, or [Insert Party Here] slightly more?
						
						Why? 
						
						> Gary Johnson acted a lot like a protest vote
						
						Objection, assumes facts not in evidence.  
						
						Some may have been, certainly... but how many were honest expressions of preference?  How do you know the percentages?
						
						Besides, given the overwhelming prevalence of Favorite Betrayal, given the fact that [roughly half of Biden supporters aren't voting for Biden because they *support* him, but because they *oppose* Trump and his policies.](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-voters-say-more-motivated-stop-trump-than-support-president-reutersipsos-2023-11-15/) That's a 5:4 margin of "oppose opposition" over "support candidate" among Biden voters, while Trump voters are roughly 1:1.
						
						Think about that: applied to the 2020 election, that means that roughly 70.1M votes total *for the duopoly candidates* weren't votes of *Support*.   Compare that to the 74.2M votes that Trump won total. 
						
						> If they were not contributing to a spoiler effect
						
						That they were is a hard argument to support; of the 56 races (50+DC+NE1+NE2+NE3+ME1+ME2) only *four* had less than a true majority for the winner (GA,WI,AZ,NC), and, as in FL2000, there's a solid argument that those who voted for minor parties would not have voted for the Duopoly, even if their minor party candidate weren't on the ballot (I personally have a friend who explicitly doesn't bother voting in a race where he doesn't like any of the candidates. In effect, that means he doesn't vote in the majority of General Election races, if he votes in the General at all).
						
						
						> Suddenly a lot of those other parties might get very competitive and push out many people who run them today,
						
						Certainly you're not ignorant of the efforts across the country to deny minor parties ballot access (either outright, or *as* a party)
						
						--
						Also, as to appointments, Vetoes, etc: Approval (and Score) seeking broader support means that any such elected candidate is more likely to make appointments, issue vetoes, that have broader support than those elected by methods with narrower support.

							Do you genuinely believe that even close to a majority of Americans would have wanted Johnson to be president? That is a very hard sell to me. Voting for someone like that in a race you know full well he is not going to win is hard to spin to me as anything but a demonstration and a political message. Perhaps sincere alignment with his views but also that you understand that he won't be nearly enough to win.
							
							I prefer this single mark thing for a couple of other reasons. Main one is precedent, we have far more precedent for this kind of system, especially in the form of runoff elections, than we do with essentially any other voting system. Australia uses IRV, Ireland for their president, which is something I guess but not much for real executive presidents. Almost everywhere in the world, the head of state of an executive presidential republic is elected with a single mark system, most of them having a runoff, typically if nobody has a majority on round one. A few have odd rules like Bolivia where 40% and 10% lead is enough or Argentina where 45% or 40% with a 10% lead on the runner up is enough. 
							
							This gives us much more to compare yourself against and to know what kind of patterns to expect. Interestingly, there was a proposed amendment to the constitution back after a weird race back in the Nixon era to change to a 40% system where if you got that many votes you won in a direct election, else go to a runoff. 
							
							It can also be useful for organizing political blocs to, encouraging some degree of electoral alliances, which in a multi party system can be quite useful to encourage voting not merely just for the candidate themselves based on a CV but a platform of pledges on policy and some means of getting that implemented through support in Congress and who can defend the president against being completely isolated and easy to undermine through impeachment, refusing to confirm their nominees systematically and veto overrides being done out of jealousy and not genuine belief in the wisdom of doing it. It isn't so usual for Americans to think of presidents like this but it becomes very important in multi party systems.

								Under a voting method that didn't interpret support as mutually exclusive (Approval, Score, Majority Judgement), he might have.  It's a stretch, but it's definitely possible, even with only the 3.28% indicating he's their favorite.  Let's consider majority judgement &amp; Score (approximate averages, bolding the median vote for each candidate):
								
								--|Clinton|Johnson|Stein|Trump
								-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
								48.18% C|5|**3**|3|0|4|

								Median|C+S+***J***|J+***C***|S+C+***T***|***C+S***
								Average|2.50|**3.04**|1.98|2.37
								
								Is that optimistic for Johnson?  Of course.  
								
								Is it *possible,* given how much people hated Clinton and Trump? I have a hard time believing that it's *not* possible.

									Precedent is not merely tradition, this is the way that the vast majority of countries have elected presidents since the 1990s. Precedent also gives us a huge wealth of knowledge from which to be able to judge trends, to make sensible predictions, to know how to organize political systems in general and to make them work coherently. Without precedent, we would have little knowledge about what unexpected side effects might arise, especially given that rules pertaining to the election of a head of state are almost always constitutional rules and so are inherently hard to change. 
									
									We should know as much as we can about a system so as to make it likely that we don't overlook effects that we should have known about. 
									
									As for single mark, there are plenty of non first past the post systems based on that. Open list proportional representation usually is single mark, closed list essentially always is, mixed member proportional can be single mark, and a two round system is merely having a second election some period of time later, with the second ballot and majority to win criteria a guarantee for people so as not to have the same incentive as plurality alone. 
									
									Single non transferable vote is also single mark, like in Vanuatu and some elections in Japan. 
									
									Proportional representation is most famous in parliamentary systems where the president often doesn't matter too much, and sometimes is not even elected by the public (even with an electoral college) anyway like in Germany, so they focus on the legislature there and often less so the president but the person chosen for a head of state might well be important in some systems like America or Brazil or Chile and so they must be elected taking into account the multi party system and a two round system is a way of making sure that one person will have the votes from a majority of those who vote. Not a guarantee, but it is easy to operate. 
									
									Endorsing some people over others is also not always a process that others will be privy to as to their reasoning. For example, I would be very skeptical of a Johnson presidency. He might have right ideas on certain aspects but his ability to carry them out with legislative support might be near zero but Obama at least actually had a Senate majority and the House Democrats in 2012 actually had more votes than the Republicans in that election, and ergo could defend the administration policies. Democracy is not merely about the ballots themselves but on the structure that supports it and you can hollow out a lot of the process if you focus too much on any one aspect. Johnson to me would be much more useful as a legislator, one voice among many where you can agree with on some points and not others more easily, depend on his vote as a Representative or Senator when you need it. I would not trust him as president.

	Yes, but I wouldn't advise it. Parties (especially in jurisdictions with stronger party institutions) are useful labels for voters to get an idea of what candidates stand for.  And ultimately politics is a team sport - you need to form alliances to pass legislation. Voters deserve to know the shape of those alliances in advance of voting.

			Yep, this is my issue as well, and I live in WA state, where we get to vote by mail and are given TONS of information about each candidate compared to what most other states get (i.e. basically nothing). Nonpartisan elections create a massive time sink for voters and if you don't have enough free time to research candidates it can mean you mistakenly vote for someone you don't actually agree with or you just don't vote at all.
			
			Nonpartisan elections are a bad attempt to solve the two-party issue without actually tackling the root cause (vote splitting), while also taking away one of the most useful tools voters with limited free time have to help them make a decision: information.

	I think it's possible, but imo undesirable (probably many don't agree with that).

	I live in WA. My ballot comes in the mail weeks before the election date and I get a booklet with all candidates, their "pitch", links to websites, endorsements, etc., and even then I can find it hard to know who to vote for because they don't always list policy proposals and stay pretty vague. Many candidates don't have websites, for example, or the website only has a few bullet points. So instead, I have to read/watch a lot of interview articles or debate videos online. That takes time, and I have it easy. If you live in other states you might not even know who's running until you enter the booth on election day.

	If we had partisan elections for all elections (state level is mostly partisan) then I could look at their stances and party affiliation to get a decent enough idea of what they stand for and will try to implement, especially if the parties can kick them out if they vote against the platform. Parties provide a good way for voters without a ton of free time to know who they can vote for just by comparing party platforms. That membership/categorization model is very useful for real people who have lives to live and don't pay attention to politics as much as I have the privilege of doing.

	US founding fathers did not necessarily want or plan for political parties, but it seems to happen naturally, especially between "haves" vs "have-nots".

	And then FPTP makes it nearly impossible for moderate/middle candidates to succeed, causing divisions to grow and become extreme. People in the middle get attacked by extremists from both sides.

	To reduce party influence it might take a real psychological change in a whole country... and a better voting method that doesn't punish moderates. Could a better voting method do most of the work? I wonder.

Scotland uses STV for local elections and it has helped smash many 1 party fiefdoms but some do still remain as support for one party is strong enough, it got rid of the undeserved majorities and supermajorities though.
		
		If people keep voting the same way then a different voting system might not help.  It's going to be like addiction, you need the addict to want to change as well.
		
		If the 2 parties wave divisive issues around where most fall on one side or the other then that could make the vote converge on the 2 main parties.  At the same time if there genuinely is a moderate segment then a better voting system should reflect that.

		Depending on the topic, direct democracy can be pretty bad due to poor voter education. I know lots of people where I live now love initiatives and removing them would be an immediate political nonstarter. Having grown up in Texas, a place without initiatives, and seeing what kind of bottom-of-the-barrel initiatives people try to get off the ground here, I'm not totally convinced having them is a net good most of the time.
		
		Initiatives related to taxes are almost always a problem - you are asking voters to decide to cut taxes, which always sounds nice, without them also saying what to cut. It's a blunt tool for such a decision with not enough nuance to make the right choice.
		
		One place where I do think initiatives are good is decisions that representatives may avoid because it could hurt their prospects/careers, e.g. voting reform by initiative makes a lot of sense.

	Politicians will always sort into like-minded groups, but you could greatly reduce their influence with a constitutional amendment like:

	 "Political party affiliation shall not be listed on the ballot, nor shall it be used as a criteria in a candidate's qualification for ballot access."

	I'm not sure that would be better than having a multi party system, but I think it would be much better than a two party system.

	Are political parties necessary to function?  No.

	Is it possible to have a democracy without *officially recognized* political parties?  Yes.

	Is it possible to prevent (de facto) political parties from forming?  Not without completely obliterating Freedom of Association in the political sphere; just as Sanders and King are independents, they *consistently* vote with the Democrats rather than Republicans, because that's closer to their personal ideologies.

	For another example of this, back in the dawn of the United States, there were no *official* parties (indeed, in his Farwell Address, our first president, George Washington specifically warned against factionalism [partisanship]), but they existed even before the constitution was ratified, with people such as Washington, John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, etc being "Federalists" (for a stronger central government) and others like James Maddison and Thomas Jefferson being "Anit-Federalists" (preferring as weak a federal government as possible that still served the component states)

	> They could have an ideology or be linked to political alliances, but not be a member of a political party themselves

	Largely a distinction without a difference.

	> This wouldnt work probably under PR or something similar because those inherently require voting for parties

	They don't, actually.  Some methods do, certainly, but not all;  The only methods that require parties are those involving party lists (Open/Closed Party List, MMP, D'Hondt/Jefferson, etc) or otherwise assign seats according to Party Affiliation (e.g. Dual Member Proportional)

	On the other side of the coin, there are a few proportional/semi-proportional methods that can be trivially run without any acknowledgement of political party:

	* Proportional Approval Voting (Thiele's Method) was used in Sweden around the turn of the 20th Century, and didn't actually reference parties in the tabulation thereof.  

	 * Extensions &amp; modifications there of, such as Reweighted Range Voting and Phragm√©n's method, would likewise work.  

	* STV, and it descendants (Schulze-STV, Apportioned Score/Apportioned Approval/Apportioned Majority Judgement, etc) can all be run without any acknowledgement of parties

	  * For example, Ireland's D√°il elections use STV, and while there are party labels on the ballot, they have no mechanical/algorithmic influence on the results; if someone wanted to vote (e.g.) Sinn Fein A>Fine Gael>Fianna Fail>Aontu>Sinn Fein B, they could, and the fact that their top ranked candidate and bottom ranked candidate both happen to belong to the same party would mean absolutely nothing when it came to determining who was seated

	> there isn't a party that reflects all its voters' beliefs.

	There never will be, nor a *candidate* that does so.

	In fact, the ideological deviation *within* parties is such that I strongly question the desirability of Party-Based Proportionality; while parties make for a decently cohesive ideological platform, you start getting into approximations of approximations:

	1. Any election can only ever be an approximation of the electorate's aggregate beliefs for various reasons:

	 * voters rarely do a good job of informing themselves of the actions &amp; true beliefs of those they vote for

	 * humans aren't always perfect at recognizing even their own actual beliefs

	 * the necessity for a finite, manageable number of seats necessarily results in some degree of imprecision; if you have S seats per district-election, and N Blocs within that district, you can end up with a representation error of up to (100%\*N)/(2S) (so, with a 10 seat district and 5 parties, you could have representation error of up to 25%)

	* As you observed, the match between Voter ideology and candidate/party ideology is going to be an imperfect approximation at best.

	* While *party* ideology may correspond to a specific point within a multidimensional ideological space, the representatives *of* that party will not be *at* that point.

	 * Just as voters aren't well reflected in the ideology doesn't have a precise mapping between their ideology and that of a party, a *party candidate* won't be perfectly aligned with their party ideology, either.

	So, while #1 and #2  are largely unavoidable, not referencing parties cuts down on the misrepresentation of #3.

	If the goal of Proportional Representation is to have the ideological barycenter of the elected body [as closely as possible reflect that of the electorate], I understand the benefit of Parties, but I also recognize [~~that without~~ the poor ideological reflection that parties represent, [and] it is of paramount importance that each seat reflects the portion of the electorate that they represent as accurately as possible, however that is achieved.  

	...which is why finding a good voting method is so important.

	...and the additional imprecision of referencing things *by party* runs counter to that, IMO.

	> Parties regularly collapse or break down as well, and the political landscape is very fragmented.

	Honestly, that's probably for the best, because the more fragmented the political landscape is, the more accurately the voters' choices of parties should reflect them.  Also, parties rising and falling *theoretically* should reflect the failing parties having deviated too far from the will of the voters at that point in time, and the rising ones doing better.

	> In an independent voting system, politicians wouldn't be tied to party discipline and could have a different opinion on every issue. The median voter would be better represented and politics would be less polarized and divisive.

	This is the reason I'm such a fan of Score based methods (including the simplified version, Approval), and the multi-seat extensions thereof: pure cardinal methods trend towards representing the central few standard deviations.

	Condorcet Methods, being a ranked attempt to achieve the same goal, are also tolerable.

	> As for how the government would be elected, that could happen through a presidential system with a popular vote

	Or, if you still wanted a more parliamentary system, you could still allow the representatives/MPs/MLAs to vote on who they want as Prime Minister/Premier, but if they weren't subject to a Party Whip, they could be more discerning about how their vote would fall.

	Political parties are not necessary. In my opinion parties are a result of election mechanics and the need for mass marketing and mass advertising and aggregation of resources in order to campaign. 

	In small scale democracy practiced in cooperatives and small town hall democracy, we don't see strong parties. Many unions for example are run as one party regimes. 

	With less people there is less need for mass media advertising and fundraising and marketing, and therefore less need of parties. 

	A no party democracy could possibly be scaled up to the nation using something called "sortition" where representation is chosen by lottery rather than election. Similarly to the claims I make above, in lottery based representation there is no need for campaigning and fundraising and mass concentration of resources in order for you to get represented. You are automatically represented using the power of statistics and random sampling. 

	Therefore there would be far less need to form permanent parties to perform the tasks of fundraising and resource concentration and strategic coordination to win elections. Moreover the principle of rotation, where participants step down to cycle in new participants, ensures that permanent power structures are difficult to create.

If people can prganize to pool together rescources for advertising, phone banking and such to improve the odds of a candidate they llike winning, then there is still an inventive to political parties. If you have a range voting system like star or score and then additionally reatrict the means of financing camaigns to only using public funding then you would eliminate the need for parties.

			I mean, at this point you're raising the question of whether or not a party-free system is even desirable. Our whole model of democracy was built on the assumption of people being, fundamentally, individuals who make decisions as individuals and judge people solely as individuals, when the reality of human nature is our tendency to form communities. The Founders' vision for how their republic would work was never realistic and it's a bit astounding that they thought it would given that they already had some experience with democratic systems.
			
			The OP did say that candidates could "have an ideology or be linked to political alliances, but not be a member of a political party themselves", so it wouldn't necessarily go against the spirit of the question for an "alliance" to form around a candidate, but in order for there to be a fixed party that puts all its weight behind a single candidate in a system that doesn't penalize splitting votes between many candidates with similar policies, it would effectively have to act like a mob (as in an organized crime ring) to chase away alternatives. As it stands primary elections allow candidates to be largely judged as individuals even if there are particular audiences that coalesce around them.

	No party labels can work. They seem to be the exception.  In the UK you see a bunch of independents at the local level but they tend to be in the lower population councils and islands where retail politics are feasible and or the main parties don't bother to invest as much in.  In some of them they are actually the majority.

	At the higher level it has been enforced for heads of states who have to give up their party label sometimes to foster a united tone.

	I think one of the STV using local jurisdictions in the US relies more on issues rather than party labels.  Candidates adopt major and minor issues, voters vote accordingly with 1st preferences according to their interests and further preferences for other candidates who adopt their interests as minors.

	That way different coalitions can form on each issue.

	I do not think that this would work at the the national level of the US.  It could help. It would require a sea change to foster this.  It would be awesome if it did work.  I think for the US, if you could return to the previous informal 4 party system where both parties had 2 wings that would vote for and against big issues that would be an immense achievement. Even looking back to under the early years of Obama, on minor issues there were GOP senators crossing the aisle to vote.  Now things have polarized to hell.

	I think you might overestimate the opposing entrenched forces that will counteract your best intentions.

	Such a system requires a very on the ball highly educated electorate or one where they trust elites to corral their votes for it to work in a sizeable country.  If there are strong political fault lines then success will be more limited.

	Municipal level governments don't have party affiliations.

	Err... At least they don't where I'm from (Ontario/Canada). Do they in USA? Or other countries?

	On most days I think we'd be better off without political parties.

		Some lower level US elections are non partisan, some have switched to partisan though.

	Are you suggesting the the government prohibit people from exercising their freedom of association? 

	The founders didn't have any political parties. They worried about the concept, but it only took two election cycles before nature ran it's course and people grouped together on one side or another for particular issues. 

	Now, if you want to talk about the importance of keeping government out of parties and parties out of government, that's a conversation worth having.

	From what little I know of the Netherland‚Äôs government structure - you guys have done it pretty well, especially when graded on a curve of the rest of the world.

	Fully proportional systems can be quite messy; but you‚Äôre never going to be able to vote for a politician or party that matches your views completely. I suspect that asking for a democratic political system without parties is like asking for an industry without brands. Sure, it can be done, but the branding allows consumers to make a decision directionally on what they think is better without having to over-analyze every aspect of their purchase.
