	I haven't read it, but I've seen _Doing Good Better_ by Will McAskill referenced often as an intro. He also has a book on longtermism called _What We Owe The Future_

		I would recommend *The Precipice*, by Toby Ord over WWOTF.
		
		Singer's *The Life You Can Save* is also good.

	My recommendation would be Doing Good Better by William McAskill. Another alternative could be The Most Good You Can Do by Peter Singer.

	*Doing Good Better* by Will McAskill is the best place to start for effective altruism in general, and *The Precipice* by Toby Ord is the best place to start for the existential risk side of things. If you sign up for the 80,000 Hours newsletter, they will send you a free copy of an EA book of your choice- and you can immediately unsubscribe if you just want the free book: [https://80000hours.org/newsletter/](https://80000hours.org/newsletter/)

	Perhaps also consider *Effective Altruism: How Can We Best Help Others?* by Magnus Vinding.
