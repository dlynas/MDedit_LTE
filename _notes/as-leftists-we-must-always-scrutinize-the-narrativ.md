## As leftists we must always scrutinize the narratives and histories handed to us about communism by the world historical enemy of communism â€” the United States. The revolutionary theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism has been used countless times to throw off colonial hegemons, to liberate the oppressed, and to raise life expectancy and literacy rates exponentially in countries like China and the Soviet Union. Check out our conversation with Breht O'Shea of Revolutionary Left Radio ðŸŽ§

	"The one thing you have to keep in mind whenever you're hearing, passively absorbing certain
	information about certain communist figures in particular, you should really, especially
	if you just want to be intellectually honest, or if you want to be ideologically coherent,
	step away from that propaganda, investigate yourself.
	You will never, ever get handed the reality about any communist movement or any communist
	figure from the world historical enemy of communism, right, the United States of America
	and the imperial block that it leads.
	So you should at very least be skeptical.
	And a lot of people who just, you know, will jump out of the woodwork to call Mao a psychopath
	or a genocide or not only are they passively absorbing propaganda that they're then regurgitating
	as if it's the conclusions they came to.
	But I also think there's plenty of orientalism here.
