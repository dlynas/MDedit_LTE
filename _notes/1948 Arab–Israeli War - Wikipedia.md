The civil war became a war of separate states with the [Israeli Declaration of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Declaration_of_Independence "Israeli Declaration of Independence") on 14 May 1948, the [end of the British Mandate for Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_the_British_Mandate_for_Palestine "End of the British Mandate for Palestine") at midnight, and the entry of a [military coalition of Arab states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League "Arab League") into the territory of [Mandatory Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine "Mandatory Palestine") the following morning. The war formally ended with the [1949 Armistice Agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1949_Armistice_Agreements "1949 Armistice Agreements") which established the [Green Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Line_(Israel) "Green Line (Israel)").

Since the 1917 [Balfour Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration "Balfour Declaration") and the 1920 creation of the [British Mandate of Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine "Mandatory Palestine"), and in the context of [Zionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism "Zionism") and the [mass migration of European Jews to Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah "Aliyah"), there had been [tension and conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercommunal_conflict_in_Mandatory_Palestine "Intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine") between Arabs, Jews, and the British. British policies dissatisfied both Arabs and Jews. Arab opposition developed into the [1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936%E2%80%931939_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine "1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine"), while the Jewish opposition developed into the 1944–1947 [Jewish insurgency in Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_insurgency_in_Palestine "Jewish insurgency in Palestine").

The [civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947%E2%80%931948_civil_war_in_Mandatory_Palestine "1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine") began the day after the adoption of the [United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine "United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine") on 29 November 1947 – which planned to divide the territory into an Arab state, a Jewish state, and the [Special International Regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_separatum_(Jerusalem) "Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)") encompassing the cities of [Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem "Jerusalem") and [Bethlehem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem "Bethlehem"). At the end of a [series of offensives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_Dalet "Plan Dalet") that began April 1948, in which Zionist forces had conquered cities and territories in Mandatory Palestine in preparation for the establishment of a Jewish state, Zionist leaders announced the [Israeli Declaration of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Declaration_of_Independence "Israeli Declaration of Independence") on 14 May 1948.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-20">[16]</a></sup> The following morning, after the termination of the British Mandate, Egypt, Transjordan, [Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Republic_(1946%E2%80%9363) "Syrian Republic (1946–63)"), and expeditionary forces from Iraq entered Palestine.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-21">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-22">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-23">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-24">[20]</a></sup> The invading forces took control of the Arab areas and attacked Israeli forces and several Jewish settlements.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-25">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-morris2008p236_26-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-morris2008p236-26">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-27">[23]</a></sup> The 10 months of fighting took place mostly on the territory of the British Mandate and in the [Sinai Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinai_Peninsula "Sinai Peninsula") and [southern Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon "Southern Lebanon"), interrupted by several truce periods.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-28">[24]</a></sup>

As a result of the war, the State of Israel controlled the area that the UN had proposed for the Jewish state, as well as almost 60% of the area proposed for the Arab state,<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-29">[25]</a></sup> including the [Jaffa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa "Jaffa"), [Lydda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lod "Lod") and [Ramle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramle "Ramle") area, [Upper Galilee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Galilee "Upper Galilee"), some parts of the [Negev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negev "Negev") and a wide strip along the [Tel Aviv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv "Tel Aviv")–[Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem "Jerusalem") road. Israel also took control of [West Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Jerusalem "West Jerusalem"), which was meant to be part of an international zone for Jerusalem and its environs. Transjordan took control of [East Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Jerusalem "East Jerusalem") and what became known as the [West Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank "West Bank"), [annexing it the following year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordanian_annexation_of_the_West_Bank "Jordanian annexation of the West Bank"). The territory which became the [Gaza Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip") was [occupied by Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Gaza_Strip_by_Egypt "Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt").

Over [700,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion_and_flight "1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight") from their homes in the area that became Israel, marking the beginning of the [Palestinian refugee problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugee_problem "Palestinian refugee problem"),<sup id="cite_ref-refugees_30-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-refugees-30">[26]</a></sup> in what they refer to as the [Nakba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba "Nakba") ([Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic") for "the catastrophe").

## Background

A proposed separation of Palestine

On 29 November 1947, the [United Nations General Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly "United Nations General Assembly") adopted a resolution recommending the adoption and implementation of a plan to partition the British Mandate of Palestine into two states, one Arab and one Jewish, and the City of Jerusalem.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-34">[30]</a></sup>

The [General Assembly resolution on Partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine "United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine") was greeted with overwhelming joy in Jewish communities and widespread outrage in the Arab world. In Palestine, violence erupted almost immediately, feeding into a spiral of reprisals and counter-reprisals. The British refrained from intervening as tensions boiled over into a low-level conflict that quickly escalated into a [full-scale civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947%E2%80%9348_Civil_War_in_Mandatory_Palestine "1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine").<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-35">[31]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-36">[32]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-37">[33]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Morris48_38-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Morris48-38">[34]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Efraïm_Karsh_2002_p.30_39-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Efra%C3%AFm_Karsh_2002_p.30-39">[35]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Benny_Morris_2003_p.101_40-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Benny_Morris_2003_p.101-40">[36]</a></sup>

From January onwards, operations became increasingly militarised, with the intervention of a number of [Arab Liberation Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Liberation_Army "Arab Liberation Army") regiments inside Palestine, each active in a variety of distinct sectors around the different coastal towns. They consolidated their presence in [Galilee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilee "Galilee") and [Samaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaria "Samaria").<sup id="cite_ref-Yoav_Gelber_2006_pp.51-56_41-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Yoav_Gelber_2006_pp.51-56-41">[37]</a></sup> [Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd_al-Qadir_al-Husayni "Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni") came from Egypt with several hundred men of the [Army of the Holy War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_the_Holy_War "Army of the Holy War"). Having recruited a few thousand volunteers, al-Husayni organised the blockade of the 100,000 Jewish residents of Jerusalem.<sup id="cite_ref-Larry_Collins_1971_p.7_42-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Larry_Collins_1971_p.7-42">[38]</a></sup>

To counter this, the [Yishuv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yishuv "Yishuv") authorities tried to supply the city with convoys of up to 100 armoured vehicles, but the operation became more and more impractical as the number of casualties in the relief convoys surged. By March, Al-Hussayni's tactic had paid off. Almost all of [Haganah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah "Haganah")'s armoured vehicles had been destroyed, the blockade was in full operation, and hundreds of Haganah members who had tried to bring supplies into the city were killed.<sup id="cite_ref-Benny_Morris_2003_p.163_43-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Benny_Morris_2003_p.163-43">[39]</a></sup> The situation for those who dwelt in the Jewish settlements in the highly isolated [Negev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negev "Negev") and north of Galilee was even more critical.

While the Jewish population had received strict orders requiring them to hold their ground everywhere at all costs,<sup id="cite_ref-Larry_Collins_1971_p.163_44-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Larry_Collins_1971_p.163-44">[40]</a></sup> the Arab population was more affected by the general conditions of insecurity to which the country was exposed. Up to 100,000 Arabs, from the urban upper and middle classes in Haifa, Jaffa and Jerusalem, or Jewish-dominated areas, evacuated abroad or to Arab centres eastwards.<sup id="cite_ref-Benny_Morris_2003_p.67_45-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Benny_Morris_2003_p.67-45">[41]</a></sup>

This situation caused the United States to withdraw its support for the Partition Plan, encouraging the [Arab League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League "Arab League") to believe that the Palestinian Arabs, reinforced by the Arab Liberation Army, could put an end to the plan. However, the British decided on 7 February 1948 to support the annexation of the Arab part of Palestine by Transjordan.<sup id="cite_ref-Henry_Laurens_2005_p.83_46-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Henry_Laurens_2005_p.83-46">[42]</a></sup>

Although doubt took hold among Yishuv supporters, their apparent defeats were due more to their wait-and-see policy than to weakness.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (July 2021)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> [David Ben-Gurion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ben-Gurion "David Ben-Gurion") reorganised Haganah and made conscription obligatory. Every Jewish man and woman in the country had to receive military training. Thanks to funds raised by [Golda Meir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golda_Meir "Golda Meir") from sympathisers in the United States, and [Stalin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin") decision to support the [Zionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism "Zionism") cause, the Jewish representatives of Palestine were able to sign very important armament contracts in the East. Other Haganah agents recovered stockpiles from the Second World War, which helped improve the army's equipment and logistics. [Operation Balak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Balak "Operation Balak") allowed arms and other equipment to be transported for the first time by the end of March.<sup id="cite_ref-Arnold_Krammer_1974_p.89_47-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Arnold_Krammer_1974_p.89-47">[43]</a></sup>

Ben-Gurion invested [Yigael Yadin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yigael_Yadin "Yigael Yadin") with the responsibility to come up with a plan of offence whose timing was related to the foreseeable evacuation of British forces. This strategy, called [Plan Dalet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_Dalet "Plan Dalet"), was readied by March and implemented towards the end of April.<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-48">[44]</a></sup> A separate plan, [Operation Nachshon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Nachshon "Operation Nachshon"), was devised to lift the [siege of Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(1948) "Siege of Jerusalem (1948)").<sup id="cite_ref-morris2008p116_49-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-morris2008p116-49">[45]</a></sup> 1500 men from Haganah's Givati brigade and [Palmach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmach "Palmach")'s Harel brigade conducted sorties to free up the route to the city between 5 and 20 April. Both sides acted offensively in defiance of the Partition Plan, which foresaw Jerusalem as a _[corpus separatum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_separatum_(Jerusalem) "Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)")_, under neither Jewish nor Arab jurisdiction. The Arabs did not accept the Plan, while the Jews were determined to oppose the internationalisation of the city, and secure it as part of the Jewish state.<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-50">[46]</a></sup>

The operation was successful, and enough foodstuffs to last two months were trucked into Jerusalem for distribution to the Jewish population.<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-51">[47]</a></sup> The success of the operation was assisted by the death of al-Husayni in combat. During this time, and independently of Haganah or the framework of Plan Dalet, irregular fighters from [Irgun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irgun "Irgun") and [Lehi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehi_(group) "Lehi (group)") formations massacred a substantial number of Arabs at [Deir Yassin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_Yassin_massacre "Deir Yassin massacre"), an event that, though publicly deplored and criticised by the principal Jewish authorities, had a deep impact on the morale of the Arab population and contributed to generate the [exodus of the Arab population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_exodus "1948 Palestinian exodus").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (May 2021)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

At the same time, the Arab Liberation Army was roundly defeated at [Mishmar HaEmek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishmar_HaEmek "Mishmar HaEmek") in its first large-scale operation,<sup id="cite_ref-Benny_Morris_2003_pp.242-243_52-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Benny_Morris_2003_pp.242-243-52">[48]</a></sup> coinciding with the loss of their [Druze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druze "Druze") allies through defection.<sup id="cite_ref-Benny_Morris_2003_p.242_53-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Benny_Morris_2003_p.242-53">[49]</a></sup>

Within the framework of the establishment of Jewish territorial continuity foreseen by Plan Dalet, the Haganah, Palmach and Irgun forces intended to conquer mixed zones. The Palestinian Arab society was shaken. [Tiberias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberias "Tiberias"), [Haifa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa "Haifa"), [Safed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safed "Safed"), [Beisan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beisan "Beisan"), [Jaffa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa "Jaffa") and [Acre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre_(city) "Acre (city)") fell, resulting in the flight of more than 250,000 Palestinian Arabs.<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-54">[50]</a></sup>

The British had essentially withdrawn their troops. This pushed the leaders of the neighbouring Arab states to intervene, but they were not fully prepared, and could not assemble sufficient forces to turn the tide. The majority of Palestinian Arab hopes lay with the [Arab Legion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Legion "Arab Legion") of Transjordan's monarch, King Abdullah I, but he had no intention of creating a Palestinian Arab-run state, since he hoped to annex as much of the territory of the [British Mandate for Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine "Mandatory Palestine") as he could. He was playing a double game, being just as much in contact with the Jewish authorities as with the Arab League.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (May 2021)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

In preparation for the offensive, Haganah successfully launched Operations [Yiftah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Yiftah "Operation Yiftah")<sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-55">[51]</a></sup> and Ben-'Ami<sup id="cite_ref-Benny_Morris_2003_pp.252_56-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Benny_Morris_2003_pp.252-56">[52]</a></sup> to secure the Jewish settlements of [Galilee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilee "Galilee"), and [Operation Kilshon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Kilshon "Operation Kilshon"), which created a united front around Jerusalem. The inconclusive meeting between [Golda Meir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golda_Meir "Golda Meir") and Abdullah I, followed by the [Kfar Etzion massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kfar_Etzion_massacre "Kfar Etzion massacre") on 13 May by the Arab Legion led to predictions that the battle for Jerusalem would be merciless.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

On 14 May 1948, [David Ben-Gurion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ben-Gurion "David Ben-Gurion") declared the establishment of the [State of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Israel "State of Israel") and the [1948 Palestine war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestine_war "1948 Palestine war") entered its second phase with the intervention of the Arab state armies and the beginning of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

### Armed forces

By September 1947, the [Haganah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah "Haganah") had "10,489 rifles, 702 light machine-guns, 2,666 submachine guns, 186 medium machine-guns, 672 two-inch mortars and 92 three-inch (76 mm) mortars".<sup id="cite_ref-morris_2003_16_57-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-morris_2003_16-57">[53]</a></sup>

In 1946, Ben-Gurion decided that the Yishuv would probably have to defend itself against both the Palestinian Arabs and neighbouring Arab states and accordingly began a "massive, covert arms acquisition campaign in the West", and acquired many more during the first few months of hostilities.<sup id="cite_ref-Leonard_Slater_1970_p.31_58-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Leonard_Slater_1970_p.31-58">[54]</a></sup>

The Yishuv managed clandestinely to amass arms and military equipment abroad for transfer to Palestine once the British blockade was lifted. In the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), Yishuv agents purchased three [Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-17_Flying_Fortress "Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress") bombers, one of which bombed Cairo in July 1948, some [Curtiss C-46 Commando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtiss_C-46_Commando "Curtiss C-46 Commando") transport planes, and dozens of half-tracks, which were repainted and defined as "agricultural equipment". In Western Europe, [Haganah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah "Haganah") agents amassed fifty 65mm French mountain guns, twelve 120mm mortars, ten [H-35](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotchkiss_H35 "Hotchkiss H35") light tanks, and a large number of half-tracks. By mid-May or thereabouts the Yishuv had purchased from [Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia "Czechoslovakia") 25 [Avia S-199](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avia_S-199 "Avia S-199") fighters (an inferior version of the [Messerschmitt Bf 109](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messerschmitt_Bf_109 "Messerschmitt Bf 109")), 200 heavy machine guns, 5,021 light machine guns, 24,500 rifles, and 52 million rounds of ammunition, enough to equip all units, but short of heavy arms.<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-59">[55]</a></sup> The airborne arms smuggling missions from [Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia "Czechoslovakia") were codenamed [Operation Balak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Balak "Operation Balak").

The airborne smuggling missions were carried out by mostly American aviators – Jews and non-Jews – led by ex-U.S. Air Transport Command flight engineer [Al Schwimmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Schwimmer "Al Schwimmer").<sup id="cite_ref-Leonard_Slater_1970_p.100_60-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Leonard_Slater_1970_p.100-60">[56]</a></sup> Schwimmer's operation also included recruiting and training fighter pilots such as [Lou Lenart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Lenart "Lou Lenart"), commander of the first Israeli air assault against the Arabs. Several Americans, including Schwimmer, were later prosecuted by the U.S. government for violating the [Neutrality Act of 1939](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrality_Act_of_1939 "Neutrality Act of 1939").<sup id="cite_ref-61"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-61">[57]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-62">[58]</a></sup>

#### Arms production

The Yishuv also had "a relatively advanced _arms producing_ capacity", that between October 1947 and July 1948 "produced 3 million 9 mm bullets, 150,000 [Mills grenades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mills_bomb "Mills bomb"), 16,000 submachine guns ([Sten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sten "Sten") Guns) and 210 three-inch (76 mm) mortars",<sup id="cite_ref-morris_2003_16_57-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-morris_2003_16-57">[53]</a></sup> along with a few "[Davidka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidka "Davidka")" mortars, which had been indigenously designed and produced. They were inaccurate but had a loud explosion that demoralised the enemy. Much of the munitions used by the Israelis came from the [Ayalon Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machon_Ayalon "Machon Ayalon"), a clandestine bullet factory beneath kibbutz [Ayalon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajalon "Ajalon"), which produced about 2.5 million bullets for Sten guns. The munitions produced by the Ayalon Institute were said to have been the only supply that was not in shortage during the war. Locally produced explosives were also plentiful. After Israel's independence, these clandestine arms manufacturing operations were moved above ground. All of the Haganah's weapons-manufacturing was centralised and later became [Israel Military Industries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Military_Industries "Israel Military Industries").<sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-63">[59]</a></sup>

#### Manpower

In November 1947, the Haganah was an underground paramilitary force that had existed as a highly organised, national force, since the Arab riots of [1920](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920_Palestine_riots "1920 Palestine riots")–[21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa_riots "Jaffa riots"), and throughout the [riots of 1929](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riots_in_Palestine_of_1929 "Riots in Palestine of 1929"), [Great Uprising of 1936–39](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936%E2%80%931939_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine "1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine"),<sup id="cite_ref-morris_2003_16_57-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-morris_2003_16-57">[53]</a></sup> and World War II. It had a mobile force, the [HISH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hish_(Haganah_corps) "Hish (Haganah corps)"), which had 2,000 full-time fighters (men and women) and 10,000 reservists (all aged between 18 and 25) and an elite unit, the [Palmach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmach "Palmach") composed of 2,100 fighters and 1,000 reservists. The reservists trained three or four days a month<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="not true. where is the source? (November 2013)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> and went back to civilian life the rest of the time. These mobile forces could rely on a garrison force, the HIM (_Heil Mishmar_, lit. Guard Corps), composed of people aged over 25. The Yishuv's total strength was around 35,000 with 15,000 to 18,000 fighters and a garrison force of roughly 20,000.<sup id="cite_ref-morris_2003_16_57-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-morris_2003_16-57">[53]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-64">[60]</a></sup>

There were also several thousand men and women who had served in the British Army in World War II who did not serve in any of the underground militias but would provide valuable military experience during the war.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p25_65-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p25-65">[61]</a></sup> Walid Khalidi says the Yishuv had the additional forces of the Jewish Settlement Police, numbering some 12,000, the Gadna Youth Battalions, and the armed settlers.<sup id="cite_ref-Palestine1_66-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Palestine1-66">[62]</a></sup> Few of the units had been trained by December 1947.<sup id="cite_ref-morris_2003_16_57-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-morris_2003_16-57">[53]</a></sup> On 5 December 1947, [conscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription "Conscription") was instituted for all men and women aged between 17 and 25 and by the end of March, 21,000 had been conscripted.<sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-67">[63]</a></sup> On 30 March, the call-up was extended to men and single women aged between 26 and 35. Five days later, a General Mobilization order was issued for all men under 40.<sup id="cite_ref-68"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-68">[64]</a></sup>

By March 1948, the Yishuv had a numerical superiority, with 35,780 mobilised and deployed fighters for the [Haganah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah "Haganah"),<sup id="cite_ref-69"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-69">[65]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-70"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-70">[66]</a></sup> 3,000 men under [Lehi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehi_(militant_group) "Lehi (militant group)") and [Irgun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irgun "Irgun"), and a few thousand armed settlers.<sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-71">[67]</a></sup> Irgun was eventually absorbed into the Jewish Defence Army.<sup id="cite_ref-Mi5_72-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Mi5-72">[68]</a></sup> The activities of Irgun was monitored by [MI5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI5 "MI5"), which found that Irgun was "involved or implicated in numerous acts of terrorism" during the end years of the [British mandate in Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine "Mandatory Palestine") such as the attacks on trains and the kidnapping of British servicemen.<sup id="cite_ref-Mi5_72-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Mi5-72">[68]</a></sup>

#### Arab forces

According to [Benny Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Morris "Benny Morris"), by the end of 1947, the Palestinians already "had a healthy and demoralising respect for the Yishuv's military power" and if it came to battle, the Palestinians expected to lose. When the first violent incidents broke out in Jerusalem on the 29 November, the [Arab Higher Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Higher_Committee "Arab Higher Committee"), well aware of their lack of armaments, had called for a three-day strike: the most militant Palestinian group in the city, consisting of 44 fighters, was furnished with 12 rifles, some handguns and a few kilograms of explosives.<sup id="cite_ref-73"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-73">[69]</a></sup>

The effective number of Arab combatants is listed as growing to 12,000 by some historians<sup id="cite_ref-Laurens3_74-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Laurens3-74">[70]</a></sup> while others calculate an eventual total Arab strength of approximately 23,500 troops, and with this being more of less or roughly equal to that of the Yishuv. However, as Israel mobilised most of its most able citizens during the war while the Arab troops were only a small percentage of its far greater population, the strength of the Yishuv grew steadily and dramatically during the war.<sup id="cite_ref-75"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-75">[71]</a></sup>

## Political objectives

### Yishuv

[Yishuv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yishuv "Yishuv")'s aims evolved during the war.<sup id="cite_ref-morris_1948_397_76-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-morris_1948_397-76">[72]</a></sup> Mobilisation for a total war was organised.<sup id="cite_ref-77"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-77">[73]</a></sup> Initially, the aim was "simple and modest": to survive the assaults of the Palestinian Arabs and the Arab states. "The Zionist leaders deeply, genuinely, feared a Middle Eastern reenactment of the [Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust "Holocaust"), which had just ended; the Arabs' public rhetoric reinforced these fears". As the war progressed, the aim of expanding the Jewish state beyond the UN partition borders appeared: first to incorporate clusters of isolated Jewish settlements and later to add more territories to the state and give it defensible borders. A third and further aim that emerged among the political and military leaders after four or five months was to "reduce the size of Israel's prospective large and hostile Arab minority, seen as a potential powerful [fifth column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_column "Fifth column"), by belligerency and expulsion".<sup id="cite_ref-morris_1948_397_76-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-morris_1948_397-76">[72]</a></sup>

According to research by Shay Hazkani, Ben-Gurion and segments of the [religious Zionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_Zionism "Religious Zionism") leadership drew parallels between the war and the biblical wars of extermination, and states this was not a fringe position. IDF indoctrination pamphlets were distributed to recruits instructing them that God “demands a revenge of extermination without mercy to whoever tries to hurt us for no reason.”.<sup id="cite_ref-78"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-78">[74]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-79"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-79">[75]</a></sup>

[Plan Dalet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_Dalet "Plan Dalet"), or Plan D, ([Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language"): תוכנית ד', _Tokhnit dalet_) was a plan worked out by the Haganah, a Jewish paramilitary group and the forerunner of the Israel Defense Forces, in autumn 1947 to spring 1948, which was sent to Haganah units in early March 1948. The intent of Plan Dalet is subject to much controversy, with historians on the one extreme asserting that it was entirely defensive, and historians on the other extreme asserting that the plan aimed at maximum conquest and expulsion of the Palestinians. According to [Walid Khalidi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walid_Khalidi "Walid Khalidi") and [Ilan Pappé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilan_Papp%C3%A9 "Ilan Pappé"), its purpose was to conquer as much of [Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region) "Palestine (region)") and to expel as many Palestinians as possible,<sup id="cite_ref-Palestine1_66-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Palestine1-66">[62]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-80"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-80">[76]</a></sup> though according to [Benny Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Morris "Benny Morris") there was no such intent. In his book _[The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ethnic_Cleansing_of_Palestine "The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine")_, Pappé asserts that Plan Dalet was a "blueprint for ethnic cleansing" with the aim of reducing both rural and urban areas of Palestine.<sup id="cite_ref-81"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-81">[77]</a></sup>

According to [Yoav Gelber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Gelber "Yoav Gelber"), the plan specified that in case of resistance, the population of conquered villages was to be expelled outside the borders of the Jewish state. If no resistance was met, the residents could stay put, under military rule.<sup id="cite_ref-82"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-82">[78]</a></sup> According to Morris, Plan D called for occupying the areas within the UN sponsored Jewish state, several concentrations of Jewish population outside those areas (West Jerusalem and Western Galilee), and areas along the roads where the invading Arab armies were expected to attack.<sup id="cite_ref-83"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-83">[79]</a></sup>

The Yishuv perceived the peril of an Arab invasion as threatening its very existence. Having no real knowledge of the Arabs' true military capabilities, the Jews took Arab propaganda literally, preparing for the worst and reacting accordingly.<sup id="cite_ref-Gelber1_84-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Gelber1-84">[80]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Disputed_statement" title="Wikipedia:Disputed statement"><span title="This claim has reliable sources with contradicting facts (April 2024)">disputed</span></a> <span>– <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War" title="Talk:1948 Arab–Israeli War">discuss</a></span></i>]</sup>

Clause 10 of the 15 May 1948 [Arab League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League "Arab League") cablegram explaining the reasons for their entry into the territory

The [Arab League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League "Arab League") had unanimously rejected the UN partition plan and were opposed to the establishment of a Jewish state alongside an Arab one.

The Arab League before partition affirmed the right to the independence of Palestine, while blocking the creation of a Palestinian government.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="The text near this tag may need clarification or removal of jargon.

In April with the Palestinian defeat, the [refugees coming from Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_exodus "1948 Palestinian exodus") and the pressure of their public opinion, the Arab leaders decided to invade Palestine.<sup id="cite_ref-Gelber_2006_p.11_85-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Gelber_2006_p.11-85">[81]</a></sup>

The Arab League gave reasons for its invasion in [Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region) "Palestine (region)") in the [cablegram](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Cablegram_from_the_Secretary-General_of_the_League_of_Arab_States_to_the_Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations "s:Cablegram from the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States to the Secretary-General of the United Nations"):<sup id="cite_ref-87"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-87">[83]</a></sup>

-   the Arab states find themselves compelled to intervene in order to restore law and order and to check further bloodshed.
-   the Mandate over Palestine has come to an end, leaving no legally constituted authority.
-   the only solution of the Palestine problem is the establishment of a unitary Palestinian state.

British diplomat [Alec Kirkbride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Kirkbride "Alec Kirkbride") wrote in his 1976 memoirs about a conversation with the Arab League's Secretary-General [Azzam Pasha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Rahman_Hassan_Azzam "Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam") a week before the armies marched: "...when I asked him for his estimate of the size of the Jewish forces, \[he\] waved his hands and said: 'It does not matter how many there are. We will sweep them into the sea.'"<sup id="cite_ref-88"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-88">[84]</a></sup>

According to Gelber, the Arab countries were "drawn into the war by the collapse of the Palestinian Arabs and the Arab Liberation Army \[and\] the Arab governments' primary goal was preventing the Palestinian Arabs' total ruin and the flooding of their own countries by more refugees. According to their own perception, had the invasion not taken place, there was no Arab force in Palestine capable of checking the Haganah's offensive".<sup id="cite_ref-Gelber1_84-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Gelber1-84">[80]</a></sup>

### King Abdullah I of Transjordan

King Abdullah was the commander of the [Arab Legion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Legion "Arab Legion"), the strongest Arab army involved in the war according to [Eugene Rogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Rogan "Eugene Rogan") and [Avi Shlaim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avi_Shlaim "Avi Shlaim") in 2007.<sup id="cite_ref-89"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-89">[85]</a></sup> (In contrast, Morris wrote in 2008 that the Egyptian army was the most powerful and threatening army.<sup id="cite_ref-90"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-90">[86]</a></sup>) The Arab Legion had about 10,000 soldiers, trained and commanded by British officers.

King Abdullah outside the [Church of the Holy Sepulchre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Holy_Sepulchre "Church of the Holy Sepulchre"), 29 May 1948, the day after Jordanian forces took control of the Old City in the [Battle for Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_for_Jerusalem "Battle for Jerusalem")

In 1946–47, Abdullah said that he had no intention to "resist or impede the partition of Palestine and creation of a [Jewish state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_state "Jewish state")."<sup id="cite_ref-Sela_91-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Sela-91">[87]</a></sup> Ideally, Abdullah would have liked to annex all of Palestine, but he was prepared to compromise.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p26_92-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p26-92">[88]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p51_93-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p51-93">[89]</a></sup> He supported the partition, intending that the West Bank area of the British Mandate allocated for the Arab state be annexed to Jordan.<sup id="cite_ref-94"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-94">[90]</a></sup> Abdullah held secret meetings with the Jewish Agency (at which the future [Israeli Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Prime_Minister "Israeli Prime Minister") [Golda Meir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golda_Meir "Golda Meir") was among the delegates) that reached an agreement of Jewish non-interference with Jordanian annexation of the West Bank (although Abdullah failed in his goal of acquiring an outlet to the Mediterranean Sea through the Negev desert) and of Jordanian agreement not to attack the area of the Jewish state contained in the United Nations partition resolution (in which Jerusalem was given neither to the Arab nor the Jewish state, but was to be an internationally administered area). In order to keep their support to his plan of annexation of the Arab State, Abdullah promised to the British he would not attack the Jewish State.<sup id="cite_ref-95"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-95">[91]</a></sup>

The neighbouring Arab states pressured Abdullah into joining them in an "all-Arab military invasion" against the newly created State of Israel, that he used to restore his prestige in the Arab world, which had grown suspicious of his relatively good relationship with Western and Jewish leaders.<sup id="cite_ref-Sela_91-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Sela-91">[87]</a></sup> Jordan's undertakings not to cross partition lines were not taken at face value. While repeating assurances that Jordan would only take areas allocated to a future Arab state, on the eve of war [Tawfik Abu al-Huda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawfik_Abu_al-Huda "Tawfik Abu al-Huda") told the British that were other Arab armies to advance against Israel, Jordan would follow suit.<sup id="cite_ref-96"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-96">[92]</a></sup> On 23 May Abdullah told the French consul in Amman that he "was determined to fight Zionism and prevent the establishment of an Israeli state on the border of his kingdom".<sup id="cite_ref-97"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-97">[93]</a></sup>

Abdullah's role in this war became substantial. He saw himself as the "supreme commander of the Arab forces" and "persuaded the Arab League to appoint him" to this position.<sup id="cite_ref-98"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-98">[94]</a></sup> Through his leadership, the Arabs fought the 1948 war to meet Abdullah's political goals.

### Other Arab states

King [Farouk of Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farouk_of_Egypt "Farouk of Egypt") was anxious to prevent Abdullah from being seen as the main champion of the Arab world in Palestine, which he feared might damage his own leadership aspirations of the Arab world.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p26_92-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p26-92">[88]</a></sup> In addition, Farouk wished to annex all of southern Palestine to Egypt.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p26_92-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p26-92">[88]</a></sup> According to [Gamal Abdel Nasser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser "Gamal Abdel Nasser") the Egyptian Ministry of Defence's first communique describe the Palestine operations as a merely punitive expedition against the Zionist "gangs",<sup id="cite_ref-99"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-99">[95]</a></sup> using a term frequent in Haganah reports of Palestinian fighters.<sup id="cite_ref-100"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-100">[96]</a></sup> According to a 2019 study, "senior British intelligence, military officers and diplomats in Cairo were deeply involved in a covert scheme to drive the King to participate in the Arab states' war coalition against Israel."<sup id="cite_ref-:0_101-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:0-101">[97]</a></sup> These intelligence officers acted without the approval or knowledge of the British government.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_101-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:0-101">[97]</a></sup>

[Nuri as-Said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuri_as-Said "Nuri as-Said"), the strongman of Iraq, had ambitions for bringing the entire Fertile Crescent under Iraqi leadership.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p26_92-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p26-92">[88]</a></sup> Both Syria and Lebanon wished to take certain areas of northern Palestine.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p26_92-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p26-92">[88]</a></sup>

One result of the ambitions of the various Arab leaders was a distrust of all the Palestinian leaders who wished to set up a Palestinian state, and a mutual distrust of each other.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p26_92-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p26-92">[88]</a></sup> Co-operation was to be very poor during the war between the various Palestinian factions and the Arab armies.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p26_92-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p26-92">[88]</a></sup>

### Arab Higher Committee of Amin al-Husayni

Following rumours that King Abdullah was re-opening the bilateral negotiations with Israel that he had previously conducted in secret with the Jewish Agency, the Arab League, led by Egypt, decided to set up the [All-Palestine Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Palestine_Government "All-Palestine Government") in [Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City "Gaza City") on 8 September under the nominal leadership of the Mufti.<sup id="cite_ref-102"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-102">[98]</a></sup> Abdullah regarded the attempt to revive al-Husayni's Holy War Army as a challenge to his authority and all armed bodies operating in the areas controlled by the Arab Legion were disbanded. [Glubb Pasha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glubb_Pasha "Glubb Pasha") carried out the order ruthlessly and efficiently.<sup id="cite_ref-103"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-103">[99]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-104"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-104">[100]</a></sup>

## Initial line-up of forces

### Military assessments

Though the State of Israel faced the formidable armies of neighbouring Arab countries, due to previous battles the Palestinians themselves hardly existed as a military force by the middle of May.<sup id="cite_ref-Creveld_105-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Creveld-105">[101]</a></sup> The British Intelligence and [Arab League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League "Arab League") military reached similar conclusions.<sup id="cite_ref-106"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-106">[102]</a></sup>

The British Foreign Ministry and the [CIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency "Central Intelligence Agency") believed that the Arab states would finally win in case of war.<sup id="cite_ref-107"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-107">[103]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-108"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-108">[104]</a></sup> [Martin Van Creveld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Van_Creveld "Martin Van Creveld") says that in terms of manpower, the sides were fairly evenly matched.<sup id="cite_ref-109"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-109">[105]</a></sup>

In May, Egyptian generals told their government that the invasion would be "a parade without any risks" and [Tel Aviv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv "Tel Aviv") would be taken "in two weeks."<sup id="cite_ref-110"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-110">[106]</a></sup> Egypt, Iraq, and Syria all possessed air forces, Egypt and Syria had tanks, and all had some modern artillery.<sup id="cite_ref-Morris,_2003,_p._35_111-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Morris,_2003,_p._35-111">[107]</a></sup> Initially, the [Haganah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah "Haganah") had no heavy machine guns, [artillery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery "Artillery"), armoured vehicles, anti-tank or anti-aircraft weapons,<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p25_65-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p25-65">[61]</a></sup> nor military aircraft or tanks.<sup id="cite_ref-morris_2003_16_57-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-morris_2003_16-57">[53]</a></sup> The four Arab armies that invaded on 15 May were far stronger than the Haganah formations they initially encountered.<sup id="cite_ref-112"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-112">[108]</a></sup>

On 12 May, three days before the invasion, David Ben-Gurion was told by his chief military advisers (who over-estimated the size of the Arab armies and the numbers and efficiency of the troops who would be committed – much as the Arab generals tended to exaggerate Jewish fighters' strength) that Israel's chances of winning a war against the Arab states were only about even.<sup id="cite_ref-Morris,_2003,_p._35_111-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Morris,_2003,_p._35-111">[107]</a></sup>

### Yishuv/Israeli forces

Sources disagree about the quantity of arms at the Yishuv's disposal at the end of the Mandate. According to [Efraim Karsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efraim_Karsh "Efraim Karsh") before the arrival shipments from [Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia "Czechoslovakia") as part of [Operation Balak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Balak "Operation Balak"), there was roughly one weapon for every three fighters, and even the Palmach could arm only two out of every three of its active members.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p25_65-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p25-65">[61]</a></sup> According to [Larry Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Collins_(writer) "Larry Collins (writer)") and [Dominique Lapierre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominique_Lapierre "Dominique Lapierre"), by April 1948, the Haganah had accumulated only about 20,000 rifles and Sten guns for the 35,000 soldiers who existed on paper.<sup id="cite_ref-113"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-113">[109]</a></sup> According to [Walid Khalidi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walid_Khalidi "Walid Khalidi"), "the arms at the disposal of these forces were plentiful".<sup id="cite_ref-Palestine1_66-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Palestine1-66">[62]</a></sup> [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France") authorised [Air France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France "Air France") to transport cargo to Tel Aviv on 13 May.<sup id="cite_ref-Zamir2010p22_114-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Zamir2010p22-114">[110]</a></sup>

Yishuv forces were organised in nine brigades, and their numbers grew following Israeli independence, eventually expanding to twelve brigades. Although both sides increased their manpower over the first few months of the war, the Israeli forces grew steadily as a result of the progressive mobilisation of Israeli society and the influx of an average of 10,300 immigrants each month.<sup id="cite_ref-115"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-115">[111]</a></sup> By the end of 1948, the [Israel Defense Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces "Israel Defense Forces") had 88,033 soldiers, including 60,000 combat soldiers.<sup id="cite_ref-116"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-116">[112]</a></sup>

At the invasion, in addition to the irregular Palestinian militia groups, the five Arab states that joined the war were [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt "Egypt"), [Transjordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate_of_Transjordan "Emirate of Transjordan"), [Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria "Syria"), [Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon "Lebanon") and [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Iraq "Kingdom of Iraq") sending expeditionary forces of their regular armies. Additional contingents came from [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia "Saudi Arabia") and [Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen "Yemen"). On the eve of war, the available number of Arab troops likely to be committed was between 23,500 and 26,500 (10,000 Egyptians, 4,500 Jordanians, 3,000 Iraqis, 3,000–6,000 Syrians, 2,000 [ALA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Liberation_Army "Arab Liberation Army") volunteers, 1,000 Lebanese, and several hundred Saudis), in addition to the irregular Palestinians already present.

#### Arab states

Jordan's [Arab Legion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Legion "Arab Legion") was considered the most effective Arab force. Armed, trained and commanded by British officers, this 8,000–12,000 strong force was organised in four infantry/mechanised regiments supported by some forty artillery pieces and seventy-five armoured cars.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p26-27_127-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p26-27-127">[123]</a></sup> Until January 1948, it was reinforced by the 3,000-strong [Transjordan Frontier Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transjordan_Frontier_Force "Transjordan Frontier Force").<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p27_128-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p27-128">[124]</a></sup> As many as 48 British officers served in the Arab Legion.<sup id="cite_ref-129"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-129">[125]</a></sup> Glubb Pasha, the commander of the Legion, organised his forces into four brigades as follows:

The Arab Legion joined the war in May 1948, but fought only in the area that King Abdullah wanted to secure for Jordan: the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.

France prevented a large sale of arms by a Swiss company to Ethiopia, brokered by the UK foreign office, which was actually destined for Egypt and Jordan, and denied a British request at the end of April to land a squadron of British aircraft on its way to Transjordan, and applied diplomatic pressure on Belgium to suspend arms sales to the Arab states.<sup id="cite_ref-Zamir2010p22_114-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Zamir2010p22-114">[110]</a></sup>

The Jordanian forces were probably the best trained of all combatants. Other combatant forces lacked the ability to make strategic decisions and tactical manoeuvres,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPollack2004?_132-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPollack2004?-132">[128]</a></sup> as evidenced by positioning the fourth regiment at [Latrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrun "Latrun"), which was abandoned by ALA combatants before the arrival of the Jordanian forces and the importance of which was not fully understood by the Haganah.

The initial Arab plans called for Syrian and Lebanese forces to invade from north while Jordanian and Iraqi forces were to invade from east in order to meet at Nazareth and then to push forward together to Haifa.

On 28 May the Egyptians renewed their northern advance, and stopped at a destroyed bridge north to [Isdud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashdod "Ashdod"). The Givati Brigade reported this advance but no fighters were sent to confront the Egyptians. Had the Egyptians wished to continue their advance northward, towards [Tel Aviv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv "Tel Aviv"), there would have been no Israeli force to block them.<sup id="cite_ref-163"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-163">[159]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-164"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-164">[160]</a></sup>

From 29 May to 3 June, Israeli forces stopped the Egyptian drive north in [Operation Pleshet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Pleshet "Operation Pleshet"). In the first combat mission performed by Israel's fledgling air force, four [Avia S-199s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avia_S-199 "Avia S-199") attacked an Egyptian armoured column of 500 vehicles on its way to [Isdud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashdod "Ashdod"). The Israeli planes dropped 70 kilogram bombs and strafed the column, although their machine guns jammed quickly. Two of the planes crashed, killing a pilot. The attack caused the Egyptians to scatter, and they had lost the initiative by the time they had regrouped. Following the air attack, Israeli forces constantly bombarded Egyptian forces in Isdud with [_Napoleonchik_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_de_65_M_(montagne)_modele_1906 "Canon de 65 M (montagne) modele 1906") cannons, and IDF patrols engaged in small-scale harassment of Egyptian lines. Following another air attack, the Givati Brigade launched a counterattack. Although the counterattack was repulsed, the Egyptian offensive was halted as Egypt changed its strategy from offensive to defensive, and the initiative shifted to Israel.<sup id="cite_ref-165"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-165">[161]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS" title="Wikipedia:NOTRS"><span title="This claim needs references to better sources.

On 6 June, in the [Battle of Nitzanim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Nitzanim "Battle of Nitzanim"), Egyptian forces attacked the kibbutz of [Nitzanim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitzanim "Nitzanim"), located between [Majdal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Majdal,_Askalan "Al-Majdal, Askalan") and [Isdud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isdud "Isdud"), and the Israeli defenders surrendered after resisting for five days.

#### Battles of Latrun

The heaviest fighting occurred in [Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_for_Jerusalem_(1948) "Battle for Jerusalem (1948)") and on the Jerusalem – Tel Aviv road, between Jordan's [Arab Legion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Legion "Arab Legion") and Israeli forces.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p61-62_166-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p61-62-166">[162]</a></sup> As part of the redeployment to deal with the Egyptian advance, the Israelis abandoned the Latrun fortress overlooking the main highway to Jerusalem, which the Arab Legion immediately seized.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p61_167-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p61-167">[163]</a></sup> The Arab Legion also occupied the Latrun Monastery.

The besieged Israeli [Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem "Jerusalem") was only saved via the opening of the so-called "[Burma Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma_Road_(Israel) "Burma Road (Israel)")", a makeshift bypass road built by Israeli forces that allowed Israeli supply convoys to pass into Jerusalem.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p62_168-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p62-168">[164]</a></sup> Parts of the area where the road was built were cleared of Jordanian snipers in May and the road was completed on 14 June. Supplies had already begun passing through before the road was completed, with the first convoy passing through on the night of 1–2 June. The Jordanians spotted the activity and attempted to shell the road, but were ineffective, as it could not be seen. However, Jordanian sharpshooters killed several road workers, and an attack on 9 June left eight Israelis dead. On 18 July, elements of the [Harel Brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harel_Brigade "Harel Brigade") took about 10 villages to the south of Latrun to enlarge and secure the area of the Burma Road.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

All Jewish aviation assets were placed under the control of the _[Sherut Avir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherut_Avir "Sherut Avir")_ (Air Service, known as the SA) in November 1947 and flying operations began in the following month from a small civil airport on the outskirts of [Tel Aviv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv "Tel Aviv") called [Sde Dov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sde_Dov_Airport "Sde Dov Airport"), with the first ground support operation (in an [RWD-13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RWD-13 "RWD-13"))<sup id="cite_ref-181"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-181">[177]</a></sup> taking place on 17 December. The [Galilee Squadron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilee_Squadron "Galilee Squadron") was formed at [Yavne'el](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yavne%27el "Yavne'el") in March 1948, and the Negev Squadron was formed at [Nir-Am](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nir-Am "Nir-Am") in April. By 10 May, when the SA suffered its first combat loss, there were three flying units, an air staff, maintenance facilities and logistics support. At the outbreak of the war on 15 May, the SA became the [Israeli Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Air_Force "Israeli Air Force"). With its fleet<sup id="cite_ref-182"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-182">[178]</a></sup> of light planes it was no match for Arab forces during the first few weeks of the war with their [T-6s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-6_Texan "T-6 Texan"), [Spitfires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitfire "Spitfire"), [C-47s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-47 "C-47"), and [Avro Ansons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro_Anson "Avro Anson").

On 15 May, with the beginning of the war, four [Royal Egyptian Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Egyptian_Air_Force "Royal Egyptian Air Force") (REAF) Spitfires attacked [Tel Aviv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv "Tel Aviv"), bombing [Sde Dov Airfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sde_Dov_Airport "Sde Dov Airport"), where the bulk of Sherut Avir's aircraft were concentrated, as well as the [Reading Power Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_Power_Station "Reading Power Station"). Several aircraft were destroyed, some others were damaged, and five Israelis were killed. Throughout the following hours, additional waves of Egyptian aircraft bombed and strafed targets around Tel Aviv, although these raids had little effect. One Spitfire was shot down by anti-aircraft fire, and its pilot was taken prisoner.<sup id="cite_ref-Morris_2008,_p._261_183-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Morris_2008,_p._261-183">[179]</a></sup>

Throughout the next six days, the REAF continued to attack Tel Aviv, causing civilian casualties. On 18 May, Egyptian warplanes attacked the [Tel Aviv Central Bus Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv_Central_Bus_Station "Tel Aviv Central Bus Station"), killing 42 people and wounding 100. In addition to their attacks on Tel Aviv, the Egyptians bombed rural settlements and airfields, though few casualties were caused in these raids.<sup id="cite_ref-Morris_2008,_p._261_183-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Morris_2008,_p._261-183">[179]</a></sup>

At the outset of the war, the REAF was able to attack Israel with near impunity, due to the lack of Israeli fighter aircraft to intercept them,<sup id="cite_ref-184"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-184">[180]</a></sup> and met only ground fire.

As more effective air defences were transferred to Tel Aviv, the Egyptians began taking significant aircraft losses. As a result of these losses, as well as the loss of five Spitfires downed by the British when the Egyptians mistakenly attacked [RAF Ramat David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramat_David_Airbase "Ramat David Airbase"), the Egyptian air attacks became less frequent. By the end of May 1948, almost the entire REAF Spitfire squadron based in [El Arish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Arish "El Arish") had been lost, including many of its best pilots.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Although lacking fighter or bomber aircraft, in the first few days of the war, Israel's embryonic air force still attacked Arab targets, with light aircraft being utilised as makeshift bombers, striking Arab encampments and columns. The raids were mostly carried out at night to avoid interception by Arab fighter aircraft. These attacks usually had little effect, except on morale.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Israeli B-17s in flight

The balance of air power soon began to swing in favour of the Israeli Air Force following the arrival of 25 [Avia S-199s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avia_S-199 "Avia S-199") from [Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia "Czechoslovakia"), the first of which arrived in Israel on 20 May. Ironically, Israel was using the Avia S-199, an inferior derivative of the [Bf 109](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messerschmitt_Bf_109 "Messerschmitt Bf 109") designed in [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany") to counter British-designed Spitfires flown by Egypt. Throughout the rest of the war, Israel would acquire more Avia fighters, as well as 62 Spitfires from Czechoslovakia. On 28 May 1948, Sherut Avir became the Israeli Air Force.<sup id="cite_ref-185"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-185">[181]</a></sup>

Many of the pilots who fought for the Israeli Air Force were [foreign volunteers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahal_(Israel) "Mahal (Israel)") or mercenaries, including many [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") veterans.<sup id="cite_ref-David_Bercuson_1984_p.74_186-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-David_Bercuson_1984_p.74-186">[182]</a></sup>

On 3 June, Israel scored its first victory in aerial combat when Israeli pilot [Modi Alon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modi_Alon "Modi Alon") shot down a pair of Egyptian DC-3s that had just bombed Tel Aviv. Although Tel Aviv would see additional raids by fighter aircraft, there would be no more raids by bombers for the rest of the war. From then on, the [Israeli Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Air_Force "Israeli Air Force") began engaging the Arab air forces in air-to-air combat. The first dogfight took place on 8 June, when an Israeli fighter plane flown by Gideon Lichtman shot down an Egyptian Spitfire. By the fall of 1948, the IAF had achieved [air superiority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_superiority "Air superiority") and had superior firepower and more knowledgeable personnel, many of whom had seen action in World War II.<sup id="cite_ref-187"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-187">[183]</a></sup> Israeli planes then began intercepting and engaging Arab aircraft on bombing missions.

Following Israeli air attacks on Egyptian and Iraqi columns, the Egyptians repeatedly bombed [Ekron Airfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Nof_Airbase "Tel Nof Airbase"), where IAF fighters were based. During a 30 May raid, bombs aimed for Ekron hit central [Rehovot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehovot "Rehovot"), killing 7 civilians and wounding 30. In response to this, and probably to the Jordanian victories at [Latrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Latrun_(1948) "Battles of Latrun (1948)"), Israel began bombing targets in Arab cities. On the night of 31 May/1 June, the first Israeli raid on an Arab capital took place when three IAF planes flew to [Amman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amman "Amman") and dropped several dozen 55 and 110-pound bombs, hitting the King's Palace and an adjacent British airfield. Some 12 people were killed and 30 wounded. During the attack, an RAF hangar was damaged, as were some British aircraft. The British threatened that in the event of another such attack, they would shoot down the attacking aircraft and bomb Israeli airfields, and as a result, Israeli aircraft did not attack Amman again for the rest of the war. Israel also bombed [Arish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arish "Arish"), [Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City "Gaza City"), [Damascus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus "Damascus"), and [Cairo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo "Cairo"). Israeli [Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-17_Flying_Fortress "Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress") bombers flying to Israel from [Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia "Czechoslovakia") bombed Egypt on their way.<sup id="cite_ref-188"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-188">[184]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-189"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-189">[185]</a></sup>

At the outset of the war, the [Israeli Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Navy "Israeli Navy") consisted of three former [Aliyah Bet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Bet "Aliyah Bet") ships that had been seized by the British and impounded in [Haifa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa "Haifa") harbour, where they were tied up at the breakwater. Work on establishing a navy had begun shortly before Israeli independence, and the three ships were selected due to them having a military background – one, the INS _Eilat_, was an ex-[US Coast Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard "United States Coast Guard") icebreaker, and the other two, the INS _Haganah_ and INS _Wedgwood_, had been [Royal Canadian Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Navy "Royal Canadian Navy") corvettes.<sup id="cite_ref-navy_190-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-navy-190">[186]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Gershoni,_pp._46–47_191-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Gershoni,_pp._46%E2%80%9347-191">[187]</a></sup>

The ships were put into minimum running condition by contractors dressed as stevedores and port personnel, who were able to work in the engine rooms and below deck. The work had to be clandestine to avoid arousing British suspicion. On 21 May 1948, the three ships set sail for Tel Aviv, and were made to look like ships that had been purchased by foreign owners for commercial use. In Tel Aviv, the ships were fitted with small field guns dating to the late 19th century and anti-aircraft guns.<sup id="cite_ref-navy_190-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-navy-190">[186]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Gershoni,_pp._46–47_191-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Gershoni,_pp._46%E2%80%9347-191">[187]</a></sup>

After the British left Haifa port on 30 June, Haifa became the main base of the Israeli Navy. In October 1948, a [submarine chaser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_chaser "Submarine chaser") was purchased from the United States. The warships were manned by former merchant seamen, former crewmembers of Aliyah Bet ships, Israelis who had served in the [Royal Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy "Royal Navy") during World War II, and foreign volunteers. The newly refurbished and crewed warships served on coastal patrol duties and bombarded Egyptian coastal installations in and around the [Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City "Gaza City") area all the way to [Port Said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Said "Port Said").<sup id="cite_ref-navy_190-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-navy-190">[186]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Gershoni,_pp._46–47_191-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Gershoni,_pp._46%E2%80%9347-191">[187]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS" title="Wikipedia:NOTRS"><span title="This claim needs references to better sources.

As the war progressed, the IDF managed to field more troops than the Arab forces. In July 1948, the IDF had 63,000 troops; by early spring 1949, they had 115,000. The Arab armies had an estimated 40,000 troops in July 1948, rising to 55,000 in October 1948, and slightly more by the spring of 1949.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Another city, [Jenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenin "Jenin"), was not occupied but its residents fled. The combined Arab forces captured 14 Jewish settlement points, but only one of them, [Mishmar HaYarden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishmar_HaYarden "Mishmar HaYarden"), was in the territory of the proposed Jewish State according to [Resolution 181](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine "United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine").<sup id="cite_ref-statsgelber_192-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-statsgelber-192">[188]</a></sup>

Within the boundaries of the proposed Jewish state, there were twelve Arab villages which opposed Jewish control or were captured by the invading Arab armies, and in addition to them, the [Lod Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lod_Airport "Lod Airport") and pumping station near [Antipatris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipatris "Antipatris"), which were within the boundaries of the proposed Jewish state, were under the control of the Arabs. The IDF captured about 50 large Arab villages outside of the boundaries of the proposed Jewish State and a larger number of hamlets and Bedouin encampments. 350 square kilometres of the proposed Jewish State were under the control of the Arab forces, while 700 square kilometres of the proposed Arab State were under the control of the IDF.

At the time of the truce, the British view was that "the Jews are too weak in armament to achieve spectacular success".<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p64_193-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p64-193">[189]</a></sup> As the truce commenced, a British officer stationed in [Haifa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa "Haifa") stated that the four-week-long truce "would certainly be exploited by the Jews to continue military training and reorganization while the Arabs would waste \[them\] feuding over the future divisions of the spoils".<sup id="cite_ref-Morris2008p269_194-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Morris2008p269-194">[190]</a></sup> During the truce, the Israelis sought to bolster their forces by massive import of arms.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p64_193-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p64-193">[189]</a></sup> The IDF was able to [acquire weapons from Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_shipments_from_Czechoslovakia_to_Israel_1947%E2%80%931949 "Arms shipments from Czechoslovakia to Israel 1947–1949") as well as improve training of forces and reorganisation of the army during this time. [Yitzhak Rabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Rabin "Yitzhak Rabin"), an IDF commander at the time of the war and later Israel's fifth Prime Minister, stated "\[w\]ithout the arms from Czechoslovakia... it is very doubtful whether we would have been able to conduct the war".<sup id="cite_ref-196"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-196">[192]</a></sup>

The Israeli army increased its manpower from approximately 30,000–35,000 men to almost 65,000 during the truce due to mobilisation and the constant immigration into Israel.

The [ceasefire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire "Ceasefire") was overseen by UN mediator [Folke Bernadotte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folke_Bernadotte "Folke Bernadotte") and a team of UN Observers made up of army officers from Belgium, United States, Sweden and France.<sup id="cite_ref-198"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-198">[194]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS" title="Wikipedia:NOTRS"><span title="This claim needs references to better sources.

> 
> 1.  the attempt by ...the Irgun Zvai Leumi to bring war materials and immigrants, including men of military age, into Palestine aboard the ship _Altalena_ on 21 June...
> 2.  Another truce violation occurred through the refusal of Egyptian forces to permit the passage of relief convoys to Jewish settlements in the Negeb...
> 3.  The third violation of the truce arose as a result of the failure of the Transjordan and Iraqi forces to permit the flow of water to Jerusalem.<sup id="cite_ref-BernadotteViolations_199-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-BernadotteViolations-199">[195]</a></sup>

After the truce was in place, Bernadotte began to address the issue of achieving a political settlement. The main obstacles in his opinion were "the Arab world's continued rejection of the existence of a Jewish state, whatever its borders; Israel's new 'philosophy', based on its increasing military strength, of ignoring the partition boundaries and conquering what additional territory it could; and the emerging Palestinian Arab refugee problem".<sup id="cite_ref-Morris2008p269_194-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Morris2008p269-194">[190]</a></sup>

Taking all the issues into account, Bernadotte presented a new partition plan. He proposed there be a Palestinian Arab state alongside Israel and that a "Union" "be established between the two sovereign states of Israel and Jordan (which now included the West Bank); that the Negev, or part of it, be included in the Arab state and that Western Galilee, or part of it, be included in Israel; that the whole of Jerusalem be part of the Arab state, with the Jewish areas enjoying municipal autonomy and that Lydda Airport and Haifa be 'free ports' – presumably free of Israeli or Arab sovereignty".<sup id="cite_ref-Morris2008p269_194-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Morris2008p269-194">[190]</a></sup> Israel rejected the proposal, in particular the aspect of losing control of Jerusalem, but they did agree to extend the truce for another month. The Arabs rejected both the extension of the truce and the proposal.<sup id="cite_ref-Morris2008p269_194-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Morris2008p269-194">[190]</a></sup>

### Second phase: 8–18 July 1948 ("Ten Day Battles")

On 8 July, the day before the expiration of the truce, Egyptian forces under General [Muhammad Naguib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Naguib "Muhammad Naguib") renewed the war by [attacking Negba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Negba#Battle_of_July_12 "Battles of Negba").<sup id="cite_ref-Knopf330_200-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Knopf330-200">[196]</a></sup> The following day, Israeli air forces launched a simultaneous offensive on all three fronts, ranging from [Quneitra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quneitra "Quneitra") to [Arish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arish "Arish") and the Egyptian air force bombed the city of Tel Aviv.<sup id="cite_ref-201"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-201">[197]</a></sup> During the fighting, the Israelis were able to open a lifeline to a number of besieged kibbutzim.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p64_193-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p64-193">[189]</a></sup>

The fighting continued for ten days until the UN Security Council issued the Second Truce on 18 July. During those 10 days, the fighting was dominated by large-scale Israeli offensives and a defensive posture from the Arab side.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

An Egyptian artillery piece captured by battalion 53 of the [Givati Brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Givati_Brigade "Givati Brigade").

In the south, the IDF carried out several offensives, including [Operation An-Far](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_An-Far "Operation An-Far") and [Operation Death to the Invader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Death_to_the_Invader "Operation Death to the Invader"). The task of the 11th Brigades's 1st Battalion on the southern flank was to capture villages, and its operation ran smoothly, with but little resistance from local irregulars. According to Amnon Neumann, a [Palmach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmach "Palmach") veteran of the Southern front, hardly any Arab villages in the south fought back, due to the miserable poverty of their means and lack of weapons, and suffered expulsion.<sup id="cite_ref-202"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-202">[198]</a></sup> What slight resistance was offered was quelled by an artillery barrage, followed by the storming of the village, whose residents were expelled and houses destroyed.<sup id="cite_ref-203"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-203">[199]</a></sup>

On 12 July, the Egyptians launched an offensive action, and again attacked [Negba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negba "Negba"), which they had previously failed to capture, using three infantry battalions, an armoured battalion, and an artillery regiment. In the battle that followed, the Egyptians were repulsed, suffering 200–300 casualties, while the Israelis lost 5 dead and 16 wounded.<sup id="cite_ref-204"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-204">[200]</a></sup>

After failing to take Negba, the Egyptians turned their attention to more isolated settlements and positions. On 14 July, an Egyptian attack on [Gal On](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal_On "Gal On") was driven off by a minefield and by resistance from Gal On's residents.<sup id="cite_ref-205"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-205">[201]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This citation requires a reference to the specific page or range of pages in which the material appears.

The Egyptians then assaulted the lightly defended village of [Be'erot Yitzhak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be%27erot_Yitzhak "Be'erot Yitzhak"). The Egyptians managed to penetrate the village perimeter, but the defenders concentrated in an inner position in the village and fought off the Egyptian advance until IDF reinforcements arrived and drove out the attackers. The Egyptians suffered an estimated 200 casualties, while the Israelis had 17 dead and 15 wounded. The battle was one of Egypt's last offensive actions during the war, and the Egyptians did not attack any Israeli villages following this battle.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

In a second planned stage of the operation the fortified positions of [Latrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrun "Latrun") – overlooking the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway – and the city of [Ramallah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramallah "Ramallah") were also to be captured.

The objectives of Operation Danny were to capture territory east of Tel Aviv and then to push inland and relieve the Jewish population and forces in [Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem "Jerusalem"). Lydda had become an important military center in the region, lending support to Arab military activities elsewhere, and Ramle was one of the main obstacles blocking Jewish transportation. Lydda was defended by a local militia of around 1,000 residents, with an [Arab Legion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Legion "Arab Legion") contingent of 125–300.<sup id="cite_ref-207"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-207">[203]</a></sup>

The IDF forces gathered to attack the city numbered around 8,000. It was the first operation where several brigades were involved. The city was attacked from the north via [Majdal al-Sadiq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_al-Sadiq "Majdal al-Sadiq") and [al-Muzayri'a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Muzayri%27a "Al-Muzayri'a"), and from the east via [Khulda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khulda "Khulda"), [al-Qubab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qubab "Al-Qubab"), [Jimzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimzu "Jimzu") and [Daniyal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniyal "Daniyal"). Bombers were also used for the first time in the conflict to bombard the city. The IDF captured the city on 11 July.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p64_193-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p64-193">[189]</a></sup>

### Second truce: 18 July – 15 October 1948

At 19:00 on 18 July, the second truce of the conflict went into effect after intense diplomatic efforts by the UN.

On 16 September, Count [Folke Bernadotte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folke_Bernadotte "Folke Bernadotte") proposed a new partition for Palestine in which the [Negev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negev "Negev") would be divided between Jordan and Egypt, and Jordan would annexe [Lydda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lod "Lod") and [Ramla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramla "Ramla"). There would be a Jewish state in the whole of [Galilee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilee "Galilee"), with the frontier running from Faluja northeast towards Ramla and Lydda.

The plan was once again rejected by both sides. On the next day, 17 September, Bernadotte was [assassinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folke_Bernadotte#Assassination "Folke Bernadotte") in Jerusalem by the militant Zionist group [Lehi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehi_(group) "Lehi (group)"). A four-man team ambushed Bernadotte's motorcade in Jerusalem, killing him and a French UN observer sitting next to him. Lehi saw Bernadotte as a British and Arab puppet, and thus a serious threat to the emerging State of Israel, and feared that the provisional Israeli government would accept the plan, which it considered disastrous. Unbeknownst to Lehi, the government had already decided to reject it and resume combat in a month. Bernadotte's deputy, American [Ralph Bunche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Bunche "Ralph Bunche"), replaced him.<sup id="cite_ref-211"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-211">[207]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-212"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-212">[208]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Haberman1995_213-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Haberman1995-213">[209]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Cowell1991_214-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Cowell1991-214">[210]</a></sup>

On 22 September 1948, the [Provisional State Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_State_Council "Provisional State Council") of Israel passed the Area of Jurisdiction and Powers Ordnance, 5708–1948. The law officially added to Israel's size by annexing all land it had captured since the war began. It also declared that from then on, any part of Palestine captured by the Israeli army would automatically become part of Israel.<sup id="cite_ref-215"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-215">[211]</a></sup>

### Little triangle pocket

The Arab villagers of the area known as the "[Little Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_(Israel) "Triangle (Israel)")" south of [Haifa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa "Haifa") repeatedly fired at Israeli traffic along the main road from [Tel Aviv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv "Tel Aviv") to [Haifa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa "Haifa") and were supplied by the Iraqis from northern Samaria.<sup id="cite_ref-Morris2008p298_216-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Morris2008p298-216">[212]</a></sup> The sniping at traffic continued during the Second Truce. The poorly-planned assaults on 18 June and 8 July had failed to dislodge Arab militia from their superior positions. The Israelis launched [Operation Shoter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Shoter "Operation Shoter") on 24 July in order to gain control of the main road to Haifa and to destroy all the enemy in the area.<sup id="cite_ref-Morris2008p298_216-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Morris2008p298-216">[212]</a></sup>

Israeli assaults on 24 and 25 July were beaten back with stiff resistance. The Israelis then broke the Arab defences with a combined infantry and armour assault backed by heavy shelling and bombing. Three Arab villages surrendered, and most of the inhabitants fled before and during the attack. The Israeli soldiers and aircraft struck one of the Arab retreat routes, killing 60 Arab soldiers.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy_dispute#Disputed_statement" title="Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute"><span title="Summary of problem (December 2013)">dubious</span></a> <span>– <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#the_article_has_POV_and_%22dubious%22_problems" title="Talk:1948 Arab–Israeli War">discuss</a></span></i>]</sup>.

At least a hundred militiamen and civilians were killed.<sup id="cite_ref-Morris2008p298_216-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Morris2008p298-216">[212]</a></sup>

The Arabs claimed that the Israelis had massacred Arab civilians, but the Israelis rejected the claims.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy_dispute#Disputed_statement" title="Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute"><span title="Summary of problem (December 2013)">dubious</span></a> <span>– <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#the_article_has_POV_and_%22dubious%22_problems" title="Talk:1948 Arab–Israeli War">discuss</a></span></i>]</sup> A United Nations investigation found no evidence of a massacre. Following the operation, the Tel Aviv-Haifa road was opened to Israeli military and civilian traffic, and Arab roadblocks along the route were removed. Traffic along the Haifa-[Hadera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadera "Hadera") coastal railway was also restored.

On 22 October, the third truce went into effect.<sup id="cite_ref-217"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-217">[213]</a></sup> Irregular Arab forces refused to recognise the truce, and continued to harass Israeli forces and settlements in the north. On the same day that the truce came into effect, the [Arab Liberation Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Liberation_Army "Arab Liberation Army") violated the truce by attacking [Manara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manara,_Israel "Manara, Israel"), capturing the strongpoint of Sheikh Abed, repulsing counterattacks by local Israeli units, and ambushed Israeli forces attempting to relieve Manara. The IDF's [Carmeli Brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmeli_Brigade "Carmeli Brigade") lost 33 dead and 40 wounded.<sup id="cite_ref-218"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-218">[214]</a></sup> Manara and [Misgav Am](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misgav_Am "Misgav Am") were totally cut off, and Israel's protests at the UN failed to change the situation.

On 24 October, the IDF launched [Operation Hiram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Hiram "Operation Hiram") and captured the entire [upper Galilee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Galilee "Upper Galilee") area, driving the ALA back to Lebanon, and ambushing and destroying an entire Syrian battalion.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p68_219-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p68-219">[215]</a></sup> The Israeli force of four infantry brigades was commanded by [Moshe Carmel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Carmel "Moshe Carmel").<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p68_219-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p68-219">[215]</a></sup> The entire operation lasted just 60 hours, during which numerous villages were captured, often after locals or Arab forces put up resistance.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p68_219-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p68-219">[215]</a></sup> Arab losses were estimated at 400 dead and 550 taken prisoner, with low Israeli casualties.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p68_219-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p68-219">[215]</a></sup>

Some prisoners were reportedly executed by the Israeli forces. An estimated 50,000 Palestinian refugees fled into Lebanon, some of them fleeing ahead of the advancing forces, and some expelled from villages which had resisted, while the Arab inhabitants of those villages which had remained at peace were allowed to remain and became Israeli citizens. The villagers of [Iqrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iqrit "Iqrit") and Birim were persuaded to leave their homes by Israeli authorities, who promised them that they would be allowed to return. Israel eventually decided not to allow them to return, and offered them financial compensation, which they refused to accept.<sup id="cite_ref-220"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-220">[216]</a></sup>

At the end of the month, the IDF had captured the whole of Galilee, driven all ALA forces out of Israel, and had advanced 8 kilometres (5 miles) into [Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon "Lebanon") to the [Litani River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litani_River "Litani River"),<sup id="cite_ref-Operation_Hiram_221-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Operation_Hiram-221">[217]</a></sup> occupying thirteen Lebanese villages. In the village of [Hula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hula,_Lebanon "Hula, Lebanon"), two Israeli officers [killed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hula_massacre "Hula massacre") between 35 and 58 prisoners as retaliation for the [Haifa Oil Refinery massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa_Oil_Refinery_massacre "Haifa Oil Refinery massacre").

Israel launched a series of military operations to drive out the Arab armies and secure the borders of Israel. However, invading the West Bank might have brought into the borders of the expanding State of Israel a massive Arab population it could not absorb. The Negev desert was an empty space for expansion, so the main war effort shifted to Negev from early October.<sup id="cite_ref-222"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-222">[218]</a></sup> Israel decided to destroy or at least drive out the Egyptian expeditionary force since the Egyptian front lines were too vulnerable as permanent borders.<sup id="cite_ref-Morris2008p320_223-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Morris2008p320-223">[219]</a></sup>

On 15 October, the IDF launched [Operation Yoav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Yoav "Operation Yoav") in the northern Negev.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p64_193-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p64-193">[189]</a></sup> Its goal was to drive a wedge between the Egyptian forces along the coast and the [Beersheba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beersheba "Beersheba")\-[Hebron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebron "Hebron")\-Jerusalem road and ultimately to conquer the whole Negev.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p64_193-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p64-193">[189]</a></sup> This was a special concern on the Israeli part because of a British diplomatic campaign to have the entire Negev handed over to Egypt and Jordan, and which thus made Ben-Gurion anxious to have Israeli forces in control of the Negev as soon as possible.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p64_193-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p64-193">[189]</a></sup>

On 19 October, [Operation Ha-Har](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ha-Har "Operation Ha-Har") began in the [Jerusalem Corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Corridor "Jerusalem Corridor"), while a [naval battle also took place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_naval_campaign_in_Operation_Yoav#Battle_near_Majdal "Israeli naval campaign in Operation Yoav") near [Majdal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Majdal,_Askalan "Al-Majdal, Askalan"), with three Israeli corvettes facing an Egyptian corvette with air support. An Israeli sailor was killed and four wounded, and two of the ships were damaged. One Egyptian plane was shot down, but the corvette escaped. Israeli naval vessels also shelled Majdal on 17 October, and [Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City "Gaza City") on 21 October, with air support from the [Israeli Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Air_Force "Israeli Air Force"). The same day, the IDF [captured Beersheba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Beersheba_(1948) "Battle of Beersheba (1948)"), and took 120 Egyptian soldiers prisoner. On 22 October, Israeli naval commandos using explosive boats [sank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_naval_campaign_in_Operation_Yoav "Israeli naval campaign in Operation Yoav") the Egyptian flagship _[Emir Farouk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Amir_Farouq "El Amir Farouq")_, and damaged an Egyptian minesweeper.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh2002p68_219-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Karsh2002p68-219">[215]</a></sup>

On 9 November 1948, the IDF launched [Operation Shmone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Shmone "Operation Shmone") to capture the [Tegart fort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tegart_fort "Tegart fort") in the village of [Iraq Suwaydan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Suwaydan "Iraq Suwaydan"). The fort's Egyptian defenders had previously repulsed eight attempts to take it, including two during Operation Yoav. Israeli forces bombarded the fort before an assault with artillery and airstrikes by B-17 bombers. After breaching the outlying fences without resistance, the Israelis blew a hole in the fort's outer wall, prompting the 180 Egyptian soldiers manning the fort to surrender without a fight. The defeat prompted the Egyptians to evacuate several nearby positions, including hills the IDF had failed to take by force. Meanwhile, IDF forces took Iraq Suwaydan itself after a fierce battle, losing 6 dead and 14 wounded.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

The main assaults were spearheaded by mechanised forces, while [Golani Brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golani_Brigade "Golani Brigade") infantry covered the rear. An Egyptian counterattack was repulsed.

The IDF entered and secured the territory, but did not meet significant resistance along the way, as the area was already designated to be part of the Jewish state in the UN Partition Plan, and the operation meant to establish Israeli sovereignty over the territory rather than actually conquer it. The Golani, [Negev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negev_Brigade "Negev Brigade"), and Alexandroni brigades participated in the operation, together with some smaller units and with naval support.<sup id="cite_ref-226"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-226">[222]</a></sup>

As the fighting progressed and Israel mounted an incursion into the Sinai, the [Royal Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force "Royal Air Force") began conducting almost daily reconnaissance missions over Israel and the Sinai. RAF reconnaissance aircraft took off from Egyptian airbases and sometimes flew alongside [Royal Egyptian Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Air_Force "Egyptian Air Force") planes. High-flying British aircraft frequently flew over [Haifa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa "Haifa") and [Ramat David Airbase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramat_David_Airbase "Ramat David Airbase"), and became known to the Israelis as the "shuftykeit."<sup id="cite_ref-spyflight_228-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-spyflight-228">[224]</a></sup>

On 20 November 1948, an unarmed RAF photo-reconnaissance [De Havilland Mosquito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Mosquito "De Havilland Mosquito") of [No. 13 Squadron RAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._13_Squadron_RAF "No. 13 Squadron RAF") was shot down by an [Israeli Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Air_Force "Israeli Air Force") [P-51 Mustang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-51_Mustang "P-51 Mustang") flown by American volunteer Wayne Peake as it flew over the [Galilee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilee "Galilee") towards [Hatzor Airbase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatzor_Airbase "Hatzor Airbase"). Peake opened fire with his cannons, causing a fire to break out in the port engine. The aircraft turned to sea and lowered its altitude, then exploded and crashed off [Ashdod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashdod "Ashdod"). The pilot and navigator were both killed.<sup id="cite_ref-spyflight_228-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-spyflight-228">[224]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-229"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-229">[225]</a></sup>

Just before noon on 7 January 1949, four [Spitfire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarine_Spitfire "Supermarine Spitfire") FR18s from [No. 208 Squadron RAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._208_Squadron_RAF "No. 208 Squadron RAF") on a reconnaissance mission in the [Deir al-Balah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_al-Balah "Deir al-Balah") area flew over an Israeli convoy that had been attacked by five Egyptian Spitfires fifteen minutes earlier. The pilots had spotted smoking vehicles and were drawn to the scene out of curiosity. Two planes dived to below 500 feet altitude to take pictures of the convoy, while the remaining two covered them from 1,500 feet.<sup id="cite_ref-spyflight_228-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-spyflight-228">[224]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Aloni_230-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Aloni-230">[226]</a></sup>

Israeli soldiers on the ground, alerted by the sound of the approaching Spitfires and fearing another Egyptian air attack, opened fire with machine guns. One Spitfire was shot down by a tank-mounted machine gun, while the other was lightly damaged and rapidly pulled up. The remaining three Spitfires were then attacked by patrolling IAF Spitfires flown by [Chalmers Goodlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalmers_Goodlin "Chalmers Goodlin") and John McElroy, volunteers from the United States and Canada respectively. All three Spitfires were shot down, and one pilot was killed.<sup id="cite_ref-spyflight_228-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-spyflight-228">[224]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Aloni_230-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Aloni-230">[226]</a></sup>

Two pilots were captured by Israeli soldiers and taken to [Tel Aviv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv "Tel Aviv") for interrogation, and were later released. Another was rescued by [Bedouins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin "Bedouin") and handed over to the Egyptian Army, which turned him over to the RAF. Later that day, four RAF Spitfires from the same squadron escorted by seven [Hawker Tempests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_Tempest "Hawker Tempest") from [No. 213 Squadron RAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._213_Squadron_RAF "No. 213 Squadron RAF") and eight from [No. 6 Squadron RAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._6_Squadron_RAF "No. 6 Squadron RAF") went searching for the lost planes, and were attacked by four IAF Spitfires. The Israeli formation was led by [Ezer Weizman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezer_Weizman "Ezer Weizman"). The remaining three were manned by Weizman's wingman Alex Jacobs and American volunteers Bill Schroeder and Caesar Dangott.<sup id="cite_ref-spyflight_228-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-spyflight-228">[224]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Aloni_230-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Aloni-230">[226]</a></sup>

The Tempests found they could not jettison their external fuel tanks, and some had non-operational guns. Schroeder shot down a British Tempest, killing pilot David Tattersfield, and Weizman severely damaged a British plane flown by Douglas Liquorish. Weizman's plane and two other British aircraft suffered light damage during the engagement. During the battle, British Tempest pilots treated British Spitfires as potential Israeli aircraft until the British Spitfire pilots were told by radio to wiggle their wings to be more clearly identifiable. The engagement ended when the Israelis realised the danger of their situation and disengaged, returning to Hatzor Airbase.<sup id="cite_ref-spyflight_228-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-spyflight-228">[224]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Aloni_230-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Aloni-230">[226]</a></sup>

Israeli Prime Minister [David Ben-Gurion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ben-Gurion "David Ben-Gurion") personally ordered the wrecks of the RAF fighters that had been shot down to be dragged into Israeli territory. Israeli troops subsequently visited the crash sites, removed various parts, and buried the other aircraft. However, the Israelis did not manage to conceal the wrecks in time to prevent British reconnaissance planes from photographing them. An RAF salvage team was deployed to recover the wrecks, entering Israeli territory during their search. Two were discovered inside Egypt, while Tattersfield's Tempest was found north of [Nirim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirim "Nirim"), 6 km (4 mi) inside Israel. Interviews with local Arabs confirmed that the Israelis had visited the crash sites to remove and bury the wrecks. Tattersfield was initially buried near the wreckage, but his body was later removed and reburied at the British War Cemetery in [Ramla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramla "Ramla").<sup id="cite_ref-spyflight_228-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-spyflight-228">[224]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-cohen_231-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-cohen-231">[227]</a></sup>

In response, the RAF readied all Tempests and Spitfires to attack any IAF aircraft they encountered and bomb IAF airfields. British troops in the Middle East were placed on high alert with all leave cancelled, and British citizens were advised to leave Israel. The [Royal Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy "Royal Navy") was placed on high alert. At Hatzor Airbase, the general consensus among the pilots, most of whom had flown with or alongside the RAF during World War II, was that the RAF would not allow the loss of five aircraft and two pilots to go without retaliation, and would probably attack the base at dawn the next day. That night, in anticipation of an impending British attack, some pilots decided not to offer any resistance and left the base, while others prepared their Spitfires and were strapped into the cockpits at dawn, preparing to repel a retaliatory airstrike. However, despite pressure from the squadrons involved in the incidents, British commanders refused to authorise any retaliatory strikes.<sup id="cite_ref-spyflight_228-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-spyflight-228">[224]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-232"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-232">[228]</a></sup>

The day following the incident, British pilots were issued a directive to regard any Israeli aircraft infiltrating Egyptian or Jordanian airspace as hostile and to shoot them down, but were also ordered to avoid activity close to Israel's borders. Later in January 1949, the British managed to prevent the delivery of aviation spirit and other essential fuels to Israel in retaliation for the incident. The [British Foreign Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office "Foreign and Commonwealth Office") presented the Israeli government with a demand for compensation over the loss of personnel and equipment.<sup id="cite_ref-spyflight_228-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-spyflight-228">[224]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-233"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-233">[229]</a></sup>

#### UN Resolution 194

In December 1948, the [UN General Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly "United Nations General Assembly") passed [Resolution 194](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_194 "United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194"). It called to establish a [UN Conciliation Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Conciliation_Commission "United Nations Conciliation Commission") to facilitate peace between Israel and Arab states. However, many of the resolution's articles were not fulfilled, since these were opposed by Israel, rejected by the Arab states, or were overshadowed by war as the 1948 conflict continued.

## Weapons

Largely leftover World War II era weapons were used by both sides. Egypt had some British equipment; the Syrian army had some French. German, Czechoslovak and British equipment was used by Israel.<sup id="cite_ref-234"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-234">[230]</a></sup>

According to Amitzur Ilan, "Israel's ability to cope better with the embargo situation was, by far, her greatest strategic asset."<sup id="cite_ref-235"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-235">[231]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-236"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-236">[232]</a></sup>

## Israeli usage of biological warfare

Research by Israeli historians [Benny Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Morris "Benny Morris") and [Benjamin Kedar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Kedar "Benjamin Kedar") show that during the 1948 war, Israel conducted a biological warfare operation codenamed "Cast Thy Bread." According to Morris and Kedar, the Haganah initially used typhoid bacteria to contaminate water wells in newly cleared Arab villages to prevent the population including militiamen from returning. Later, the biological warfare campaign expanded to include Jewish settlements that were in imminent danger of being captured by Arab troops and inhabited Arab towns not slated for capture. There were also plans to expand the biological warfare campaign into other Arab states including Egypt, Lebanon and Syria, but they were not carried out.<sup id="cite_ref-237"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-237">[233]</a></sup>

**Armistice Demarcation Lines of 1949 ([Green Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Line_(Israel) "Green Line (Israel)")):**

      Israeli controlled territory from 1949

In 1949, Israel signed separate [armistices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice "Armistice") with Egypt on 24 February, Lebanon on 23 March, Transjordan on 3 April, and Syria on 20 July. The Armistice Demarcation Lines, as set by the agreements, saw the territory under Israeli control encompassing approximately three-quarters of the prior British administered [Mandate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine "Mandatory Palestine") as it stood after [Transjordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate_of_Transjordan "Emirate of Transjordan")'s independence in 1946. Israel controlled territories of about one-third more than was allocated to the Jewish State under the UN partition proposal.<sup id="cite_ref-Brown2004_238-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Brown2004-238">[234]</a></sup> After the armistices, Israel had control over 78% of the territory comprising former Mandatory Palestine<sup id="cite_ref-239"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-239">[235]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-240"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-240">[236]</a></sup> or some 21,000 km<sup>2</sup> (8,000 sq mi), including the entire [Galilee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilee "Galilee") and [Jezreel Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jezreel_Valley "Jezreel Valley") in the north, the whole [Negev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negev "Negev") in south, [West Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Jerusalem "West Jerusalem") and the [coastal plain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_coastal_plain "Israeli coastal plain") in the center.

The armistice lines were known afterwards as the "[Green Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Line_(Israel) "Green Line (Israel)")". The [Gaza Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip") and the [West Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank "West Bank") (including [East Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Jerusalem "East Jerusalem")) were occupied by Egypt and Transjordan respectively. The [United Nations Truce Supervision Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Truce_Supervision_Organization "United Nations Truce Supervision Organization") and [Mixed Armistice Commissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_Armistice_Commissions "Mixed Armistice Commissions") were set up to monitor ceasefires, supervise the armistice agreements, to prevent isolated incidents from escalating, and assist other UN peacekeeping operations in the region.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (May 2021)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Just before the signing of the Israel-Transjordan armistice agreement, general Yigal Allon proposed a military offensive to conquer the West Bank up to the Jordan River as the natural, defensible border of the state. Ben-Gurion refused, although he was aware that the IDF was militarily strong enough to carry out the conquest. He feared the reaction of Western powers and wanted to maintain good relations with the United States and not to provoke the British. Moreover, the results of the war were already satisfactory and Israeli leaders had to build a state.<sup id="cite_ref-Shapira2014p173_241-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Shapira2014p173-241">[237]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Morris2009p79_242-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Morris2009p79-242">[238]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Shalom2002p174_243-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Shalom2002p174-243">[239]</a></sup>

### Casualties

Israel lost 6,373 of its people, about 1% of its population at the time, in the war. About 4,000 were soldiers and the rest were civilians.<sup id="cite_ref-politics_17-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-politics-17">[13]</a></sup>

The exact number of Arab casualties is unknown. One estimate places the Arab death toll at 7,000, including 3,000 Palestinians, 2,000 Egyptians, 1,000 Jordanians, and 1,000 Syrians.<sup id="cite_ref-onwar_120-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-onwar-120">[116]</a></sup> In 1958, Palestinian historian [Aref al-Aref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aref_al-Aref "Aref al-Aref") calculated that the Arab armies' combined losses amounted to 3,700, with Egypt losing 961 regular and 200 irregular soldiers and Transjordan losing 362 regulars and 200 irregulars. According to [Henry Laurens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Laurens_(scholar) "Henry Laurens (scholar)"), the Palestinians suffered double the Jewish losses, with 13,000 dead, 1,953 of whom are known to have died in combat situations. Of the remainder, 4,004 remain nameless but the place, tally and date of their death is known, and a further 7,043, for whom only the place of death is known, not their identities nor the date of their death. According to Laurens, the largest part of Palestinian casualties consisted of non-combatants and corresponds to the successful operations of the Israelis.<sup id="cite_ref-laurens_18-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-laurens-18">[14]</a></sup>

### Demographic outcomes

#### Arabs

During the [1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947%E2%80%931948_Civil_War_in_Mandatory_Palestine "1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine") and the 1948 Arab–Israeli War that followed, around 750,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled from their homes, out of approximately 1,200,000 Arabs living in former [British Mandate of Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine "Mandatory Palestine"), a displacement known to Palestinians as the _[Nakba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba "Nakba")_. In 1951, the UN Conciliation Commission for Palestine estimated that the number of Palestinian refugees displaced from Israel was 711,000.<sup id="cite_ref-244"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-244">[240]</a></sup>

According to estimate based on earlier census, the total Muslim population in Palestine was 1,143,336 in 1947.<sup id="cite_ref-245"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-245">[241]</a></sup> The [causes of the 1948 Palestinian exodus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_1948_Palestinian_exodus "Causes of the 1948 Palestinian exodus") are a controversial topic among historians.<sup id="cite_ref-246"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-246">[242]</a></sup> After the war, around 156,000 [Arabs remained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_citizens_of_Israel "Arab citizens of Israel") in Israel and became Israeli citizens.<sup id="cite_ref-247"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-247">[243]</a></sup>

Displaced Palestinian Arabs, known as [Palestinian refugees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugee "Palestinian refugee"), were settled in [Palestinian refugee camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_refugee_camps "Palestine refugee camps") throughout the Arab world. The United Nations established [UNRWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA "UNRWA") as a relief and human development agency tasked with providing humanitarian assistance to Palestinian refugees. Arab nations refused to absorb Palestinian refugees, instead keeping them in refugee camps while insisting that they be allowed to return.<sup id="cite_ref-Palestine_refugees-UNRWA_248-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Palestine_refugees-UNRWA-248">[244]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Jerusalem_Fund_249-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-Jerusalem_Fund-249">[245]</a></sup>

Refugee status was also passed on to their descendants, who were also largely denied citizenship in Arab states, except in Transjordan.<sup id="cite_ref-250"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-250">[246]</a></sup> The [Arab League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League "Arab League") instructed its members to deny Palestinians citizenship "to avoid dissolution of their identity and protect their right of return to their homeland."

Palestinian refugees and displaced persons and the lack of a [Palestinian right of return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_right_of_return "Palestinian right of return") remain major issues in the [Arab–Israeli conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict "Arab–Israeli conflict").

#### Jews

In the three years from May 1948 to the end of 1951, 700,000 Jews [settled in Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah "Aliyah"), mainly along the borders and in former Arab lands,<sup id="cite_ref-BennyMorris_32-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-BennyMorris-32">[28]</a></sup> doubling the Jewish population there.<sup id="cite_ref-251"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-251">[247]</a></sup> Of these, upwards of 300,000 [arrived from Asian and North African states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_Arab_and_Muslim_countries "Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries").<sup id="cite_ref-sachar_pp395-403_252-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-sachar_pp395-403-252">[248]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-253"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-253">[249]</a></sup> Among them, the largest group, over 100,000, [was from Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ezra_and_Nehemiah "Operation Ezra and Nehemiah"). The remaining came mostly from Europe, including 136,000 from the 250,000 displaced Jews of World War II living in [refugee camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displaced_persons_camps_in_post-World_War_II_Europe "Displaced persons camps in post-World War II Europe") and urban centers in Germany, Austria, and Italy,<sup id="cite_ref-254"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-254">[250]</a></sup> and more than 270,000 coming from Eastern Europe,<sup id="cite_ref-255"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-255">[251]</a></sup> mainly [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Romania#Post-War "History of the Jews in Romania") and [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland#Communist_rule:_1945%E2%80%931989 "History of the Jews in Poland"), over 100,000 each.

On the establishment of the state, a top priority was given to a policy for the "ingathering of exiles", and the [Mossad LeAliyah Bet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossad_LeAliyah_Bet "Mossad LeAliyah Bet") gave key assistance to the Jewish Agency to organise immigrants from Europe and the Middle East, and arrange for their transport to Israel. For Ben-Gurion, a fundamental defect of the State was that 'it lacked Jews'.<sup id="cite_ref-256"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-256">[252]</a></sup>

Jewish immigrants from Arab and Muslim countries left for numerous reasons. The war's outcome had exacerbated Arab hostilities to local Jewish communities. News of the victory aroused messianic expectations in Libya and Yemen; Zionism had taken root in many countries; active incentives for making aliyah formed a key part of Israeli policy; and better economic prospects and security were to be expected from a Jewish state.<sup id="cite_ref-sachar_pp395-403_252-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-sachar_pp395-403-252">[248]</a></sup>

Some Arab governments, Egypt, for example, held their Jewish communities hostage at times. Persecution, political instability, and news of a number of violent pogroms also played a role. Some 800,000–1,000,000 Jews eventually left the [Arab world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world "Arab world") over the next three decades as a result of these various factors.<sup id="cite_ref-sachar_pp395-403_252-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-sachar_pp395-403-252">[248]</a></sup> An estimated 650,000 of the departees settled in [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel "Israel").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBeker20054_257-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBeker20054-257">[253]</a></sup>

## Historiography

Since the war, different [historiographical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography "Historiography") traditions have interpreted the events of 1948 differently; in the words of the [New Historian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Historians "New Historians") [Avi Shlaim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avi_Shlaim "Avi Shlaim"), "each side subscribes to a different version of events."<sup id="cite_ref-:02_258-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:02-258">[254]</a></sup> In the Israeli narrative, the war is Israel's War of Independence.<sup id="cite_ref-:02_258-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:02-258">[254]</a></sup> In the Palestinian narrative, the War of 1948 is inextricable from the [Nakba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba "Nakba"), the Zionist movement is one of [settler colonialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism_as_settler_colonialism "Zionism as settler colonialism"),<sup id="cite_ref-259"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-259">[255]</a></sup> and the Israelis are seen as [conquerors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest "Conquest") and the Palestinians as victims.<sup id="cite_ref-:02_258-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:02-258">[254]</a></sup> The different narratives of 1948 reflect these different perceptions.<sup id="cite_ref-:02_258-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:02-258">[254]</a></sup>

An issue affecting the historiography of 1948 is access to sources and archives, which may have been destroyed, appropriated, censored, or otherwise made unavailable to some or all researchers.<sup id="cite_ref-:02_258-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:02-258">[254]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:2_260-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:2-260">[256]</a></sup> Linguistic barriers represent another hurdle, as most research is published exclusively in the author's native language and is not translated.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_260-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:2-260">[256]</a></sup>

The historiography of 1948 is tied to political [legitimacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_(political) "Legitimacy (political)") in the present and has implications for the [Israeli–Palestinian conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict "Israeli–Palestinian conflict").<sup id="cite_ref-:1_261-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:1-261">[257]</a></sup> According to [Avraham Sela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Sela "Avraham Sela") and Neil Caplan:

> A major reason for this grip of the past over the present is the unfulfilled quest of both Israelis and Palestinians for legitimacy, in one or more of the following three senses: (a) each party's sense of its own legitimacy as a national community entitled to its own sovereign state; (b) each party's willingness to grant legitimacy to at least part of the competing national narrative of the other; and (c) the international community's extension of legitimacy to the competing rights and claims of Israelis and Palestinians.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_261-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:1-261">[257]</a></sup>

The narratives of 1948 have also had implications for [Palestinian refugees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees "Palestinian refugees").<sup id="cite_ref-:2_260-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:2-260">[256]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 211">: 211 </span></sup> 

### Israeli narratives

The Israelis, whether or not they were conquerors, were irrefutably the victors of the war, and for this reason among others, "they were able to propagate more effectively than their opponents their version of this fateful war."<sup id="cite_ref-:02_258-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:02-258">[254]</a></sup> Only in 1987 was that narrative effectively challenged outside the Arab world.<sup id="cite_ref-:02_258-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:02-258">[254]</a></sup>

#### Zionist narrative

Avi Shlaim gives the conventional Zionist narrative or the "old history" of the 1948 war as follows:

> The conflict between Jews and Arabs in Palestine came to a head following the passage, on 29 November 1947, of the United Nations partition resolution that called for the establishment of two states, one Jewish and one Arab. The Jews accepted the U.N. plan despite the painful sacrifices it entailed, but the Palestinians, the neighboring Arab states, and the Arab League rejected it. Great Britain did everything in its power toward the end of the Palestine Mandate to frustrate the establishment of the Jewish state envisaged in the UN plan. With the expiry of the Mandate and the proclamation of the State of Israel, seven Arab states sent their armies into Palestine with the firm intention of strangling the Jewish state at birth. The subsequent struggle was an unequal one between a Jewish David and an Arab Goliath. The infant Jewish state fought a desperate, heroic, and ultimately successful battle for survival against overwhelming odds. During the war, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled to the neighboring Arab states, mainly in response to orders from their leaders and despite Jewish pleas to stay and demonstrate that peaceful coexistence was possible. After the war, the story continues, Israeli leaders sought peace with all their heart and all their might but there was no one to talk to on the other side. Arab intransigence was alone responsible for the political deadlock, which was not broken until President Anwar Sadat's visit to Jerusalem thirty years later.<sup id="cite_ref-:02_258-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:02-258">[254]</a></sup>

According to Shlaim, this narrative is "not history in the proper sense of the word," as most of the literature on the war was produced – not by professional academic historians – but rather by participants in the war, politicians, soldiers, and state-sponsored historians, as well as by sympathetic journalists, chroniclers, and biographers.<sup id="cite_ref-:02_258-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:02-258">[254]</a></sup> It also portrays Israelis as morally superior, lacks political analysis, and gives undue weight to "the heroic feats of the Israeli fighters."<sup id="cite_ref-:02_258-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:02-258">[254]</a></sup> This [nationalist narrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_historiography "Nationalist historiography") was taught in Israeli schools and used for gaining legitimacy internationally.<sup id="cite_ref-:02_258-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:02-258">[254]</a></sup>

#### New Historians

The standard Zionist narrative of the war remained unchallenged outside the Arab world until the war's fortieth anniversary, when a number of critical books came out, including [Simha Flapan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simha_Flapan "Simha Flapan")'s _The Birth of Israel: Myths and Realities_ (1987), [Benny Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Morris "Benny Morris")'s _The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem_ (1987), [Ilan Pappé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilan_Papp%C3%A9 "Ilan Pappé")'s _Britain and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1948–51_ (1988), and Shlaim's _Collusion Across the Jordan: King Abdullah, the Zionist Movement and the Partition of Palestine_ (1988).<sup id="cite_ref-:02_258-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:02-258">[254]</a></sup> These writers came to be known as [New Historians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Historians "New Historians") or "post-Zionists."_<sup id="cite_ref-:3_262-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:3-262">[258]</a></sup>_

According to Shlaim, the new historians disagreed with the Zionist narrative on six main points: British policy with regard to the Yishuv at the end of the Palestine Mandate, the military balance in 1948, the origins of the Palestinian refugee problem, the nature of relations between Israelis and Jordanians during the war, Arab aims in the war, and the reasons peace remained elusive after the war.<sup id="cite_ref-:02_258-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:02-258">[254]</a></sup>

Among their most vitriolic critics was [Shabtai Teveth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabtai_Teveth "Shabtai Teveth"), biographer of [David Ben-Gurion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ben-Gurion "David Ben-Gurion"), who published "The New Historians," a series of four weekly full-page articles attacking the new historians, in [Haaretz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haaretz "Haaretz") May 1989.<sup id="cite_ref-:02_258-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:02-258">[254]</a></sup> Teveth claimed that the new historiography was flawed in its practice and that it was politically motived, that it was pro-Palestinian and aimed to [delegitimize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegitimisation_of_Israel "Delegitimisation of Israel") the State of Israel.<sup id="cite_ref-:02_258-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:02-258">[254]</a></sup>

#### Neo-Zionist narratives

[Ilan Pappé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilan_Papp%C3%A9 "Ilan Pappé") identifies a turn in predominant Israeli narratives about 1948 in September 2000. In the climate of the [Second Intifada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada "Second Intifada") and in the [Post-9/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-9/11 "Post-9/11") period, "not only were Israel's brutal military operations against the Palestinians during the new intifada seen as justified, but so was their systematic expulsion in 1948."<sup id="cite_ref-:3_262-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:3-262">[258]</a></sup> Evidence of the expulsions, massacres, and war crimes of 1948 brought to light by the New Historians could no longer be ignored, but writers of what Pappé calls a "neo-Zionist" narrative justified these as necessary or unavoidable.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_262-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:3-262">[258]</a></sup>

In this period, the focus of Israeli historical writing on 1948 shifted largely from its human impact back to its military aspects.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_262-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:3-262">[258]</a></sup> Neo-Zionist writers were given selective access to top-secret material, to which writers critical of Zionism would not have been given access, and much of their work was published by the [Israeli Ministry of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Ministry_of_Defense "Israeli Ministry of Defense").<sup id="cite_ref-:3_262-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:3-262">[258]</a></sup>

Among those Pappé associated with the neo-Zionist perspective were [Benny Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Morris "Benny Morris") (who had become more outspokenly defensive of Zionism by this time), [Daniel Gutwein](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Daniel_Gutwein&action=edit&redlink=1 "Daniel Gutwein (page does not exist)") \[[he](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%93%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%92%D7%95%D7%98%D7%95%D7%95%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9F "he:דניאל גוטוויין")\], [Mordechai Bar-On](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordechai_Bar-On "Mordechai Bar-On"), [Yoav Gelber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Gelber "Yoav Gelber"), Tamir Goren, [Arnon Golan](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arnon_Golan&action=edit&redlink=1 "Arnon Golan (page does not exist)") \[[he](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%9F_%D7%92%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%9F "he:ארנון גולן")\], Alon Kadish, and [Yoav Peleg](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yoav_Peleg&action=edit&redlink=1 "Yoav Peleg (page does not exist)") \[[he](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%90%D7%91_%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%92 "he:יואב פלג")\], as well as the journal [_Techelet_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azure_(magazine) "Azure (magazine)") .<sup id="cite_ref-:3_262-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:3-262">[258]</a></sup>

### Palestinian narratives

Unlike Israeli narratives that shifted over the decades, Palestinian narratives of 1948 have been more or less constant, focusing on Palestinians' indigenous rights to Palestine, Palestinian victimhood, dispossession, displacement, exile, statelessness, and more "unrequited grievances against colonialism and Zionism."<sup id="cite_ref-:2_260-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:2-260">[256]</a></sup><sup><span title="Pages: 209–211">: 209–211 </span></sup>  The term '[Nakba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba "Nakba")' to describe the Palestinian catastrophe in the war of 1948 was coined in [Constantin Zureiq's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantin_Zureiq "Constantin Zureiq") 1948 book _[Ma'na an-Nakba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma%27na_an-Nakba "Ma'na an-Nakba")_.<sup id="cite_ref-263"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-263">[259]</a></sup> [Yoav Gelber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Gelber "Yoav Gelber") identifies [Arif al-Arif's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aref_al-Aref "Aref al-Aref") six volume _[an-Nakba](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=An-Nakba_(book)&action=edit&redlink=1 "An-Nakba (book) (page does not exist)")_  \[[ar](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A8%D8%A9_(%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8) "ar:النكبة (كتاب)")\] written in Arabic in the 1950s as thorough and notable.<sup id="cite_ref-264"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-264">[260]</a></sup>

Palestinian narratives have focused on countering the dominant Zionist narrative; the preeminent Palestinian historian of 1948 [Walid Khalidi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walid_Khalidi "Walid Khalidi") has dedicated much of his career to disproving the official Israeli narrative that the [1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion_and_flight "1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight") was voluntary.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_260-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:2-260">[256]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 211">: 211 </span></sup>

In the narratives of the wider Arab-Muslim world, 1948 is seen as an "Arab debacle," representative of the region's social and political decline from its "glorious distant past."<sup id="cite_ref-:2_260-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-:2-260">[256]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 210">: 210 </span></sup>  The official narratives of Arab states on 1948 tended to be [apologetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apologia "Apologia") with the goal of defending their political legitimacy, while the [Arab nationalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_nationalism "Arab nationalism") wrote with a focus on distilling and extracting historical lessons to galvanize Arab society, politics, and ideology in preparation for the next conflict with Israel – neither approach bridled itself too much with historical accuracy.<sup id="cite_ref-267"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-267">[263]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 6">: 6 </span></sup>

#### In the United States

The American journalist [Joan Peters'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Peters "Joan Peters") 1984 book _[From Time Immemorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Time_Immemorial "From Time Immemorial")_ had a massive impact on how 1948 was understood in popular and political narratives in the United States.<sup id="cite_ref-268"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-268">[264]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-269"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#cite_note-269">[265]</a></sup>

'Plan Dalet' or 'Plan D' was the name given by the Zionist High Command to the general plan for military operations within the framework of which the Zionists launched successive offensives in April and early May 1948 in various parts of Palestine. These offensives, which entailed the destruction of the Palestinian Arab community and the expulsion and pauperization of the bulk of the Palestine Arabs, were calculated to achieve the military fait accompli upon which the state of Israel was to be based.

(Ben Gurion) He also did not flinch from provoking the United Nations by breaking the truce agreement. But the limit of his fearlessness was a clash with a Western power. Vainly, the right and Mapam accused him of defeatism. He did not flinch from confronting them but chose to maintain good relations with the United States, which he perceived as a potential ally of the new state, and also not to provoke the British lion, even though its fangs had been drawn. At the end of the war, when Yigal Allon, who represented the younger generation of commanders that had grown up in the war, demanded the conquest of the West Bank up to the Jordan River as the natural, defensible border of the state, Ben-Gurion refused. He recognized that the IDF was militarily strong enough to carry out the conquest, but he believed that the young state should not bite off more than it had already chewed. There was a limit to what the world was prepared to accept. Furthermore, the armistice borders – which later became known as the Green Line – were better than those he had dreamed of at the beginning of the war. In Ben-Gurion's opinion, in terms of territory Israel was satisfied. It was time to send the troops home and start work on building the new nation.
