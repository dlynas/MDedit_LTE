	I had a pretty dramatic change. I was addicted to cocaine and valium, I had even bought 1000 valium tablets just for myself after I went a month without being able to get them because I never wanted to worry about not having them again. I was so depressed an anxious all the time, I was pretty certain that my life was going to end badly, I'd tried crack and heroin and I felt like it was only a matter of time before I became a total junkie and lost everything or died of an overdose.

	After non duality, I recognised that all the negative stories my abusive parents had taught me about myself are just stories. I'm not this worthless stain on the earth that they told me that I am. When I don't identify with thoughts I can see the beauty of my being. After a lifetime of never feeling even the slightest bit of love even from my parents I now recognise that I am the universe and love itself. I now have acess to more love than I could ever want any time I choose to recognise my true being. I never even made any kind of attempt to stop taking drugs but with this new realisation there was no point in them anymore so I just haven't found myself taking these drugs again since.

			Just by recognising your true being. When you just be in the stillness and the story disappears but you do not you start to realise that its not who you are. The more time spent as the true self and not inside a story the less relevant the stories become. You start to realise that who you truly are and the stories in your mind are not the same thing so even without getting rid of them they aren't even doing any harm. After that they kind of lose their grip and just fall away on their own.

				My practice is observing my physical movements, like noticing my feet moving on the pavement, or noticing my hands chopping vegetables, or even noticing another person limping.  I feel/see love radiating through it all.  I softly look at everything and feel the same thing.  It means being transparent, so that I can receive all purely.
				
				My practice is to notice thoughts arising, while knowing I am the deeper self.
				
				My practice is to intend a preference, and allow the divine to move me at the right timing, so that it happens perfectly.  
				
				My practice is that when some emotional suffering happens, I tune into the sensation of it within my body, and I just allow it to be,  since it is just an observable layer over my true being.

			For years, I had a daily mindfulness meditation practice. Now, my practice is far less structured and mostly involves doing self-enquiry-type practices when I get free moments during my day. I also listen to talks and read books when I feel compelled to do so.
			
			The book Beyond Mindfulness by Stephan Bodian helped me to understand non-dual practice and I continue to do some of the meditations it recommends. But teachings resonate differently with different people so it's important to find what works for you.

* 🟩 **[HeyStray](https://www.reddit.com/user/HeyStray)** ⬆️ 10 _(2023-04-01 05:31:15)_

	Before: wasn't thinking too much about other people,  was a very self interested individual.

	After: still a self interested individual, by nature, however I'm much more empathetic towards "evil" people, and "normal" folks in general. I tend more to lend a hand, live for others moreso than just myself.

	Sam Harris' talks of the lack of self, nondual meditation, and long conversations on free will have got me to realize how much more forgiving i ought to be towards myself and others.

		Thanks. I'm just listening to Sam Harris series on free will. That's a hard one for me to get my head around and a subject that is stalling my acceptance and understanding.

		* 🟧 **[HeyStray](https://www.reddit.com/user/HeyStray)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-04-01 07:53:57)_

			My stumbling upon Sam occurred on an LSD trip when I was questioning who I was, and how I got here. His bullseye approach in affirming that none of my actively produced thoughts are from me but occurring automatically clicked very vividly, as it was easy to recognize the fallacy of claiming authorship over every next thought during the trip.
			
			Delving into more of his talks and properly *understanding* them when I was sober was harder because it's all conceptually there, the only part lacking was my putting effort into using his guided meditations to notice the effortlessness in the next thought that appears, as well as the subsequent effortless actions.
			
			A big step for me was when I'd catch myself falling asleep, recognizing that it was due to some fantasy of a story 'I' was telling to lull myself to sleep. Of course, it's not actually me doing any of the storytelling, it all happens automatically. The fantasy story evaporates into thin air just like waking up from a dream once I become lucid. I sense this fantasy story-talk to fall asleep is universal, it only takes the right amount of luck to recognize.

	Same to what others have said:

	I’m much more open, understanding, and forgiving of others. I spend less, I no longer find completeness in things. There is a sense of wholeness now that was lacking for most of my life. The world is much more beautiful, it’s like there is a vividness to it I’d never seen before. I’m more open to life - like actual living things - than I was, a stillness of curiosity has seemed to develop and a slowing down to appreciate so much of what before I had taken for granted. My mind is much stiller, it’s still freaks out from time to time but it’s much easier to let that go than it ever has been.

	It's still early days (maybe a year), but I do feel like I take life less seriously and view my worries as less about me and more as just a narrative that is going to play out in whatever way it will.  Doesn't mean I don't sometimes forget and get stuck in a train of thought, but I can usually catch myself doing this fairly quickly and get off that train at the next stop. ;-)  I also think (hope) it's made me less judgmental about others and more empathetic, but it's hard to say.  At least I notice it a lot more when I do start to judge people and try to then defend their actions and change my thinking about them...

			Currently I try to get in at least 45 straight minutes per day of self inquiry, but sometimes add another 1 or 2 15--20 minute sessions at other times, plus I just try to self-inquire whenever I am not actively doing something (and listening/watching something), so while driving, walking the dog, when I wake up during the night and before falling back to sleep, etc.

			I should also clarify that I haven't had any "shifts" or "glimpses" for that matter.  I've had plenty of situations where perceptions got a little distorted, or I read something and got chills and ringing in my ears, but I don't think I would consider those shifts or glimpses, just kind of sensations/emotions.  I've not felt the kind of nondual lack of separation from other objects or connection with the larger Everything that is supposed to be one of the hallmarks of these things.  So while learning about these things from others and just having a regular practice has helped my "cognitive processing" to some extent, I'm still waiting for the other (only) shoe to drop, lol.

	It beautified the entire world, everything in it.....and I love beauty.  I feel grand affection for it all.  Everything I had wondered about was answered, like the inequality in life.....there is none!  Where was God?  Well right here, where everyone is.  

	My natural practice includes seeing more purely what is happening within and in the manifested world.  I had no teachings...I had a spontaneous awakening, knew nothing about enlightenment, so I searched for information on what had happened to me.  I did not know there were entire teachings about my experience.  It is good that it happened that way, because I cannot doubt what I experienced directly, and continue to experience.  Yes, my attention can still go wayward, but it returns to the purer center.  And then, it is as if it never went wayward, it is an amazing thing!

	Maturity , I've read so much , saw so much that I cant remember , and the spark of being that devoted seeker died so much that I didn't even feel like telling anybody .

	After sometime I started to see its beauty , its basically the endless happy ending . And from time to time I romanticize it , its is just beauty thats too cool for life it continues to surprise it with what it brings up .

	You can create your own myth about it and live it .

	An innocent calm cool maturity , like a subtle breath of fresh air above a slow moving river . And you connect everything to it , you see the beauty of the prophets and all those zen masters , they were all duping , just playing a game :).

	I create my own meditations , I created one which I call it the story telling meditation where I just ask about the story of anything and try to imagine it , look inside it for stories inside the story , and gnostically just keep going like this , as if Iam sculpting a piece of art inside another in real time :D.

	I can also brighten the electromagnetic light waves of the shadows coming through my eyes by enquiry :D.

	I've done enquiry so much that now if I do it I can get an orgasm :D

	Iam pretty crazy :D.

	Went from manic depression episodes, panic and anxiety attacks due to unhealed trauma brought on by the seemingly endless bucket of Christianity trying to fill myself with the promise that someone else loves me more than i ever could and i should be ashamed of my lifestyle and thoughts because it doesn't align with the teachings and dogma (tldr severe dad/god complex issues) to learning to love myself and accept that everything that happens needs to happen for me to be here and it's only happening because I AM here and if I weren't, it wouldn't.

	I still struggle with the lows and the anxiety but it's a lot more manageable now as I'm able to take a step back and observe it as 'it is because it is because it isn't without being".

	Continuously claiming the space in which I exist and allowing myself to flow rather than construct a path that goes against everything I am. Just being present a loooot more and UNDERSTANDING that I'm okay rather than telling myself I am.

	And also learning that everything is as it should be in it's connected state and only exists because I observe it and if it didn't exist neither would I in this moment, so choosing to be here and now is choosing to observe everything in it's chaos and beauty and seeing how connected every single cell is in this crazy thing we call life and appreciating how beautiful it is.

			Hmmm, I just kinda paid attention to thoughts as they came across my perception.
			
			I would notice my mood dip due to stresses at work or getting caught in traffic. I would learn to "catch" myself falling into a pit of dissatisfaction/anger/whatever. Once I was able to identify the thought as a separate occurrence it was then a small step in letting it go.
			
			Nowadays there is no "practice" as such. Stuff is just happening. 
			
			I read a lot of books on religion and philosophy. I travelled a lot and did a lot of psychedelics. I spent many days in solitude, hiking, playing drums, making art. Living. 
			
			Books that helped include:
			
			I am that - nisargadatta
			Spiritual enlightenment: the damnedest thing - jed mckenna
			Tao te Ching

	My emotions don't bother me like they used to when I would usually get triggered. They come and go faster, just like the thoughts that caused them. Depression has subsided, as well as anxiety, so i guess you can say i am more relieved, especially with the fact that i no longer need to search for anything.I can actually understand and relate to teachers. For example, if someone asks Rupert Spira or Tolle, etc, a question, I can usually answer it. Same thing when i read the bible. I know I'm a shit teacher as this is still kind of brand new to me...well, figuring out the illusion anyway. I don't desire the things I used to, and if i do have a desire i know that its not really relative to life itself and its just for fun i guess is what im trying to say?? I know objective experience won't make me truly happy.

	I can actually sit places without doing nothing and not get bored, especially if it's comfortable.

	Before I read the comments I'll add my bit so it isn't influenced by the others. 

	Essentially the before and after of it was. 

	Before: I used to think my thoughts and mind were important. I used to think my thoughts and mind _were me_. So this would lead to very difficult situations where sometimes I would have thoughts I didn't like that caused anxiety and worry and regret. Because I identified with my thoughts, clinging to some, resisting others, I was all mixed up and just had a lot of constant anxiety about something or the other. 

	After: after I realized my thoughts and mind _were not_ me the negative feelings associated with identification went away mostly. So I still think but I don't get caught up in my thoughts. And if I notice a negative feeling it's very easy to switch it off because I know it's not me and it _cannot_ affect the Self. The Self is constant and everything else is ephemeral. Once I could identify with True Self it was easy to deal with life's problems. And there can still be challenges, it's just that the reaction to the challenges used to be to deal with them while being anxious and frustrated, and now it's just dealing with them with grace and peace and effortlessness.
