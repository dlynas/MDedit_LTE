General polling rule of thumb: the degree to which public opinion on an issue is responsive to framing tweaks tells you a lot about how stable/deeply held those opinions are.

Marist had this: "A majority of Americans (52%) think Congress should raise the debt ceiling to avoid default and discuss spending cuts separately." So, basically, who knows? x.com/mkraju/status/â€¦

(Obviously, this is one of the high variance cases. A good counter example: there have been a ton of polls asking about striking down Roe in various ways that all produce basically similar results to the effect of its being highly unpopular.)

(Another counter example: you can ask the public any number of ways, and cutting Social Security is still not going to be popular.)

The glib takeaway from highly variant poll numbers is "lol this is meaningless." The more considered one is: taken together, the level of variance -- and the way that opinion varies -- can say a lot about how people think about issues.

I find it's kind of useful to think of public opinion on any issue as operating along, at minimum, a two-dimensional scale: not only what share of the population supports any given action, but also how much they know/care about the issue.

(Anybody who has ever talked to another person about politics should not be surprised to find that, if you talk to 1,000 people about their political views, it will be even more complicated in aggregate. And yet, patterns emerge. That's why public opinion is fascinating!)

My theory is that any issue where the two parties are at complete loggerheads probably comes down to the fact that it polls differently depending on how you ask the question

A statewide grand jury that was empaneled in central Florida issued three more reports from its 18-month-long investigation of the causes and consequences of recent illegal immigration to Florida. Here's a summary of the recommendations:

I thought the rule was to frame the question until you get the answer you want

Public opinion can be Both/And/Everything Everywhere All At Once

The debt ceiling / budget distinction is one that only people who follow US politics pretty closely are probably even aware of. So, to your point, framing is everything because many respondents don't really have an opinion on the question's content.

Public opinion manipulated by media reflects media manipulation. As

popularized "How'd that happen!" My prohetic tweet:

If a poll found that 50% of Americans blamed Repugs for this and 50% blamed Dems, the American political news media would congratulate itself on a job well done.

In which diner in Arkansas was this poll conducted?

None of them seem to be serving their constituents, let alone listening to them.

A statewide grand jury that was empaneled in central Florida issued three more reports from its 18-month-long investigation of the causes and consequences of recent illegal immigration to Florida. Here's a summary of the recommendations:

In this case it may show how little people understand about the issue.

Might as well be asking this poll in french, if most Americans aren't going to understand it anyway.

I looked at the cross tabs on the CNN poll. Every single question had a 0% "unsure" result. There are ALWAYS "I don't know"s. And Half the respondents said they were following the debt ceiling news "not much" or "not at all", and STILL had a firm opinion? Fishy.

AAPOR Day 1 takeaways, extremely condensed edition: Text-to-web polling is useful, but maybe not always for reaching the demo/ideol groups you'd assume. Not \*everything\* is expressive responding. There is, in the world, insufficient coffee for me personally.
