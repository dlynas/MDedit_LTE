## I'm looking for games with great simulated economies

> By economies, I mean -- I want the quality feeling of really starting a business and dominating a market.  Your suggestion can be as abstract as you want it to be.  
> 
> 
> I know mmos are probably going to be the top suggestion, and that's perfectly fine -- know that I'm just not \*really\* looking for that.  PvP economic stuff is fun, and I appreciate those recommendations -- but I mostly want a single player simulated economic experience.

	I am creating a society sim that has economy within it.  Here is my pitch for it if you are interested.

	>Imagine a city builder where you don't construct buildings but construct society itself. In this innovative government simulation game, players act as omnipotent rulers, setting the laws and policies that guide a civilization's development from the Stone Age to the modern era and beyond. Your decisions shape the evolution of your society as it autonomously builds, progresses, and reacts to the challenges you set, from natural disasters to economic crises. Analyze the impact of your governance through detailed reports and watch your civilization advance through the ages based on the rules you dictate. This game offers a unique blend of strategy, simulation, and deep historical exploration, appealing to fans of complex management and societal development games.

	To expand on that a bit, it has a rewind system that creates checkpoints that you can rewind to any time you make a major decision, you can view your web of decisions and the detailed reports within each node.  You can also save out your decision tree to use as a template for future plays if you find a good mix.  Your ultimate goal is to shape the perfect society.  I want to have both large and small scale multiplayer at some point but that would require quite a bit of external funding as it would essentially become a massive version of those tile based mobile games but of much higher quality levels.  For small scale multiplayer that would be simpler as each player would be a tile on the global map that contains their society, and the host sets the time scale, other players can request increases or decreases to the time scale.  This multiplayer update would add PVP wars as well so your two societies can fight over resources on other tiles or direct assaults on your core society tile.  I have loads of other plans and small details but I don't want to give it all away.

			Still working on it, mostly in spare time though as no publisher seemed interested in funding it so it's probably going to be bootstrapped.
