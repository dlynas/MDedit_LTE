	One fact will silence 40 scientists. Forty facts won't silence one fool.

		A rumor travels halfway round the world, while the truth is still putting on its britches!

			The only thing that can travel faster that light is gossip in a courthouse.

		If only it were true.  The problem is that you can be both a fool and a scientist.

			A fool is a fool.

				And they hold every profession imaginable.

					Yes. And that doesn't disparage the profession; it's only that fools are fools.  Their profession is meaningless. Don't throw out the institution with the bath water.

						Don't cut down a tree because of a few rotten apples.

							If more people knew the rest of that quote they'd realise that they've been using it incorrectly all along.

								Can you dm or comment the rest, please. Thank you in advance.

					* 🟥 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-03-14 14:05:27)_

						I didn’t.  I’m just saying the quote isn’t true because you can be both a fool and a scientist.

							Great people who contributed greatly to the growth of society believed in christals and similar areas with little degree of proof.

							That's not the intent of the quote, and you know it. "Scientist" here means a responsible person. Not a fool. That's the obvious interpretation. All quotes would be garbage if you just assume everyone is a fool.

							* ⬛️ **[deleted]** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-03-14 15:02:23)_

								Eh, I wouldn’t call anyone a scientist just because they’re capable of thinking rationally or logically.
								
								Sounds like a quote someone with a biology degree wrote to tug themselves off a bit is all.
								
								But even beyond that facts don’t silence anyone because what is fact is always heavily debated.  It really depends on the degree of proof.

									...and you seem to be coming from the latter part of the quote.

										Great, thanks!

									*  **[nal14n](https://www.reddit.com/user/nal14n)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-03-15 05:17:50)_

										Where is your degree of proof for that hypothesis.

	Source for this Heinlein quote?

		Do you seriously expect to start a rebellion with picayune stuff like that?
		It's not picayune stuff, because it acts directly on their emotions, below the logical level. You can sway a thousand men by appealing to their prejudices quicker than you can convince one man by logic. It doesn't have to be a prejudice about an important matter either.

	Let's define the word fool and proceed. Seems like we have a nice debate going on here.
