**Norbert Wiener** (November 26, 1894 – March 18, 1964) was an American [computer scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist "Computer scientist"), [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician") and [philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher "Philosopher"). He became a professor of mathematics at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology") ([MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT "MIT")). A [child prodigy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_prodigy "Child prodigy"), Wiener later became an early researcher in [stochastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_processes "Stochastic processes") and mathematical [noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(signal_processing) "Noise (signal processing)") processes, contributing work relevant to [electronic engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_engineering "Electronic engineering"), [electronic communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_communication "Electronic communication"), and [control systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system "Control system").

Wiener is considered the originator<sup id="cite_ref-W1948_3-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-W1948-3">[3]</a></sup> of [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics "Cybernetics"), the science of communication as it relates to living things and machines,<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

> After much consideration, we have come to the conclusion that all the existing terminology has too heavy a bias to one side or another to serve the future development of the field as well as it should; and as happens so often to scientists, we have been forced to coin at least one artificial neo-Greek expression to fill the gap. We have decided to call the entire field of control and communication theory, whether in the machine or in the animal, by the name _Cybernetics_, which we form from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") [κυβερνήτης](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BA%CF%85%CE%B2%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82#Ancient_Greek "wikt:κυβερνήτης") or _[steersman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmsman "Helmsman")_.

with implications for [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), [systems control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_control "Systems control"), [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology"), [neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience "Neuroscience"), [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), and the organization of [society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society "Society"). His work heavily influenced computer pioneer [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann "John von Neumann"), information theorist [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon "Claude Shannon"), anthropologists [Margaret Mead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Mead "Margaret Mead") and [Gregory Bateson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Bateson "Gregory Bateson"), and others.

Wiener is credited as being one of the first to theorize that all intelligent behavior was the result of feedback mechanisms, that could possibly be simulated by machines and was an important early step towards the development of modern [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence").<sup id="cite_ref-beginsOfAi_5-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-beginsOfAi-5">[5]</a></sup>

## Biography\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norbert_Wiener&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Biography")\]

### Youth\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norbert_Wiener&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Youth")\]

Wiener was born in [Columbia, Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia,_Missouri "Columbia, Missouri"), the first child of [Leo Wiener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Wiener "Leo Wiener") and Bertha Kahn, [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish "Jewish") immigrants from [Lithuania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Jews "Lithuanian Jews") and [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Jews "German Jews"), respectively. Through his father, he was related to [Maimonides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides "Maimonides"), the famous [rabbi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi "Rabbi"), philosopher and physician from [Al Andalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Andalus "Al Andalus"), as well as to [Akiva Eger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiva_Eger "Akiva Eger"), [chief rabbi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_rabbi "Chief rabbi") of [Posen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pozna%C5%84 "Poznań") from 1815 to 1837.<sup id="cite_ref-Montagnini_6-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-Montagnini-6">[6]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: p. 4">: p. 4 </span></sup> 

Leo had educated Norbert at home until 1903, employing teaching methods of his own invention, except for a brief interlude when Norbert was 7 years of age. Earning his living teaching German and Slavic languages, Leo read widely and accumulated a personal library from which the young Norbert benefited greatly. Leo also had ample ability in mathematics and tutored his son in the subject until he left home. In his autobiography, Norbert described his father as calm and patient, unless he (Norbert) failed to give a correct answer, at which his father would lose his temper.

In “The Theory of Ignorance”, a paper he wrote at the age of 10, he disputed “man’s presumption in declaring that his knowledge has no limits”, arguing that all human knowledge “is based on an approximation”, and acknowledging “the impossibility of being certain of anything.”<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

He graduated from [Ayer High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayer_High_School "Ayer High School") in 1906 at 11 years of age, and Wiener then entered [Tufts College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tufts_College "Tufts College"). He was awarded a [BA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts "Bachelor of Arts") in mathematics in 1909 at the age of 14, whereupon he began graduate studies of [zoology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoology "Zoology") at [Harvard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard "Harvard"). In 1910 he transferred to [Cornell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University "Cornell University") to study philosophy. He graduated in 1911 at 17 years of age.<sup id="cite_ref-NYT_Norbert_Wiener_obituary_8-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-NYT_Norbert_Wiener_obituary-8">[8]</a></sup>

### Harvard and World War I\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norbert_Wiener&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Harvard and World War I")\]

The next year he returned to Harvard, while still continuing his philosophical studies. Back at Harvard, Wiener became influenced by [Edward Vermilye Huntington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Vermilye_Huntington "Edward Vermilye Huntington"), whose mathematical interests ranged from axiomatic foundations to engineering problems. Harvard awarded Wiener a [PhD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhD "PhD") in June 1913, when he was only 19 years old, for a dissertation on [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic "Mathematical logic") (a comparison of the work of [Ernst Schröder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Schr%C3%B6der_(mathematician) "Ernst Schröder (mathematician)") with that of [Alfred North Whitehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead "Alfred North Whitehead") and [Bertrand Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell "Bertrand Russell")), supervised by Karl Schmidt, the essential results of which were published as Wiener (1914). He was one of the youngest to achieve such a feat. In that dissertation, he was the first to state publicly that [ordered pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair "Ordered pair") can be defined in terms of elementary [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory "Set theory"). Hence [relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_(mathematics) "Relation (mathematics)") can be defined by set theory, thus the theory of relations does not require any axioms or primitive notions distinct from those of set theory. In 1921, [Kazimierz Kuratowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazimierz_Kuratowski "Kazimierz Kuratowski") proposed a simplification of Wiener's definition of ordered pairs, and that simplification has been in common use ever since. It is (x, y) = {{x}, {x, y}}.

In 1914, Wiener traveled to Europe, to be taught by [Bertrand Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell "Bertrand Russell") and [G. H. Hardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy "G. H. Hardy") at [Cambridge University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge "University of Cambridge"), and by [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert") and [Edmund Landau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Landau "Edmund Landau") at the [University of Göttingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_G%C3%B6ttingen "University of Göttingen"). At Göttingen he also attended three courses with [Edmund Husserl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Husserl "Edmund Husserl") "one on Kant's ethical writings, one on the principles of Ethics, and the seminary on Phenomenology." (Letter to Russell, c. June or July, 1914). During 1915–16, he taught philosophy at Harvard, then was an engineer for [General Electric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric "General Electric") and wrote for the _[Encyclopedia Americana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia_Americana "Encyclopedia Americana")_. Wiener was briefly a journalist for the _[Boston Herald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Herald "Boston Herald")_, where he wrote a feature story on the poor labor conditions for mill workers in [Lawrence, Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence,_Massachusetts "Lawrence, Massachusetts"), but he was fired soon afterwards for his reluctance to write favorable articles about a politician the newspaper's owners sought to promote.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

Although Wiener eventually became a staunch pacifist, he eagerly contributed to the war effort in World War I. In 1916, with [America's entry into the war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_in_World_War_I "United States in World War I") drawing closer, Wiener attended a training camp for potential military officers but failed to earn a commission. One year later Wiener again tried to join the military, but the government again rejected him due to his poor eyesight. In the summer of 1918, [Oswald Veblen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Veblen "Oswald Veblen") invited Wiener to work on [ballistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistics "Ballistics") at the [Aberdeen Proving Ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen_Proving_Ground "Aberdeen Proving Ground") in Maryland.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> Living and working with other mathematicians strengthened his interest in mathematics. However, Wiener was still eager to serve in uniform and decided to make one more attempt to enlist, this time as a common soldier. Wiener wrote in a letter to his parents, "I should consider myself a pretty cheap kind of a swine if I were willing to be an officer but unwilling to be a soldier."<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> This time the army accepted Wiener into its ranks and assigned him, by coincidence, to a unit stationed at Aberdeen, Maryland. World War I ended just days after Wiener's return to Aberdeen and Wiener was discharged from the military in February 1919.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>

### After the war\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norbert_Wiener&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: After the war")\]

Norbert Wiener was regarded as a semi-legendary figure at MIT.

Norbert (standing) and Margaret Wiener (sitting) at the [International Congress of Mathematicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Congress_of_Mathematicians "International Congress of Mathematicians"), Zurich 1932

Wiener was unable to secure a permanent position at Harvard, a situation he attributed largely to [anti-Semitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Semitism "Anti-Semitism") at the university and in particular the antipathy of Harvard mathematician [G. D. Birkhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_David_Birkhoff "George David Birkhoff").<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> He was also rejected for a position at the [University of Melbourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Melbourne "University of Melbourne"). At [W. F. Osgood's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Fogg_Osgood "William Fogg Osgood") suggestion, Wiener was hired as an instructor of mathematics at [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"), where, after his promotion to professor, he spent the remainder of his career. For many years his photograph was prominently displayed in the [Infinite Corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Corridor "Infinite Corridor") and often used in giving directions, but as of 2017, it has been removed.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

In 1926, Wiener returned to Europe as a [Guggenheim scholar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guggenheim_scholar "Guggenheim scholar"). He spent most of his time at Göttingen and with Hardy at Cambridge, working on [Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion "Brownian motion"), the [Fourier integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_integral "Fourier integral"), [Dirichlet's problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet%27s_problem "Dirichlet's problem"), harmonic analysis, and the [Tauberian theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tauberian_theorems "Tauberian theorems").

In 1926, Wiener's parents arranged his marriage to a German immigrant, Margaret Engemann; they had two daughters. His sister, Constance (1898–1973), married mathematician [Philip Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Franklin "Philip Franklin"). Their daughter, Janet, Wiener's niece, married mathematician [Václav E. Beneš](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A1clav_E._Bene%C5%A1 "Václav E. Beneš").<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> Norbert Wiener's sister, Bertha (1902–1995), married the botanist [Carroll William Dodge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_William_Dodge "Carroll William Dodge").

Many tales, perhaps apocryphal, were told of Norbert Wiener at MIT, especially concerning his absent-mindedness. It was said that he returned home once to find his house empty. He inquired of a neighborhood girl the reason, and she said that the family had moved elsewhere that day. He thanked her for the information and she replied, "That's why I stayed behind, Daddy!"<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> Asked about the story, Wiener's daughter reportedly asserted that "he never forgot who his children were! The rest of it, however, was pretty close to what actually happened…"<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

In the run-up to [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") (1939–45) Wiener became a member of the [China Aid Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Aid_Society "China Aid Society") and the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced German Scholars.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> He was interested in placing scholars such as [Yuk-Wing Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuk-Wing_Lee "Yuk-Wing Lee") and [Antoni Zygmund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoni_Zygmund "Antoni Zygmund") who had lost their positions.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>

### During and after World War II\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norbert_Wiener&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: During and after World War II")\]

During [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), his work on the automatic aiming and firing of [anti-aircraft guns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_gun "Anti-aircraft gun") caused Wiener to investigate [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory "Information theory") independently of [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon "Claude Shannon") and to invent the [Wiener filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_filter "Wiener filter"). (To him is due the now standard practice of modeling an information source as a random process—in other words, as a variety of noise.) Initially his anti-aircraft work led him to write, with [Arturo Rosenblueth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arturo_Rosenblueth "Arturo Rosenblueth") and [Julian Bigelow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Bigelow "Julian Bigelow") the 1943 article 'Behavior, Purpose and Teleology', which was published in [Philosophy of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_Science "Philosophy of Science"). Subsequently his anti-aircraft work led him to formulate [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics "Cybernetics").<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ontologyOfTheEnemy_21-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-ontologyOfTheEnemy-21">[21]</a></sup> After the war, his fame helped MIT to recruit a research team in [cognitive science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science "Cognitive science"), composed of researchers in [neuropsychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychology "Neuropsychology") and the mathematics and [biophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biophysics "Biophysics") of the nervous system, including [Warren Sturgis McCulloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch "Warren Sturgis McCulloch") and [Walter Pitts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Pitts "Walter Pitts"). These men later made pioneering contributions to [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") and [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence"). Soon after the group was formed, Wiener suddenly ended all contact with its members, mystifying his colleagues. This emotionally traumatized Pitts, and led to his career decline. In their biography of Wiener, [Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flo_Conway "Flo Conway") and [Siegelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Siegelman "Jim Siegelman") suggest that Wiener's wife Margaret, who detested McCulloch's [bohemian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemianism "Bohemianism") lifestyle, engineered the breach.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

Wiener later helped develop the theories of cybernetics, [robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics "Robotics"), computer control, and [automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation "Automation"). He discussed the modeling of neurons with [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann "John von Neumann"), and in a letter from November 1946 von Neumann presented his thoughts in advance of a meeting with Wiener.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>

Wiener always shared his theories and findings with other researchers, and credited the contributions of others. These included [Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") researchers and their findings. Wiener's acquaintance with them caused him to be regarded with suspicion during the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War"). He was a strong advocate of automation to improve the standard of living, and to end economic underdevelopment. His ideas became influential in [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India"), whose government he advised during the 1950s.

After the war, Wiener became increasingly concerned with what he believed was political interference with scientific research, and the militarization of science. His article "A Scientist Rebels" from the January 1947 issue of _[The Atlantic Monthly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic_Monthly "The Atlantic Monthly")_<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> urged scientists to consider the ethical implications of their work. After the war, he refused to accept any government funding or to work on military projects. The way Wiener's beliefs concerning nuclear weapons and the Cold War contrasted with those of von Neumann is the major theme of the book _John Von Neumann and Norbert Wiener_.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup>

Wiener was a participant of the [Macy conferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences "Macy conferences").

### Personal life\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norbert_Wiener&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Personal life")\]

In 1926 Wiener married Margaret Engemann, an assistant professor of modern languages at [Juniata College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juniata_College "Juniata College").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (May 2021)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> They had two daughters. Opinions are not all positive on Margaret's impacts on Wiener's career.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>

Wiener admitted in his autobiography _I Am a Mathematician: The Later Life of a Prodigy_ to abusing [benzadrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzadrine "Benzadrine") throughout his life without being fully aware of its dangers.<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>

Wiener died in March 1964, aged 69, in [Stockholm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm "Stockholm"), from a heart attack. Wiener and his wife are buried at the Vittum Hill Cemetery in [Sandwich, New Hampshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich,_New_Hampshire "Sandwich, New Hampshire").

### Awards and honors\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norbert_Wiener&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Awards and honors")\]

## Work\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norbert_Wiener&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Work")\]

> Information is information, not matter or energy.

Wiener was an early studier of [stochastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_processes "Stochastic processes") and mathematical [noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(disambiguation)#Noise_in_mathematics "Noise (disambiguation)") processes, contributing work relevant to [electronic engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_engineering "Electronic engineering"), [electronic communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_communication "Electronic communication"), and [control systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system "Control system"). It was Wiener's idea to model a signal as if it were an exotic type of noise, giving it a sound mathematical basis. The example often given to students is that English text could be modeled as a random string of letters and spaces, where each letter of the alphabet (and the space) has an assigned probability. But Wiener dealt with analog signals, where such a simple example doesn't exist. Wiener's early work on information theory and signal processing was limited to analog signals, and was largely forgotten with the development of the digital theory.<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>

Wiener is one of the key originators of [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics "Cybernetics"), a formalization of the notion of [feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback "Feedback"), with many implications for [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), [systems control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_control "Systems control"), [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology"), [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), and the organization of [society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society "Society"). His work with cybernetics influenced [Gregory Bateson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Bateson "Gregory Bateson") and [Margaret Mead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Mead "Margaret Mead"), and through them, [anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology "Anthropology"), [sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology "Sociology"), and [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education "Education").<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup>

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiener_process_3d.png/230px-Wiener_process_3d.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wiener_process_3d.png)

In the mathematical field of probability, the "[Wiener sausage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_sausage "Wiener sausage")" is a neighborhood of the trace of a [Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion "Brownian motion") up to a time _t_, given by taking all points within a fixed distance of Brownian motion. It can be visualized as a cylinder of fixed radius the centerline of which is Brownian motion.

### Wiener equation\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norbert_Wiener&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Wiener equation")\]

A simple mathematical representation of [Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion "Brownian motion"), the [Wiener equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_equation "Wiener equation"), named after Wiener, assumes the current [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity") of a [fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid "Fluid") particle fluctuates randomly.

### Wiener filter\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norbert_Wiener&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Wiener filter")\]

For signal processing, the [Wiener filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_filter "Wiener filter") is a [filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(signal_processing) "Filter (signal processing)") proposed by Wiener during the 1940s and published in 1942 as a classified document. Its purpose is to reduce the amount of [noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise "Noise") present in a signal by comparison with an estimate of the desired noiseless signal. Wiener developed the filter at the Radiation Laboratory at MIT to predict the position of German bombers from radar reflections. It is necessary to predict the position, because by the time the shell reaches the vicinity of the target, the target will have moved, and may have changed direction slightly. They even modeled the muscle response of the pilot, which led eventually to cybernetics. The unmanned V1's were particularly easy to model, and on a good day, American guns fitted with Wiener filters would shoot down 99 out of 100 V1's as they entered Britain from the English channel,<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2020)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> on their way to London. What emerged was a mathematical theory of great generality—a theory for predicting the future as best one can on the basis of incomplete information about the past. It was a statistical theory that included applications that did not, strictly speaking, predict the future, but only tried to remove noise. It made use of Wiener's earlier work on [integral equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_equations "Integral equations") and [Fourier transforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transforms "Fourier transforms").<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup>

### Nonlinear control theory\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norbert_Wiener&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Nonlinear control theory")\]

Wiener studied [polynomial chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_chaos "Polynomial chaos"), a key piece of which is the Hermite-Laguerre expansion. This was developed in detail in _Nonlinear Problems in Random Theory_.

Wiener applied Hermite-Laguerre expansion to nonlinear system identification and control. Specifically, a nonlinear system can be identified by inputting a white noise process and computing the Hermite-Laguerre expansion of its output. The identified system can then be controlled.<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup>

### In mathematics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norbert_Wiener&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: In mathematics")\]

Wiener took a great interest in the mathematical theory of [Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion "Brownian motion") (named after [Robert Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Brown_(Scottish_botanist_from_Montrose) "Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)")) proving many results now widely known, such as the non-differentiability of the paths. Consequently, the one-dimensional version of Brownian motion was named the [Wiener process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process "Wiener process"). It is the best known of the [Lévy processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9vy_process "Lévy process"), [càdlàg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A0dl%C3%A0g "Càdlàg") stochastic processes with stationary statistically [independent increments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_increments "Independent increments"), and occurs frequently in pure and applied mathematics, physics and economics (e.g. on the stock-market).

[Wiener's tauberian theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener%27s_tauberian_theorem "Wiener's tauberian theorem"), a 1932 result of Wiener, developed [Tauberian theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tauberian_theorem "Tauberian theorem") in [summability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summability_theory "Summability theory"), on the face of it a chapter of [real analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis "Real analysis"), by showing that most of the known results could be encapsulated in a principle taken from [harmonic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_analysis "Harmonic analysis"). In its present formulation, the theorem of Wiener does not have any obvious association with Tauberian theorems, which deal with [infinite series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_series "Infinite series"); the translation from results formulated for integrals, or using the language of [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis "Functional analysis") and [Banach algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_algebra "Banach algebra"), is however a relatively routine process.

The [Paley–Wiener theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paley%E2%80%93Wiener_theorem "Paley–Wiener theorem") relates growth properties of [entire functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entire_function "Entire function") on **C**<sup>n</sup> and Fourier transformation of Schwartz distributions of compact support.

The [Wiener–Khinchin theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener%E2%80%93Khinchin_theorem "Wiener–Khinchin theorem"), (also known as the _Wiener – Khintchine theorem_ and the _Khinchin – Kolmogorov theorem_), states that the power spectral density of a wide-sense-stationary random process is the Fourier transform of the corresponding autocorrelation function.

An [abstract Wiener space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Wiener_space "Abstract Wiener space") is a mathematical object in [measure theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_theory "Measure theory"), used to construct a "decent", strictly positive and locally finite measure on an infinite-dimensional vector space. Wiener's original construction only applied to the space of real-valued continuous paths on the unit interval, known as [classical Wiener space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Wiener_space "Classical Wiener space"). Leonard Gross provided the generalization to the case of a general [separable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_space "Separable space") [Banach space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space "Banach space").

The notion of a Banach space itself was discovered independently by both Wiener and [Stefan Banach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Banach "Stefan Banach") at around the same time.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup>

His work with [Mary Brazier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Brazier "Mary Brazier") is referred to in [Avis DeVoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avis_DeVoto "Avis DeVoto")'s _As Always, Julia_.<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup>
