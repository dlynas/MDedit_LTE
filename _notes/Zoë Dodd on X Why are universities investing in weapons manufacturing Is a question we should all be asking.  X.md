Why are universities investing in weapons manufacturing? Is a question we should all be asking.



Where is pension fund being invested? How many of us know? I haven't got a clue. Could be arms, oil, Pharma etc, etc.

Our pensions, our taxes. We have no say in where our money goes. We should

Why universities won't divest from investing in weapons manufacturing is a good follow up question

One hundred years ago, American universities still formally affirmed their Christian character and Christian values had a natural and expected place in American higher education. What happened?

Which universities? Be specific

And why are politicians? Gives them the wrong incentives when making decisions.



I would be afraid of the laser weapons

Holy fuck. Because war exists, we need brilliamt people working to keep our country safe and it offers excellent opportunity to learn applied physics. If we weren’t leading the way in weapons manufacturing we would instead be relying on purchasing foreign weapons? Which like????

One demand students are calling for is Israeli divestment. Divestment is not a new request. In fact, it’s been asked for many times, most notably in the 80s to protest South African apartheid. What is less talked about is why colleges will resist divestment more than ever. /1

USA is defense companies & corps in trench coat doesn't give a shit about it's citizens. We have 600k homeless, 40+ million food insecure, infrastructure crumbling, ppl 1 health event from financial ruin, most live paycheck to paycheck but we have a trillion for other countries? x.com/IanJaeger29/st…

To make sure they train students to design the weapons and get campus access for recruiting

It’s the only thing America manufactures

If you invest in a broad diversified portfolio, it includes all sectors. You have to specify to exclude military contractors (as Quaker institutions do), or alcohol/tobacco/firearms, or fossil fuels. Add Israel? Even more complicated.

Because it's one of the US's consistently most profitable industries (and we live in a capitalist hellscape).

Agreed that is a very good question

It's the largest and most steady employer in the United States

Who needs morality when you have profitability? 

We are. No answers have been offered thus far.
