## Destiny made Israel look worse (timestamps included)

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Hasan_Piker/comments/1bfr4by/destiny_made_israel_look_worse_timestamps_included/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hasan_Piker/comments/1bfr4by/destiny_made_israel_look_worse_timestamps_included/)

> **WARNING: LONG ASS POST**
> 
> I haven’t watched Hasan’s reaction yet because I’m a filthy YouTube watcher that see’s ads at the top of the hour 😞 so this post consists of my personal thoughts.
> 
> **I genuinely believe Destiny made the Israeli side of this debate look worse and anyone that’s pro-Israel should be *fucking embarrassed* that they had Destiny represent them.** Note, it was a 5-hour debate so I can’t remember *everything* off the top of my head. I remember mentally taking notes and writing a couple time stamps last night but there was a lot.
> 
> **I’ll stick to three main points.** Please note that Destiny made a fool of himself much more often than this but these three *really* stuck out to me.
> 
> **Point 1:** There was a point where Destiny asked Rabbani and Norm a question about how the early Zionists wanted validation and support from Western powers. Rabbani described this as them being “imperial stooges.” Destiny then bought up a *genuinely dumbfuck ass question:* “If early Israel saw themselves as a Western fashioned nation, how could they have imagined that engaging in displacing 400k+ Arabs wouldn’t have tripped any moral flags in the West?”
> 
> Rabbani, very correctly, answered the question by saying the West is **literally fucking built on the displacement of indigenous populations.** As he said, “removing dark people is intrinsic to Western history.” I have no idea how Destiny thought this was some form of “gotcha” or an own. **1:08:30 is the timestamp for this in the Lex Fridman video.**
> 
> The next two are *very* damning and I genuinely feel embarrassed for anyone that’s pro-Israel given Destiny represented them in this debate.
> 
> **Point 2:** There was a point in the debate when they began discussing when in the past there could have been peace. I don’t have a specific timestamp for this because I genuinely do believe you should take the time to watch this part on your own. **The timestamp is the section titled “Peace” and it starts at 3:28:34.** 
> 
> Mr. Rabbani and Norm argued that the Palestinians had followed international law and recognized Israel by 1993. Then, in the [2000 Camp David Summit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Camp_David_Summit), with the help of Bill Clinton, the Israeli’s offered Arafat the “most generous deal” they had received thus far. I’ve linked the Wikipedia article for a brief summary but it really doesn’t do it justice. Watch the debate portion or read up on more detailed sources for the talks. I believe it was 92% of the West Bank. Arafat rejected this deal.
> 
> Naturally, Destiny and Mr. Morris used this to argue that “the Palestinians have always rejected a state.” Mr. Rabbani and Mr. Finkelstein argued that offer by the Israeli’s didn’t meet international law. They then argued that in nearly all diplomatic cases, the Palestinians did their best to abide by international law and the Israeli’s never extended the same charity to them. The Camp David Summit offer would still allow 80% of the settlers to remain in the West Bank, the issue of East Jerusalem wasn’t resolved, and the right of return wasn’t granted to the Palestinians. These are all violations of international law.
> 
> Destiny argued that international law is meaningless and that the Palestinian and Israeli leadership should engage in bilateral diplomacy to resolve the issue. He fully acknowledged that Israel broke international law and that international law hasn’t gotten the Palestinians anywhere so they must make concessions to Israel.
> 
> **My mind was genuinely blown at this point.** This is literally fucking admitting that Israel is the bad guy. He fully admits they break international law **and** international law hasn’t gotten the Palestinians any closer to a state. My brother in Christ, the reason “international law hasn’t gotten the Palestinians anywhere” is because Israel completely refuses to follow it. **You’re fucking admitting Israel is the bad guy.** 
> 
> Also, what is this bullshit about “bilateral diplomacy to resolve the issue rather than international law?” Does he not see the inherent power imbalance between the two parties? “Bilateral diplomacy” would literally result in the Palestinians making all the concessions and Israel making none.
> 
> I couldn’t believe what I was hearing in all honesty. He was literally just admitting Israel is the bad guy lmao.
> 
> **Point 3:** I didn’t think Destiny could stoop any lower but he continues to surprise me. This part was in the section “Hope for the future” and approximately at 4:46:05. Rabbani told Destiny that he watched some of Destiny’s “research streams” and calls Destiny out because in the stream, Destiny said that “Jim Crow was not apartheid but Arab states not giving citizenship to Palestinian refugees is apartheid.” Destiny then doubles down on that take and then goes as far as to say “nuking Gaza wouldn’t be genocide.” I won’t say anything more about this because I’m sure you guys know my thoughts.
> 
> **Conclusion**
> 
> Destiny was way out of his depth here. His sophistry and debate bro techniques didn’t work *at all* on Rabbani and Norm. Benny Morris, while having gross views, at least didn’t display an intentional attempt to engage in bad faith. Morris also showcased his knowledge on this topic.
> 
> If after this you’re still a Destiny fan, you’re beyond redemption. Forget morality, you don’t have enough of a brain to make worthwhile opinions if you defend Destiny in this debate. He was objectively outclassed and made a fool of himself to the point where he made Israel look worse.

	If we're going to be honest it's not as if any Morris did well either.

	The Israeli position is genuinely indefensible if you see the Palestinians as human beings.

	If you don't see the Palestinians as human beings and rather as rabid animals that need to be contained then the Israeli position makes sense.

	Haven't watched it yet because 5 hours of Destiny...fuck that. Might watch some highlights or Hasans stream, did he watch the whole thing?

	Anyway I just wanted to know, wtf is the nuke comment? What did Norm say to that? Was there an explanation? How could he possibly explain that? I'm truly trying to wrap my head around how his brain is working here, HOW WOULD IT NOT BE FUCKING GENOCIDE TO NUKE AN ENTIRE POPULATION AM I LOSING MY FUCKING MIND?! 

	Genuinely might be one of the craziest most evil things I've ever heard him say. Had no idea he could get worse but here we are.

		I haven’t watched Hasan’s reaction in full yet. I’m watching it right now while doing some work. In regard to the debate, it was 70% a talk between the other 3. Destiny didn’t talk *as much.* When he did talk, it was still insufferable.
		
		Regarding the nuke thing, he said “I don’t know if Israel nuking all 2 million people in Gaza would qualify as genocide because genocide requires intent.” Yes, he’s literally that stupid. 4:46:10 in case you just want to watch the part about Jim Crow not being apartheid and a few mins later, him following up that he doesn’t know if nuking Gaza would be genocide.

		Don't forget when him and Benny openly scoffed that Palestinians are starving. Later he said the Houthis are starving people through their attacks on merchant ships, unlike the """"starving"""" people in Gaza.
		
		He then also claimed it's okay to bomb kids if you think they left a fisherman's shack that was supposedly a Hamas compound (how many times have we heard that one?). 
		
		So yeah, dumb, psychotic take after dumb, psychotic take. I wouldn't be surprised if he was on the Hasbara payroll, although I bet he would do this garbage for free just for the rage bait.

		* 🟧 **[LyheGhiahHacks](https://www.reddit.com/user/LyheGhiahHacks)** ⬆️ 7 _(2024-03-16 12:10:28)_

			Even the *mainstream news* in my country showed the starvation of Palestinians in gaza. It was both heartbreaking and enraging to see month old babies that were just about skeletons, anyone denying that it's happening are pure evil. As a new mother, I find so it deeply disturbing, and soul-crushing. Especially after seeing Israeli mothers with their own babies out there fucking protesting against Palestinian babies getting aid, disgusting behaviour, I don't know how they live with themselves.

		I can help explain it hopefully. The definition of genocide necessitates a special a kind of intent in order to only capture cases where the killing of the group was the atomic purpose (no pun intended). It's analogous to hate crimes, i.e. you can commit non-hate crimes on marginalized groups or its members depending on the intention of the attacker. 
		
		It's not impossible to imagine Israel using a nuke for explicitly strategic purposes (whether this is moral or not is not relevant) where the ethnic/racial background of the people isn't a factor in the decision, and that ethnic/racial group's destruction isn't the aim, so it wouldn't be considered a genocide. [Oblique intent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention_(criminal_law)#:~:text=Oblique%20intent%3A%20the%20person%20has,the%20'virtually%20certain'%20test) doesn't apply because of the special requirement.  Btw this isn't my definition, its [the UN's](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/genocide.shtml).

			It’s already a genocide. Israel would let the 2.0 million displaced Palestinians die because they want to build beach high rise apartments in Gaza. Why do you think there have already been auctions selling that land and architecture renderings for the beach property.
			
			Many Israeli gov’t officials have openly said genocidal statements about the Palestinian people.

	Regarding peace negotiations I'm surprised nobody on the pro Palestinian side ever brings up 2014. 

	Seems to be a perfect example of Palestinian landmark concessions and Israel STILL rejected the deal, purely because Netanyahu didn't want peace with Hamas.

		Hell, go back even further. The Israelis intentionally sabotaged the PLO and propped up Hamas because they wanted more conflict &amp; an unstable Palestinian movement. Israel has done nothing but agitate for years, and yet these two guys would have you believe they're innocent. It's just laughable.

	As Finkelstein (sp?) points out multiple times,  Destiny showed up to a discussion with published scholars having only studied Wikipedia as a primary source.  As Finkelstein also points out, Destiny doesn’t even have enough self awareness to see how stupid that it made him look. 

	Once I realized that was the extent to which Destiny chose to prepare for this conversation the rest just felt like a waste. I also get that Destiny is a frustrating guy but I don’t think screaming at one another and shouting repeated phrases over one another accomplishes much of any of the goals they could have had in doing this.

		* 🟧 **[AngelBCHI](https://www.reddit.com/user/AngelBCHI)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-03-24 00:31:10)_

			Well obviously he’s going to say Jim Crow was wrong if you ask him on a public livestream full of viewers. And if you agree that he is wrong then what’s the problem with my comment? The reason why it’s horrific is because he is blatantly denying history, and the fact that he says nuking Gaza would not be genocide in the same sentence after spending hours denying Israel’s proven genocidal intent makes his whole argument look even more ghoulish.

		I know I’m right and I know he’s wrong. He’ll never admit he was blatantly wrong about so much shit so there’s no point talking to him. It’ll just open me up to harassment from his KiwiFarms ass fans.
