## “Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers..." - Dwight D. Eisenhower

> *“Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. This is not a way of life at all in any true sense. Under the clouds of war, it is humanity hanging on a cross of iron.” - Dwight D. Eisenhower*

> Feel like this is an apt quote to share given the current state of international affairs. A reminder that resources are finite and because of this the costs of war extend far beyond the battlefield.

	It’s hard to imagine how just a few years ago people in position of power could actually “think”

		Not only in power. He was a general.  The top allied general in charge of the European theater of World War Two before becoming president. And a republican. But peace was his aim and his concern was for the poor and hungry.

	This is such a classic quote, and we've obviously never learned from it. Ike also coined the term, and warned us about, the military-industrial complex. But it's thriving today more than ever, sucking money away from healthcare, education, and so much more.

		Unfortunately, plenty of people claim things like "war is good for the economy". Explaining basic economics is hard.

		It’s also no longer relevant and propagates a false narrative / dichotomy that makes the issues much harder to address.

			Don’t hold back, just say what you really think.
			
			I was not referring to food.
			
			As to all the others, yes that is exactly what I am saying.
			
			If reason had not failed, violence would not have been required.
			
			Please forgive my vacuous lack of thought and reason.
			We can’t all be as brilliant as you. If we were, you wouldn’t be special anymore.

					I think the point you’re missing is that the opposition in your scenarios were unreasonable. The Confederacy, The Nazis, generic bad guys, Etc. 
					
					They’re not saying to let violent individuals do whatever they want because meeting violence with violence would be unreasonable. They’re saying the very fact that a violent conflict was necessary was a sign that somewhere along the line “reason” failed.

	Jesus. This was a conservative when I was born. How we went from Ike to Nixon to Reagan to Trump is a pure horror story, exactly the mess DDE was trying to warn us against.

	It’s easy to point to this and bemoan how much the republican party has changed. (Eisenhower was a republican president, if anyone wasn't sure.)  But the truth isn’t so simple.  In some ways, the repubs haven’t changed at all.

	After WW2, Eisenhower was insanely popular. Both parties were clamoring for him to be their candidate. I don’t remember how the repubs got him, but Ike was a sure victory.

	The problem with this country isn’t that people like Trump run for president. It’s that far, far too many people simply vote for the most famous person on the ticket. That’s how Reagan got elected too. That’s the republican strategy. Get the more famous candidate.

	The solution is simple; we need a smarter electorate. Which means we need a better education system. Which means making changes to our tax system, which means taking power away from the rich and powerful who like things just the way they are.  Simple, but not easy.

	Or we can follow the path of every other rich and powerful empire in history and let the rich and powerful people drive us to ruin just so they can stay on top of their local heaps. I guess we need better educated rich people too. They need to learn that the good of the whole is better for them and their progeny in the long run than just focusing on the good of the self — like Trump and his class of people.

	How do we get more Eisenhowers to actually run in this shit-show we call American politics? How do we get smart people who are not actually famous to be elected? Let’s solve those problems and all the other ones should get taken care of. Let’s fix our education system. We need to put education in the hands of teachers and education professionals. We need to DOUBLE the pay for teachers so we can attract the best teachers to the field. Education needs to be INDEPENDENT from politics and government, and non-centralized, equally funded, and free for all.

	Finland did it by making private schools illegal. That forced rich people to send their kids to public schools. And suddenly, education got better. But we also need to equalize the funding across the socio-economic spectrum. It’s a big job, but it’s just as important as national defense. ***Let’s fund education the same way we fund the military***. It is that important to the survival of this country.

	Let’s work on this.

		I'd love to hear your suggestions - not a taunt, I really would. Many of the issues you mention needing thoughtful correction have been known for decades without significant improvement. Global warming, education, etc. You speak with clarity, something I often miss in these discussions, and appear to have given the matter a lot of thought - what do you believe has to be done in order to effect the positive changes that would have such a beneficial impact for everyone?

			Thank you. I actually have been thinking about this for several years. Waaay too much info for a reddit post. I’m currently working with a documentary producer (just preliminary meetings so far, but it’s going well.) With any luck we’ll start production in early 2025. After the election, if such a project even makes sense anymore. If not, I’ll be in Europe somewhere watching the decline and fall of the USA from a distance.

			* 🟦 **[lostntheforest](https://www.reddit.com/user/lostntheforest)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-04-30 13:21:06)_

				Thanks for your response, and efforts in the documentary -i hope it goes well. Your last sentence made me laugh, I'm not sure why, or maybe it was a gurgling death rattle. If you have time -Any recommended reads/authors/sources of information etc?

			Not just Moonmanetc - what do any of you think can be done? One thought I had is that all documentation coming from our government should be written in plain, easily explainable language.

	I miss when leaders were well versed in speech, or felt like they had to be and were embarrassed if they weren’t.  Even the politicians I like (ish) now don’t have much in the way of quotable speech.

	If Ike ran as a Democrat today, Fox and all the other opinion shows pretending to be the news would call him a socialist.

	Please listen to this entire speech in its entirety.

	This is the farewell address of a man who created the U.S. economy as it was in his own lifetime and as it is today. And he saw what he had set in motion. In spite of his regret and his warning and the popularity and almost ubiquity of this knowledge, here we are. Exactly where he feared we would be when he spoke these words.

	And all on our own, by our own hand, as a result of our own decisions.

* 🟩 **[esleydobemos](https://www.reddit.com/user/esleydobemos)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-04-30 19:28:40)_

	This might be the most poignant quote of modern times. Too bad it has fallen on deaf ears for all of this time.

	"The primary aim of modern warfare, in accordance with the principles of double think, the same simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the Inner Party, is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living."

	A great sentiment and it may even have been true when he said it but then people make the mistake of thinking it’s applicable today - it isn’t. Our surplus production as a society is massive, we don’t need to make choices between funding militaries and feeding, clothing and taking care of people - just reroute unhealthy concentrations of capital and be vigilant of anti-trust issues.

	Said by the man that did more to establish the US military-industrial complex than any other person. 

	Also said by the guy that 100% capitulated to the USSR in the final months of WWII and by doing so set the stage for the Cold War.
