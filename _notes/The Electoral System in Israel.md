**The principles upon which the electoral system is based**

The general framework for the elections was laid down in article 4 of the _Basic Law: The Knesset_, and according to it the Knesset is to be elected in general, country-wide, direct, equal, secret and proportional elections. This article can only be amended by a vote of a majority of the Knesset members.

The principle of the generality of the elections ensures the active right of every Israeli citizen, who is at least 18 years old, to vote and the right of every Israeli citizen, who is at least 21 years old, to be elected. Even though the _Basic Law: The Knesset_ gave the legislator the power to deny the right to vote to anyone as it may see fit, the Knesset has never made use of this power. Those holding certain official positions, such as the President of the State, the State Comptroller, judges or _dayanim_, career officers, and senior civil servants, may not stand for election to the Knesset.

The principle of country-wide elections states that Israel is a single electoral district insofar as the distribution of Knesset seats is concerned. Direct elections mean that the voter elects the Knesset directly, rather than an electoral college (as is the case in the election of the President in the United States). Equal elections apply to equality amongst the votes given, and the Supreme Court laid down that the principle of equality relates to equality of opportunities for all the lists participating in the elections as well.

The principle of secrecy ensures fairness in the elections and aspires to prevent the placing of effective pressure on voters, since no one has any way of knowing how they actually voted. The principle of proportionality manifests itself in that all the lists, which get past the qualifying threshold, are represented in the Knesset by a number of members which is proportional to their electoral strength.

**The frequency of elections**

The Knesset elections are supposed to take place every four years. The Knesset can decide, by an ordinary majority, to dissolve itself and call for early elections. The elections to the second (1951), fifth (1961), tenth (1981), eleventh (1984), thirteenth (1992) and fourteenth (1996) Knessets were all held before the due date. The Knesset can also decide, by a special majority, to prolong its term beyond four years. This happened in the cases of the third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh Knessets, each of which served for more than four years. The elections to the eighth Knesset (1973) were delayed because of the Yom Kippur War. Since the coming into force of the new Basic Law: the Government towards the elections to the 14th Knesset, early elections are to be held under the following circumstances: A decision by the Prime Minister to dissolve the Knesset, a decision by the Knesset to dissolve itself before its term is completed, a vote on a motion of no-confidence in the Prime Minister, and the failure to pass the budget law within three months of the beginning of the financial year.
