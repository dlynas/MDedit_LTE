	How is this legally allowed to happen?

		They have all kinds of bullshit laws to justify it. 
		
		For example, it's illegal for a Palestinian to make any modifications to their homes. When one family built an extra room as their daughter had gotten married and was pregnant and they needed room for the new family, the israelis found out and took the house. Another family begin to grow vegetables in their back yard.
		.. which counted as a modification so the Israeli courts took their house. 
		
		The family that built the extra room...what the courts did was make that "illegal" extra room available to Israelis, so settlers moved into it WHILE THE ORIGINAL FAMILY WAS STILL THERE and basically made life so miserable for that family that the end result was they ended up with the entire house. Which of course was the plan from the beginning. And they will give 'open house tours' to settlers and tourists, unannounced, while the Palestinian families are sitting right there eating their breakfast, parading a line of laughing people through the house, pointing out amenities and saying what a good deal it is, and the family can't do a single thing about it.
		
		Edit:
		Another fucked up detail:
		
		many of the roads these houses are on...and have BEEN on for generations, have been "sterilized"(as the soldiers call it) by the IDF. As in, they have decided that no Arabs can walk on it, only Israelis. This means that some Palestinians can't use their front door. They have to circle around,cut through back alleys and CLIMB IN THEIR OWN BACK WINDOWS to enter their home. Of course, if an Israeli comes to the house, THEY can use the front door which the Palestinians cannot. 
		
		This is one small detail in a full litany of abuses suffered by the Palestinians for the duration of the occupation. The IDF itself tells its soldiers that the idea is to ALWAYS remain an intimidating presence for the express purpose of keeping down the morale of the Arabs. For instance, IDF soldiers themselves have stated that there is often no reason for why a group of soldiers will storm into a random household in the middle of the night, waking the occupants and then confining them all to one room, allowing no one to enter or leave-, including for work or school-giving permission at their own whim for the occupants to use the bathroom and eat-  for days at a time. It is a tactic designed to make their presence felt and keep the Palestinians docile and afraid
		..this is not hyperbole or idle accusation, this is factual information.
		
		And they have the AUDACITY to act shocked at what eventually happened. The Israeli zionist government itself, and it's treatment of Palestinians , is the single GREATEST threat to the safety and security of its Jewish citizens.

			How the hell do you move into an occupied home that doesn't want your there and make yourself such a pest that the family leaves and continue on about your life? Like, what the fuck is going through a person's brain that, not even as an argument of morality but rather mentality, allows them to do something like that? Just imagine for a second of being in the position of the "Settler" (we really need to stop using that word, and use something more appropriate). It's genuinely psychotic.

				Google it, this is common knowledge and has been for a while. THis stuff is very [well documented](https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories/report-israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories/) by the UN, Amnesty international and others. There's so many reports out there so take your pick. Over and over again this stuff is found in violation of international law.
				
				>Tens of thousands of Palestinians remained at risk of forced evictions in Israel and the OPT, including some 5,000 living in shepherding communities in the Jordan Valley and South Hebron Hills. Israeli authorities demolished 952 Palestinian structures across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, displacing 1,031 Palestinians, and affecting the livelihoods of thousands of others.
				
				>On 4 May, the Israeli Supreme Court upheld a decision to forcibly transfer over 1,000 residents of Masafer Yatta in the South Hebron Hills from their ancestral land, which Israel had designated as “firing zone 918”, a military training zone closed to Palestinian access.
				
				>In July, the Israeli Supreme Court legalized the settlement outpost of Mitzpe Kramim, built on private Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank, claiming that it was “purchased in good faith”. This reversed its 2020 decision that ordered the government to evacuate the outpost.
				
				>According to OCHA, 2022 was the sixth consecutive year that saw an increase in state-backed settler violence against Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, reaching a peak in October during the olive harvest season. The Israeli army and police continued to fail to investigate complaints by Palestinians about such violence.
				
				>In Israel, the authorities continued to deny official recognition to 35 Palestinian villages in the Negev/Naqab, depriving them of essential services. In January, the Israeli Land Authority and the Jewish National Fund began planting trees on lands belonging to the village of Saawa al-Atrash in the Negev/Naqab to forcibly transfer its Palestinian population.

		[Some context on this actual case](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/15819s1/comment/jt8aeiv/), for those who are interested, from when this was brought up earlier. What I wrote then: 
		
		The case in question was an eviction following a 45 year court case.
		
		The case from the video looks to be the eviction of the Ghaith-Sub Laban family (same old woman in the video and in some of the articles linked below). They have been living since the 1950's in an Old City (Jerusalem, which is also identifiable as the location, not a "settlement") apartment that was Jewish owned before all Jewish residents were expelled in 1948.
		
		It was a complicated case, in Israeli courts for 45 years. The family had the option at one point to remain as tenants while acknowledging that they didn't own it. They elected to continue fighting it in court with a different strategy and lost. They were evicted here after they refused to leave following the court order.
		
		You will find extremely different accounts of what is going on here based on the source that you are looking at. For example, compare [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/11/israel-expels-sub-labans-from-their-home-in-jerusalems-old-city) (very anti-Israel) with Haaretz (Israel extreme left) with [Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinian-family-evicted-from-jerusalem-home-after-decades-long-legal-battle/) (Israeli center) with [CAMERA](https://www.camera.org/article/the-facts-that-al-jazeera-missed-on-the-sub-laban-property-dispute/) (piece on the case from 2016).
		
		What is clear though (whether or not you agree with the court ruling) is that this is not just some group of orthodox Jewish men (or "settlers" as any left-leaning or anti-Israel publication likes to label) who randomly decided "let's kick people out of their house today" and were allowed to do so. This was an eviction following the end of a 45 year legal dispute after the family refused to vacate the property.

		The settlers called the police, claiming Rafat assaulted them. When they arrived, the police immediately arrested Rafat, and for the next seven hours kept him with his arms handcuffed and his legs bound.
		
		Rafat was released on bail on terms that included a restraining order from the Old City for two weeks. A few days later, the family was fined NIS 48,500 (nearly $13,000) to pay for 160 hours of policing, the private contractor company that vacated the house, and the legal expenses of the settlers who took over their home."

He tells them that the land of other people (who aparently, god does not prefer because they are bad, mmmmk?) belongs to them, and that they will eventually settle there through force. It's explicit, and this is the second time he forcibly removes people from the land, don't forget Noah and his ark and the death of everyone but his family, so he can settle the entire earth. It's all ridiculously founded on removing people from their land, it's the bedrock of the entire story.

		Basically, Jordan took the land and cleansed Jewish people from it. Then settled Palestinian refugees in them in exchange for a small rent. Israel took that land and kept that deal as is. Descendents of the original families that owned those properties sued that the property was originally thiers and the only reason they lost that property was because their family was cleansed by the government of Jordan. Israel courts agreed and granted the properties back to the original settlers. 
		
		Morally it can still be gray because the Palestinians owned these homes for over 50 years.

	* 🟨 **[eriverside](https://www.reddit.com/user/eriverside)** ⬆️ 16 _(2024-03-13 08:41:56)_

		This one is a long story. Jews had bought the house pre-1948. Following the war that part of Jerusalem was taken by Jordan. Jordan expelled all the jews there and gave those properties to palestinians. In 1967 the area came back under Israeli control. Since then the owners of those properties have been trying to get them back. This is a case that made headlines a couple years ago. 
		
		After a 45 year legal battle, the palestinian family refused to recognize that they weren't the proper owners, wouldn't pay rent, so the courts ordered the eviction. This is the eviction. 
		
		If Israel didn't respect Palestinian rights, they wouldn't drag a court case 45 years when they had the evidence of the deed of sale to the jewish family pre-1948.
