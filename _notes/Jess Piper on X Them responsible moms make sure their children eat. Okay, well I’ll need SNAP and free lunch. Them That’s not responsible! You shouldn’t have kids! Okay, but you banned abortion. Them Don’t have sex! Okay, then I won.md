Them: responsible moms make sure their children eat. Okay, well I’ll need SNAP and free lunch. Them: That’s not responsible! You shouldn’t have kids! Okay, but you banned abortion. Them: Don’t have sex! Okay, then I won’t date Them: See? Women create incel culture!



...and if you DO date, then they whinge about your body count.

No, them: Where's the dad? He makes sure there is food on the table. He is the provider. That's his job. That is his role.

Not one single dime of YOUR money should be spent on drag story time. Donate NOW to make sure it doesn’t happen.

Us: Can we at least get good healthcare for pre-natal, labor/delivery, and post-partum? Them: Nah, that's socialist. Our grandmothers just had their babies at home and went right back to the kitchen, you can too.

And from what I’ve seen, women seem to have less issue with “no sex” than men. To those men, I say, be careful what you wish for!

Let's pretend contraception doesn't exist.

Who would’ve thought that the person you met in a bar at 2am had unprotected sex with the first day you met them wasn’t a good person to start a life with and have kids.

Women: the cause of all society's problems!

Or just pay for your kids lunch like everyone has from the beginning of America. FFS.

Are these the sort of conversations taking place within your head? Maybe try talking to someone. Seems like you may have some issues.

You know you can dare and have sec with making kids.

SNAP isn’t YOU making sure YOUR children eat, it’s US making sure YOUR children eat. It’s pathetic GET A JOB.

Do you always fabricate dialogues in your head which are unrepresentative of any actual positions?

if you require government assistance to feed your children, you shouldn't have children. Its really not rocket science. if only there were some kind of device that could be used to prevent pregnancy. Ill invent one. Ill call it a "condom". Ill be rich! ...anyone got any sheep

I can make my kid a packed lunch for like $0.75. His mom would rather pay. I don't know why. Oh, right, because she'd have to make it.

“Okay, then I won’t date.” Logic chain broken here.

Any able-bodied parents who rely on govt welfare just to feed their kids ought to feel deeply ashamed. There is absolutely no excuse for not providing the basic necessities for your children. Period.

Just date for marriage with responsible men.

This is quite the stretch…. Even for you….

Not one single dime of YOUR money should be spent on drag story time. Donate NOW to make sure it doesn’t happen.
