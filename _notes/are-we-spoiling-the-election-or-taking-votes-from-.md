## Are we "spoiling" the election or "taking votes" from other parties? Do those parties own your vote? Why do they keep complaining but never fix the voting system? How is it democracy if the ruling parties rig the system to keep you from ever having a real choice?

"Are you concerned with a third party?
I am very concerned. I mean, I talked to Joy about it all the time.
Stein's vote total exceeded Trump's margin of victory.
So had she perhaps not been part of it, Hillary Clinton would have been president.
Okay, we hear this all the time, so let's talk about it.
First of all, it's not true.
Polls show that the vast majority of people who voted green would not have voted
at all if we weren't on the ballot.
So basically, they're mad that we inspire people to get out in vote.
Second, this whole idea that certain politicians are entitled to your vote is ridiculous.
They don't own your vote, they have to earn your vote.
If you let other people tell you how to vote, you'd give away your power
to make politicians listen to you and represent you.
That's just how democracy works.
And finally, they've been calling us spoilers since Ralph Nader's 2000 campaign.
And that's also nonsense.
But you know what?
There's a solution to this supposed problem they're whining about.
It's called ranked choice voting.
We've been fighting for ranked choice voting for decades.
But the politicians in power refuse to pass it, because they don't want you to have a real choice.
And that's one more reason they don't deserve your vote.
The establishment smears outsiders like me, and it shames voters like you who just want better choices.
But how is it democracy if the ruling parties rig the system to keep you from ever having a real choice?
Without freedom of choice, there is no democracy.
And by exercising your right to vote for a candidate of your choosing,
you are making this a better democracy."
