## Anyone attempting to make sense of things right now? 

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/1bpbrl3/anyone_attempting_to_make_sense_of_things_right/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/1bpbrl3/anyone_attempting_to_make_sense_of_things_right/)

> I can’t recall a time in my life (and I’m not young) when the world has felt so confused and confusing. Is there anyone who’s been coming up with interesting new ideas as to why? I’m a fan of Mark Fisher, and I quite like the garbled dystopian tech of Nick Land, so that style of vibe but a more recent analysis of the past decade or so?

	I've been reading Naomi Klein's Doppelgänger which I feel does a really great investigation into the far-right/Qanon/antivax world and understanding how people come to adopt and advocate that kind of worldview. It's the closest I've found to a good explanation of why the world feels so ... odd ... right now. A unique combination of economic/political/biological/psychological factors all thrown in the pot together during COVID have fast tracked us to this weird Tower of Babel landscape where the political right and left seem to be saying the same things but with absolute opposite implications.

				Points to Han for being accessible. Yeah, it sometimes strays into feeling just a little too simple and doesn't feel entirely satisfying or engaging compared to the usual fare, but I guess that's also part of his point. 
				
				And there's that quip about why Heidegger was more popular than similar contemporaries: "Because he was so much harder to understand."

	If i were to explain the current state of things, I'd go to Deleuze and his idea of 'Societies of Control'. This is also closely related to the economic model of post-Fordism. People in purely disciplinary societies were more oppressed in some ways, sure, but at least they had a clear idea of what they were supposed to do. The current economic paradigm makes people feel lost, while at the same time being designed to control you in ways you don't even consider or notice.

		We are still very much under a disciplinary framework. I don’t see why we should believe otherwise

		* 🟧 **[vikingsquad](https://www.reddit.com/user/vikingsquad)** ⬆️ 7 _(2024-03-28 12:15:42)_

			Control is best understood as a lamination over discipline, not a superseding structure entirely.

			* 🟦 **[FoolishDog](https://www.reddit.com/user/FoolishDog)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-03-28 12:46:34)_

				Right, I wasn’t sure if OP was trying to say that control societies had replaced disciplinary ones which is why I was trying to point out that disciplinary matrixes don’t just disappear.

		* 🟧 **[KindOfMisanthropic](https://www.reddit.com/user/KindOfMisanthropic)** ⬆️ 4 _(2024-03-28 12:02:04)_

			In some areas, sure. And it's not a black and white thing. Some parts are still disciplinary, while others are control based. Prisons, for instance, are still for the most part disciplinary. Schools are more of a mixed bag I'd say.
			
			A lot of this also depends on which part of the world you live in. Western societies are more control based these days, while eastern countries are generally more disciplinary.
			
			One well-known example is the chinese social credit system. We have a social credit system in the west also, but it's not as transparent as it is in China. In China, they have a clear idea of what increases social credit and what decreases it. In the west, we are always to some extent left guessing what increases and decreases social status.

		What's funny is that AC himself was asked the question in some interviews "so if we're all lost in this incomprehensible hyperreal complexity, who has a better idea?" and he's like, "nobody, lol, it's a big problem".

						Which would be incorrect. 
						They are American from German Descent. 
						So they are not German. They have German Ancestors. Which is why they don’t have any words for their dissociative complex. The mid 19th century is 150-200 years ago. Which is approximately 7 generations.

	I don’t much care for anyone else’s theories right now, I think they’re mainly all off the mark.

	I think it’s that the first wave of children of divorce after NFD was passed grew up and are now the age of majority. This is where all/most the confusion around identity and culture comes from. 

	The internet, meanwhile, is so vast we’re in a kind of new dark ages. This dark age is one of “overexposure,” where everything is so “bright” you can’t anything see clearly. Too many records, as opposed to too few. 

	And the economy has tightened back into the conditions that brought about Yellow Journalism. The same way the media landscape of the latter half of the 19th century turned into speculative Wild West, so too with the tech boom of the late 20th century. The early 20th century is the regulation of the 19th century boom; the early 21st century is the regulation of the 20th century boom.

	We keep applying theory meant to analyze the 19th century tech boom’s effects to the 20th century boom, but it’s not a workable critical framework for that purpose — we’re no longer in a dialectical arrangement; there’s a third value now. We’re firmly in hyper reality now, and it has replaced the ground. We need a sort of post-Baudrillardean/McLuhanian theory.

		Agreed. One of the major changes between the 90s and now that I've been thinking of  this week comes from the context of Hiphop and drug dealing. In music and Hiphop culture, we've seen the rise of the user/dealer-- someone who sells drugs to subsidize their own drug habit while also representing the artistic and aesthetic goals of the audience. Future, is the biggest example of this, passing out nihilism like it's a bundle of percosets. 
		
		Information, advertising, and entertainment all have these same blurred-lines: we are now consumer/producers being exploited by an algorithmic class of platform owners and profile currators. Pretending our relationships to technology, language, and capital is the same as it was 20 years ago really won't help us.

		"The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age."

	Matt Christman and his Cushvlogs! Through synthesizing most of the other thinkers mentioned here, he's arrived at an incredibly accurate and productive worldview. It's long form video, which I assume is not ideal, but his vlogs have utterly reshaped me and I'm compelled to evangelize.

		One of my all time favorite Matt bangers. Stole this from a recent r/cushvlog post.
		
		“The one thing that unites anyone of any particular political persuasion is that something is going to bring about some horrible reckoning. They see the rough beast approaching, and they approach it like The Blind Man and the Elephant. Everybody is describing some element of it, through their own demographic profile. And they’re evincing their revulsion at some externalized and sublimated component of their participation in this malfunctioning social machine, and then claiming that is what’s going to bring it down.
		
		And everyone is describing some real phenomenon; some of them are totally epiphenomenal and some of them are more central. But what matters is, what they’re really doing is, expressing their desire, their religious yearning for a break. For a breach with the reality that we find ourselves in. In which we are deracinated, spiritually-deadened automatons. And all we can do is hurl towards an annihilation, hurl towards death. A death that can bring no redemption, that can bring no reconciliation. Because we are all eternally alone and separate. No matter what religious beliefs we skin on top of that lived experience. That is the world that we live in. And we want to not live in that anymore. It is hell.”

	Check out “The Age of Anger: a histoby of the present” by Pankaj Mishra.

	My own sense is that the world of our grandparents and parents was Manichean: it was easy to understand a singular threat. Nazis, the Soviets. These things paradoxically granted a kind of security of knowing and understanding the mechanics of the world. Now, nothing is clear, the ground shifts from day to day.

	In our time of polycrisis, the threats are not only not clearly delineated, but are even ambiguous in terms of their status. Crises are multivariate and sometimes without a correct “side”. The crisis is in some sense all around us, in everything.

	Add to that the twilight of the elites, of centralized media, and the revolt of the public through social media—the ground is no longer stable, we have no clear sense of the world and the correct path.

	Lastly, our real social networks and connections have atomized and we are left with a kind of diffuse visual field of one-dimensional images through which we are expected to make sense of our lives. Our interpretive tools have dissolved within social media.

					This back and forth is one of the dumbest I've read on reddit (which is a pretty fucking dumb website). Even if we accept your prescriptivist view it still fails to support your claim since the figurative usage of the word is recorded in any respectable dictionary. From Oxford:
					
					> Manichaean *adjective*
					 /ˌmænɪˈkiːən/
					 /ˌmænɪˈkiːən/
					(also Manichean)
					(religion, philosophy)
					
					>​based on the belief that there are two opposites in everything, for example good and evil or light and dark
					
					>example: We have already seen his Manichaean view of the world.
					
					
					And from Wikipedia:
					
					> The terms "Manichaean" and "Manichaeism" are sometimes used figuratively as a synonym of the more general term "dualist" with respect to a philosophy, outlook, or world-view. The terms are often used to suggest that the world-view in question simplistically reduces the world to a struggle between good and evil. For example, Zbigniew Brzezinski used the phrase "Manichaean paranoia" in reference to U.S. president George W. Bush's world-view (in The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, 14 March 2007)
					
					Why should we accept your authority over Oxford or Wikipedia?

							Lol, this is actually my wheelhouse, I'm writing my thesis on the use of Gnosticism as a signature (in the Agambian sense) in postwar German philosophy. When Eric Voegelin calls modernity Gnostic do you think he means people started to convert to Gnosticism around the 16th century? When Karl Jaspers accuses Heidegger of Gnosticism what do you think he means? Do you think he thinks Heidegger belives in the demiurge of the ancient Greeks? When Hans Jonas connects today's ecological destruction to Gnosticism is he simply a mad man? 
							
							I urge you to think of Gnosticism (which Manichaeism is a part of) as signature which is 
							
							> something that in a sign or concept marks and exceeds such
							a sign or concept referring it back to a determinate interpretation or field, without
							for this reason leaving the semiotic to constitute a new meaning or a new concept.
							Signatures move and displace concepts and signs from one field to another . . .
							without redefining them semantically. Many pseudoconcepts belonging to the philosophical tradition are, in this sense, signatures that . . . carry out a vital and strategic function, giving a lasting orientation to the interpretation of signs.

									I have to ask, what does this mean?
									
									I didn't make you make you blow snot out of your nose. Karl Jasper, Hans Jonas, Hans Blumenberg, et. al. did. I am not here to defend any of their positions, I am merely using them as examples of discourse you clearly are foreign to. I asked, somewhat rhetorically, if you would call them all mad men? And yes, you would, you really are biting the bullet here. In that case the gap between us is too large. You are literally saying that the man who wrote *Gnosis und Spätantiker Geist* (the first book to systematize Gnosticism) doesn't know anything about Gnosticism. 
									
									You clearly are not in a position to call my thesis gibberish, and what I am doing is in no way new or radical.

Not to mention all the German scholarship which is currently ongoing in the wake of Odo Marquad.

	Not a fan of either Fisher or Land, but if I had to recommend current people working on describing a "state of affairs" analysis, I would say Achille Mbembe's *Necropolitics,* Paul B. Preciado's nonfiction writings and Sayak Valencia's *Gore Capitalism* offer commendable attempts at describing the global situation. Also, Judith Butler just released *Who's Afraid of Gender?* which also surveys the present quite well.

	With that said, what aspect of the world feels confusing to you? That could help people recommend better stuff. Though disillusion has its place in theory, I think reading folks like Byung-Chul Han are not the best that's out there, he can offer very surface level commentary on capital and its effects on society.

	First of all i don't know which part of the things. Some call today [ a polycrisis](https://uchv.princeton.ed[u/news](https://www.reddit.com/user/news)/recap-adam-toozes-tanner-lecture-polycrisis). So, which part? Populism? Trump? Ukraine? Palaistine? The E.U.? The climate crisis? Inflation? The culture wars &amp; idpol &amp; wokeness? etc

	Maybe unpopular opinion for r/criticaltheory but i feel that searching about Critical theory at least for the first couple of years is the first step many aspiring Leftists take to make sense of the World around them.

	I mean that this sub is likely as confused (if not more) than you are.

	That's ok. It is what it is. Better searching for the answers than thinking that you know them when you don't or not searching /giving up.

	Just i feel that in this space most people don't have them yet. They don't have the answers that you seek.

	Anyhow, i would recommend:

	For Ukraine Verso book: "[Towards the abyss](https://www.versobooks.com/products/3216-towards-the-abyss)" by  Volodymyr Ishchenko.

	For wokeness: A[ youtube video by Carefree Wandering](https://youtu.be/GnUqrF9mAA8?si=VCkQiT4KD3y5offo) and and [Catherine Liu (jacobin youtube interview)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ortmpBSz4ko).

	For change in Civil Society:

	[Original essay "Ruling the void" by Peter Mair](https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii42/articles/peter-mair-ruling-the-void) for the New Left Review.

	Generally the [New Left Review](https://newleftreview.org/) is a wonderful resource.

	AND everything that's connected to the following two articles (the articles themselves and the books mentioned within)...

	"[On the failure of the Millennial Left](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2024/02/omelets-with-eggshells-on-the-failure-of-the-millennial-left/)" an essay on 3 books and the most recent itteration of the Left.

	A couple of maybe unorthodox suggestions: Michael Ende's books *Momo* and *The Neverending Story*. Parables for a disillusioned age.

	* 🟨 **[AncestralPrimate](https://www.reddit.com/user/AncestralPrimate)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-03-29 18:53:49)_

		Can you elaborate on this? The Neverending Story movie had a huge, formative impact on me as, like, a toddler. And I know Ende was a cultivated German intellectual (not a hack). But can you say why you read his books as theory?

		* 🟧 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-03-29 19:12:39)_

			NES can be read as a parable about the pitfalls of excessive nihilism (the nothing), and Momo describes a society being manipulated by time thieves who make everyone atomized, anxious, and disconnected by selling them a self-actualizing philosophy. Reading Momo is like Byung Chul Han but in young adult fiction form.
			
			Ende was drafted by the Nazi military. He tore up his draft papers and joined the underground instead. Three of his highschool friends went to the front and died almost immediately. A lot of intellectuals of the period who write critical theory had similar stories. The Frankfurt school people left for America and watched from afar while their old home descended into fascism, and Sartre joined the French resistance.

				* 🟪 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-03-31 09:23:50)_

					Fwiw it wasn't meant as a dig at the Frankfurt cohort. Just that all those people mentioned had a similar experience of living through a worldview altering historical period where society seemed to be descending into collective chaos. They dealt with it in different ways but all came out the other end concerned about how it all came apart.

	The use of AI to do very basic tasks seems evident. I have been appalled by the seeming laziness in which just about everything is slapped together in these times. It does seem to have taken this turn during the pandemic.

	From the constant "data breaches" to the unexplained technological fails that take down systems across industries, we seem to be in a state of broken technology. It is like we are going backward.

	If you are in the United States, then you can also look to the "tiny home" movement as a way to obscure the reality of ballooning housing costs. Prosperity in the United States is long gone.

	In my life as a philosopher, there has never been so much intense debate and incredible meaning-making as now. The world is confusing because we have spend 50 years doing so much without thought. Thinking about how what we do will change the past and the future, and why we are doing what we are doing - is going on all around us. The thing 'to do' is to always talk about it, with everyone, disrupt the status quo of "confused and confusing' with questions like is this who we are, confused and unable to imagine new ideas?

		I think there's a lot to talk about but probably the biggest issues are rising housing costs relative to median income meaning it's more and more of a struggle simply to put a roof over your head, and the other one is the rise of right wing authoritarianism around the world, for example here in the US the loss of women's bodily autonomy regarding abortions. I'm glad you're doing well but for the majority of people even in America life is getting more difficult every year.

						In your previous post you said you're finishing your bachelor's, but in this post, you say you're a grad student? 
						
						Also seems strange to suggest therapy as a solution for the kinds of issues that critical theory tackles. It smacks of liberal ideology, viewing everything as a personal issue to be dealt with on the individual level, ignoring the systemic causes of many of our problems. Take climate change for example-- centuries of capitalism accumulation have pushed us the point where human life on this planet is threatened, and the only way to effectively address it requires collective efforts on an unprecedented scale and the construction of alternative modes of economy, to say nothing of the kind of broader theoretical/philosophical shifts such a moment precipitates (just take a look at all the discourse surrounding the Anthropocene). Instead of engaging with any of this, your suggestion is to...see a therapist? 
						
						Sounds like you need to do some research into the rise of the therapy/psychiatric industry (and the interrelated self-help industry) and its relation to late stage capitalism. Foucault's work would be a good place to start.

						* 🟫 **[belindasmith2112](https://www.reddit.com/user/belindasmith2112)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-03-28 11:25:18)_

							Yes, you can actually be working on both. 
							I can be working on my dissertation in my last semester. Since I’ve already been accepted to my PHD program. And, everyone needs therapy at some point in their lives. It would seem that you’re very disconnected from what is actually happening on campuses. And, in the world of neuroscience. 
							Foucault does a have hearted gesture at what we are dealing with. His work does provide some insight. Nevertheless, it isn’t very applicable
