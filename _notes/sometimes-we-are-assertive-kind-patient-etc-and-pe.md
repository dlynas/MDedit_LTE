## Sometimes we are assertive, kind, patient, etc. and people don’t see what we’re doing. They’re unable to view our kindness or our intention.

There are also times where we totally miss the mark and we hurt the person.

There will absolutely be situations where you did everything you could and the other person is choosing to hold onto their upset and you don’t feel like apologizing, explaining yourself, etc. THAT IS OK!

We have a choice in these moments. We can say:
1. This person is hell bent on misunderstanding me. I’m not going to continue to try to make them see my kindness.
2. I want to learn how to help this person better and I want to understand what is going wrong in our communication.

If you’re interested in repair and trying to understand/move forward…it’s helpful to use the phrases or some like them from the right column instead of the left.
