## Voting systems tier list???

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/EndFPTP/comments/1ahpqla/voting_systems_tier_list/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EndFPTP/comments/1ahpqla/voting_systems_tier_list/)

> Is there a voting systems tier list anywhere? \[/does anyone feel like saying what their one would   lol\] I get the general gist of FPTP worst - STV best but I was wondering if people could give other systems ratings in comparison as there appears to be many different options and I just want a general guide from those who know more about this topic than me

	First, this depends entirely on the criteria used.

	Second, single-winner and multi-winner are more or less impossible to compare to each other.  In fact, multi-winner methods are hard to compare *to each other* in a fully objective manner *period*, because a lot of the key criteria one would apply to them (proportionality, representation) are themselves highly subjective in definition.  

	For single winner elections, a large number of common evaluative criteria have been proposed, most of which fall under two general categories:

	* Results Efficiencies

	   * Condorcet

	   * Linear Utility

	   * Sub-linear Utility

	   * Supra-linear Utility

	* Strategy Vulnerability

	   * Simple Compromise

	   * Simple Burial

	   * Clones

	   * Complex, Coordinated Strategies

	**Results Efficiencies** are different interpretations of "How often does this method naturally deliver the 'best' winner?"

	**Strategy Vulnerability** measures how often various strategies, especially simple or natural ones, can direct the result.  We think of "strategy" in terms of individual ballots to visualize it intuitively, but the real strategy we're talking about here is *parties*.  Another way of phrasing this is "How much inherent advantage do  you gain from being in a political party?", "How much do the activities of political parties dictate the outcome of elections?", or "How much does electing the Condorcet Winner depend  on parties behaving optimally in voter interests?"

	Additional properties also often factor in, such as monotonicity, summability, or ballot sensitivity to privacy.

	You also have various real world administrative concerns, such as current support among LEO procedures, voting machine vendors, and other currently-federally-certified components.  This can also include factors such as auditing, or any implications of said summability issues.

	Finally, you have education concerns.  TBQH, this corner of the debate gets old fast and isn't objective at all.  There's no credible (or replicable) evidence that humans are not smart enough to rank or rate things, no matter how much FPTP defenders insist otherwise.  No one on this subreddit should be indulging in either half of this, which is ultimately a bad faith pro-FPTP argument.

	\----------

	I have made a [website](https://www.chocolatepi.net/voteapp/) where you can visualize, test, and compare over 50 different single-winner methods in your web browser.

	You can even run thousands of elections (check the "Sim" tab") and get a report of all of the aforementioned numerical values, to make your own "tier list" for whatever type of electorates and candidate spreads you fancy.

			Oh crap, you're right--minorities are too stupid for voting reform.
			
			Pack it up boys, let's go home.
			
			\-----
			
			But actually, we doing this?
			
			[Kimball and Anthony's 2016 paper found identical disparities after applying a DID method](https://www.umsl.edu/~kimballd/KimballRCV.pdf) across multiple cities:
			
			>In a case study of Minneapolis elections before and after the adoption of RCV we find similar levels of socioeconomic and racial disparities in voter participation in plurality and RCV elections.
			
			&amp;#x200B;
			
			>Furthermore, in 2013 overvote and undervote rates for city council contests appear to be unrelated to the income or racial composition of Minneapolis wards. Overall, the Minneapolis evidence indicates that socioeconomic disparities in voter participation are similar in plurality and RCV elections.
			
			[Joseph Coll's paper](https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/3913/2151) primarily focuses on age-related ballot issues, but also dives into other factors:
			
			>For example, this study finds no relationship between racial and ethnic minorities and under‐voting and a positive relationship (greater under‐voting) among richer respondents.
			
			..while helpfully offering possible explainations for older, SF-based studies like the ones cited:
			
			>At the same time, other work has found lower under‐voting rates for precincts with greater proportions of non‐white voters and lower under‐voting rates in precincts with higher median income (e.g., Neely &amp; Cook, 2008). Is it something about the area under study (i.e., usually San Francisco, CA), or perhaps these differences are accounted for by differences in voting technology across jurisdictions (e.g., Knack &amp; Kropf, 2003)?
			
			The boring explaination, as both Kimball and Coll allude to, seems to be a (very logical) correllation between errors and number of candidates+ballot length.
			
			This also tracks with the incredibly low error rates (\~0.02%) seen with Alaska's [extremely clean and well-designed ballots](https://www.elections.alaska.gov/election/2022/genr/HD9_JD3.pdf) that featured a fixed number of candidates.  This is what the main RCV proposals in NV, CO, WI, and MO follow.
			
			\-----
			
			Outside of everything, I would automatically exclude Aspen and Oakland from any academic review of voting reform.  Both municipalities have infamously experienced major local election process dysfunction unrelated to ballot design at various points in the last 20 years, which majorly skews participation and error stats across periods.
			
			Otherwise looking at more cities is best, and if you had to focus on one it would be Minneapolis (as the oldest in this context) or Alaska (as the model that current proposals are most closely following).

				>I would automatically exclude Aspen and Oakland from any academic review of voting reform
				
				Sure- the first link that I shared used 'ballot data from the 2013 general election, the 2017, and 2021 New York City democratic mayoral primaries'.
				
				>and if you had to focus on one it would be....Alaska
				
				OK- in the last Alaskan House election, one-third of voters only 'ranked' 1 candidate. More crucially, in the last IRV election in Maine's 2nd Congressional district, 49.7% of voters only 'ranked' 1 candidate. (1) Half is a lot!! And you can't play the race card with Maine's 2nd district, ahem.
				
				No, it does not mean that voters are too 'stupid' to use IRV. As difficult as this may be to understand- a very large number of voters are low-information types, do not follow politics or public policy closely, and *don't have cognizable opinions on multiple candidates.* They literally don't have opinions on who should be ranked 3, 4, 5, or even #2. They don't know who the candidates are, they can't clearly identify what the policy differences are between them. They spend 20 minutes a year thinking about politics, they hate politics, they want more public services from the government but also lower taxes, etc.
				
				It's tough for people on this sub to understand, because we're all politics-obsessed weirdos- myself totally included here. We're the weird ones. A gigantic number of regular people just don't think about this stuff to the extent that we do. So they, again, have no opinions on who should be 'ranked' beyond #1. This is the revealed preferences of the people of Maine, for instance.
				
				As an example- I hate basketball and refuse to watch it. Am I 'too stupid' to make a ranked list of the top 10 greatest power forwards of all time? (That's a position, right?) I'd like to think I'm not too dumb to understand it- instead, I know nothing about NBA power forwards because I don't care, so I'm unable to rank them. So go many voters in this country. QED
