## Martin Luther King Jr. on Incrementalism

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/4dupi0/martin_luther_king_jr_on_incrementalism/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/4dupi0/martin_luther_king_jr_on_incrementalism/)

> > I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action"; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a "more convenient season." Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.
> 
> > I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured.
> 
> > In your statement you assert that our actions, even though peaceful, must be condemned because they precipitate violence. But is this a logical assertion? Isn't this like condemning a robbed man because his possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn't this like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by the misguided populace in which they made him drink hemlock? Isn't this like condemning Jesus because his unique God consciousness and never ceasing devotion to God's will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? We must come to see that, as the federal courts have consistently affirmed, it is wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate violence. Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber. I had also hoped that the white moderate would reject the myth concerning time in relation to the struggle for freedom. I have just received a letter from a white brother in Texas. He writes: "All Christians know that the colored people will receive equal rights eventually, but it is possible that you are in too great a religious hurry. It has taken Christianity almost two thousand years to accomplish what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to earth." Such an attitude stems from a tragic misconception of time, from the strangely irrational notion that there is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actually, time itself is neutral; it can be used either destructively or constructively. More and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good will. We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people. Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co workers with God, and without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right. Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.

The Sanders campaign is running up against Hillary Clinton's moderate plea for continued incrementalism and it was wrong then and it is wrong now.

	If I could upvote this to the top of the universe I would. 

	The parallels -- indeed, the shared contemporaneous efforts -- of MLK and Bernie haven't gotten their due. Bernie is the first pubic leader since MLK who has truly put human morality at the center of his policy approach. And he hasn't just talked the talk. He's walked the walk.

	Civil Rights. Gay Rights. Human Rights. Climate Change. War. Poverty.

	Is demanding change any time but RIGHT NOW on any of these acceptable?

		Bernie is inspired by MLK, a lot of his platform of economic justice is exactly what MLK was fighting for before he was killed

	This is spot on. MLK was also a democratic socialist and a non-violent Christian revolutionary. Dr. Cornell West brings this out in his talks and his book, The Radical King.

	On the issue of climate change alone, the time for incremental change is long past - we've run out the clock.

	Wow.  This perfectly describes the conservative democrats, and that statement has been made and will be made again by Barney Frank, a man who left me completely and utterly disappointed when he became a lobbyist.

	Incrementalism is bullshit. The Social Security Act wasn't enacted on incrementalism. Neither was the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act. The time for change is now.

	Great quote.  Would be nice to hear something similar from Bernie whenever Hillary talks about "Pragmatism" and "Getting things done".
