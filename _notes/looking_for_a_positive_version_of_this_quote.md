		If that wasn't already a saying, you should give yourself a gold star. I'll nominate you for the Nobel Peace Prize but I wouldn't hold my breathe.

	Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.

	“a fly cannot convince the bee that of which things it finds attractive.”

	However you said compliments both parties…

	“The bee and the fly both indulge in the differences of what is sweet and attractive.”

		It’s not as flattering for the side that’s being used as the fly though. I’m looking for a positive neutral if that makes sense

			Maybe what you’re looking for isn’t possible? A way to say some ppl eat honey and some eat shit without offending the ppl or things you claim to be eating shit, it’s a mile long tightrope walk.  You could say some people find power through knowledge and some find power through ignorance but it still does something similar which seems inherent in the type of saying it is.

	Every creature eats a diet specific to its species. Whales eat krill. Bees eat honey. Cats…well, they eat a lot of things! But different species will often not eat the same food as another species. The difference between delicious and terrible depends on what type of creature one is.

		This comment actually won. It's actually what I was looking for and it depicted both parties exactly how I wanted them. Both different but still beautiful in their own way.
