## Beginner with no construction skills searching for advice (long term goal is to build my own cabin)

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/OffGrid/comments/15wk2gh/beginner_with_no_construction_skills_searching/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OffGrid/comments/15wk2gh/beginner_with_no_construction_skills_searching/)

> Hi there!
> 
> I am 24 y.o, I have always been interested in off-grid living and have always dreamt of building my own cabin.
> 
> I am currently working online (self-employed) and recently had the idea of starting this new hobby/business. However, I have absolutely 0 knowledge on house building, and I am not the kind of person to be naturally good at building things. I am more a "theory" than "practice" person, so to speak. I suck at DIY, I believe mostly because I grew up with my mother only, and have never used my hands to build anything else than an IKEA small table.
> 
> However, I would love to actually start a project. I was thinking of maybe trying to buy a studio or small apartment to refurbish myself, with the help of a friend or a knowledgeable person. And later when I have more skills I will probably build my own cabin.
> 
> I am making this post to ask if some of you have good recommendations as to where I should start learning. Is there any book, youtube channel that is good for beginners like me? In order to learn the basics of construction overall. I guess the best way to learn is to start doing it, but I am such a beginner that I think some amount of theory would help before starting anything!
> 
> Even if I want to hire someone to help refurbishing, I would love to know what to expect, what needs to be done, and also not to get scammed.
> 
> Thank you so much for your help!
> 
> TL;DR: Beginner who has never built anything is seeking advice (books, tips, YT channels) to start a "small project": refurbishing a studio/apartment, in the event of possibly starting a real estate business and possibly building my own cabin in the future.

	Kris Harbour Natural Building on YouTube.

	A Place of My Own by Michael Pollan(book)

	Essential Craftsman on YouTube.

	Lloyd Khan (various books)

	Adam Savage's Tested on YouTube.

	I Did A Thing on YouTube.

	Marty T on YouTube.

	Stumpy Nubs on YouTube.

	Townsends on YouTube.

	Hope these help. I've been working with my hands my entire life. I used to suck ass at it. It's a skill you can master, just like anything else. Start with "A Place of My Own", then check out some instructional videos on Essential Craftsman(especially tool safety vids), then start at the very beginning of Kris Harbour to see what's possible with just a guy and the occasional help out in the woods. Marty T is an old school tinkerer who rescues various pieces of heavy equipment and brings them back to life and puts them to use. He doesn't do instructional stuff, but there's a ton to learn from him. Adam Savage often talks about personal failures, how to master general skills, and general process stuff that most people just never talk about. Go watch Mythbusters to get a good idea of how to use tools in weird ways and get familiar with the scientific and building processes. Absolute gold mines out there these days.

	Wishing you the best.

			You're quite welcome. Took me a very long time to gather my various skills. Always happy to help level the learning curve for others if I can.

			The Very Efficient Carpenter book by Larry Haun is still a great resource on stick framing construction basics. It was designed for students getting into the trade but is fine for DIY. The companion video is available on YT as well.

	I would recommend checking out Bushradical on YouTube. A lot of his cabin building videos are easy to follow and not very complicated.

	What I did was start using my hands and tools on small projects. I made some small tables. Then I made a chicken house. Then I built a large kit shed. Then I built a shelter on our property. Then I built a roof over some decking at home. Then I built our tiny house. And all along the way I would watch videos for skills, talk to people who knew how to do it already, and looked at examples to model.

	You could volunteer for habitat for humanity and help build a home to learn a bunch. You could also check out the list of intentional communities, on www.ic.org to see if there happens to be one near you. A lot have visitor programs where you could potentially help build structures, in return they usually house and feed you.

	Nothing wrong with flipping a piece of property either, but that can be expensive, just thought I'd offer some free solutions as well.

	I take building and fixing things for granted because I grew up watching my Dad and then copied him for a young age. He never personally showed me anything. He told me to watch others and learn so that’s what I did. He showed me it can be done so I guess that’s confidence building. But there’s lots of skills I’m still learning 60 years later. So we are all always learning. I think attitude, confidence, persistence, and planning are half the battle. The skills and tools can be acquired piecemeal. Being a self starter is also important. If you are self motivated to get out there and bust some knuckles but at the same time try to work smarter not harder. Ive become a Jack of all trades master of none but that’s not entirely fair to myself. I excel at a few things that I’ve applied myself to such as off grid solar and gardening. You will find out what you excel at and know your limitations. That’s part of the fun. Be safe.

	I like this video as it gives a gentle introduction into building.  It's just a shed, so no plumbing or electrical, but it's a good first SERIOUS project to tackle that will be useful, get you accustomed to basic tools, and give you confidence.   You will learn a little bit of concrete, a little bit of framing, roofing, doors, windows, etc.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLk\_CAMmQPc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLk_CAMmQPc).

	I don't know if they still exist...but Home Depot usually has some books re electrical/building sheds/etc.  And, at least the ones I picked up years ago, were location building code specific.

	Def not very exciting...but thorough, and several examples/plans to follow.

	So far as how not to cut your fingers off with a circular saw...there are a billion good YouTube videos.  

	Ho slowly and carefully.  Build a coffee table or something if you have 0 experience with a saw/hammer/screwdriver.  Many will disagree...but you don't need every tool out there to start.  

	If you have the space...start with a shed.  Draw up your plans...litterally with pencil and paper.  By the time you've finished that you'll have solid foundation skills to build a cabin.

	I agree with the guy to get a job as an apprentice in any of the trades. There's no experience like hands on experience, especially in building and construction. Just learning the names of all the tools and how to use them is valuable. And you get paid to learn a thing your interested in.

		I already thought about at least visiting a professional to get some info. I am still keeping my online job that takes me 3-4 hours a day so I will see if there are any programs or any way to do it part time. Thank you!

	My wife grew up in San Diego and was the cover girl for a typical 90's to 2010 California kid.  Never had to do any demonstrable work and never worked with her hands.  

	Fast forward to a decade ago in Kansas and that girl is a badass.  It took her awhile but with encouragement and me helping fix whatever but she is a bona-fide rock star.

	Several months back I had to be gone from the homestead, and when I came back, the entire garden had been planted, a new raised bed built, a small garden shed built and new trellis built.

	There are very few things she won't jump in and start, with me preferably, without if I'm tied up.  

	So the best advice I can give is what I gave her.  Just start.  The only way to build skills is to actually do it.  Start small to build your confidence and to realize u.might screw something up, but it can be fixed or started over.

	Get a job, even as a scrapper, in construction. If you have a good work ethic and a desire to learn people will teach. I manage construction and we are desperate for people who will just show up and try.

		Good to know, thank you. I always fear that if I just "show up and try", I will be more of a burden than anything.

			Well you will be at first, we all were at one point. Hell now that I manage construction I feel like I'd better serve the company most days being back on tools but I know I'll keep progressing, that's just how learning works.
