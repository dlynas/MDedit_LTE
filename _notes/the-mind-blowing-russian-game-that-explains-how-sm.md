"Have you ever heard of a game called Werewolf?
No.
Everyone gets a piece of paper.
It's either got villager written on it,
but two of the word Werewolf.
Someone runs the game to make sure no one's cheating.
And they go, okay, it's nighttime, everyone close your eyes.
Werewolves choose someone to kill, and the werewolves go...
They say, okay, everyone close your eyes, it's morning time, open them again.
During the night, Francis was killed.
There's then a conversation, and this is where it gets interesting,
between all the villagers and the two werewolves,
over who the werewolves are.
Then at the end of the day, the villagers have to decide who they're gonna kill,
and they say, well, we're gonna kill Constantine.
It's revealed by the person running the game,
I'm afraid Constantine was a villager, and the game continues.
The villagers win the game if they kill both werewolves.
The werewolves win the game if they kill all the two villagers.
And the werewolves usually win.
The game was invented by a student of sociology in Russia,
who wanted to prove his thesis that an uninformed majority
will always lose a battle of information against an informed minority.
So that just shows, when you have hidden information,
you can completely manipulate a large group of people."
