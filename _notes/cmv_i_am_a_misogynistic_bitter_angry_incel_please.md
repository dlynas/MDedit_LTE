## CMV: I am a misogynistic, bitter, angry incel please help me change my toxic views.

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/mpvo8y/cmv_i_am_a_misogynistic_bitter_angry_incel_please/](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/mpvo8y/cmv_i_am_a_misogynistic_bitter_angry_incel_please/)

> 👉👉👉EXTRA EDIT: please read edit 10 all the way down my post. 👈👈👈
> 
> READ THIS FIRST: This might be a long post but i have a lot of toxic views and i would really like to change them. I wanna  say why i feel so angry and bitter and misogynist. i really wanna change and improve myself and get rid of these hateful thoughts and beliefs. Also sorry if it sounds like I'm ranting. 
> 
> First of i wanna say how i feel why i feel and think the way i do. 
> 
> I am an 18 year old incel. 
> 
> The reason why i wanna have sex with women so badly is because men who are virgins with no experience with women are losers and considered to be less worthy of respect. 
> I am 18 years old and i feel a lot of anger and envy towards teenagers in particular when i see teens my age or younger than me (particularly, boys) asking for advice on reddit or anywhere else, about having sexual relationships or see parents posting about their teens having sex and asking for advice about it as well. And i especially feel so upset when i see teens my age or younger in malls or anywhere in public holding hands and kissing. 
> 
> The reason why i feel angry and envious is because these boys have had sex with attractive girls before me and they're much younger than me. I feel inferior and less of a man than these boys.  
> I feel like these boys are more successful and more respectable than me. 
> And I'm not saying women are trophies to be conquered, but from these boys having sex with girls it shows that they're attractive, they're interesting, and have qualities that draws girls to them.  
> That they're more worthy than me. I am very hard working and have a lot of determination and resilience and i have accomplished quite a lot for my age on other things yet no girl ever gave me a chance.
> 
> Another thing; another reason why i also wanna sex badly is because i am getting older and sex at a older age isn't as enjoyable compared to doing It in your younger years. 
> Teenagers have raging hormones and are much hornier and lustful than adults. Therefore even if i end up having sex when I'm older, what would be the point if i am not even gonna have the same excitement or fun? I'll be a grown man and i won't have raging hormones anymore and I'll be much more stoic and busy so sex will be worthless at such a age. 
> 
> Teenagers aside, in general i hate men who are successful with women because again, it shows they're much worthy and more of a man than me. 
> Virgin men are ridiculed and mocked and laughed at. 
> If this didn't happen that me and many other incels likely wouldn't feel this way. 
> Virgin is even used as an insult. Being a virgin, especially a male virgin and an involuntary one at that shows that no one wants to sleep with you and there must be something wrong with you. 
> 
> And my reason for my misogyny isn't just because women won't have sex with me but because women also mock male virgins. Sure women are different but in general being a virgin is considered to be a red flag by a lot of women. 
> 
> Also i see a lot of attractive women dating and sleeping with such weird or ugly looking men without much in return. 
> A lot of these men are not rich or handsome or very successful and in fact if they WERE i wouldn't feel as envious. Id rather have women chase after successful and handsome men. I feel angry and hateful towards these men and the women because it shows that it doesn't take much for men to attract women yet i struggle a LOT and the fact that these men who much worse looking and not even successful are easily able to start a sexual or romantic relationship with women shows that something Is wrong me and with my low self esteem it makes me feel worse and it manifests into very negative emotions. 
> 
> I mean on reddit there's this beautiful woman (that i have been following for a while and masturbate to her posts) who posts nudes on reddit and has a onlyfans and she posted a new video of her having sex with this new guy who she never posted before. In the comments it turned out that he was one of her onlyfans followers and he met up with him for sex. She replied to a comment that said he paid her that he didn't pay her anything and she had sex with him because she was looking for a new sex partner and he sent her a nice respectful message and had a nice chat. This guy wasn't even good looking and in fact was below average. He was very fucking scrawny and he had such a weird penis shape and his dick wasn't even big. He had no wealth, no good looks, not even a big or good looking penis and this fucking whore chose to sleep with him over a "nICe ReSpeCtfUL mEsSaGe"  they were also flirting a bit in the comments and the dude said that he almost lost his mind when her saw her naked and had sex with her several times. 
> 
> I have talked with this girl on onlyfans a lot and have followed her for a while. I spent a lot of money on her a LOT and she barely responds to my messages and when we do talk she doesn't seem interested in me yet she met up with this dude for sex over a message. 
> 
> I felt so angry that i actually wanted to hack this guy and steal his personal information. Not just him but send a cyber attack on HER as well. 
> 
> To put into words how angry i was:
> 
>  I am in multiple discord servers about technology and computer's (since i wanna expand my knowledge about tech and become a engineer in the future) and in one of the servers there's a group of guys who are very good at hacking and have done a lot of serious illegal things. They also do things such as pirate games and movies and jailbreak devices.
> I am good at computers but not as much as these guys. I am good friends with them and so i aksed them to hack someone for me or to teach me how to do cyber attacks. 
> Turns out Learning how to hack is very complicated  and can take years to learn and master and even just commting a cyber assault on someone or on any site can take a long time as well. From months to years. so i asked to hack him for me instead. They said sure but depending on the attack it would take a while and they won't make any promises. 
>  
> This is when i realized i was probably taking things too far over something so stupid. 
> 
> I really wanna change and just learn how to be a man without having to be in a sexual or romantic relationship with anyone. I have a lot more beliefs and Views and reasons for why but it would make this post even longer so I'll just leave it at that. 
> 
> Please change my Views.
> 
> EDIT: i am taking therapy already so please don't recommend that
> 
> EDIT 2: thank you so much all the upvotes and comments. I replied to a lot of them but there's too many more now. I will reply to all your comments in the morning.
> 
> EDIT 3: not sure if any new people will see this new edit but i am actually bisexual. Yes i am attracted to men sexually. However i only find beautiful effeminate men attractive like the ones in anime attractive (astolfo, hideyoshi kinoshit, saika totsuka, etc) and there's this anime cosplayer named @_10kujo on Instagram. He's gorgeous. I do feel envy towards less good looking guys who get with these type of guys im attracted to but thats something completely different than women and will be a topic for another time. 
> 
> EDIT 4: i was not expecting to get this much attention holy shit  
> I have received so many comments, replies, DM and private messages. I promise i will respond to ALL of you eventually but it will take a while to get to you
> 
> EDIT 5: i gave several deltas already but my mindset hasn't completely changed. And i will be giving deltas on comments that provide good points that will get me thinking and reconsider my Views.
> 
> EDIT 6: again i will try to reply to ALL of you but it will take time to reply because as i stated before i have received so many replies and DMs and even private messages and I'm STILL receiving more.
> 
> EDIT 7: since i am still getting so many responses i wanna bring up something else. 
> 
> I am more envious towards teenagers who have sex with hot teachers. 
> 
> Now wether it is wrong or not is something else id rather not discuss but as a teenager who recently turned 18, i would love to have sex with a beautiful adult woman. 
> It does not traumatize young boys and there's even evidence of it.
> There have been many cases of tecahers having sex with highschool students and the boys would ALWAYS brag about to their peers which is how the relationship was busted in the first place.
> 
> There was a case of a 16 year old teen who had a 3some with 2 GORGEOUS female teachers thatv lasted for 9 hours. When i read that i felt even more envy than regular adult men having sex with women their age.
> 
> EDIT 8: I am thankful for all the advice, encouragement, and positivity however i have also received a lot of hate, death threats and suicide wishes, and been mocked. I assure you i will simply report and block these comments and messages, they're not even worth the time and energy to be worked up about. Also despite being friends with people who are experienced with hacking and stealing information i will not even bother to ask them to harm these people because there's so many of them who sent me hate and it'd take a lot of fucking time to even attack one of them.  Plus i wouldn't wanna bother my discord friends with all of this bullshit anyways. I wouldn't even go after them myself if i could. Plus i wouldn't wanna get in trouble legally anyways or be banned from reddit. 
> Again all of these messages and comments that mock, insult, and threaten me will simply be blocked and reported so please don't waste your time typing out a long detailed message because i really won't care.
> 
> 
> EDIT 9: Alright this is a little surprising but I've gotten several messages and nudes from girls, and older single women (30s, 40s) but mostly older women who apparently have a thing for young lonely virgin 18 years old like me and enjoy teaching them about sex. I've had one older woman offer to come meet up with me and sent several different nude poses and selfies as proof she's real. 
> 
> I wanna say that i am kind of shocked at this and as surprising and weird as this may sound... i prefer to just chat normally and have a friendly conversation, especially with women. I have realized i have deep rooted issues that women can't fix. Only i can. I am in a very bad place mentally and emotionally and really need to learn to be more confident in myself and how to interact with people. I do not want to sext or even meet up with any woman because one of my goals is to see women as equals, more than sexual beings and realize that they bring more value than just sex and relationships. I have a lot of messed up ideas in my head about sex, relationships, and women that i need to change.
> If you're a woman and decide to send me nudes or something please don't. I'd prefer to just have a normal friendly chat.
> 
> EDIT 10: this will possibly be the last edit and i don't think many new people will see this but i wanna
> thank you so much to everyone who has contributed to changing my views. I have realised and come to terms with the fact that i have other deep and bigger issues than not getting laid, and not having sex isn't a problem to begin with anyways. 
> 
> My mindset hasn't 100% changed but my eyes and mind have been opened more and know that women are not the issue nor the men they sleep with. It is me. Only i can fix my issues and i am ready to become a man and stop viewing women as sexual beings. I am more willing to be just friends with them. 
> 
> Thank you again so much for the encouragement and all the advice. 
> 
> I will still reply to as many comments as i can and converse with people in the comment section and my DMs and I'll be willing to hear more advice and encouragement from new people who comment. 
> Sex, or lack of sex does not make me any less of a man or human being and i am ready to accept that.

	> The reason why i wanna have sex with women so badly is because men who are virgins with no experience with women are losers and considered to be less worthy of respect.

	I'll challenge this premise. You want to have sex because you feel that's the case, not because it actually is the case. I work with people who are in their late 20s and have never had sex, and are wildly successful ( >300k earners ).

	> That they're more worthy than me. I am very hard working and have a lot of determination and resilience and i have accomplished quite a lot for my age on other things yet no girl ever gave me a chance.

	Don't tie your worth to how other people feel about you. People aren't out-fucking you because they're more successful or desirable, they're doing so because they do other things better than you do, and you have to expect that. 

	> Being a virgin, especially a male virgin and an involuntary one at that shows that no one wants to sleep with you and there must be something wrong with you.

	Again, being virgin doesn't mean no one wants to sleep with you. It means you haven't slept with someone. That's mostly because you haven't created situations where this is possible. That could be a combination of you, your surroundings, your social circle, etc. 

	> Also i see a lot of attractive women dating and sleeping with such weird or ugly looking men without much in return. A lot of these men are not rich or handsome or very successful and in fact if they WERE i wouldn't feel as envious. Id rather have women chase after successfuland handsome men. I feel angry and hateful towards these men and the women because shows that it doesn't take much for men to attract women yet i struggle a LOT and the fact that these men who much worse looking and not even successful are easily able to start a sexual or romantic relationship with women shows that something Is wrong me and with my low self esteem it makes me feel worse and it manifests into very negative emotions.

	I mean, you're not really putting much effort into understanding why people have sex if that's your observation, and in fact is contrary to maybe the way you feel about women. You were claiming you felt inferior to other people because they had sex and seemingly were more successful, but now you're saying they're not and that's what makes you upset. 

	The inconsistency between those arguments shows the true consistency here: people are doing something different that you are not, and you should figure out what that is ( I'll cover this at the end ).

	> I mean on reddit there's this beautiful woman (that i have been following for a while ans masturbate to her posts) who posts nudes on reddit and has a onlyfans and she posted a new video of her having sex with this new guy who she never posted before. In the comments it turned out that he was one of her onlyfans followers and he met up with him for sex. She replied to a comment that said he paid her that he didn't pay her anything and she had sex with him because she was looking for a new sex partner and he sent her a nice respectful message and had a nice chat. This guy wasn't even good looking and in fact was below average. He was very fucking scrawny and he had such a weird penis shape and his dick wasn't even big.

	I mean, he did what you didn't. He took a shot, he flirted, he was convincing enough and she was receptive enough to his flattery that they took the risk. You're upset about someone doing something you were too scared to do, which seems silly to me IMO. Apply this to everywhere else in life. Are you upset at kids who show up and take tests and gets As, and you decided to stay home and got an F?

	> This is when i realized i was probably taking things too far over something so stupid.

	Yes, you did, because this person did absolutely nothing to you. People have committed suicide over this type of stuff, and your inability to control yourself in this regard could have directly resulted in the death of someone. When would you have stopped? What if this person had a religious family and you leaked this stuff to their parents to hurt them, or something? 

	Your instincts are dangerous here, as is your anger, and I'm happy you're seeking professional help because you need it.

	> I really wanna change and just learn how to be a man without having to be in a sexual or romantic relationship with anyone. I have a lot more beliefs and Views and reasons for why but it would make this post even longer so I'll just leave it at that.

	This is a good goal, IMO.

	Now for my thoughts on this freeform:

	Sex, like most things, is about human connection. 

	It's about vulnerability, is it's the natural inclination for us to stay clothed. We willingly take our clothes off and be in a vulnerable state with others when we have sex. 

	It's about attraction, there is something in the other person that draws us to them. This could be looks, money, intelligence, etc. It's different per person.

	It's about the need to be around and interact with people.

	It's worth noting here, based on those 3 things I said above, that none of them were represented in your perceptions about why people have sex with people. You only talked about how ugly someone was, or how successful someone was. There is not one "thing" that makes someone fuckable. So there is no "one shoe fits all" type thing going on here.

	So, I guess based on the above, maybe my EXACT recommendations to you are:

	1) Keep going to therapy. I think you really do need it, and it's going to serve you well for the rest of your lives.

	2) Your communication style, at least online, is relatively poor. Your arguments are fragmented, your explanations are too long winded. When you were explaining your desire to hack, you needed MANY less words than the ones you gave. This is a communication style that turns many people off. People want clear, concise, and fluid conversation, and based on the above, you seem like someone that "talks at people" rather than talks with them.

	3) Focus on platonic relationships first. Learn to develop good, meaningful ones that you enjoy. Don't look for "quick tricks to have sex". The people you have sex with are people too, and even if your desire to start a relationship with them is to have sex with them ( which is fine between two consenting adults ), you still have to learn how to create relationships. This is not an easy thing, it's actually difficult.

	4) Look for women you respect, either at school or other places, and try to start a platonic relationship. Learn to value women for more than their ability to have sex with you. Find women who are better at you than something, and learn from them. If you're looking for a mentor, look for a woman. Anything that can demonstrate to you that the value women provide to this world is much more than sex, and you can develop that perspective through gratitude for the things they teach you.

	I'm happy you recognize it's a problem, and happy you're trying to get better. Don't just make this post empty words. It's going to take work to get you to where you want to be, and there won't be shortcuts. Start tomorrow.

			You **can** say all the “many things” you want to respond to these comments. You don’t have to just keep saying there’s things you want to say. That’s what comments are for - discussion.

			* 🟦 **[ReallyReilly](https://www.reddit.com/user/ReallyReilly)** ⬆️ 112 _(2021-04-13 08:01:51)_

				Just wanted to jump on board and agree with [u/Ray_adverb12](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ray_adverb12) since I’ve seen you mention a few times that you have a lot to say in response to someone...
				
				And then not say anything more.
				
				If you are really trying to change your viewpoint then you need to say “all these things” so you can get an actual dialogue going and possibly change your views. 
				
				Nobody is just going to be able to say something magical and instantly change your mind. You are going to need to engage and articulate your thoughts. If you’re not aware of what you are thinking then you will have no way to change it. 
				
				So please, OP, roll up your shirtsleeves and get into it. Tell us ***why*** - tell us all these ‘other things.’ Let’s get it out there and try to figure it out!
				
				I think you have gotten some really good advice on here already and if you take the time to write out these “other things” those same people will probably take the time to continue their discussions with you. 
				
				Best of luck! I’m rooting for you!

					I agree with you here as I also noticed OP responding this way.  I'm proud of him for opening up and making this effort.  But this goes so deep, I can't imagine he could possibly address everything here.  I get the sense it's overwhelming.  
					
					So far, I'm also proud of everyone here who has been so thorough and even painfully honest.  (I didn't really expect that.) 
					
					I hope he gets some insight and talking points to take to therapy.

			I think what they said about finding a mentor is a good idea. You could try to find either a woman or a man to mentor you, to help you work on your views you would like to change. You could easily find somebody online to help you. In person I don’t know the logistics of finding somebody like that, but you could find somebody online, get to know them and see if they’re the kind of person that can help you in your views. It’s a step you can take to surround yourself with people you want to emulate. There’s really not much to lose.

		This is a really good comment, because you explained the faults in his thinking and I think OP is really hung up on some convictions that feel true for him. Seeing them exposed like this, with empathy and advice to boot, is great.
		
		 OP, I see that you responded that you want to say more about the points /[u/lyace](https://www.reddit.com/user/lyace) brought up. Please do because they gave you some good points to think about. When you engage with this answer, it helps you develop a more critical view of your own thoughts and see why they are irrational. You are feeling a lot about yourself, sex, and women, and have convinced yourself that those feelings are based on objective observations of reality, but they are not. If you really want to change your mind, you have to actively practice engaging with new, non-toxic ideas.

			Yeah, I feel for OP because in isolation, some of this could seem reasonable, right?
			
			You watch porn, you see these massive dicks and you have an average dick, and unless you get an outside perspective you're thinking you're inferior.
			
			You see people making fun of virgins, using it as an insult, and you begin to feel like there's something wrong with you.
			
			Like, without someone to challenge your thoughts or be critical enough to challenge your own thoughts, it's easy to live in that bubble. But it's all pretty internally inconsistent, and requires you to toe that line of "hey, so it's true that I AM someone people have avoided sex with" as an acknowledgement, but the courage to identify what that is and work on it instead of hating other people for it.

		IDK if that's misogynistic or not but when so much money is involved, I wouldn't be surprised if something like that was staged.

	First off, props for recognizing your toxic feelings and wanting to change. And for what it’s worth, i sympathize with you—there’s a lot of bullshit out there from virgin jokes, to small dick jokes, to shitty marketing campaigns that is genuinely hurtful, and propagates this idea that having more sex == being more of a man and being of higher value

	Getting out of the incel/NiceGuyTM mindset takes time, and i can’t do it all in one post, but if there’s one thing i want to say, it’s: please, please, please stay away from this “sexual marketplace” mindset, where everyone has a quantifiable sexual worth, and you can rank everyone on an absolute scale. I’m not going to pretend like there aren’t qualities that are generally perceived as more attractive than others (like height, for example), but obsessing in this mindset will drive you CRAZY, because it doesn’t actually exist. You’ll be super bitter because “it’s unfair that only rich/tall/big dick/successful/(insert whatever quality here) guys can get laid”, and then you’ll be bitter again when you see guys “of lower worth” getting laid, because that’s even more unfair

	All the while, you’re directing all of your attention outward, and projecting your toxic mindset onto everyone else (whose thoughts you absolutely do not know), while ignoring what will actually help you develop relationships with other people, which is working on yourself, and how you express yourself to others. 

	Look, women are people too. They get horny just like you, and are attracted to attractive people just like you, and are scared of rejection just like you. And they can 100% pick up on the fact that, instead of treating them like complicated, flawed people with their own desires, you’re treating them like a puzzle to unlock, or some game, where there’s a checklist that you just have to figure out and complete to get the prize. And their danger sense will drive them faaaar away whenever they get that sense. 

	But there’s also this false binary that incels believe in—either you’re a douchebag pickup artist who’s super pushy for sex, or you go 100% in the other direction and pretend that you’re not interested at all. And then you feel like you’re a good person who didn’t make a move, so you deserve them to make the move for you, which is equally as toxic

	There’s a 3rd option, where you treat women as equals, and respect them as equals. You’re honest and clearly communicate that you’re interested, but in a way that’s more of an invitation to a party, than asking for a favor. Don’t ask a girl if she’ll *let you have sex with her*, instead say “hey, i’m attracted to you. Are you also attacted to me?” 

	Look, someone ultimately has to make a move, and most people are afraid of rejection and want the other person to be the vulnerable one. But you can still do it in a way where you’re on equal footing—nobody likes to feel like they’re dating down, so don’t imply it with the way you ask someone out. 

	You are a man. You have worth. Carry yourself with some respect. 

	But also understand that women are the same. So when you inevitably get rejected (because spoiler, *everyone* does), handle it with grace. Because your worth isn’t determined by who will or won’t sleep with you—you were a kickass person before you asked someone out, and you’ll be a kickass person after you asked them out. Only the next time won’t seem as scary

	Because that’s the secret about all the “ugly guys” you see getting laid. They’re just confident people who are confident enough to be okay with being rejected. And once you have enough self-esteem to not be terrified of being rejected, then you can finally participate in a vast world of women who want to date/have sex with men. And confidence is fucking sexy

			I feel like it's also really important to remember that no one walks around with a sign on them saying "virgin". People don't know or care if you're a virgin or not. 
			
			But I think lots of people who obsess over being virgins do this because they feel ashamed and embarassed for how OTHER people view their virginity - but, as I said, that's not the case. 
			
			I think it's big of you to admit that your views need changing. One thing I haven't seen people commenting about is your friend group - I won't pretend to know them or the type of people they are, but I've noticed lots of "incels" hang out together (in person or online). If you're part of incel or otherwise sexist/toxic groups, leave them. It's very hard to change when you're surrounded by toxic people who normalise their toxicity. 
			
			You acknowledging the problem is half the work. Now it's time to fix the next half.

				That’s probably the toughest step too.  I had to step away from friends for a time because of their views and actions.  I came back to them when they grew up and changed. You can also have friends who have views you don’t agree with and just keep those things off limits for conversation which I have also done.

					Honestly, this is just part and parcel with being able to handle rejection. Acknowledging that in general people come and go is essential, and sometimes that means *you* are the one that leaves. This is beyond anyone’s control and is part of being human. It is wise to accept this and live life without undue attachment to transient individuals.
					
					Some friends are so good they cannot possibly be separated from your life, but those are few and far between. You’ll know them when you see them for their kindness and how they seek always to uplift you, [u/monster_zero_](https://www.reddit.com/user/monster_zero_) , and I guarantee that most of the people you know now are not those kinds of friends.
					
					I can say that with confidence as a person who’s short on friends at the moment for this exact reason: we shared an environment, basic interests, and had fun together, but in time I realized that I was not altogether important to them. Not long after, I realized that they weren’t that important to me either. When we as a group just stopped interacting with each other, I was prepared for it.

				My fiance was a virgin when we met and I was not. He was 20 at that time. In no way did I look down on him for it, and i didn't even know until after we had sex for the first time. He clearly wasn't just after sex though. He thought I was smart and pretty and funny and wanted to get to know me better. Sex is just one of the perks.

			You are hyper focused on people's success. When you see a relationship you get jealous of the guy. You didn't see the dozens of times he was rejected. You also didn't see him volunteer, join hobby groups, mingle with friends for several years before he met someone who was into him.
			
			I think you are really misplacing your insecurities about yourself as anger against others. Work on yourself. Stop asking yourself what you need to be to get laid. Ask yourself who you want to be to make yourself proud. When you're proud, you are confident. When you are confident, girls don't feel like they are doing you a favor by having sex with you (ew). Which, btw, is the stench your mindset releases. 
			
			Just think about it. If you had a woman who was 600 pounds, angry, mean, and extremely unpleasant to be around. Would you agree to have sex with her because you pity her? No one will do the that for you. 
			
			You need to be the best self you can be, be proud of who you are, be confident in your value as a fucking human being, and put yourself out there fully understanding that rejections are NORMAL and the world doesn't owe you anything.

				try to become a person you would fuck
				
				by doing this, you will focus on yourself, on being a better yourself, and less on other people sex life, which is not that important btw
				
				and as other said don't be too afraid of rejection, everybody gets rejected and that's not that bad. just treat women fairly and with some respect

			One of the things I picked up in your op is that you want instant results to your solutions whether that was sex with women or hacking someone without putting in the actual work. 
			
			It took me til I was 25 to realize that I can’t just have something because I wanted it. I had to earn it and work for it. Spend some time on YouTube or google and dive into all the info you can on what subject you are trying to get better at.

			Here is a secret: Nice guys DO win in the end.  Do you think woman enjoy being ghosted,  having relationships with immature guys who aren’t ready for commitment if you are both compatible?  First of all, I hate the concept of virginity.  Sex does not need to be a big deal. It does not teach you the secrets of the Universe. I waited till I was 21 since I was crazy busy with a job and grad school. I didn’t particularly love the idea of having set because of all of the crappy fumbling that went on when I was a teenager and above. It repulsed me.  Then one night, a man I was attracted to took me on a date, and then when we came home politely asked if he could kiss me.  I said yes, expecting the worst,  but getting the best!!!!! My first time was sweet and the next morning he strew the bed with rose petals.  Be THIS guy.  Or be my husband who was originally not my type, but was the kindest man I ever dated. We have been married for almost 16 years.  The main thing is this:  Kindness is a muscle. As a start try to do something kind for someone every day. It will become a habit, and one that will make you very happy.

	You know I appreciate you taking the time to make this post. That said, you're 18 which is comparatively young. I'm a guy who didn't get laid til college. Saw plenty of friends hook up with girls in high school, suppose I felt a sense of jealousy. No reason to bring anger into this situation. If you are feeling angry it is likely a misplaced emotion. Ask yourself if there's anything else in your life that you should be angry about but aren't?

	The only advice I can give you is that being bitter and toxic will only keep you further and further away from forming meaningful relationships with anyone at all. The world owes you nothing, women owe you nothing, you are in this on your own. Get comfortable with that notion and comfortable with the idea of not blaming anybody else for your shortcomings. Despite any shortcomings you may have there will still be many people who will love and be attracted to you if you cultivate a good attitude.

	In short, all good things in all good time. You're young, you have your whole life ahead of you, and I'd hate to see you stifle all of that with your current attitude. Be optimistic but don't spend all of your time focusing on what you don't have. Focus on cultivating the positive qualities and skills that you do have. Focus on bettering yourself. If you do that, in time, a partner will come. The most important thing in life is making sure that you are well and healthy and it's only through this that you will attract anybody at all.

	Best of luck, man. I'd have gone harder on you if you weren't so young, but you still have time to turn it around. Any specific questions feel free to ask and if I'm awake I'll be more than happy to answer.

			A very small addition, but your toxic feelings can form a spiral of doom, where women might get bad vibes from you over your feelings towards them, so you don't get close relationships with women (including sexual ones), so you get more anger and jealousy, which women might pick up on, etc.
			
			You have to ask youself as honestly as possible: have the women done anything wrong? (On the whole I mean, as theirs assholes in every group.) A woman goes out with an ugly poor guy, has she done something wrong? No. A woman rejects you, or isn't interested in you, has she done something wrong? No. Anger is just not the right emotion, as you've not been wronged.
			
			You are allowed to feel sad, and self pity, of course. People out there have something you want. But anger is unproductive. You have to think objectively, how can I get that thing? What can I do to make myself more attractive as a sexual partner? How can I find a woman who is more into. They are really hard questions to think about, and can make you feel pretty shitty, but it's important to focus on these rather than on anger towards women or the people they date.
			
			As for advice on those questions, you could write a book about it. I can only give my personal advice:
			
			- Not all sex is through hookups. I was never part of the casual sex world, I don't know how it works. Presumably the most important thing is having an attractive first impression. Work out, get more confident (e.g. join a public speaking club, sports team), practise flirting without coming across as needy or creepy (I never learned this). I can't help much here.
			
			- For longer relationships, compatibility matters more than first impressions. I was friends with my girlfriend before we were going out (I was older than you are btw). We hung out and watched YouTube together, and were in the same friendship group so we went to things together. We had similar senses of humour etc. Sure, she might not have been into me romantically (which people call being friend zoned as if its something she is in control of), but that wouldn't be a huge loss, I'd still have a friend. You just have to be pleasant to enough people that one if them might be interested in you romantically. The tips from the first bullet are probably relevant here too, but its important to know that you're not befriending people solely to get in their pants. That's kind of exploitative.
			
			- At the end of the day you want to improve your odds. Make sure you're meeting the right people. If you are nerdy as fuck, do nerdy social activities. If you are sporty, join sports clubs. A good sense of humour can transcend these kinds of tropes, but most people will be compatible with people like themselves. Also, if you're looking for a relationship and not just casual sex, you'll need to consider the whole of the woman, not just their body. Attractiveness over a longer period is more than just physical. I'm not saying that you're not allowed to reject girls, everyone is allowed to reject anyone, but don't necessarily rule people out because they don't have your idea of an ideal body. They may be perfect for you in other ways. Women are generally less interested in men's bodies than men are in women's, it's all about the whole package. Are you going to make each other happy?
			
			I know it sounds unromantic, but a sexual relationship is just like a business relationship, and it might be healthier to think of it like that. Business are allowed to decline any relationships that they don't think suit them, and if you want to make a deal you make your side of the deal as attractive as possible. Not all businesses put the same conditions on their contracts. You'll want to see what a lot of businesses have to offer, and find one where the feeling is mutual. What other businesses do with each other isn't something you should worry about.

				Woman here, this is what I wanted to say but couldn't properly convey. OP, as long as you take care of yourself and treat women like equals one will come along. And don't be afraid to shoot your shot. Ask someone on a date, and if they say no, you've lost nothing.  If they say yes, you've got a date! And those conventially unattractive, poor guys don't get women because they're lucky.  They have something to offer,  whether it be a wonderful personality or they know how to treat a woman. I'd consider myself a 6 on a good day, but there's been guys that have objectively been 2s that I'd consider dating just because I like their personality. 
				
				I suppose what I'm trying to say is don't be so hard on yourself.  Anyone can get a woman,  they just need to put forth the effort to better themselves.  But I want to stress, you shouldn't change yourself for the sake of getting dates with women. You should change yourself for the betterment of you. It's not easy, and it took me a long time to learn how, but you've got to love yourself. Take the time to care for yourself. You may not feel like a hot shower, or a haircut, or a good shave, but you certainly deserve one. You may not feel like dressing how you want is worth the effort, but it'll make you feel better.  
				
				I hope my ramblings have conveyed something of worth.

I also notice that some incels, try to go to pickup class, or artists for dating advice, I think they are trying then hating on women all the time but its still wierd, since most of it ends up they guy browbeating the women into agreeing.

		* 🟧 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 89 _(2021-04-13 10:11:47)_

			OP, sex as a teenager generally kind of sucks.  Pretty much anyone I know who had sex in high school laughs about it now because it was awkward and sloppy and usually not very good.
			
			I guess you've heard a myth that raging hormones somehow makes sex *feel* better, but it doesn't work that way.  All they do is make you *crave* sex more.  
			
			Sex in your 20's and 30's has absolutely no tangible physical material reason to be any worse than sex in your teens, and most people who've had it both ways will affirm that your 20's and 30's are the prime time for you to enjoy sex with a partner.
			
			You need to remember that a lot of women are raised and told *not* to give away their virginity or have sex.  We get told a lot of shit, like about how if we've had sex we're like chewed gum and aren't as valuable to our future spouses.  That's what I learned in sex ed at school.  Why would that kind of teaching make a teen girl comfortable with having sex?  It's very normal for women to not start having sex until at *least* senior year (17-18) and often, even later than that.
			
			But genuinely, you need to pursue healthy relationships *without* your end goal being sex.  If you go into a relationship just seeking to give support, companionship, and warmth to someone else, you'll have much better luck growing that relationship and having it turn out.  Work on yourself a bit.  Try some new hairstyles, practice telling jokes and being funny.
			
			Don't go into any interaction with a woman you're attracted to, with having sex with her being the end goal.  We pick up on that and it can really make it awkward and actually make it harder to establish and build a relationship when we feel like all it is is us being wooed into eventually having sex.
			
			If it came down to it and all you want is sex, there are beautiful women who will do that for you if you are willing to pay for their services.  There's nothing wrong with that, despite what some may say.

				Wanna add to this comment, the more you get older, the more you’ll enjoy having sex as you would know better. The thing about teenagers enjoying sex more is complete rubbish. Most teenage boys don’t know anything about sex other than what they see on porn. Having sex with a real person is really different than what you see on the internet. Most teenager boys learn sex from porn and they completely disregard the fact that sex is two way experience. Somehow losing your virginity at an early age has become a way to appear “cool”, like smoking for some reason. 
				
				Another thing is that girls won’t think you’re inferior than other guys just because you are a virgin. There are plenty of girls who wait for the right person so through therapy and working on yourself, you can be that person. Please remember having sex doesn’t make you a lesser person. There are plenty of people who are asexual, who aren’t sexually attracted to anyone, that doesn’t make them inferior.

I'm significantly older than OP and haven't had sex yet; I have a pretty great life so that doesn't bother me too much, but I do worry both that I'm missing out and that my future partner(s) will expect someone my age to already know what is good for me and for them, and I'll inevitably let them down.

									I (cis hetero female) was 32 my first time.  Lots of factors went into this, mostly I just wanted to get through grad school without tons of distractions, moved, didn't know anyone, I probably wasn't ready for anything serious until my late 20s and I wasn't interested in a one off - just life.   
									The first few times were a bit awkward for me, because I was nervous and needed to get my bearings. Just needed to figure out the lay of the land, how it all worked, etc. But after I realized that he really did like my body and I figured out what was what, it got really good really fast.  
									I think because I was older and more confident in who I was that translated into being comfortable with sex quickly.  
									That was over 20 years ago and I will say experience does make it better, but I really believed that age and maturity helped me get comfortable with sex much more quickly that if I'd had it in my teens or 20s.

									Oral, work the clit, take it slow, work up to it, wait til she’s squirmin as she gets off, then go ahead and have sex, you’ll have less pressure on yourself because you ensured she got off first orally; and now it’s your turn and if you do happen to bust after two pumps then at least you both came.... but the funny thing about it is once that pressure is Alleviated, then you are able to last much longer because you aren’t worried about “man if I cum to soon snd she doesn’t get offf she will think I’m lame”.

			My fiance didn't have sex for the first time until he was 22. Sex isn't what makes you a man or an adult for that matter. What makes someone one is the ability to accept responsibility for their lives and their choices. Trust me I know plenty of men and women who have sex, aren't adults mentally or emotionally, and are utterly miserable. The world is tough it's going to knock you the hell down and hit you harder than anyone or anything ever else could regardless of one's sexual status. But you have to keep getting back up one more time than it knocks you down, raise your hand and flip the bird reminding it that it hasn't beaten you yet. 
			
			No one cares you're a virgin. In five years from now, no one is going to care from your high school who was getting laid and who wasn't. The fact you took the time to write this post and really think about what people had to say tells me you're not as lost as you feel you are. There is hope for you, keep pushing forward in life and growing as a person the rest will happen when it happens.

				Totally agreed. At 18 I know I had some of the feelings OP described at times. Sometimes it can feel like you’ve got a great big glowing sign above your head saying VIRGIN and that everyone else is constantly having sex all the time — exaggeration from teenage boys does little to help this!
				
				I remember getting to university and being a bit disappointed that it wasn’t actually constant orgies and drinking (well, for me anyway). It made me feel even more self conscious. Then one night with some friends the topic of when we’d last had sex came up and I had to ‘admit it.’ And absolutely nothing happened. The conversation moved on. No jeering, no nothing.
				
				My first time was when I was 19 with a girlfriend I felt really close to. I know others who were well into their 20s before their first time. While I think its fine to see it as a milestone, once you’ve done it you kind of realise that its not that big of a deal in the first place.

				* 🟪 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 5 _(2021-04-13 14:18:00)_

					Yeah this, generally people care very little about your sexual status (except maybe if you're available) and if they do they're most likely insecure themselves. Also the label virgin is far more unclear than you'd think. I've had guys think I'd never kissed someone or done oral because I said I was virgin, while other people have said I can't ever lose my virginity because I don't f women.

				This is what is SO important. Being a man is not about romantic relationships with women. It's about how you handle your own problems, responsibility, a growth mindset, and your treatment of other human beings, ESPECIALLY human beings that can't give you anything.

			I would add that sex definitely does not get worse with age.  I agree that as a teenager it was very much on the mind but as a person in my late 20s now 1) I still wanna have sex 2) its still pretty cool when it happens lol
			
			I know it can seem unfair or that it’ll never happen for you, but it will if you develop a healthy attitude about it.  Maybe not tomorrow or the next day but you’re still young.  I would also recommend trying to look at women as not just a potential sex object but just like you would anyone else, this will help foster a healthier mentality about it and make meaningful relationships (sexual and otherwise) easier with women.  
			
			Last thing, I definitely don’t think sexual history is what defines you as a man, and anyone that thinks so is pretty immature.  You even mention in your post about that Onlyfans dude, I would argue that most of society doesn’t see that guy as cooler or more of a man for having sex on camera, and also that guy seems like proof that he isnt better or worse than you because he had sex.  Sleeping with a bunch of women is like the cartoon version of masculinity in my opinion.  Derive your self worth from other things than sexual history and sex stuff will very likely follow.  Hopefully this helps even a little but yea I would just say definitely remember that sex doesn’t make you a better or worse man, you’re not missing out on the good times for it so to speak, and just focus on building positive relationships with people and that stuff will come.

			I'm really glad you're looking to change your perspectives. I am 24 years old and a virgin. I used to feel terrible about that, I used to feel unlovable, and unnoticeable. Just know that if you feel like that it isn't true, your virginity has no bearing on you. When I look back on my life I realize that none of that was true, women have been and still are interested in me, and now I don't want to act on it because I want to be more functional, to be able to function on my own and care about myself. 
			
			I would also like to point out that the reason why our society views virginity as so important is due a number of religious and patriarchal aspects of our society, we demonize women for having sex, yet men are demonized for not having sex. It creates a contradiction in the expectations of society. This ends up hurting both men and women alike. The views that men are driven solely by sex, hurts men and women alike it cheapens the capabilities of men, and is used to blame the victims of sex crimes. The real problem between men and women is we put unnecessary expectations and judgments on one another. Often times people refer to these as toxic masculinity, since a lot of them originate as views of how men should be, or how men should be in relation to women. These expectations have affects on us.

			Tbh, sex is overrated. Your frustration is a result of the fact that the only "coming of age" ritual we have in Western society is losing your virginity.
			
			Women don't have this problem because their coming of age is biological. They get their period and are welcomed into womanhood. 
			
			Men have to "prove" their "manhood." Other cultures, like in Judaism for example, have rituals for boys to transition into adulthood.
			
			All that is to say, sex won't make you feel like a man. It's awkward, it's weird and it's best to find someone you love to explore your sexual desires with. 
			
			The moment you stop caring is the moment it will get easier to actually get laid because women can sense the desperation and will friend zone you fast.

			* 🟦 **[kejartho](https://www.reddit.com/user/kejartho)** ⬆️ 5 _(2021-04-13 15:04:41)_

				It is and it isn't. A lot of people say this after they've done the act to downplay the importance on it, however, this does very little to those who haven't had sex. Instead it just makes them feel like "if it's not really such a big deal, what's wrong with me?"
				
				The reality is that our society does place some importance on the act. Religious people demonize it outside of marriage but then actively encourage it after marriage as one of the most holy acts we can do to celebrate god.
				
				The fact that we are biologically tied to the act by birth but also constantly bombarded with messages about it, does in fact make it feel like it's important.
				
				Heck, when people do the act it can be a bonding moment or a *triumphant* moment to feel like you're finally an adult. Or heck, it makes you feel like someone just flat out finds you attractive or in love which is really uplifting.
				
				Then as we get older, wiser, and often worry less about sex - we then start to realize the act itself is just an act. It's only as important as we place it to be and for many of us who have been sexually active for a while it is no big deal or in fact overrated. However, for those virgins on the outside, looking in - it can be painful.
				
				So, I feel for OP but he is going to have to get over the desperation and realize he has to focus on other aspects of relationships if he wants to get laid. He can't just be mad at people for not getting laid in the first place, that gets him nowhere. At the same time, I can't, in good conscious tell someone it's overrated. I can just try and empathize a bit.

				Yeah, tying self-worth and personal value to losing your virginity is a freaking time bomb. There are two extremely likely scenarios:
				
				1. You stress out about being a virgin so much that you reek of desperation--which is the worst aphrodisiac known to mankind--and stay a virgin for longer.
				2. You have sex, but place such high stakes on the experience that it is stressful and ultimately disappointing.
				
				Either way, your self-worth takes a nose dive because you'll feel like you failed in some way. And even if the sex is somehow great the first time, a week later OP will be wondering why he doesn't magically have new confidence or a better outlook on life. Because virginity wasn't the issue at all.

			Good on you for taking the courage to make this post.
			
			It's a rather misogynistic film, but it might help you relax a little, The 40 Year Old Virgin.
			
			And yes, sex gets better with age. The worst sex I've ever had was losing my virginity. It's so much better with someone you love really deeply. Sounds cheesy, but I swear by it.
			
			Sex addicts are what I call severely soul sick. Obsessive and excessive and overly casual sex can lead to some serious mental and emotional problems.
			
			My guess is you've got some underlying issues that you're hyper focusing onto sex. I highly recommend seeking out therapy. I would not be in the good place I'm today without it.
			
			For the record, from one man to another, you're a good man. Your good and bad thoughts/deeds speak to your character, but they do not define who you are at your core. Work at improving yourself, which this post is a big step forward, but know that you have worth for simply existing.

					I don't mean to imply that actions don't contribute to the definition of a person. Absolutely. But the person is defined additionally in other primordial ways. For example, when a baby is born, do they not have any definition? I believe they do. The definition I'm referring to here isn't predicated on anything they do, but simply on their being, their existence.

					* 🟥 **[Passance](https://www.reddit.com/user/Passance)** ⬆️ 5 _(2021-04-13 05:06:30)_

						I agree with the intrinsic value of human life, but it doesn't say anything about a person, and when a baby is born, nothing is to say anything about their character or personality. They are precious, but they have no identity yet. So what I'm saying is that actions *do* define a person, at least their identity. Just... don't conflate identity with value. You aren't born someone... You are who you make yourself.

							I see so many people disbelieve they have value outside their identity. 
							
							That's like saying that a person's value is tied to the amount of money in their bank account.
							
							Actions, character, identity... The things that take time and thought to curate are wonderful (or awful, depending). But they cannot replace one's intrinsic value.
							
							Lack of a sense of one's intrinsic value can lead to all sorts of issues, such as perpetual depression or anxiety.

				This film helped define my deep insecurities about being a virgin for a long time (not one anymore because I changed things in my life). It is the absolute last movie I would recommend to someone having these feelings, and frankly I am baffled how anyone could think that movie would be helpful to a virgin. Steve Carrells character is constantly mocked and belittled for not having had sex. He is very much presented as less of a man than his friends at work. Yes, he does have sex at the end, and it's great, but that will just show someone who is in the space that OP is how much they are missing out on. It's not comfortable.

			Seriously about the sex issue. 
			
			
			I think it's about the intimacy. Longing for a companion and being jealous over others finding companionship. It's easy to deflect that into sex with women as a status symbol. I'm that guy. And just now I found a partner where it isn't about sex for me. It's about being with someone. Loving someone and longing for a good life. The sex, to me, is just a by product. 
			
			As someone who was envious for most of my life about relationships of all ages (I'm 32) I met someone at 30. Never dated because I wouldn't give myself the ability to be intimate and vulnerable. You see all these people going for lust, and that's heart wrenching. But you don't see what is going on behind closed doors. 
			
			Also about the more sex drive and all.... Sure it's more "first time" sex. First time in a car, doggy,etc. But I promise you that it is equally exciting when you're in a relationship with someone you want to be with and they know it's your first time. Even better because they know their boundaries as they age and are more comfortable knowing what kind of partner they want and turns them on. Same with yourself. You'll know that the idea of a bdsm sounds good in your head but the intimacy of slow and time taking it's more rewarding. 
			
			To me, sex used to just be a thing to say "I've done it" now that I found someone I love and can be intimate with. Sex is something that's great, but I enjoy the cuddling afterwards. I enjoy more of what comes next and what makes her happy. 
			
			Be patient man, jealousy doesn't look good on a person. Be real with yourself and find the true reason why you're envious. In the mean time, I'd suggest getting a body pillow or a big pillow just to hold with or sleep on the couch. Might not do good for your body, but it's nice to have something to sleep against. 
			
			Also, practice being nice without an insult to follow up. Getting food? Tell the cashier she's got nice earrings get your food and leave. It will help your confidence in communication with women and that jealousy will fade.
			
			Don't be afraid to change your wardrobe if you're not feeling like you're attracting the women you want. Bright colors helped me change my mood, and depression. Helped me gain the confidence to even complement someone's dress or watch or something. I'm no casanova, but if there's something I learned from Reddit that isn't all bullshit, it's that women much rather be complimented on a small thing than a physical feature that they couldn't change. Worse case scenario you can read cues fr the strangers and realize that wasn't a good time or situation to complement someone's shoes as they stand behind a desk. 
			
			
			
			
			To me, it sounds like you're just lonely. And none of the things you title yourself as.

		* 🟧 **[Globin347](https://www.reddit.com/user/Globin347)** ⬆️ 4 _(2021-04-13 12:34:48)_

			A bit of advice: your weight, muscle mass, and facial structure aren’t the most important parts of being attractive. It’s hygiene and behavior. For hygiene, make sure you shower every day, wear clean clothes, and keep your house and car tidy. You ought to do a deep clean at least once a week, and be sure to shave, too. Even if you want a beard and/or mustache, there’s a big difference between a guy who carefully trims his facial hair, and a guy who just never cuts their hair.
			
			That said, working out certainly doesn’t hurt. Provided you are clean and live in a clean house, it will not only make you more attractive, but you’ll feel a lot better and less angry overall. (Mind you, working out won’t immediately improve your mood. The first week or so, you might be miserable doing so; you’ll have to push through that, and start with light excercise so you don’t overwhelm yourself. Going for a walk, doing 15 push ups, and 15 sit ups every day is a good start. Once you don’t feel exhausted after that, you can bump up the numbers.)
			
			For behavior, make sure you treat women as independent actors with their own goals. Other comments cover this already. Another important point is confidence; you don’t need sex to prove yourself worth.

			OP, high school kids are the absolute worst when it comes to making fun of others for being virgins or for never having a girlfriend in their life (that was me). But I kept being the real me, always having a positive attitude, and trying to be nice and friendly with anyone I met whether I liked them or not. Take care of yourself physically and mentally. You don’t even need to be attractive guy to get girls to like you. Having a great personality is what makes you attractive! Going out of your way to try and make yourself look better or feel better is attractive to people. Setting goals in your life and talking about those goals with people makes you more likable and more desirable to be around. I am in no way shape or form trying to bring you down more than you are, but I think you are here because you know that there are parts of your character and the thoughts that you are having which aren’t healthy and are just wrong. But that’s okay! I had them too! It took leaving high school, being open to meeting new people, and being open to becoming a different person than I was in high school. I met so many people who (very luckily for me) weren’t afraid to tell me that my views were just plain wrong. For me, it was the embarrassment of my best friend saying, “whoa man, you can’t say that shit!” The look on his face said it all. Things WILL get better! Unfortunately, if you are like me, it may take leaving high school to see things getting better. And it won’t happen instantaneously. It will take years, but you need to be open to becoming a better person, and learning new things, and fucking take care of yourself! That is huge! You can’t be fun for everyone else if you aren’t fun for yourself. Love yourself, man! You are probably a much better guy than you realize. Also, this might be the most difficult thing of all to hear, but typically an “incel” is associating with other people like them, just like successful people associate with successful people, and trashy people associate with trashy people. Do yourself a favor and get off the websites and subreddits for incels, and take a look at those that you associate with. Some study done years and years ago showed that as people, our personalities are a combination of the 5 people we associate with the most. I am sorry to tell you that getting rid of the toxic friends and online forums is going to be a major factor and shifting your views. My final piece of advice is for the future, when you do start becoming intimate with someone. COMMUNICATE! You can have all the sex in the world but you will have a hard time being good with your partner if you don’t tell each other what you like and don’t like (even those weird kinks), and what your partner is and isn’t doing right. Communicate on ways each other can improve, and be open and excited rather than offended by those conversations. That’s all I have for you and I wish you the absolute best of luck in this next big step in your life! It will probably get a bit dicy in the coming years, but you can always be a better person! Also, something that will make you feel really good really fast, is to GIVE. I think it could be really beneficial to you. Just GIVE! Give to the homeless shelter up the road, give to charity or the homeless person on the street. Save up some money and take your mom out to dinner. I don’t know, it might not help you, but some of the happiest and most life changing moments I have had were when I went out of my way to give. It helped me a lot to get out of some bad thoughts. I want to be rich and successful not so that I can live lavishly, but because now my dream job is to just GIVE! Maybe just try it out. If you only have a dollar, give it.

	1) You need to stop identifying as someone who isn't having sex. Start by cultivating an identity that is positive. What do you want to do with your life? Do you have a social life? Do you have a community? What are your hobbies and interests?  

	2) I'm a 22 y/o man who has never had much luck with the opposite sex either. But I don't care. Why? Because I'm in college and I have much greater things to worry about than getting laid. You're in high school and the next few years are probably some of the most important in your life as what you do with them will most likely affect your career and your livelihood in the future. Don't waste it worrying about sex. You need to let go of this idea (often perpetuated by movies and TV) that you HAVE to get laid or else you're missing out on this "awesome, life changing experience". 

	3) The average age where a man loses his virginity in the US is 18. It's the same age for girls. Which means that of all the people you know in your age group, around half of them are virgins like you. If they are not letting this fact get to them, why are you? 

	4) Because getting laid is harder for men than for women, there is an understandable male tendency to look up to and/or envy men who have sex with lots of women (assuming they didn't pay for them), because in a way it is an "achievement". But you must understand that, in the grand scheme of things, it is a pretty minor "achievement", on the same level as being to solve a 4X4 Rubiks cube or being able to juggle. It may make for good conversation material but it's really not a big deal. These men who you are jealous of who have sex with lots of women probably don't even see it as much of a achievement themselves. 

	5) Quit porn, and stop following that girl on Reddit. Stop watching sexually explicit material.

			Another thing to keep in mind is that in high school, sex can be really socially impactful for women too, but in a negative way. It’s not uncommon that they’ll be called sluts and can be made fun of for it. So there’s a huge incentive for girls to not be having sex. Once you get to college, though, no one gives a shit if you’re having sex or not. This is obviously anecdotal but I know a *ton* of women who lost their virginities freshman year. And not even always to someone “worthy” by your metrics - just to someone who showed an interest in them, held a good conversation, and made them feel desired. I don’t know if you’re going to college, but it’s not really about college, per se - it’s about how toxic high school can be, and getting away from that puritanical culture/mindset. There’s a lot more sex in the adult world because it comes with a lot less stigma (on both fronts). And I absolutely guarantee it’s better as an adult once you’ve had plenty of practice and know what feels good and what doesn’t. Think of it like... yo-yoing. Anyone can have some fun throwing a yo-yo up and down. But it’s a lot **more** fun when you know some tricks and can really dazzle people.

	Its fine if you are a virgin bro. Lot of people both boys and girls are virgins at your age and beyond, if you wanna remedy this, focus on you, Focus on looking good for you, sleep right, eat right, be confident on who you are, don't be messuring yourself based on how many people wanna have sex with you, but on how you feel about yourself, that on its own projects confidence, which is one of the keys to a successful life on all fronts. And remmember, don't hate the players, hate the game, hating women isn't gonna get you the victory you want.

	Also don't spend so much time on this cesspool called social media so much, go out with your boys, have a beer,  go hiking, spend your time coding and honing your craft, eventualy you might get picked up by a tech company, there you meet people, maybe a cute girl, you ask her out and see where it goes. You have a lot of things ahead of you, don't just focus on the sex, unsuccessful people have sex too, so that doesnt matter, its only like adding spicy sauce to your KFC, does it taste better? Sure, but you aint gonna die from a lack of booty. So relax my friend, enjoy life and eventualy you will get on theright track to accomplish all your dreams

I won't go into the full story but basically this was an infamous internet dude who thought women owed him sex and had a terrible attitude and strategy when it came to approaching women (he was autistic so it didn't help either with his stubbornness), this long drought of being a virgin didnt' stop until his mid 30s when he hired a prostitute.

	You have some serious problems, and the fact that you seem to _get_ that these are problems, and that the problem is with _you_ and not with the rest of the world, is an extremely promising place to start. Kudos for that. That's some worthwhile self-reflection right there.

	I can only offer so much advice here, though, because... well... I'm not a psychologist. I know a bit about incel culture, but I'm not sure how to _fix_ any of these problems, or help you get past them. I can give you a little advice (tip one: **get out of incel communities and try to find better ones, these places are really fucking bad for you**), but ultimately it sounds like you're dealing with some really heavy self-hatred and self-worth issues. And if it is available to you, your best shot really is to seek professional help. Please don't see this as a knock against you; this is coming from someone who knows full well that he should be getting more therapy than he gets. 😅

	If you'd like my personal advice on some of these issues, I can give it, but in any case like this... If you can access it, professional therapy or counseling will almost certainly help you.

	If you can accept that alot of people don't actually care whether you've had sex and that you can still be respected without having sex than you are on your way to becoming a "man".

	Well I tried reading through comments and they're mostly quite helpful. I would rage at this but you are indeed young and I'll admire that you want to change this. 

	Reading through your thread all I saw is women being seen as objects. And honestly it starts there. Everyone has already said how you need to treat them equal, and how your worth won't change just because you shoved your dick in a vagina. Everything you feel about yourself to not be valuable will continue to be there post dick shoving.

	I'm not sure what is your purpose of changing your mindset. Is it just because you heard it's wrong? Do you know why it's wrong for you? I think understanding that will bring you closer to the journey. Right now we can all give you advice on tweaking your personality but what is the end goal of changing your mind? If it's just to seem better on paper so you can finally convince a girl to sleep with you, that's manipulation and just ends up being much worse for you and everyone involved. You'll just end up disassociating from your own self and will do anything to win the game. And that's gonna take a long time to recover, so in that sense maybe it's best to stay alligned with yourself even if that means you're a misogynistic person.

	Start out with the simplest thing you think is lacking. Have you ever reached out to a girl and talked to her? If you're worried you're gonna say dumb misogynistic stuff, well, so be it. You'll learn not to do it next time. You can do something even smaller, send an anonymous present to a crush; don't expect anything back but see the reaction without her knowing it's you. 

	You've pointed out many issues you've found. Maybe start putting all these points on a board and make a big ------> to where do you want the opinion to change. And figure out the steps in between for yourself.

	Honestly anything we say here may or may not convince you. The reality is, we're all in this just trying it out. The more confident you'll feel the more you'll stop questioning why others aren't or are attracted to you. Yes, even that doesn't matter at some point. It ends up just being a vibe that you will follow. Cause your whole weight and worth won't be tied to that one attraction.

	You're 18. You haven't had a lot of years yet to process the complexity of humans. You're trying to find a fit for all solution but there is none. Most things in life that are made as a fit for all suck. That's why the variety of choices in every single aspect of our life. Everyone has a niche. Give this thing time and start small. 

	It's a good first step but you have to do the work. Appreciated but let's not pat ourselves on the back just yet, let's see some progress in the right direction.

	And yes, as others said, sex is fucking horrible in teen times dear lord, if there's any reason I wouldn't want to be younger it would be that. I lost my virginity at 20 and honestly I could have waited longer myself. It probably would have saved me years of hassle. And believe me, I'm a fucking catch.

			Yes. Hear me out. You do. You absolutely see women as less than humans. I'm serious here. You might not realize it. No one wants to see themselves as a bad person, and the most misogynistic men say they actually do see women as people. But they do not. And this is something you have to work on. Your relationship with women will not change until you change this mindset. I promise you that.

			But you are a man. That’s not something that can be taken away from you. It’s literally a textbook definition of biological parts of you. If those biological parts don’t feel fitting to you, you have a whole different problem which is solved by understanding more the subject of transgender people. Which maybe isn’t the case but what do I know.
			
			In the last year a ton of people had to move back in with their parents. It’s cheaper, you can save up money. That argument is also built on some misconceptions which maybe aren’t so bad. Maybe you do live in your parents basement. But it doesn’t have to be permanent. Nothing of what we do is permanent. Everything passes. Nothing matters. It’s daunting and freeing at the same time.

			Tbh I've seen you in this thread disregarding the opions of women just because they are women. I've seen you insist that you know the behavior of women better than women do, despite the obvious lack of meaningful relationships with women. I've firsthand seen you treat women as inferior and I don't even know you, we haven't even interacted for five minutes.  If I can pick up on it, why wouldn't the women you meet in real life? You really need to consider that your contempt for women is more apparent than you believe, and as a whole people don't enjoy sharing intimacy with those who view them with contempt.

* 🟩 **[dayman1370](https://www.reddit.com/user/dayman1370)** ⬆️ 749 _(2021-04-13 01:27:37)_

	First and foremost. Sex is between two consenting adults. You don’t “earn” sex from a woman. You don’t have “X” amount of cars, or money, or awards and that earns you sex. You don’t earn sex by being attractive or funny or personable. Sex is a mutual experience between two people.

	With that being said, you need to start with your mindset. Stop making everything about sex. Also stop blaming and hating on others because you’re not having it. No one is out to stop you or stand in your way. The only person that does that is yourself. 

	Second, work on yourself. Focus on building solid friendships/ relationships with others that are like minded. Value them. Don’t expect things from them. Be there for them. Take up new hobbies. Find new passions. Step outside your comfort zone.

	Third, you are young. Men don’t stop maturing until they are 25 years old. It’s not unorthodox or weird that you haven’t had sex yet. The harder you try to make it happen and the more you worry about it, the longer it will be. It will come naturally once you meet a person you trust that trusts you. At its core, sex is about intimacy and trust. You are willing to give the entirety of yourself to someone else, and them the same to you.

	Lastly, sex doesn’t deteriorate with age lol. You may be hornier and have more rampant hormones as a young adult, but sex honestly gets better with age because it’s more often than not with someone you care about and love. 

	I think the most important thing for you to change is blaming others. It won’t get you anywhere and will just perpetuate your loneliness and anger. Look at it this way. The longer you stay angry at others and project hate and misogyny, the longer you will keep yourself isolated from intimacy and connection with others.

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 11 _(2021-04-13 16:44:05)_

	Women do not mock men for being virgins. I have never seen this in my entire life. You are projecting.

	A lot of cognitive dissonance here. Have you considered that women decide who to sleep with based on personality? Your "whore" didnt take into account looks or money cause she wanted to connect with someone and that pisses you off? Have you considered you may have been pissed if it was money that made her sleep with him? Or looks? Is there any right way for her to sleep with a fan that isnt you? You sound really bitter and obsessed with both sex and yourself. I cant imagine from this post that a conversation with you could be pleasant for a woman who you consider an option for sex.

	>sex at a older age isn't as enjoyable compared to doing It in your younger years. 

	Said literally no woman ever. 

	Here's something worth knowing: being a raging ball of hormones and insecurities actually doesnt make for very good sex.

	You're giving vaginas too much power. Putting your dick in one wont magically make you more worthy. It wont change anything about you. It wont give you respect or power. It won't mean that your are attractive ir smart or interesting. It certainly wont make you a man. 

	You hate women because you dont like yourself, not because women dont like you. You dont change when you go from a virgin or not-a-virgin. You can put your dick into a baker's dozen of vagina and you will still feel unworthy and ugly and disrespected and overlooked and underappreciated. Because all of those feelings are coming from you - theyre internal, not external. 

	Once you learn to love yourself and derive your self esteem from the things you do and the person you are, it won't matter if a bit of you has been inside a bit of someone else. 

	This experience

	>This guy wasn't even good looking and in fact was below average. He was very fucking scrawny and he had such a weird penis shape and his dick wasn't even big. He had no wealth, no good looks, not even a big or good looking penis and this fucking whore chose to sleep with him over a "nICe ReSpeCtfUL mEsSaGe"

	Should have helped you realize that all the things you want and value (good looks, wealth, manliness, respect, power) arent actually what everyone else values. Dude was nice to her and respected her and that led to them connecting and then having sex. 

	You cant hate women and blame them and belittle them and see them as a means to an end and expect to get the same result.

			Probably just as important is "nice and respectful" is from the point of view of the person receiving the message, not the person sending the message.
			
			What I've seen a lot on incel/red pill type posts is "I did this nice thing and that nice thing but she still won't get with me!" Usually those "nice things" are from a movie or book or anime or whatever.
			
			My best guess about why the OF girl hooked up with the "nice message" guy is that his messaging was nice and respectful and responsive to *her particular needs*.  It probably wasn't one message, either, but a conversation.  Probably not "omg I wanna fuck you so hard" either.
			
			(All this assumes it wasn't a porn stunt - be careful about those - very few pizza delivery guys actually get laid randomly.)
			
			I'm not a woman but my experience in life so far has been that women would prefer to be recognized and treated as an individual human being and not as a cardboard cut out.  "Women like this" and "women act this way" and "women care about these things" might do ok if we're talking about the combined behavior of 1,000 women, but each woman is unique.
			
			And yeah, sex today is way better than when I was in high school or college.

		* 🟧 **[iamasecretthrowaway](https://www.reddit.com/user/iamasecretthrowaway)** ⬆️ 231 _(2021-04-13 09:06:51)_

				Even being an actual nice person helps but is not enough (but of course, being a manipulative "nice" guy can only hurt), because literally nothing can ever guarantee a connection with anyone in particular. You can be the best guy in the world, and could still get rejected from someone who just didn't feel a spark, and that's ok. 
				
				We should really try to change the culture of relationships as validation. There are too many movies where the main character "gets the girl" and that somehow turns his life around. Relationships should be about mutual connection, not a confirmation of one's self-worth.

				* 🟪 **[GamerPhileYT](https://www.reddit.com/user/GamerPhileYT)** ⬆️ 9 _(2021-04-13 13:06:45)_

					Exactly. I want more movies where the protagonist doesn’t “get the girl”, and the later half of the movie is spent on him realizing that that’s okay, and that he can still be happy without her.

			* 🟦 **[brookleinneinnein](https://www.reddit.com/user/brookleinneinnein)** ⬆️ 32 _(2021-04-13 11:09:25)_

				I’m going to throw in that nice does not equal good. We put emphasis on nice, but frankly nice can come from a place of pure manipulation. Goodness cannot be faked. Goodness is the sum of behaviors that occur when no one is watching. It is being kind with no expectation of reward. It is rare, but personally it truly is the most attractive attribute, beyond wealth, and physical characteristics.

				* 🟪 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 21 _(2021-04-13 13:04:49)_

					Extremely important point. 
					
					Personally in my life, I have seen this with a lot of people in the Buddhist community. So many (new or inexperienced) people think Buddhists must be super nice, sweet, overly-lovey people and if you aren't those things, then you're a bad Buddhist and an asshole.
					
					However, in my experience, a lot of the best, truly most kind Buddhists I know have sort of a gruff outer exterior. While they can be "nice", they really do not take any shit, and can come off as very forceful/"wrathful" or tough sometimes. But underneath, they will do anything to help you. Give you the shirt off their back kind of people. 
					
					True kindness is not just acting nice or sweet. It is much deeper than that.

			* 🟦 **[RegressToTheMean](https://www.reddit.com/user/RegressToTheMean)** ⬆️ 61 _(2021-04-13 09:31:20)_

				Yeah, being nice should be the baseline. Far too many incels complain about the "friend zone"
				
				I'd consider the opposite of this the fuck zone. That the incel is only being nice to get laid. It's not like you get good boy points if you're nice and can cash them in for sex.
				
				While OP has made a good first step in recognizing his challenges, he probably needs a boatload of therapy to work through these issues

				* 🟪 **[PerplexityRivet](https://www.reddit.com/user/PerplexityRivet)** ⬆️ 34 _(2021-04-13 15:35:52)_

					I'm a guy that spent a LOT of time in the friend zone to a bunch of wonderful girls that I liked, but who weren't interested in me romantically. And I decided to embrace it rather than resent it. After years of this, when I finally met the amazing, talented, beautiful, driven woman who would become my wife, I knew how to listen to her, connect with her emotionally, and be comfortable just hanging out with her in a non-romantic way. And she fell for me *hard*. Those were skills that I had to learn through experience being best friends with girls, and I'm glad I did because that's exactly what your spouse is supposed to be--a best friend that you have hot sex with.
					
					TL/DR: Embrace the friend zone, because it will build your ability to be a genuinely good partner to someone.

It’s *fantastic* PR to keep her subscribers interested, but otherwise a *terrible fucking idea* to fuck a guy who is obsessed enough with you to follow your only fans.  The chance that ends safely and happily for the girl are practically nonexistent.  It’s probably just a new boyfriend who she can pretend is a sub to keep that glimmer of hope going for them (or maybe he really did pay her, who knows).

Yeah, he’s gotta take a pill but we are both more confident than we’ve ever been in our lives, know our kinks and have less baggage and it’s just wonderful.

		Shockingly sleeping with a new woman didn't make me feel better. It made me feel much worse, because nothing changed and what I believed would make me happy had no effect.
		
		I'm now in a very loving committed relationship and the sex is FAR better than it was in my 20s (I'm early 30s). Sex with randoms can be fun but it sure as hell doesn't make up for not loving yourself.

	Better to spend your time focusing on your own development as a person.  Whether that be education or training for a career that would interest you, reading more to enrich your understanding of the world, and physical activity for your health and as an outlet for your anger and frustrations. Only when you grow and can feel comfortable in your own skin will you be able to attract other people to you. Agree that your vibe and attitudes will likely keep people away until you can channel your thoughts and actions to a more positive place.

* 🟩 **[Floomby](https://www.reddit.com/user/Floomby)** ⬆️ 44 _(2021-04-13 04:12:32)_

	I want to start by expressing how much I respect you for having the balls to engage in this level of self reflection. From my experience, anyone who is willing to examine themselves and question their actions and belief system is showing that they have what it takes to grow and find happiness.  

	Now. Step One. Again, from my lofty perch (edit: I'm actually kind of being sarcastic when I say this, because when I was young I had zero game and little self assurance, and at this point I still feel like I'm not especially mature...) of being some 4 decades older than you, I have found that so many times, when I am stuck on something and really need to progress, but can't seem to do so, it means that I need two things: 

	1.) Some external input. In other words, being genuinely stuck means that I need to seek counsel from a worthy source. That's what you are doing, right here, and with your therapist. 

	2.) You need to change your assumptions. You cannot see a solution because of one or more beliefs that are faulty and need to be questioned and discarded. It's like if you write a computer program to calculate people's power bills, and customers suddenly start getting bills saying they owe $100,000, you wouldn't tell them to shut up and pay up. You would go back and examine your code to work out where the error was. 

	So, regarding that, I have some bad news and some good news. The bad news is that I have identified multiple faulty assumptions that are leading you to the anger, frustration, and loneliness from which you currently suffer. The good news is that you can change these assumptions for ones that actually reflect reality. 

	The first, worst assumption is centered around your views of virginity and what makes you a valuable person. 

	Start here. You are very much a victim of toxic masculinity. That means that what you think constitutes "manliness" reflects the extremely narrow worldview of other immature boys. 

	Your value does not come from sticking your dick into a vagina. Your value comes from being you. You are valuable. You don't have to earn the right to be valued. You may be surrounded by awful people right now. Maybe your parents are cold, negligent, emotionally unavailable, or abusive. Maybe you don't have many siblings or cousins, or may even you do, but they are extremely hierarchical and are always trying to identify someone who is the piece of shit so that they can pile on that person and derive their sense of self worth from that, from hurting someone else, or maybe the other kids you have grown up around were like that. 

	There is a lot of that going around. Maybe it's a result of end stage, ruthless, winner-take-all capitalism. 

	Well, fuck that noise. You are the product of one and a half billion years of evolution. You have a consciousness. You are literally made of stardust. Your existence is a miracle. You have a right to be here, exactly as you are, whether you are a virgin, skinny or fat or muscle bound or handsome or weird looking or whatever else you are or aren't, you are important and you need to tell yourself that no matter what you do or don't like about yourself, you have a basic, fundamental value that no one has the right to question. So even if bullies or even friends and family do or say something to make you feel less than, they are wrong. Nobody is better than you just because. You aren't better than anyone else, either. 

	Second. The concept that somehow you have to fulfill certain conditions in order to be allowed to be considered a man is ludicrous. 

	Do you identify with being a man? Awesome. You are a man. End of story. 

	Again, no one can take that from you, no matter what they try to say about it. You are the only one who has the right to declare your gender. If you say you are a man, then you are a man. 

	It is 2021. An actual dick is no longer what determines whether or not you are a man. You are. 

	So, I would say that you should do your best to avoid all of the people who are putting these toxic ideas into your head that: 

	-Some people are worth more than others, and some people are worthless. 

	-A person does not get to decide for themselves what their gender is. A committee of people, who may or may not be awful, nasty, and cruel, pass judgment daily on who "makes the cut" and is allowed into the deeply exclusive country club of True Manhood. 

	-Relationships are all about fucking. Relationships are but another of many tests to determine whether you are an okay person or a trash person. 

	-People who do or don't meet certain criteria will be mocked and this is the inevitable order of The Way Things Are, and these people are justified in their mockery 

	-There is a very strict and particular criteria for what does and doesn't constitute good looking. Good looks are a strict linear hierarchy, like rank in the military. Your value as a person is determined by your looks. Only good looking people deserve Relationships. People who do not conform to the Universal Standard of Good Looking do not deserve to be in relationships. 

	I could go on, but I think that the assumptions listed above, which I identified just from the first few paragraphs of this post, all need to be trashed, because they are all rigid amd dead wrong. 

	I have already talked about how you are inherently valuable just because you are a human, and how you are a man because you say you are. You are 18 and older, and you identify as male. Issue settled. Anybody who says otherwise is being deliberately cruel or ignorant, and deserves to be disregarded. 

	Okay, next vital area. You want to be in a relationship? 

	First of all, a relationship means, relating to another human being. You have relationships with your parents/guardians, companions, family members, bosses, teachers, etc. 

	If you want a romantic and sexual relationship with a woman, then you need to understand that this consists of, first and foremost, a social interaction consisting of give and take with another human being. 

	A popular idea among misguided and unmoored young guys is that a relationship means that you posses this other person and that now you get to stick your dick in them a whole bunch. 

	How depressing and transactional. 

	It is especially bad if someone thinks that they are required to engage in a bunch of fucking in order to prove their intrinsic value to other immature young men. 

	Speaking as a woman, nobody wants the meaning of their existence to be so that some guy can prove to a bunch of assholes that he is sufficiently manly up to their standards. 

	Relationships are about relating. That means social interaction, talking, getting to know one another as humans and as friends first. The sex is an extension of that. 

	Ok, sure, plenty of women enjoy hookups just because sex feels good. Well, that's what sex is about. Two people exchanging affection and helping *each other* have a lovely experience together. 

	So, you can't just think of a female vagina as some sort of top level cum sock. There is a human in there. 

	Want to know how those guys whom you don't think are conventionally attractive are attracting female attention? With social skills. 

	So the next step is you have to step put of your comfort zone, and dedicate yourself to developing your emotional intelligence. 

	Go ahead and Google social intelligence and emotional intelligence. Those are  the most important skills you need to work on in order to be less lonely in general. 

	Oh, and broaden your horizons. Ditch the people who want to out you down and subject you to an endless series of shit tests as to whether or not you qualify as a man. 

	It's late and I have babbled on enough, and probably belabored my point. Reading over my post, maybe it sounds scoldy. Sorry if it does. You deserve nothing but encouragement, really. You have barely started in life. I don't mean that as a put down at all. I mean, that is the inevitable result of being an 18 year old who is only just now been legally permitted to take charge of his life. You grew up surrounded by certain ideas. Fortunately, you are intelligent and curious enough to want to start questioning things. 

	There is a whole big world out there filled with people and experiences you can't even imagine yet. There is a whole life you haven't lived yet. There are all kinds of crazy, amazing, horrible, beautiful things out there. 

	So develop your social and emotional intelligence, never stop learning, steer clear of bad and limited people, and seek out good people who affirm your dignity and who bring out the best in you.

	Hi there, I'm a psychotherapist, but I'm not your psychotherapist, and nothing I say here establishes a patient-therapist relationship.  In fact, I suggest you print it, and your OP, out to give to your therapist.

	I've wondered a bunch of things about incels for a while, and reading your post here, I had an epiphany – for which I thank you, and for which I will attempt to return the favor.

	There is something in your post – or rather something **missing** in your post – that sticks out like a big sore thumb.

	There's absolutely nothing about your post which suggests you like or desire sex.

	You almost exclusively talk about sex as something you want for the status it would confer upon you among men.  You are absolutely preoccupied with this instrumental use of sex.

	That's not how it usually works.  For most people, overwhelmingly, sex is all about **pleasure.** That's the draw.  Most people, most especially most 18 year olds, are super into sex because they find that **fucking feels amazing**.  They love sex for its own sake.  They crave it, and that craving is called horniness and lust.

	You don't self-describe as horny.  There's nothing of pleasure or need in your post.  You don't use the standard euphemisms to express a longing for sex, not even the language of "love" or "intimacy".   You describe masturbating to someone's picture, and that's as close as you get to expressing lust – but it's arousal at looking at a picture, and given the dearth of expression of sexuality in your post, I'm not going to make the assumption that that's the same thing as actually desiring to get it on with an actual person.

	The only place you discuss your horniness is situated in a hypothetical future looking back, with this amazing assertion:

	>Teenagers have raging hormones and are much hornier and lustful than  adults. Therefore even if i end up having sex when I'm older, what would  be the point if i am not even gonna have the same excitement or fun?  I'll be a grown man and i won't have raging hormones anymore and I'll be  much more stoic and busy so sex will be worthless at such a age.

	Those aren't the words of someone who likes sex or anticipates sex being enjoyable.  It boils down to "if I were any less horny than I am right now, sex wouldn't be enjoyable enough to bother with", which suggest you are so not horny, you don't really see how you could be any less horny.

	What this all sounds like from here, and I know I'm going way out on a limb, is that you're someone who doesn't experience sexual attraction.  You experience sexual *arousal* – you get hard and can get yourself off – but you never look at someone and think "I want to do that person".  Sexual attraction is when you want to have sex with a specific person.  And your account, above, sounds like that of someone who doesn't experience sexual attraction and is trying to force himself into having a sex life anyways.

	And of course, it can't work.  One of the things that women who are attracted to men are into is being **sexually desired**. If you don't display sexual attraction to a woman, she's never going to entertain the idea of having sex with you, if she's at all normal, sexually.

	Is that what "nice" *really* means to you?  Does it mean "I don't have unchaste thoughts about women?"  Do you think that's what the "bad" men are *guilty* of – lust – whom women prefer?

	Is what the "involuntary" part of "incel" really means to you is that you didn't chose to be this way, but find you are?  That it's not that you can't *find* a sexual partner, but that you can't find in yourself desire for one? Just the societal demand that you have one?

	That would explain why your anger is so much about social status, in such an exaggerated way.  If you believe society requires functioning as a sexually desiring person as a criterion for manliness, then being undesiring means never being a man in the eyes of society.

	If this is what is going on, and the battle that's raging in your heart: there's a name for this.  It's **asexuality**.  And you have a people and a movement waiting for you.

	The modern asexual movement defines asexuality not as an absence of sexual response or libido, but – by parallel construction to "homosexual" and "heterosexual" – someone who isn't sexually **attracted** to people.  Some ace people are sex-repulsed; others have high libidos but don't care to have sex with others; some engage in sex to please partners.  It's a spectrum. And within asexuality there are people who are not sexually attracted, but who are romantically or sensually attracted.

	The asexual movement stands up for the dignity and worth of asexual people. It insists they are no less men and women and enbies and *adults* because of their sexuality.

	If what's going on here is that you don't actually *want* to have sex with a woman (or anyone), but you think you have to to fit in in society, I recommend you go find the asexual movement.  They will be an enormous source of comfort and support to you.

	Consent matters.  And that includes your **own** consent.  Please don't force yourself to engage in a sexual behavior you don't want to just to impress others.  Please don't violate your own consent.  You absolutely do not have to engage in sex you don't want to.  Please do not let anyone convince you otherwise.

		I’m certainly not a therapist by any means but I can give you some insight into why he doesn’t talk about sex as a pleasurable act and rather a status act. 
		
		I’m just a random dude on the internet, but would consider myself incelish growing up and have grown into a relatively successful &amp; self-loving man with a wonderful girlfriend &amp; great friends. 
		
		The reason he doesn’t talk about sex through the lens of gratification is because he has no experience with women. He has nothing to draw from other than porn. But what men understand &amp; boys understand implicitly is that they want sex and look towards how do you get sex? Well, the natural first look is at who is getting the very attractive women? 
		
		Men with lots of money, men with lots of influence, men with great achievements, men with lots of charisma. To be brief, men with status. So this kind of thinking skips over the sexual gratification part because seeking sex because it’s pleasurable is a de facto assumption. But he’s identified that status is what gets you there. So he’s obsessed with status, it’s merely an extension of his sexual desire. 
		
		To him, the status that people have achieved is because of their sex drive and pursuit of women. He’s bitter an angry about lacking status because he perceives status as the access to women. So he’s focused on status, focused on the reward of status, and sex as the reward. But he hasn’t experienced the reward so it’s simply this idea in his head. Sex is literally a fantasy for him. 
		
		But what I can say is that the anger and bitterness about lacking status to me is simply a way to try to avoid self-responsibility for failure, and therefore avoiding the necessary steps for growth. 
		
		For him and men like him, what they need is purpose &amp; ambition. Something to give them confidence and feel valued. They lack self-love because they don’t believe they deserve any. And a women’s ultimate show of love is her willingness to be her most vulnerable self and have sex. 
		
		But men like this (and I say this because I once thought this long ago) believe that fulling this sexual desire is akin to being loved. But that is obviously not the case. But they won’t believe you if you tell them this. Because the desire is so strong and it’s been lacking so much that they can’t comprehend the difference between sex with someone you have genuine care for &amp; sex with an attractive woman. They have no experience to draw from.
		
		Sex with women is fraught with lots of risks, has lots of rules, and is really difficult because it requires advanced social skills. So it ends up on this pedestal that seems so out of reach that it has become a fairytale almost to them. But they also know that it’s not a fairytale because there are people having lots of sex all the time. This is the source of the frustration. 
		
		No one teaches men about becoming a man. There’s no training manual, dating culture has become this vague, vacant mess of power games, and there’s little sympathy for men who struggle with social anxiety and have this teenage boy sex drive that they aren’t used to controlling or realizing how it’s affecting their decision making. 
		
		Anyways, sorry for rambling, I just really think incels are really misunderstood.

		OP's description of his behaviors like following a specific pornographic model and interacting with her extensively and being attracted to certain men for their appearance seems to contradict this conclusion. You seem to be downplaying these as instances of arousal-driven behavior but it is clear that OP has clear sexual preferences and desires.
		
		OP describes feeling of individualized attraction and sexual desire, but his feelings of enjoyment and pleasure have been sublimated into anger and frustration.
		
		I think working off of only OPs post, which already shows an admirable level of candor and openness, we ought to take him at his word that he desires sex and not try to project a sexual identity onto him that he has given us no real reason to believe he experiences.

		* 🟧 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 27 _(2021-04-13 13:13:56)_

			I think the "psychotherapist" is reaching really far grasping at air.
			He refuses to say "he wants to have sex" so that makes him asexual is over simplification.
			
			Maybe he doesn't want to admit that he's horny as fuck and wants to slam some pussy because its embarrassing for a virgin to admit they want to feel that pleasure. 
			
			I'm sure there's many other reasons why he wouldn't outright say it. Maybe he was assuming we would already know that of course he wants his donger vice gripped in the tubular slip n slide. 
			
			OP seems like they came down with the 1st year psychology student syndrome hard.

				I think you have some points here. The psychotherapist may be right. They may he wrong. It's really not safe to say without actually knowing the person. (my wife is a therapist, she would absolutely never conclusively say this about someone without doing an actual one on one assessment in a clinical setting) 
				
				I am not expert. But my initial thought was that he probably does have sexual desire. He just doesn't know how to reconcile it he level of his desire with the fact that he isn't get any. And wishes to then blame it on the world. 
				
				I am a man with a lot of strong sexual desire. And I know how strong that biological urge can be. But I am not an incel. I can imagine a situation where someone has those same urges, and instead of channeling them into "how do I change to get some" like most people do, they channel it into, "why has society deprived me if this relief of which I crave so strongly?" And then they convince themselves that it is not their fault they aren't getting any it's society's fault. 
				
				When people get Horny af their logical brain shuts down a bit. At least I know that has happened to me. I have made some big mistakes when horny (always consensual mistakes) 
				
				Now I am not justifying anything for incels. I am not an incel at all. I strongly respect women. (if anything I have a thing for strong women, and women who are more powerful than I am) all I am saying is I agree with what you mean in the sense that to me, I think this dude probably does get horny af,. And in their horniness they come to some really really had conclusions about society.

		Hi, since you are a psychotherapist who will affect others, I want to give my 2c. I do not believe OP is necessarily asexual, he just cannot express his horniness healthily.
		
		I relate personally to OPs story in pretty much every way (see my reply to him). Despite this, I am not asexual at all and have since worked, sometimes desperately, to "fix" myself, including therapy and unethical behavour. I now have a good sex life. I have siblings who have labeled themselves asexual, but this, and all emotions, are an unspeakable topic within the family.
		
		I struggle to express my emotions (including horniness), which I believe afflicts OP also. I don't feel I am **allowed** to have emotions, as a result of my childhood.
		
		This book by another pshchotherapist explains it: [Running on Empty: Overcome Your Childhood Emotional Neglect](https://www.amazon.nl/gp/product/161448242X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1).

	* 🟨 **[adoreroda](https://www.reddit.com/user/adoreroda)** ⬆️ 9 _(2021-04-13 16:27:53)_

		I think there's something in your post that's not really addressed: virgin shaming.  
		OP didn't address or imply such a thing has directly happened to him, but he lives in a society where men who have had sex at least once (subsequently aren't a virgin) are put on a pedestal and have a higher social status, and that's what he seems upset about.
		
		I also disagree that teenagers have sex exclusively for the pleasure of it. Virgin shaming still occurs within grade school and people can feel pressured into having sex in order to upgrade their social status, or to stop being made fun of. 
		
		While we all can agree there is no objective hierarchy for who is more valuable or not based on the amounts of times you've had sex, it is socially upheld and reinforced and is very ubiquitous. There can be a chip on your shoulder in regards to the subject because you know for a fact that most people have those thoughts; that men who don't have sex/never have sex are seen as inferior. It is similar to heightism. That doesn't mean you know for a fact every person you come across has those thoughts, but it is a high probability they probably do, or subconsciously support it even without the intention of being malicious. The end problem is: you subconsciously have to think of your being a virgin as a problem. That it places you in an inferior spot in society. That constantly is going to be on your mind, and it's hard to just say "don't care about what people think"

	* 🟨 **[HopefulEducator](https://www.reddit.com/user/HopefulEducator)** ⬆️ 11 _(2021-04-13 08:09:41)_

		That's a very interesting point and thanks for putting it in great detail. I'm 10 years older than the op and I also have quite similar problems (I used to have toxic feelings but not as much anymore). I actually do feel sexual attraction to some women, but then I just ignore or suppress those feelings as much as possible due to extreme shyness and a fear of rejection. I also kinda feel ashamed about expressing my sexual desires I guess, since I get very uncomfortable expressing myself on this topic. Obviously these have contributed to my status as a virgin. How do you think I should deal with those issues?
		
		Edit: I also have been going to a therapist btw

			Not the person you replied to but I'm guessing (due to their intro) their answer will be talk to a therapist.
			
			My 2c though are that besides what they said about asexuality, there's also a spectrum of sexuality based on emotional attraction to people (demisexuality). I know friends that have sex weekly with a new random person, and someone who's been going steady for a year with someone but doesn't want to have sex yet, partially due to past trauma and fears. How you personally express sexuality is, well, personal. 'Fear of rejection' is you projecting thoughts on how others work, specifically assuming that (1) there's a really large chance you will be rejected and (2) that that matters. (Think about being rejected in non-sexual matters: would it be the end of the world if you asked a friend to grab a beer and they said no?). Talk to a therapist, find the reason you're projecting this.

		As an asexual woman myself, your comment made me really happy :) The social pressure to have sex is there for everyone, but I think it is especially hard for asexuals. It can lead to scenarios where asexuals force themselves into sexual situations because they think they should like it. Also the desire to feel like a worthy man/woman by being sexually active/available makes it hard to even realize one's own asexuality according to my experience. It is a good thing to know that other people acknowledge this!

			As a late-bloomer Aspie, I've had plenty of friends BUT ALSO lifelong struggles with  romantic/sexual relationships!
			
			I absolutely will not speak for OP, but with the situation you describe, in my experience romantic/sexual relationship/interactions have been like, the final boss of autism, lol. Makes sense, too – romance, attraction and sexuality have layers upon LAYERS of meaning and communication that are already challenging for neurotypical people. For example, with flirting, the subtleties (and especially nonverbal queues) are REALLY EASY for autistic people to misread, or just straight-up miss.
			
			Personally, this meant I've rarely articulated my attraction to others when I've felt it, and I've had a good handful of "facepalm" moments where I realize, YEARS later, "oh my god, they were actually into me!"
			
			That said – therapy has helped me practice communication skills, both sharing &amp; receiving, that has benefited literally ALL of my relationships – family, friends, work, and yes, dating! Therapy for me is an awesome, safe environment where I can express whatever is frustrating or confusing me, break it down step-by-step, and with the help of my therapist, fill in any gaps or blind spots I might have missed. And leading into my next point, therapy has most of all helped me reconnect and better communicate with myself. The best way to grow my relationships with other people is to grow my relationship with myself first. So...
			
			Equally helpful was getting tested for ASD (as an adult). I've learned a LOT about myself and my needs, as well as what I can do to make all my relationships more enjoyable &amp; authentic. And surprise surprise, I found out a ton of the struggles I've had in my relationships are SUPER COMMON for autistic people! Testing helped me become more confident embracing, not resenting who I am. It's a massive privilege, as it's often hard to find and expensive, so I'm incredibly grateful I've been able to do it. I highly recommend searching for affordable testing to anyone questioning!
			
			Finally, some hope: despite all my struggles, all my regrets over missed opportunities, I was also able to date once in high school, and once in college before I met my current partner. But even still I didn't lose my virginity til I was almost 21. Now, I've found an amazing partner who is kind, empathetic and incredibly patient as I continue to grow. But a huge part of this has been struggling together. Learning how to communicate, compromise, empathize, and forgive. Personally, my sex life has been like working out – it's a cycle of ups and downs, learning and growing, and getting better at it takes time &amp; effort. But it really does get better! 
			
			Being autistic has made romantic relationships difficult, but not impossible – I still have to remind myself of this. Autistic people are beautiful people with beautiful minds, and beautiful hearts – and there's so many people out there who want to see how beautiful we are 💚

		I think you are missing the forest for the trees here. Of course most of the post is about the rage and resentment he feels at his status, but that in and of itself doesn't suggest that he's Ace. The example with the Redditor and how he talks about women in general clearly shows that he's attracted to women.
		
		To me it sounds like he just needs to be loved by someone. He wants a human connection, but just doesn't know how to go about making it happen. Maybe he's socially awkward, maybe he has poor self image. My guess is he has experienced bullying by the "chads" and "staceys" for being a virgin, which creates more resentment, anger, fear, and depression, which leads to more issues in connecting to other people, a sort of downward spiral.

		I wish I had the resources to give an award. You’ve put into words a perspective that I’ve truly never heard before, it’s so utterly incredible to hear a truly original opinion.
		
		I think maybe the suggesting asexuality is a bit jumping the gun. What I got from the original post was that he was sexual but his desire to have some sort of virtual social status to fill his lack of self esteem and that insecurity is destroying all his other desires and feelings. It’s really hard not having any self assurance.
		
		Also, I got the sense that the OP equates being sexually successful to being cool. There are cool people everywhere sexual or not, in fact students in competitive universities report having less sex than those in less prestigious ones. A lot of my peers just don’t want to have sex early, it’s too risky to be fun. And by peers I also mean women. A girl I know said that she and none of her friends have had been in a relationship, let alone have sex. And they’re 20 years old.
		
		You define cool for yourself. These women are cool to me and the ones I want to date. I’m sure they’d prefer a guy who has similar mindsets and goals.

	You do understand that women won't want to be with you if you hate them. 

	I know lots of short or average or whatever looking guys who are or have been in relationships and zero of them hate women. Zero of them wrap their heads in negative and toxic ideas towards women. 

	If you want to never be with a person in your life, keep on walking down that road. If you want to have a relationship, fall in love and have sex you will have to go down a different path.

	Honestly, realizing there is a problem is the most important first step toward a happier life, so well done on that front.

	Shifting your mindset and changing how you are living your life can make a *huge* impact on your happiness, and the fact that you are questioning your own thoughts suggests that you might be ready for a change in the right direction.

	1. So first, just practically, consider that jealousy and raging against "society" or "women" in the abstract does *zero* to improve your actual happiness or success in relationships.

	But it is a distraction that can keep you from making the kinds of positive changes in your life that could actually make you happier.

	If we want our lives to be different, change is a necessary step.

	2) In terms of building a functional understanding of relationships, this brief (and funny) article is also helpful.

	It's been read by over 25 million people, and is the best article I've ever seen for helping people who struggle with relationships change the way they think about them, and start to see positive changes to their lives as a result:

	[https://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-better-person/](https://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-better-person/)

	3) Consider that the reason most guys are able to date successfully is because they have typically developed their IRL social skills (usually through having *at least* a moderate amount of regular social interactions, making friends, paying attention to and accurately understanding people's responses to their behavior, learning to listen effectively to others, and learning from the feedback of how other people react to their behaviors to hone their communication skills).

	Friendships are the "easy" mode of relationships. If someone can't effectively operate at that level IRL, then there is a very good chance that they are going to struggle *a lot* in forming closer relationships that require more advanced interpersonal skills.

	Not having IRL friends can also make a person *very* lonely, and overly focused on romantic relationships that they aren't actually ready for.

	So, if you struggle with social skills / making friends in real life, consider that it makes *perfect sense* that you're going to run into problems trying to have romantic relationships.

	But also, keep in mind that *no one* is born with fully developed social skills. They must be learned. That is why if you grow up in one culture, you may have trouble adapting to social life in another culture - because you have to change the way you behave in order to operate effectively in a different social environment.

	For most people, it takes spending *a significant amount* of interacting with other people in real life, and paying a lot of attention to learn how to operate reasonably well in social situations.

	Some people just haven't yet put in the time and effort to learn them yet.

	And it's not really sensible for someone to resent other people for not liking you if you haven't  learn how to interact socially with others.

	For some useful info on social skill development, check out:

	[https://www.cracked.com/blog/15-things-socially-awkward-people-need-to-know/](https://www.cracked.com/blog/15-things-socially-awkward-people-need-to-know/)

	Important to also note here that basic social skills are not the "success code" for dating anyone on earth - rather, they are a key ingredient that is usually necessary (but not sufficient on its own) for being able to function reasonably well in a social situation (friendships, relationships, among coworkers, etc.).

	***They are the floor that more advanced social interactions are built on.***

	It takes time and practice for everyone to learn, and the reason the vast majority of people invest the time and practice into developing their social skills is because it's worth it.

	So, if you don't have a good IRL friend group yet, put even thinking about romantic relationships out of your mind for now. Once you have developed the social skills to make some good friends, you will be *far* less lonely, feel *much* better about yourself, and will have more of the basic skills you need to build in order to have relationships.

	&amp;#x200B;

	4) Going to incel sites for insights about dating is a bit like asking people who are unemployed for advice on how to get a job.

	If you're spending time reading incel subs and chatting with incels, seriously ask yourself if those are the people you want to become. And if not, consider staying as far away from those sites as possible.

	A lot of guys find that their lives get *much* better after getting off such sites.

	Check out:

	[https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelExit/top/?t=all](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelExit/top/?t=all)

	For more positive communities, with more positive and inclusive views of masculinity.

	5) You mention you are in therapy, but it might not be the right kind for depression and loneliness.

	Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a type of therapy that has been shown to have a significant positive impact on people who are lonely, because they often have a counter productive thinking style that gets in the way of their happiness and ability to form relationships. Namely, researchers have found that:

	"programs that focused on maladaptive social cognition through cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) appeared somewhat successful in reducing loneliness ([Young, 1982](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3865701/#R171)). The cornerstone of this intervention was to teach lonely individuals to identify automatic negative thoughts and regard them as hypotheses to be tested rather than facts." \[[source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3865701/)\]

	CBT has been shown to improve people's well being by teaching them to not just accept those automatic, counterproductive thoughts, but to question them.

	And incel type sites are *filled* with those illogical negative thoughts- which is another important reason to keep off those sites.

	So, if you haven't tried CBT with your therapist yet, ask them about it. If they don't do CBT, consider changing therapists. Most universities offer free or low cost CBT therapy.

	6) It's important to remember that dating is really all about how well *you as an individual* fit with *the other person as an individual*.

	You're not trying to date *anyone*. Chasing after *anyone* is exhausting, sets you up for constant disappointment, and is a waste of your time - because not everyone is going to be a match for you.

	And that's what you are looking for - someone who is a good fit *for you*.

	It doesn't matter that other people have found someone who fits with them. Those people are not you. Comparing yourself to other people is just a distraction, and doesn't actually help you feel happier, or figure out who you are actually good match for.

	If you haven't found someone you click with, there is absolutely no shame in that. If you start reaching out to make new friends, that's a great way to learn about what qualities the people who click with you tend to have. And once you know what those qualities are, you can start to have a better idea for who you might be a good match with for a relationship.

	Tl;DR: Resenting "all women" for not dating you is counterproductive, and actually doesn't help improve someone's situation (worse then than, it's a distraction from improving one's situation). There are ways to improve someone's chances of social success - per the links above, it involves learning the social skills to make friends, being the kind of person who creates value for others, understanding how dating works, and learning who you personally are actually a good match with.

	Some things I, a 19 year old girl, noticed about your post that I think you should reflect on:

	1) You don’t care about women, or really see them as people. In your world, women only serve as sex objects and status symbols. You said the reason you hate being a virgin is because you think it makes you seem like a loser/inferior (nothing you said indicated any actual interest in women as people). Personally, I don’t think that way about male virgins, and as a virgin myself, it’s actually something I would prefer in a boyfriend. Yes, some women do look down on male virgins, but in my experience, nowhere near as much as men do. Another thing I’ve noticed men tend to do is project their views of society onto women, eg “I think men with really big muscles look cool, therefore women are most attracted to body builders”. It’s MEN, or society in general, that you’re actually trying to impress, not women. You’ve got the wrong target audience. I, and many other women, are actually put off by promiscuity in men, but a lot of men don’t realise that because they’re so obsessed with what THEY think is impressive (sleeping with lots of girls) rather than what women ACTUALLY want.

	2) You have a ridiculously simplistic view of what women like in men, and it shows how little you think if them as people. You clearly think women only care about looks and wealth/status, and get upset when women don’t behave in the way you believe they should, like you genuinely can’t comprehend that a woman might actually care about a guy’s personality, or actually appreciate a man being respectful towards them, or just not be shallow and not place huge value on a man’s physical appearance. I also thing there’s a lot of projection going on here too. You are impressed by muscles and wealth in men, so you assume that’s what women are sexually attracted to, which often isn’t the case. For example, you say that guy was “scrawny” and therefore ugly. But plenty of women actually prefer skinnier guys. Also, you seem very judgemental (criticising guys for their looks, genitals, status, etc) and I think that’s something that you also project onto others. Personally, I wouldn’t care if my boyfriend had a funny looking dick. I wouldn’t care if he was short, skinny, poor etc. But I wouldn’t date someone as judgemental as you because I have insecurities too, and I would not feel comfortable being vulnerable around you for fear of judgement.

	3) Major victim complex. Life is unfair and full of disappointment, and the world doesn’t revolve around you - but it’s not out to get you either. I think you’d be happier if you accepted that’s just the way it is, instead of blaming women for it. Deep down I think you know it’s not our fault, you’re just looking for something to hate, an outlet for your frustration.

	4) Your life seems to completely revolve around sex. You are obsessed with it to the point where your desperation for sex obscures everything else. That’s just setting you up for disappointment, because you believe your lack of sex is completely ruining your life, and if you do have sex it probably won’t live up to your expectations and you’ll probably just be disappointed. Having sex won’t make you popular, desirable or respected. You just want to believe that because it’s easier than actually putting work into yourself to become those things. Sex is cool and all that, but it ain’t everything.

	5) The reason that I, personally, wouldn’t date/have sex with you is entirely because of your attitude to women, and life in general. You could be the hottest, richest man on the planet and you still wouldn’t be attractive to me until you fix that.

	So my advice to you would be stop obsessing about sex. Find a hobby or a goal that adds purpose/fulfilment to your life and doesn’t have anything to do with sex. Stop blaming things like women and your virginity for your problems, and find the actual cause, and work on that. Be prepared to put in work cos there’s no easy fix. Learn to appreciate women as people in their own right, with their own individual needs and desires and complex personalities, who just happen to be a different gender. Stop caring so much about what society thinks of you, and be much more concerned with what YOU think about you.

	I’m sorry if any if that sounded mean or derogatory - I do really respect the fact that you acknowledge your prejudice and are trying to fix it. 

	I won’t tell you that women are wonderful and how dare you suggest otherwise. Just like men, some women are assholes. Just like men, some women are shallow, judgemental, etc. But that’s not because they’re women, it’s because they’re people and some people just suck. I also don’t blame you for feeling the way you feel - it’s so easy to assume the worst of the opposite gender, and believe they’re not capable of loving you the way you could love them. I know because sometimes I fall victim to feeling that way about men. But I know that in real life, men aren’t all like it seems from what I read on the internet.

	Hey, I just wanted to challenge this:

	>Another thing; another reason why i also wanna sex badly is because i am getting older and sex at a older age isn't as enjoyable compared to doing It in your younger years. Teenagers have raging hormones and are much hornier and lustful than adults. Therefore even if i end up having sex when I'm older, what would be the point if i am not even gonna have the same excitement or fun? I'll be a grown man and i won't have raging hormones anymore and I'll be much more stoic and busy so sex will be worthless at such a age.

	Just to point out, you're only 18. You have many years of horniness ahead of you. Citing a study by Harvard [https://www.health.harvard.ed[u/newsletter](https://www.reddit.com/user/newsletter)\_article/Life\_after\_50\_A\_Harvard\_study\_of\_male\_sexuality](https://www.health.harvard.ed[u/newsletter_article](https://www.reddit.com/user/newsletter_article)/Life_after_50_A_Harvard_study_of_male_sexuality) "testosterone levels peak at about age 17, then remain high for the next few decades...after the age of 40, testosterone levels fall by about 1% a year." At age 18, you have more than another 18 years of life to live before you have to really worry about that.

	I also want to point out anecdotally that the sex I was having at 18 was awful. So much worse than the sex I'm having now at 25. Just like everything else in life, with more experience comes better sex. At 25, I have sex with people who are newish to sex (age 20-24) and people who tend to know what they like/dislike and how to have good sex (age 26-30). Anecdotally I can assure you that it is a world's difference.

	\>“ this fucking whore chose to sleep with him over a "nICe ReSpeCtfUL mEsSaGe"

	Think of it this way: women want to feel good. A nice, respectful man makes a woman feel good. That is why women want to be with nice, respectful men. The solution? Be a nice, respectful man.

	The things that women want are not the same things that men champion as masculine. Trying to be a macho man will not get you women. Nice guys actually often do better – if they *really* are nice guys. Many guys think they’re nice but don’t actually understand a woman’s perspective very well, and in fact don’t come across to women as nice. They don’t do well.

	Another thing: men who are less experienced are more desirable today than they used to be – sometimes they’re more desirable than very experienced men. What really matters is whether you watch porn. If you’re an inexperienced man who doesn’t watch porn, then many women would rather have you than a man who is coming to the table with ideas about what sex is – ideas that run contrary to a woman’s positive experience.

	The solution? Avoid watching porn to avoid developing bad ideas about sex, and make yourself into a nice respectful man. At the same time, work out and work on your style, try to improve your general appearance. And you’ll do much better on the dating market.

	Know this: sex is a very different thing for women and men (I’m a trans man, so I know this). The vaginal canal has very few nerve endings and very little sensation (because it is a birth canal, evolution has guaranteed this, otherwise birth would be excruciatingly painful and women would work harder avoid it). The clitoris has a ton of nerve endings in a very small location, making it extremely sensitive and hard to stimulate in a way that is pleasurable instead of painful or uncomfortable, and it is also tucked away in a location that makes it physically harder to access. To top it off, the clitoris doesn’t naturally maintain erections the way a penis does, which makes maintaining arousal harder for women. Within a single sexual encounter, a woman’s arousal typically increases and decreases multiple times before an orgasm is finally achieved – it takes women a greater amount of focus to maintain arousal; arousal easily disappears (as blood drains out of the clitoris) when, for example, her male partner says or does something that produces any kind of negative emotion – if he seems uncaring, selfish, disrespectful, egotistic, etc. Female orgasms/orgasms on estrogen are also a little different than those of men (as a trans man, I’ve experienced both). It’s commonly said that women’s orgasms are more “whole body” based, but it goes beyond that – women’s orgasms hinge crucially on whole body and emotional feelings of goodness – being comfortable, feeling safe, and often, feeling desired in a loving as well as a sexual way.

	One sad truth of today is that porn is ruining men’s brains. Adaptation and habituation to porn are literally making men unable to orgasm except to very extreme stuff – even cumming on a woman’s face of deepthroating or anal sex are very uncomfortable and unenjoyable for women. (If you doubt me, try sticking a cucumber down your throat and see how far you can get before experiencing the terrible sensation of choking to death; try also putting a cucumber in your butt. It’s terribly painful). This can all work to your advantage. Men who don’t watch porn – men who come to the table with an open mind about what sex can be – are **extremely desirable to women today**. I know this not only because I lived as a woman for 33 years but also because the vast majority of my friends are still women. Women struggle to find men with whom they can enjoy intimacy – because today’s men are ruined by the porn they’re watching (and to a lesser extent, by their prior experiences).

	So **let your virginity be an asset**. Avoid watching porn and be ready to **come to the table with an open mind**. I would even consider advertising on your dating applications that you don’t watch porn and have zero expectations about what sex should be (trust me, that will appeal to women). You don’t have to mention that you’re a virgin. Just say you want to learn what they like and take things slowly. That will explain away your “lack of experience” once you get in the bedroom, and starting from this fresh perspective, you will probably actually outdo the vast majority of men coming to the bedroom with experience today.

	Let me give you an advice from the point of view of a woman. A woman who has met this type of a man and finds it immensely scary. 

	Something that sticks out to me from your post is the overwhelming EMPTINESS on the emotional level. All you talk about is society this, social status that, proving yourself among your fellow men. But my dude, let me tell you, this is not why men and women form relationships and have sex!

	Have you never had a friend? Someone of any gender who you want to spend time with, to have fun activities, to laugh and feel all kinds of emotions? To feel safe with them, to open up with your hopes and fears and enjoy feeling accepted and loved? To share hobbies and views on the world? This is emotional intimacy and it makes up for at least 50% of a romantic relationship, if not more.

	And what you see in the world is couples finding each other approaching it from two opposite sides. One side you understand: a man and a woman look at each other, think "oh wow, that person is hot, I want to have sex with them", then they do, realize they also enjoy each other's company in other ways and they form a long term relationship. 

	The other side is the one you don't get for some reason, and I want you to think about why. It's when a man and a woman meet in a completely non-sexual setting, start talking, opening up to each other, they realize they have a lot in common and only after that they form the sexual part of their relationship. Basically, they become good friends first and romance and sex follows. Oftentimes they don't even find each other hot or attractive at the beginning but the emotional vulnerability and wholesome personal relationship makes the other person that much more attractive. 

	(Of course, there are all kinds of in-between cases. Emotional and sexual developing at the same time, or one side not finding the other attractive at first, only after getting close, while the other side has both sexual and emotional attraction from the get go and so on.)

	So think about it: why don't you see this wholesomeness that comes with relationships? Why do you only see status and society and empty selfishness? Why is it that you think that sex and status among men is the only thing that a woman will bring into your life? Wouldn't you like to share a life with your best friend that is also really hot in your eyes and you have fun and awesome sex together?

	Your anger is completely misplaced. The relationship happiness can only be achieved if you work on yourself to become a well-rounded person that people enjoy talking to. Then you meet people who you share values and hobbies with, there will be a woman there somewhere who will look at you and see an interesting, kind, respectful person who she enjoys spending time with and relationship + sex will follow. You are only 18. If you decide to go to college, that's probably the most social you'll ever be, purely because you'll be forced to spend time in classes and on campus with so many people if your age. If not, there's your future workplace, local communities, hobby clubs and such. And believe me, sex only gets better with age, because you season it with trust and vulnerability and spice it with creativity.

	>Being a virgin, especially a male virgin and an involuntary one at that shows that no one wants to sleep with you and there must be something wrong with you.

	How do you know this is true?  I'm not trying to ask rhetorically, I'm just curious how you came to this conclusion. It may be there's another reason you're a virgin than no one is/would be interested.  For example, I'm very bad at getting hints or recognizing positive body language which set me back quite a few times.

	Hey. First I wanna say I am a woman, idk if you are looking much for advice from that perspective. 

	I wanted to start by saying the whole incel thing fascinates me and makes me both feel very much like almost making a joke of it all but the bigger half of me... And I know this is an unpopular opinion... It makes me sad. Like my heart hurts for all these lonely, self hating people that are so lost and so out of touch and clearly so isolated from meaningful family and friend relationships that they label themselves an incel. I don't think that is funny. It shuts down the follow-the-crowd side of me, the lets-make-fun-of-these-creeps side, because it's not fucking funny. It's really heartbreaking. No one should feel that way. And those feelings don't just happen because someone woke up one day and went, I want to be a hateful lonely miserable person that everyone looks down on and bullies. That isn't to suggest it's not a series of events that almost certainly, at minimum, involved the choices of that person, but I doubt most of us know what kind of life you have to have led to turn to such a mentality. However, like with other things, it doesn't excuse it. Surely a lot of people have been angered by a spouse but only certain psychopaths murder their families or shoot strangers in a crowd. So it does come down to our personal choices, and how we choose to be, what we choose to fight for, and not against. Selfish indulgence or selfless optimistic hope. 

	It sounds like you have been very tempted.to lash out and allow yourself to be weak in the moment (to have your friends hack) to indulge a temporary feeling (anger) brought on by some unimportant strangers, which would be behaving like a child having a tantrum. As well as the trouble you would be in if your friends were caught and throw you under the bus! All that trouble and over what, a temper tantrum for some strangers? However, you yourself realized, oh my god, I sound fucking nuts. This is a bad idea. I am so embarrassed by this behavior. I am going to do something about it. Even if it is posting to reddit for some other opinions. I don't say advice because 1. You are already in therapy and clearly know professional therapy is the advice that counts, not a bunch of no bodies online. But to me that is an even more amazing thing, you just wanted to do SOMETHING to spark a change in you - any change - by LISTENING TO others and even being willing to endure the shitty comments that naturally were going to follow. It's reddit. People sometimes can't help but spew their little pissy comments because they have nothing better to do with their life and instead of saving their time or energy trying to better the world or themselves, they need to complain. They are weak. We all are sometimes. But some people just don't care about being better. Those people are not worth getting into here. 

	You, however, and despite your self admitted illogical anger and despite your life situation that maybe led you to being or feeling the way you feel, are here. Trying. Doing what most 18 year old douche bags aren't. You are manning up. You are choosing to say, all these things I had come to believe and feel and obsess over isn't working for me. It's not making me happy, in fact, it's driving me literally insane. So, even though I don't know what I need to do, I refuse to keep doing nothing or the same old shit. I want to make a change in myself. 

	I find it frankly very attractive. I find it attractive when anyone chooses learning and betterment over habits and pride and refusal to admit wrongs. People who refuse to admit when they are wrong aren't right... They are delusional. They therefore are incapable of ever being right. 

	You have decided, fuck that, I want to be right. For myself. For someone. I want to not be crazy or criminally stupid or weak with a child's temper. I want to grow up and be a man. 

	That's fucking incredible. Sure I could be giving more "reddit-approved" responses here but everyone else seems to have covered most of that. I think you need, and have earned, not only encouragement but for someone to see you, really see you, and tell you that your trying matters. It matters hugely. Because one day you might be able to save someone from going down the road you are trying to get off of. Picture yourself with a woman you love - forget the sex, a sec, I know it's difficult, just assume you'll be having it regularly and she will be loyal and fun and you will genuinely be able to be yourself around her - and picture meeting someone who reminds you of your past you. Wouldn't you want to help him? Could you? I think so, if you keep helping yourself. Just remember that in continuing to seek betterment of your own self and rejecting the toxic incel crap, you aren't just saving your life, you are saving the potential lives of those you can help when you make it through this. And you will. You know how I know you will? Because I can tell you want to. With all your heart. Without hurting anyone. 

	It's okay to forgive yourself. For coming close to doing such shameful, weak, cruel things out of petty childish anger. We all fuck up. You almost did. But you aren't defined by your worst moments. You are defined by however you choose to look at yourself. 

	I think you reaching out like this is beautiful, brave, and I think it's okay to reach out and ask for reassurance when you feel alone. Even here. To strangers. It's human. It's just really , I'm crying. Like currently yeah I have a lot of problems with some of the stuff you said but I also understand like, you just don't know any better yet, but you do know you need to feel like, hope. Like it's possible. And it is. It's not possible just for you to become the kind of guy you envy, but maybe even become the guy others will envy! 

	Now, I have to kinda take a breath and hope you maybe get something out of this next part because it's very important:

	You see these guys getting laid. In your opinion, they aren't as good looking or wealthy or anything. You make an assumption one of the girls chose her partner because of some flirting. You must stop making these assumptions, it's actually very insulting to most women. How do you know he didn't privately message her poetry, or suppose they both were secretly into putting pickles up their butts or something. My point is you do not know every exchange and word between them. Maybe they both had lost their parents at a young age. Maybe they both had been in rehab. My point is, there are things that connect us, from the profound - like two people who both have lost a child, or a limb, or their eyesight, etc - to the silly (people who have specific fetishes, or both are really into some musician like garth brooks, or insane clown posse) , or maybe they just both like gross cheeses or dumb ipa beer or bowling. Or something. You have got to stop assuming you are knowing why a girl chooses who she chooses, or for that matter - and this is the most important thing I think you should take from this - you need to stop like, acting as if any girl will do. If you want just sex, pay for it, and have it that way. But if you want what it seems you are envious.of, you will never find it making girls feel replaceable or generic or whatever. Ask yourself, does the girl I am pursuing make me proud of her? Does she have something that means something to my heart? If she moved away tomorrow, and another girl moved into her place that looked similar, would I care? Because if the answer is no I wouldn't care, you should not be pursuing said girl in the first place. How would you feel if a girl seemed to like you and flirt with you and then met one of your friends and they made a move faster and bam, she was with him instead. Because you didn't matter to her to begin with. She just wanted a boyfriend. Didn't matter if it was you. She just wanted to make her sister jealous or something. Wouldn't that bother you? So don't you think it's unfair and ridiculous to think you should be doing that to girls - girls you hope will let you close enough to be intimate with them! That's messed up. I hope you can see that and get what I am saying. 

	The dude I am currently on/off with, the one I had a child for (I refused plenty of proposals and never wanted kids, ever) he was a virgin and I was his first. He was 29. He is hands down the best sex I have ever had. And truthfully, I was well, not not a slut. Lol. 

	I had cheated on guys in my teens. I never wanted to be married or have kids. I was kind of a fucking total bitch to be honest. I have reasons, etc, but it doesn't change that I was, and I was a pretty awful selfish, broken person. 

	Since I met my virgin I haven't thought about cheating once. I can talk to him about anything. That's my favorite quality, that I can admit anything to him - anything - and he is never repulsed by me or judges me. 

	I used to be one of those girls who was like no, I can't sleep with virgins, they get too clingy. Well. He got clingy. But I am so glad I did. I was missing out. Hugely. 

	It's a Terrible joke especially.on reddit but I like to joke "dang now I see what the whole 40 virgins for muslims thing is about," "no wonder men want their wives on wedding day to be virgins" (bad taste jokes and totally fucked up and nonsense but) holy shit hands down best sex ever. Ever. I'm in my early early 30s now. 

	If you ever want to talk or to just idk, vent, you are welcome.to pm. I believe in taking the time to try to help people, when you can, if you can, over wasting time being a cunt. Being a cunt is easy. Being vulnerable and reaching out when everyone else walks by can make a difference. Mostly it doesn't. But I have to believe that for the times it does, it's worth it. 

	To me at least.

	I went through your comment history a little bit to try and get a better sense of who you are, and dude. Jesus Christ. The one that sticks out to me the most is the comment under the video of the couple making out, where you very clearly creep the woman in the video out by asking if that's her husband and then rambling across two separate comments about how you want his Insta and you messaged asking for advice on how to get women. Stop that now. This is your problem. You've tied your whole identity and intrinsic value to sex and your anxiety is leading you to be pushy about it to absolute strangers on the internet. All that does is make NO ONE want to fuck you. 

	I don't say this to be rude or abrasive, the very act of making this post is mature and demonstrates a willingness to change, which is the most important step. Therapy is also a massive help and I'm proud of you for taking these steps to help yourself. I mean it, I'm proud of you. 

	Another thing I gotta bring up though is you referring to the OnlyFans girl as "a fucking whore." Did you think of her as a whore while you were masturbating to her sex content? Or did you only start thinking of her as a whore after she fucked someone else? Either way it's a problem. Women are not whores for having multiple partners, women are not whores for doing sex work, *women are not whores when they fuck someone that isn't you.* It doesn't matter how nice you are, or how much time you think you've put in or whatever, if a woman doesn't want to have sex with you, she doesn't wanna have sex with you, point blank. If you still hold those beliefs about "fucking whores" or whatever you still have a loooot of therapy to do. 

	Remember that this is a process. It will not happen overnight, but sooner rather than later you will come to a place where your social skills will develop much further. Keep in mind that you're in high school (I think that was implied), and even if you're not, your life just started. Don't decide it's hopeless based off the first quarter.

	Edit: regarding your edit, that is rape if the boys were underage, and even if they were 18 there's still a very gross power dynamic there. I would maybe recommend not watching porn for a while. It seems to be tainting your views on what sex is actually like and how people get it. You mention wanting to have a threesome with two adult women where you last for nine hours, and, hate to break it to you, nine hours of sex would be fucking miserable. The chafing alone would leave me in a coma. Porn really seems to be dictating how you view sex and that's a wildly unhealthy way to view it, since porn is almost never like real sex.

	The more angry and bitter you become the less attractive you will be to others. No one will want to date or have a sexual relationship if you're super jealous. Would you want to date an angry, bitter, jealous person? The solution is to develop as an individual, focus on things that you are in control of, and to seek help if you think you need it. These steps will help you to develop confidence and self sufficiency, which lots of people find to be attractive traits. Good luck!

	Women don’t want to sleep with boys that think they’re whores if they’ve had sex with other men. Women don’t want to sleep with boys that judge their decisions and wish or try to enact harm upon them. Women want to sleep with men that respect them and view them as equals and sexual partners. 

	You’re making sex a much bigger deal than it is. 

	Honestly sex in your twenties is better than in your teens anyway. Coincidentally the men I know who’s first times were 18 or older are generally more successful and well rounded humans than ones that were younger.

	I have a lot of pretty girl friends who, as you say, are dating men who aren't attractive and rich. Dude, you probably already know this but the most desirable factor to women is the personality. If a man is respectful of both himself and of women, women will consider him dateworthy.

	Now I'm very close with my girl friends so Imma give you some perspective in their heads. I noticed they sort of have a sixth sense when it comes to men's intentions. They have red flags exhibited by men memorized by heart. Women are likely turned off by you because they can sense your desperation to get laid from a mile away. You can be rich and attractive, but if you put off danger vibes, they won't want you. If sex is the man's priority but theirs is a relationship, then they'll think that they're only going to get used if they give you a chance. 

	You gotta stop basing your self-respect on women's perception of you. They're not going to be attracted to you unless you respect yourself, so it's a dead end. You talk about relationships with women like its a means to elevate your social status and not something that needs to be treasured. Trust me when i say they *can* sense all that shit. I swear to god they're like spiderman. And if they mark a dude down as dangerous, they let all their girl friends know which narrows down your dating pool by a lot. 

	"these boys having sex with girls it shows that they're attractive, they're interesting, and have qualities that draws girls to them." Not always. Most of the time it means those girls feel safe and treasured by those boys. Keep going to therapy, and when you start respecting yourself and others, women will notice that and you'll get opportunities to meet nice girls.

		this!!!! sir, you put this into words perfectly. (and yes we are spider-man)
		
		coming from a woman, I can almost always tell a man’s intention. I’ve had guys trying to sleep with me since I was 12 years old (yuck) so we become really fucking good at telling who has genuine intentions and who is only in it to get laid. and this isn’t just me, this is every woman. 
		
		as men are raised in a society that associates sex with manliness, women are raised in a society where we are constantly looking out for our safety. if I don’t sense any self respect *and* respect for women, I will absolutely not even talk to them - for my safety. 
		
		it’s extremely easy to sense if someone respects women in conversations. I’ve been with a virgin who had loads of respect (and had an amazing relationship) and have walked out of a date with a wealthy doctor for his lack of respect.

	* 🟨 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 6 _(2021-04-13 13:14:10)_

		Just want to add, that “sixth sense” about red flags is usually due to countless interactions with men that end up with shitty-to-fatal consequences. 
		
		Some of OP’s feelings expressed here are not just unattractive, they’re feelings they have in common with men who attack women. It’s absolutely reasonable for women to avoid people who vibe like this.

	So you are young and mistaken about many things:

	1) Sex is better when you're a teenager because you're hornier. I am in my forties, I am less horny than my teenage self that is true. But the sex is, however, MUCH better now, not even close. I know what I am doing, sex isn't rocket science but there is more nuance to it than you might think.

	2) Teenage boys are very concerned with virginity. That is true. Actual grown men, not so much. Teenagers in general are actually a lot shittier to each other than adults are. When I was in high school I was constantly on guard; as an adult, unless it is a bad part of town at night, I have no concerns that my colleagues will be shit or abusive towards me as teenagers might be.

	3) Teenage girls are not an indicator as to what women want. Teenage girls are teenagers and therefore shittier generally speaking than most adults; like teenage boys. So again the choices a teenage girl makes are not an  indication of how they will choose as adults.

	As a teenager I like you had no luck with girls. Subsequently I am married and happily so. High School and university were very different experiences for me. Night and day different. What matters at high school is far less important well anywhere else.

	Things to do: 

	1) push ups and walking/hiking; 2) read books (a mix of fiction and non fiction); 3) keep clean; 4) dress neatly; 5) make friends with women (not to sleep with your friends (that is creepy, don't be creepy), but having a woman vouch for you when they all talk together is a great in). I met my SO through female friends. 

	Basically look like you are going to make something of your life. Also actually try make something of your life.

	Finally there is nothing sadder than a man whose peak was in high school. Because frankly that isn't the measure of true success, and as an adult we pity such men. So become the man who gets to pity those fools who peaked before the race even began.

	There's a lot I'd say that everyone else has but there's one piece of advice I haven't seen yet, although I haven't read the whole thread:

	If you're a part of any incel communities, stop. Get away from them and never go back.

	You've already taken the hardest step in relizing and admitting that you have a problem. The second hardest step will be getting out of the toxic communities that re-enforce toxic attitudes because - and make no mistake about this - they don't want you to stop being an incel. That feeling of envy and rage you get when you see men with women? They feel the same way when an incel breaks the cycle and succeeds with a woman. They claim to be there for support. They aren't. They're quicksand.

	If you can get out of the incel community and stay away from it, you have a vastly better chance of getting better and re-aligning your attitudes and changing you life. Even if you take none of the other advice here, just getting out of the incel community will improve your life over time on its own because the negative attitudes you have won't be .

		100% this. Surrounding yourself (even digitally) with a group of bitter, negative, toxic people will, in turn, make you more bitter, negative, and toxic as well.
		
		You are introspective enough to see that these toxic thinking patterns can be downright dangerous, so the absolute best thing you can do is to stop spending time with the people who reinforce them. 
		
		The longer you interact with them, the worse your situation is going to get. Hands down. Remove yourself from their toxicity, and remove the word incel from your vocabulary. You ARE a man, and it sounds like you've got a pretty good head on your shoulders. 
		
		Once you're out, then you can start working on the other things suggested throughout this thread, which seems to be filled with encouragement and positivity. You got this.

* 🟩 **[headless_boi](https://www.reddit.com/user/headless_boi)** ⬆️ 7 _(2021-04-13 04:01:53)_

	I see that you already got many replies, but I want to give you one more, because I think it's good that you're aware of your views being toxic and that you want to change.

	First of all the sex thing: I feel like the whole "having sex early makes you cool and being a virgin makes you a loser" thing was made into a thing by edgy teens who thought that's just how things are. Those are the same kind of teens who bully their peers because they like reading books or they have a niche interest or something, meaning there isn't much actual logic behind their idea of what makes you a "winner" or a "loser", and often also the same teens who think that they all absolutely need to do the same things, say the same things and a hundred percent fit in with their peers and be "normal". The thing is, though, everyone is different, and there's way more to people than just whether they get a girl or not. 

	When looking for a boyfriend or a girlfriend, most relatively mature people would look for a person who they find interesting, funny, who they have some common interests with and who they're physically attracted to. Most people will literally not care at all whether you're a virgin or not. I mean, not like it really matters. When you think about it, it isn't actually a big deal to anyone except the high school kids who think it makes them cool. 

	Now a good thing about all the things I said in the previous paragraph is this: no matter what kind of stuff you like, what you look like, how you like to dress etc., sure, there are always going to be people who might find you to not be their type, but there will always also be people who actually would find you exactly their type. 

	So I would say rather than feeling envious of people you think are not very specially who get girls and dismissing yourself automatically, see them as literal proof of the things I just said. These kinds of things are subjective and a person who you don't find special in any way might seem very special for some reasons you can't see to someone else. Same goes for you. Someone could even be into you because of something you're not even aware of about yourself. 

	But in order to give yourself a chance, you need to leave any hatred and envy behind. Rather than focusing on others and thinking "look, that guy has this and this and I don't" or "that guy is worse than me and still has a better life" or something, try to think "what are the things I have that make me fun and unique?" or "what are the things about me that I could work on and improve, so that I can be the best person I can be?"

	With working and improving yourself and maturing as a person, you will have more things that might make you a fun and desirable person, so you would both be becoming a better person and increasing your chances at getting a girl at the same time, to put it simply. So it's a win-win situation for you. 

	Now, another thing is that it's hard to generalize and to say all men are like this or all women are like this, of course. What I've been talking about so far are mostly fairly general directions that I can give from my own experience and a lot of if it based on my own values and opinions and stuff. The thing is, the kind of guys that are attractive to one girl might not be attractive to many other girls, and also the kind of girls one guy is attracted to won't be the same kind of girls many others will be attracted to. So that puts us back to the "forget others and focus on yourself" bit. 

	Don't try to compare yourself to others, don't try to get girls easily off a nsfw account. Explore yourself as a person and use what you have, your personality, intellect, wit, whatever to your advantage. Be a good person. And then, on the other side, think about what kind of a girl would you be the most attracted to. What would she look like, what kind of personality would she have, what kind of stuff would she be interested in and what kind of hobbies would she have. Consider all these things rather than just focusing on sex. There's a whole lot more to life and to relationships than that, and you seem to have a bit of tunnel vision going on. So just take in the bigger picture, and open your mind as well. Be aware that each individual is different, has different values, ideas, beliefs and wishes, and you might not understand everyone or relate to everyone, but that doesn't make them inferior or superior to you. It just makes them a bit different than you, which is perfectly fine, as everyone is a bit different in one way or another.

	And lastly, for the misogyny part: I am a woman, and I know many other women, and I have never met a woman in my life who gave a shit about whether a guy is a virgin or not. The things I personally care about, and have seen other women care about as well are: the feeling of connection you get when talking to a person, their wit and personality, them being fun and easy going, down to earth, having something in common that gives you a reason and a chance to try talking to them more and being closer to them. And sure, being "good looking" is a factor too, but like I said, that's very subjective. If you take two random people and show them a picture of some random other person, one of those people might think that that's the prettiest person ever and the other could think that it's the ugliest person ever. And it's not a matter of being right or wrong, it's a matter of the whole issue being subjective, which means that you actually don't have anything that qualifies or disqualifies you based on your looks, generally speaking. It will depend on each individual person you interact with, their personal taste and all that. So, that means that the things you based your hate of an entire gender are pretty false, full of assumptions and overly generalized. 

	Are there girls who are a lot like what you described there? Yes, most probably there are. But realistically speaking, they're most probably a smaller but more visible and noticeable minority, rather than just all or most girls out there. If you feel this kind of hate, try to direct it towards certain ideals that these people might hold and try to follow, rather than hating their entire gender or them as a person. This would make way more sense, and it would actually be understandable. There are "types of guys" and "types of girls" that I dislike, but rather than hating all guys or all girls, and rather than hating random people, especially people I've never met, I chose to direct that hate towards their ideas rather than towards the people themselves. This way, this hate is way less dangerous and harmful, and there's way less of it too, because then you don't have enough hate for an entire gender, you just hate some ideals that a few people might have. 

	So that's pretty much my point of view. And maybe just seeing different points of views on here helps too, as you might find things in many of these comments that you can understand, agree with or even relate to, and when you put all those bits and pieces together, you'll end up with some solid arguments and perspectives that might help change your mind.

* 🟩 **[Tummers09](https://www.reddit.com/user/Tummers09)** ⬆️ 7 _(2021-04-13 08:25:18)_

	Hi! There's a lot going on here and a lot of comments so I'll keep it brief. Super props on recognizing your feelings being toxic and being self-aware enough to challenge that. I feel this is your first step toward not being a misogynist. Congrats! 

	TLDR: Here is HOW you can get less bitter and angry. You're not as angry as you are afraid.

	Everyone's saying "you need to not be toxic," and, "just stop making everything about sex," etc. Well here is HOW you can do that.

	*Prerequisites:*

	**The first thing** you need to be aware of is negative and positive spirals. All your negative feelings beget negative results, makes people uncomfortable, which causes more negative feelings, more results, etc. The same is also true for positive. If you can slow this negativity you'll begin to focus on positive, which people will notice, get more comfortable, you'll get more secure, more results, etc.

	**The second thing** you need to be aware of is that this battle isn't against other men or women. This is a battle against yourself (see the first thing). You get yourself in order and the rest will follow. Ironically, probably when you're not thinking about it. So, truly change your focus from others to yourself.

	**The third thing** is that *you can do this*! And it will be a lot of work. Don't lose hope! Keep yourself focusing on positive and *only do healthy things*. Care for others, accept others because you're focusing on yourself (see the first thing). 

	**The fourth thing** fantasy is a fantasy. Don't get lofty thinking that one day you're gonna hook up with this cam girl. Live your damn life and let your fantasy go for a minute.

	*Change your view:*

	I think the first thing I want to challenge is bitter and angry. I've heard "anger is a secondary emotion" and I believe that. Anger is usually reactionary to fear or insecurity, and I sense a lot of that here. You might be angry, but it is a reaction. You're not so much angry as really afraid. Afraid of being outperformed, afraid of your social standing not matching your effort and commitment? Probably also lots of other things. And that fear is *in your way* of focusing on other, more healthy things, which is your first step to being happier.

	This is your wakeup call. If you don't want to feel angry, you need to *challenge* that fear and insecurity. Don't just admit it. Challenge it *in yourself*. And let me prepare you in advance, this will be one of the greatest challenges you'll face. This will be **hard** to admit. in fact, admitting this will be *terrifying* because you're already afraid.

	This will be in 2 main steps which you'll work on back and forth, and both will take time (possibly years even). So *be patient with yourself* and allow yourself to come to grips with it. The sooner you can let it go, the sooner you can get into/past step 2.

	1. Admit it, recognize it, come to terms with it, get comfortable with it, accept it. Truly admit it. Truly recognize it. Truly come to terms with it. Notice it when it's happening, find out how to manage it, how to halt it, how to shift focus. Truly get comfortable with it. And *truly* accept it. *It's okay*. Allow yourself to be human. It's okay to feel insecure. It will never go away and everyone feels it too. You'll know you're past this step when you truly feel free and you truly aren't bothered by it any more. You'll know you accept yourself when you can truly accept others.

	2. Challenge it. No animosity. When you feel animosity, don't express it--but ask yourself why you feel it. Why are you afraid? Challenge it. Step outside of your comfort zone so you can start getting comfortable with it. It won't ever really go away, but eventually you won't notice it. You might even like it. Do healthy things that you wouldn't normally do. Do things that make you feel uncomfortable. Talk to women in person knowing in advance that this won't lead to sex. Treat them nicely. Talk to fuckbois as if they're a person. Talk about their passions, their dreams, their focus. Challenge your negative viewpoints and focus on the positive. Express your vulnerabilities in a healthy way. Make some friends in the meantime.

	So take a moment and really look into yourself. Are you angry? Maybe. But aren't you afraid? It's okay, you don't need to admit it to me or to anyone. You're safe. Just admit it to yourself.

	What are you afraid of? You're not afraid of women or men, and you're desperate to prove that. Most likely you're afraid of yourself and/or your own limitations and/or that some things are out of your control, and you're lashing out at others to try and disprove that. 

	You might be afraid of inadequacy and aging and the passing of time. And yourself truly. Why? Why are you afraid? Are you afraid society is moving on without you? Are you also afraid that time is limited?

	How do you challenge yourself with this? Reach out to your crush's crush and talk about the weather? 

	And as a bonus, this will build your confidence. You'll become more confident with yourself and you conquer this fear. This produces 2 main results and the more you think about them, both of those results feed off each other for additional growth: 

	1. Your focus will stop being about this race to have sex all the time. 

	2. And as a result, people will sense that in you, and they'll feel more comfortable around you.

	What I don't understand is why hate women for making fun of male virgins when it's mainly men who do that? 

	I loved to have sex with my virgin boyfriend for the first time. It felt amazing knowing I was the first he's ever had. Many women don't give a shit if the guy is a virgin, from what I've seen and the people I've interacted with irl, it's just a TV/movie trope. Either that or the people you come into contact with happen to all be insanely shallow and trashy. 

	You sound like you hate the world, not just women. This is pretty common for teenagers, but yours sounds pretty bad. 

	I wanna tell you: it sounds like you're being influenced heavily by tropes, not reality. Most people won't put you down for being a virgin at 18 (that's not even old dude...), and like I said, women won't look down on you unless they're assholes. you don't want an asshole girlfriend anyways. 

	There will always be people out there who are haters and will believe very very stupid shit that the media feeds them. they're sheep. don't be a sheep. don't be like the assholes. think for yourself and realize your WORTH is not in how many women you've fucked. you're WORTH so much more than that all on your own. 

	Stop listening to the trope that "men are more powerful/desirable if they're fuckboys". you're better than that.

	Your judgement is definitely cloudy.

	> In the comments it turned out that he was one of her onlyfans followers and he met up with him for sex. She replied to a comment that said he paid her that he didn't pay her anything and she had sex with him because she was looking for a new sex partner and he sent her a nice respectful message and had a nice chat. 

	She is almost certainly lying.

	Think about what she wants out of her OF channel.  She wants paid subscribers and people to not be rude to her.

	So which of these two stories would help accomplish those goals:

	"This is my ex, we decided to start having sex again."

	Or.

	"I met this guy on the site, and he was nice.  If you keep subscribing and treating me nicely, you might be my next flavour of the month."

	>Another thing; another reason why i also wanna sex badly is because i am getting older and sex at a older age isn't as enjoyable compared to doing It in your younger years.

	Teenage sex usually sucks, compared to once you are an adult.  It's awkward, neither party has much of a clue what they are doing, both parties are nervous and self-conscious as hell, and it doesn't last very long.

	That big influx of hormones works against you, not for you.

	Sex is better when you get older and can understand and control your body better, be more relaxed, and have the maturity to not just share physical intimacy, but also emotional intimacy.

	How are your social skills?

	I know this is kind of a meme to suggest people who are struggling with dating. But the reason is that it’s true. Being able to be fun to be around, at least to one specific person, is probably what gets most average people laid. People don’t want to deal with others who aren’t good at interacting with them. They have other things to do, and when others don’t know the codes for socializing, it makes *them* uncomfortable too. It may seem harsh but it’s true for everyone. 

	The second is to be social and have an active social circle. If you have a friend group, go to parties etc. you have a chance to show off your personality and actually meet potential suitors. 

	Second, women find different things attractive. You may not see what they see in the “ugly” men. I know plenty of my female friends have tastes in men where I’m like, “really? Why?”

	Third, about 14% of men and 12% of women are virgins at age 20 to 24. It’s really not that uncommon.

	People tend to date others who are similar to themselves. Across 4 countries there was a study in, this was true. This is actually the strongest prediction for who people will end up dating. Similar in income, personality, hobbies, careers etc. Are you going after women who are similar to yourself? Do you *want* women who are similar to yourself?

	**I think one of the reasons why this particular situation angered you so much is that you're starting to realize that the other incels lied to you.** 

	They told you that only 'chads' have sex and that you have to be handsome, rich, over 6ft tall, etc. to get laid when it's not true. You believed them because you wanted to think these were the reasons you're not getting laid. 

	Suddenly you see this guy who's kinda average and not rich having sex with a beautiful woman just because he was nice to her and treated her like an actual person!? Surely this is wrong... Your worldview is being challenged and it's making you angry. 

	It's easy to accept that what's holding you back is your looks, your wealth, and other concrete things. It's harder to accept that it's actually your personality. 

	I think the healthiest thing for you to do is to do a complete internet detox. Stop going to incel forums and talking to incels - it's poisoning your mind. Find healthier hobbies that you enjoy. Maybe pick up DND and make some irl friends. The fact that you're making this post means that you know there's a problem. Good luck.

	About the guy the onlyfans person slept with. I think you might be overlooking the...ahem....marketing aspect of her sleeping with him. She does that with one dude and posts it and now shes reinforced the fantasies of every guy who follows her. He won the lotto, *it could happen to you as well if you catch my eye*. But in reality she just had to pick her favorite of the probably dozens of similar messages shes gotten. Its a smart move for a sex worker and she had every right to do it, but it does highlight a complication of the issue I think you're overlooking. That woman is not functioning as a *person* for you, shes an entertainer. Shes not going to make choices or have behaviors that are necessary applicable to the women actively in your life.

	As a teenage girl myself, let me tell you that teenage girls don’t have some elaborate judging mechanism for relationships. Most of the time, it’s just down to chance or hormones. (Source: my first kiss was a disaster.) Please *don’t* determine your self worth by our pretty unwise decisions.

		I was going to say that as a teenage girl I did not care at ALL about finding a “successful man”. My boyfriend in high school was a funny theater nerd who I had a great time with (we were friends for a while first). In terms of social high school success though, I’d say he was lower on that scale. Didn’t matter to me.

		Teenagers as a whole don’t fully assess situations, and are very impulsive. I gave myself so much shit for not advancing on a girl that I knew liked me back, until I came to this conclusion. I don’t really think that’s the main issue with OP though. Teens suck at judging situations, but even so I think it’d be a turn off for just about any girl when somebody wants to do you for a status

	Hey, I'm a woman who didn't lose her virginity until 19 to a guy who was also a virgin at 20. It's not the same for men and women, but I was also ignored during my teens and felt unworthy because I wasn't getting the same attention that other girls were getting. I felt spiteful and angry and just toxic hate towards them. It turns out, that sort of thinking is what was holding me back.

	I was expecting my life to follow the timeline of my peers. I didn't come into my own or become socially successful until I stopped doing that. It stopped being a competition, or about wtf does she have that I don't??? I'm better than her why am I not getting the same attention...etc. 

	Breaking out of that way of thinking was life changing. No exaggeration. Removing my own expectations actually made them come true. You're already on the right path since you acknowledge the issue and made this post.

	And it's about finding the right person. Surround yourself with the right people and connect with them without expectations of anything more than that connection. Let go a little and you'll find you have a lot more control over yourself and your life.

	I also recommend looking into stoicism and mindfulness techniques to help break this way of thinking. They can really change the way you see yourself and the way you interact with the world around you.

	Finally, it might not be easy to accept right now, but you are not less worthy or important because of your virginity. Your worth is determined by much more than just that. By pinning your self-worth to sex, you'll start to form really unhealthy habits even after you're sexually active. You'll keep needing sex just to validate yourself. I've been down that road, it is empty and sad. I hope any of this helps.

	Cool that you see a problem and want to do something about it! That is the first and biggest step. My advice is to make a plan for your life that does not revolve around sex. You are young and have lots of time to turn yourself into the man you want to be. But who is that guy? When you're thirty, what would you like to have accomplished? What would you like to know, where do you want to live, what do you want to be good at? 

	If you play the long game, have a goal and a clear sense of self, and organize your life to get there, _it will make you attractive_ to other people. Confidence and drive are sexy and will draw people to you. To be honest I had way better sex and was much happier overall in my 30s than in my 20s or teens, and it's because I finally (with many stumbles on the way) got enough practice at being a (hu)man that my insecurities started to fade.

	* I didn't have sex until I was like 22, it 

	 doesn't tie in to my worth 

	* When I did, it was kinda meh. As I've aged, I've only had better sex. That's because I've utilised communication, love, respect, and just generally treating my lady like a human being, as powerful tools in having the best sex ever. The best sex you will ever have in the future, is in a relationship that you have worked on, one in which your lady wants you, very much. You don't make for the best sex, your partner does, in their enthusiasm. 

	* I have literally never discussed the amazing sex with my partner, with any of my friends. I don't feel the need to. It doesn't affect your "social worth" at all. The only people concerned with that, are other incels, or other severely mysoginistic and wrong people, do you really want their respect? Sure as fuck don't,and that's why I don't brag,even when I've just had great sex.

	* For whatever reason, people consider me "attractive". Yet I have not been very "successful" with women. I've always asked them out, they have never asked me out. Maybe that's a product of gender norms that will change soon, but in that regard, being able to date a woman is far more tied in to whether you ask, than your personal attractiveness or personality. Oh and get to know them. Not as potential dating partners, but as friends, as human beings, then, you actually find out what they like and what they don't like, and you can decide whether that would work well in a partner with you

	* Don't live your live at the behest of someone else. You should go to the gym, or study hard, or work hard in hopes some woman will come up to you and say "hey, I like ur big muscles, wanna date", for several reasons:

	1 That will literally never happen, that's just, not what people do

	2 You will never be happy. Other people are volatile,if your happiness depends entirely upon them, it won't last, it will disappear quickly. Become a better person for you, not for hopes of a reward

	 I just want you to know, I wouldn't consider myself at all successful with women, and yet, I am with the best lady I've ever met, and I only wish to be successful with her, in making her feel happy, loved, and satisfied. The amazing sex stems from that, it doesn't come first. 

	I generally dislike bragging, but I feel it might help here. I'm apparently considered attractive, I'd like to think I'm rather generous and kind in my actions, at least when I can anyway, and I'm pretty in shape, have a decent job,etc. And yet, no woman has ever asked me out, and I am not "successful" with women (other than my woman, who is the best woman), nor have I really been in the past. 

	And that's fine! Who cares! My self worth is not tied to other people, I am confident regardless. I do what makes me happy for me, not for attention. In my experience, the people who "get the most women" are usually just the ones you find in pubs and bars chatting up and asking out every single woman, mostly for one night stands. I don't want that, I want my personal relationship with respect, communication, and deep love, and I wanna fuel that as much as I can. I hope some of this can help you, and let me know how it all goes.

	I think you’re taking sex too seriously. Being a virgin at 18 is a lot more common than you think. It’s only a big deal if you make it a big deal. You’re really insecure about this but you don’t have to be. At 18 I honestly wouldn’t even consider you an incel. 

	And as for the whole “I’m getting older” thing, it’s just not true. That’s not something that happens until you’re 40 or 50. 

	Your going to have to get past your insecurity. If the people around you make that big of a deal about sex they’re delusional. It’ll happen, but if you let your insecurities take over then people will sense that energy and focus on it. And frankly it will keep turning you into a more and more bitter person and bitter people are no fun to be around for anybody, male or female.

	Think about being a better person in general. Take an interest in people, be a good friend. That’s a much better energy to put out. You don’t have to be the stereotypical “nice guy”. Just be good to people in little ways. And meet more people too. Sometimes the reason you don’t click with a girl is because you don’t have any common interests. But when you do meet a girl you’re compatible with you will click right away. Meeting more people means more options for you. I can honestly tell you that hooking up with somebody you’re not compatible with is just awkward and not a good time.

	On a personal note, once I stopped obsessing over getting sex as quick as possible on tinder is when I met my current girlfriend. I wasted a lot of time and money on girls I wasn’t into that much because I was just trying to get laid. I got tired of wasting time so I started saying stupid stuff on purpose for a laugh and one of the girls thought I was hilarious and now we’ve been together for 2 years. 

	So don’t take it too seriously. Forget about rushing to the finish line and enjoy the ride

	As an over-30 male virgin, I would highly recommend you get over yourself. And I mean that in the kindest way possible. 

	You're receiving a lot of very good advice here on how to better approach a relationship. I would recommend ignoring all of it and simply giving up, for the time being, on trying to enter a relationship. Your biggest obstacle to being happy right now is your obsession with this, and the best thing for you to do is to learn to let go of that obsession. This isn't the kind of problem you can force your way through.

	That doesn't mean that you are doomed to be alone forever or anything. By all means come back and visit this thread a few years from now. Or think about the stuff you're reading here and how you've been acting from time to time as you take a shower or whatever. As long as it's all theoretical thinking about what you could do in the future, or how you could have acted better in the past. And really, try not to think about it that often, because again, the problem is your obsession.

	Instead, try to figure out what else in your life makes you happy, and focus on that. Not to replace the happiness you wanted to get from a woman (happiness doesn't work that way), but to tend to things that you've almost certainly been neglecting about yourself. Get a job, get a hobby, get some friends (who don't make fun of you for being a virgin, seriously wtf), take a trip, whatever.

	And again, don't do this as a means to becoming a better person so you can be with a woman. Do it for yourself to become a better person for yourself. And then once you're a full person on your own, then you'll have something to bring to a relationship. And you can find someone else who also has something to bring, and then you can have that mutual transaction of improving each others lives that will actually make both of you happy.

	I’m 42 but I remember being young and I was more likely to go for guys who were fun to be around and were charming and respectful. Flirty but not too full on. Personal hygiene is more important than looks. You can laugh a girl into bed if you’re funny. Don’t let your eyes slip below the neck line. Smile. If you get turned down say ok and wish her good luck and move on. Don’t push for reasons or insult them when they say no. Treat women like humans and talk to them like your guy friends but less gross. Don’t put pressure on yourself to lose your virginity at all costs. Women are humans too.

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 3 _(2021-04-13 06:24:39)_

	> men who are virgins with no experience with women are losers and considered to be less worthy of respect

	I'll focus on this point in particular because it's one I can address. Let me start off by saying that I know it's really hard to believe what I'm about to say, but in the real world, most people **do not care** about the state of your virginity.

	I need you to know: you're fresh out of high school, and high school is *garbage*. It's a hormonal miasma of people treating sex like *the* ultimate milestone. But in real life, people just do not think like that. The average person not only won't care about your lack of a sexual history, they won't want even want to *know* about it. Among healthy, well-adjusted people, asking someone if they're a virgin is generally seen as an invasion of privacy, sexual harassment, and *really fuckin' weird*.

	> In the comments it turned out that he was one of her onlyfans followers and he met up with him for sex

	This is another thing that I know is gonna be hard to believe, just because of where you are mentally right now, but this **did not happen**. She's a sex worker. That is her average-looking bf who she's kept as a secret. She runs a business, and part of that involves selling a fantasy. Now, let me be clear here: what she did wasn't wrong. The last thing I want is for this to make your general negative attitude crystallize into just outright resentment over her "lying". It wasn't a lie, it was an act. Sex workers are performers, what they do is fiction. I'm going to go out on a limb and assume (correct me if I'm wrong) that you likely have been watching porn for 4 or 5 years by now? 

	I want you to imagine something real quick. Imagine that there's someone who lives on a remote island in the pacific with no internet, and one of the only connections to the outside world he has is a TV channel that broadcasts professional wrestling. He starts to imagine that, somewhere outside of his little sphere, there are these absolutely insane wrestling shows taking place, filled with incredible violence, stunts, rivalries, magic, hypnosis, etc. And because he has no frame of reference for how to interpret this, he believes it's all real. 100% of it. And why wouldn't he? It never has a disclaimer, everyone involved acts like it's real, it's even seen as a harsh taboo to break kayfabe.

	That's you with sex and porn. I know I'm making assumptions, so again, correct me if I'm wrong. But I think you were likely introduced to porn and sex as a concept at an age where you didn't have the wherewithal to realize that these things, which were presented to you as reality, were actually just a performance. And man, that *sucks*. That is a terrible place to be. You're literally comparing your reality to an impossible fantasy. 

	First and foremost, my advice to you is to get sex off your mind. It's not high school, the world doesn't revolve around it anymore, and the people who act like it does tend to make others really uncomfortable. As for how to do that, I don't know. Start by coming to your therapist with that as a clear goal. "I want to stop obsessing over sex" or "I want a healthier relationship with my sexual fantasies" is something really concrete, and (in my experience) therapists help best when you come to them with concrete requests like that. Hell, maybe you can look into hiring an escort. You don't want to accidentally develop an expensive sex addiction, of course, so talk it over with your shrink first. But that might be a good way to get over that first hurdle and get you to realize that sex isn't some magic golden token, it's just an activity. From what I hear, escorts are used to dealing with clients who have really complicated relationships with sex.

	That's the best advice I have to give. I know it's long and you have a lot of other comments to read, but I hope at least something I've said resonates. I'll cap this off by begging you to not swing the pendulum into the other direction and hop into NoFap or Semen Retention or any of those other pseudoscientific, borderline culty circles.

* 🟩 **[hcpenner](https://www.reddit.com/user/hcpenner)** ⬆️ 3 _(2021-04-13 19:32:08)_

	I agree with a lot of the top comments on this post. I just want to add that, as an intersectional feminist, this was both horrifying and insightful to read. For me, this really just confirms the fact that western society (I’m assuming you live in North America, a European country, or Australia/NZ) has completely warped what masculinity and sex mean, as well as how those two are intertwined. Because, without culture coming into things, masculinity has absolutely nothing to do with sex. The idea that you’re not “worthy” as a man until you’ve had sex (specifically with a woman who is attracted to you) is based in some serious sexism and in the idea that women are objects to be conquered/collected/used. It seems you are beginning to understand this, and I’m really happy that you are wanting to change your deeply misogynistic views. 

	I also hope you recognize that these ideas you speak of are also quite harmful to you—they basically just encourage self-hatred on the basis of not being “masculine” or “worthy” enough. And while there is a cultural reason you feel this way, you ultimately do have the power to unlearn this ideas about women, masculinity, and sex. You’ll have a much easier time finding enthusiastic sexual and/or romantic partners when you stop hating yourself so much and comparing yourself to others.

	And on the note of being a virgin at 18: It’s not nearly as much of a big deal as you think it is. A lot of people don’t have their first sexual experience as a teenager, or if they do, it doesn’t mean that they’re having lots of sex and/or good sex. People who think they’re better than others for being sexually active are really annoying. If you’re confident in yourself and you have a good sex life, you’re probably not going to be bragging about it or putting others down for being virgins. So keep in mind that the people who do that are also deeply insecure and probably unsatisfied with the sex they may be having.

	My partner and I both had our first full sexual experience with each other at 18. I didn’t see him as less worthy because he hadn’t had sex before. It was honestly nice to not have to worry so much about him having an STI, haha. We got to explore sex together in a very trusting and loving environment. I have absolutely no regrets about not having sex in high school, and neither does my partner.

	You will have sex eventually. And you’re far more likely to have good, satisfying sex sooner rather than later if you do work through these harmful ideas you have that are based in misogyny and toxic masculinity. 

	The patriarchy hurts men too. Just because you’re a man doesn’t mean that sexism and our culture’s warped understanding of gender (including masculinity) benefits you. It’s harmful to everyone, and your situation is a prime example of that. That’s my take on it, anyways.

	If you’re looking for resources, I feel like this [Contrapoints](https://youtu.be/fD2briZ6fB0) video is awesome. I also understand the importance of hearing from men, not just women, on these subjects. You may appreciate the documentary The Mask You Live In. There is also this [Ted Talk by Justin Baldoni](https://youtu.be/Cetg4gu0oQQ). On reddit, I think r/MensLib could be a good place to ask some questions. Good luck.

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 3 _(2021-04-13 04:10:01)_

	Most of this will likely have been mentioned before in other comments but it's probably worth saying again, and I'm telling you this from the point of view of a 32 year old guy with a fiancé who wasn't exactly slinging it about when I was younger.

	Women aren't just there for us. They're not objects to satisfy urges that we have. They're not less than us and their wants and desires are no less important than a man's. That's the first and probably most important thing you need to accept. Woman are allowed to not find you attractive or compatible for any reason and they don't have to sleep with you. That's not something that reflects on you specifically or your worth as a man, but it's absolutely fine for a woman to not be interested, and for most women there's literally nothing you can do to change their mind, and there's nothing wrong with that. 

	You shouldn't place so much importance on sex either. You're 18 and a virgin. Who cares? Most people at 18 were virgins whether they would admit it to you or not. Some of the people who would make fun of you for it were, or are virgins at your age. I don't want to dismiss you as "just a kid" or anything, but chances are when you get a bit older you won't care about something as unimportant as when you first had sex. The way I feel about what other people think of me at 32 is so vastly different than it was at 18. You need to try and have a more healthy mindset about that and know you're not abnormal or less worthy for not having sex. 

	Sex is absolutely not better at 18 than it is when you're older. Good sex comes from experience, and it's better with someone you have a genuine connection to and even then it gets better the longer you're with them. I'm sorry to break it to you but if you have sex today, you will almost certainly be terrible at it. Everyone is at first. The guys your age that you're jealous of are probably terrible at it, and so are the girls they're having it with. 

	The last thing I'd tell you is that starting out every potential conversation or relationship with a girl from the point of view of "how can I make this girl have sex with me" isn't healthy, and it's probably going to make them not want to be around you. Sorry to be harsh, but it's true. Treat them like people rather than just something to stick your penis in and develop friendships and relationships. Learn that women aren't objects for your pleasure and that they're allowed to have preferences and individual thoughts. I guarantee that doing that makes it easier to get to know people and get more comfortable and confident around women, and that's when someone will be able to find you attractive or want to get to know you.

	It's good that you've recognised that the way you were thinking isn't right and want to change it. I hope you get there and end up happy, but it starts with being happy with yourself. Get there and the other stuff will come, relationships and sex included.

	Let's reverse this as a thought exercise. What attributes would a person need to have for them to be ENTITLED to a sexual relationship with you?

	It's not looks, money, "putting the time in".

	It's whether or not you like them and whether you want to. That's it.

	Practice social skills. Make friends with people you don't want sex from. That's the only thing you can do to improve your odds.

	Paid onlyfans relationships are actually a really bad place to form emotional attachments. You're a customer getting emotional about a product in a store. The product isn't a sexual relationship.

	If there's one part I need to stress, if this mentality continues and one day you actually have sex, you'll fall even farther when you inevitably find it didn't change anything.

	 You don't want sex, you want to feel right. Sex just won't solve that problem. It'll make it far worse. Point is, you gotta take care of yourself and stop placing important on something that quite literally very little people actually care about.

	People find stable minds desirable. So take care of yourself, do what you need to do and get out there. There's a lot more important things to focus on.

	Responding to all of this would be quite exhausting, and probably wouldn't help as much as more general advice.

	1. A lot of your views are based in patriarchal and misogynistic notions of what sexual and romantic relationships look like. It's not your fault, and it's quite common for everyone (women and non-binary people included) to have a certain amount of these views. I suggest looking up feminist views on these subjects and honestly questioning your beliefs, and going from there.

	2. It is fine to be sexually frustrated and quite normal for your age. It's normal to be a virgin at 18. There is no "right" time to lose your virginity, and virginity as a concept is pretty stupid anyway. Besides this, sex gets better as you get older, not worse.

	3. Life isn't fair. Some men will be richer and more attractive than you. Some will have more exciting relationships than you will. You will need to learn to be OK with what you have.

	4. You should not try to suppress your feelings or your desires. You want to be in a romantic relationship with a woman, I presume based on your post. You need to acknowledge what you want and take practical steps toward achieving it, rather than trying to suppress your desire. You also need to learn to let go of negative feelings.

	5. You should try talking to a therapist. You're young and you have time to change, and therapists specialize in changing people's behaviors. I cannot suggest this enough.

	You poor, sweet baby. I just want to wrap you in my arms and tell you it'll be OK. 

	I think you might be surprised by how many guys you know actually are virgins as well. Guys lie about sex like middle-aged women lie about their age. Both of my college boyfriends were virgins before me. Most of them adult men I know were virgins when they started college. I (a lady) was a virgin til 19, myself.

	I had a roommate a few years back whose boyfriend admitted during a drinking game that he was in his mid-20s when he lost his virginity to a prostitute out of desperation. Did we think badly of him? No. We gave him hugs and told him it was OK.

	You seem to believe that being chosen by a lady is validation of your manliness. Please allow me to disabuse you if this misconception. And why do you think that manliness is the number one virtue in a man? Don't get me wrong, there are many positive masculine traits, but there are many other traits that are lovely as well.

	I felt a lot like you as a young lady. I was looking for a relationship rather than sex, but it was the same principle. I was depressed and suicidal. I clung to the first boy who liked me and slept with him almost right away.  When he broke up with me, I thought the whole world had ended. 

	Please learn from my 38 years of life experience. First, anonymous sex isn't as great as it's made out to be. It's great when you have a real connection with someone.  Connections don't happen because you're such an amazing person that you deserve it. They happen because you meet someone compatible with you. 

	These days, it's easy for me to go out with someone and be told it's not going to work. I don't feel personally offended. I know it's not about me. I'm just not right for them - even if I thought I was. 

	I'm an overweight, middle-aged lesbian from the US but living in Japan. Do you know how hard it is to find anyone who'll give me the time of day (and speaks a language I understand)?! But it's OK. There's so much more in life!!!

	Just live your life. Find things you love to do and put your whole heart into them. One days, a compatible lady will find her way into your hobby, and you'll be blown away by the feeling of making that connection - at any age.

	Hi, it's really great you want to change your view, it's a great step. 

	I am a teenage girl and I wanna give you some advice, some girls like having sex with older men and that's just their kink you need to let that go. Another thing is that your way to concerned about your appearence and the appearance of other guys. What attracts me to a guy is his ability to make me laugh, hold a great conversation and how he treats me. If a guy treats me right and respects me, gives me the occasional compliment that is way more attractive to me than what he looks like. 

	If you are still on this appearance train though, it's not just about that, it's how you carry yourself, if your confident in yourself and who you are or not that is attractive not the colour of your eyes or hair or how many muscles you have. I have dated one scrawny guy and one muscular guy and the only difference in my opinion was the cuddles but that doesn't really matter too much.

	>Another thing; another reason why i also wanna sex badly is because i am getting older and sex at a older age isn't as enjoyable compared to doing It in your younger years. Teenagers have raging hormones and are much hornier and lustful than adults. Therefore even if i end up having sex when I'm older, what would be the point if i am not even gonna have the same excitement or fun? I'll be a grown man and i won't have raging hormones anymore and I'll be much more stoic and busy so sex will be worthless at such a age. 

	This is such bullshit lol. Whoever told you this is just a dumbass. Sex is still great later. It's the exact same later. I literally laughed reading this. Only the incel world could come up with this paragraph.

	It's clear that much of your perspective and opinions comes from other incels. And you have to realize that it's the blind leading the blind. They don't know *anything* about sex/women/etc, and everything they tell you is completely idiotic and wrong.

	I can see you're really hurting. The language you use to talk about women is not okay, but I think that's why you're here. It’s also hypocritical, &amp; I point this out not to berate or judge you but to provide an example of where your logic (which is likely more detrimental to you than anyone else) is inconsistent: you say you feel misogynistic, you see women in a negative light, because women won't give you a chance. You don't really understand why, so you've assumed it's something inherent to you, &amp; you think it's unfair that you would effectively be discriminated against for something you can't control, or that’s a natural part of who you are. You hate that women seem to judge you for something you feel you can't change. But then, how is the way you judge women for the very fact of them being women any different? And isn’t your issue with the women you’ve interacted with that they aren’t even getting to know you before they dismiss you? 

	You acknowledge women are not all the same, yet you use generalized language &amp; make repeated assumptions about "what women are like" in order to degrade everyone of that sex/gender. Here's the kicker: in the same way you don't owe anyone money or time or attention for them to respect you, women don't owe anyone sex OR abstinence. It is a personal choice that’s completely individualized based on their relationship with a potential partner. People don't choose romantic or sexual partners based on some checklist of traits, or at least, most don't. We're interested in &amp; attracted to people we form personal connections with. It is a matter of circumstance whether on any given day you will happen to have an interaction with a woman in which she feels drawn to you. That part isn't a choice. Women aren't assessing every inch of your body &amp; every aspect of your life; they're talking to you &amp; figuring out whether they feel connected to you. I suspect you've had trouble connecting with women not because women have judged your appearance or success, maybe not even your character, but because it's difficult to connect with anyone who is hiding inside a shell. Incel ideology is a wall to insulate people from pain. 

	Feeling rejected doesn't indicate anything being wrong with who you are. Kids who are bullied for being different in any capacity often come to feel that they must "deserve it." It's the simplest explanation - seems more likely that there's something wrong with me than with everyone around me. The truth resists simplicity. Society &amp; community are powerful forces. People don't choose to bully someone because there's something "wrong" with them, bullies bully someone because they can. They bully easy targets, &amp; others join in to bully that target because it prevents others from making them a target. It's hard to bully a bully, because everyone probably already thinks they're tougher &amp; cooler than you. Even when we hate bullies, we're taught to respect them. We assume power is earned, but really, I think it's given.

	So, it seems to me like you've found yourself ruminating over really depressing, scary thoughts. Your brain is telling you you're not enough, you're worthless, you're cursed, you're doomed, no one likes you, you're unlikable. So you've twisted that train of thought a bit &amp; continued, I'm unattractive, the world is horrible, everyone is cruel, nothing is fair, everyone's worth is decided based on their appearance, &amp; women are evil because they pick other people but not me, &amp; I can only assume they pick other people because they're shallow &amp; vapid. Except when women pick someone who isn't gorgeous or wealthy. What then? Well those women must just be whores, they'll sleep with anyone randomly. But not me, for some reason... Why not me?

	And the cycle continues. Incel groups tend to reinforce your worst feelings about yourself, &amp; that’s on purpose, because some people have discovered that there's power to be had in making people feel insecure &amp; vulnerable. If you keep people down, you can convince them that you're the only light in the world, that you know everything, &amp; because you know everything, they should take all of your advice. Most importantly, they should believe everything you say. So when someone is starting to feel a bit more optimistic about their lives, or their dating prospects, you don't want that; that gives them some of their power back. If they feel okay about themselves, they won't listen to you anymore! If all their problems resolve, they won't have any reason to come back &amp; lend themselves to your movement. 

	These communities aren’t based on shared circumstances, or appearances, or how people in your life have treated you, or just "how the world works." They're based on recruiting people to your way of seeing the world, because then you feel validated, &amp; you feel right. If everyone around you says women are evil monsters, suddenly you're not so concerned with how you feel about yourself, because women are the world's villains. The world is run on Pretty Privilege, &amp; you’re a smart, capable, good person who is given the short end of the stick. The more people agree with you, the more righteous you feel.

	And then you see a woman living her own life, &amp; she kisses some guy. Your whole world suddenly narrows while you ruminate over other people's lives, other people's choices, based on little to no firsthand information about what's actually going on. Somewhere in your brain, you may think that even if staring at this woman being with someone else fills you with rage &amp; self-loathing, at least you're not empty. At least you're not thinking about how sad &amp; alone you feel. At least there's nothing you can do about it. That keeps the rage going, &amp; maybe rage isn't so bad. This is why I'm so glad you're here. You're confronting your rage already. You don't want to hate people, or believe hateful things. If you continue to nurture that desire to be kinder, to be more generous, to be more forgiving, you'll find that suddenly you're not so consumed by this sense that there's something wrong with you. The weight you carry lifts a bit, the pit in your stomach starts to fill, &amp; existing isn't so uncomfortable anymore. (1)

	Didn’t read all that but holy fuck you can’t base your whole worth on your ability to have sex. I’m an intelligent, good looking guy and only had sex when I was in college. A bit of a “late bloomer” but honestly there is no need to have teenage sex. It’s irresponsible at most times since we were obviously less mature.

	You compare yourself so much to others, instead of just focusing on yourself. Good looks, money, success won’t get you girls if you’re an asshole. Contrary to popular beliefs girls usually don’t sleep with ppl who irritate them or act entitled. 

	Your misogyny is preventing you from getting girls. And not getting girls is making you more misogynistic. You gotta break the cycle and stop being misogynistic 

	Why tf do you hate seeing others doing well? It is just illogical and brings no positive to you. 

	And no, sex in your 20s is just as passionate as in your teens

	Women can tell when you dont see them as people and as sex objects. Im not saying that to put you down. The next time you look at *any woman* your own age take a moment to ask yourself if the first thing you think about is if you want to have sex with her. 

	I also notice that you only reference *attractive* girls. You know there are plenty of funny, interesting, successful, and kind *less than* attractive girls. If youve written them off as unfuckable is it fair of you to be mad at women you think have done the same to you?

	Jeez I feel so sorry for this girl that people like you exist - or more accurately, people like you who don't have the epiphany of how ridiculous their feelings are. 

	She can have fun with whoever makes her feel good and safe, and really this should be lesson to you that those things are 1000x more important than the superficial bs that you're obsessing over.

This attitude of entitlement you have will only serve to not get you laid. Do yourself a favor and join a club or team or something and get offline. You honestly think you’re gonna develop a meaningful enough relationship with an onlyfans girl to get laid? No.

	>sex at a older age isn't as enjoyable compared to doing It in your younger years

	I know others have gone over this, but I just want to repeat that this is so very wrong.

	If I were to rank all of my sexual experiences, the top 10 would all be from my 30s. It's not even close. (I am in my late 30s now. I'm not afraid of my impending 40s, either.)

	I understand where you're coming from, because when I was your age I was also very frustrated. I think I was fortunate to grow up in a time before such toxic subcultures were so prominent and accessible, because I may well have been sucked in.

	It's great that you recognize this as toxic. That puts you way ahead of your peers.

	I am not a religious person, but I rather like this passage from the Bible:

	>The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all.

	I understand why you feel like others are "more worthy of respect" because of their sexual experience; it's a pervasive attitude in American culture, though thankfully on the decline. But seriously, that doesn't make them better people than you! It doesn't mean they're more attractive, or smarter, or kinder, or anything much at all.

	If you hate that attitude, if you find it dehumanizing to reduce a whole person to their sexual expression, you shouldn't be a misogynist; you should be a feminist. Seriously. Modern feminism is all about peeling away these layers of antiquated, toxic gender roles to free people (not just women, but all people) to simply *be whole people*.

	“ this fucking whore” start off by not referring to women like this. She’s a sex worker, but you’re shaming her for the sex work that you consume yourself. It’s hypocritical and misogynistic to insult her for the same thing which you so desperately crave.

	The first time isn't like the movies dude. Teenagers usually don't have a clue what they're doing. Most of my friends didn't lose it until their early to mid twenties. University/College is where everyone gets laid.

	I know it sounds obvious and stupid but just talk to girls the way you would like to be talked to, like you're not being eyed up for dinner! You don't always have to share the same interests to find a connection. Being funny is also a plus, just don't try too hard.

	That whole 'you're not a man until you have sex' bullshit is sadly interwoven into our society, but you can see that it's wrong and by posting here you've made your first big step in wanting to become a better person in my opinion.

* 🟩 **[BeatriceBernardo](https://www.reddit.com/user/BeatriceBernardo)** ⬆️ 20 _(2021-04-13 01:34:48)_

	If you're 18 and really want sex, why not just hire a prostitute (assuming it is legal to do so at where you are)? 

	> is because men who are virgins with no experience with women are losers and considered to be less worthy of respect

	You realize that it is just your opinion right? Sure, maybe other people around you also have the same opinion, but they are just an opinion. They are not even that popular. Maybe in your circle of friend, or in the media you consume, but they are not the popular opinion.

	So I guess the big question is. Why you have that opinion in the first place? My best guess is, again, because your circle of friends, and the media your consume, portrays that. If that is the real reason you have that opinion, then you just have to change your circle of friends and the media your consume.

	The typical alternative view is that, what is good is monogamy for life, sex after marriage, etc. Or even that any sex is weakness, and the best thing to do is celibacy. The goal for men is to AVOID morally loose women. I'm sure you can go around and find such group of friends and media. Usually they are religious groups, but not necessarily.

	Or maybe, I made a wrong guess. You believe that because of other reasons. In that case, I would like to know.

* 🟩 **[tidalbeing](https://www.reddit.com/user/tidalbeing)** ⬆️ 3 _(2021-04-13 03:29:13)_

	Not having had sex at age 18 is normal for either a man or a woman. Often people delay having sex until nearly 30 or might not have sex at all. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Greater respect is often given to those who have delayed sex or who have never had sex than those who lose their virginity at a young age.  

	Sex carries risks and responsibilities that few people are ready to take on until well into their 20s. Consider if you are ready to care for children. Consider if the girl you'd like to have sex with is physically ready to undergo pregnancy. Becoming pregnant can result in serious injury and death, and the risk is higher for teenagers.

	I recommend finding self-worth another way. Think about what you truly enjoy doing, and then do it in a way that doesn't harm yourself or others.

	Young men have amazing physical ability but aren't particularly good lovers. Maybe take advantage of your physical ability to engage in sports and outdoor recreation: sailing, hiking, ultra-marathons, ninja warrior competitions. You also might take on jobs that make use of  the amazing physical ability that you have as a young man--firefighting, rescue, that sort of thing. 

	You might not be in very good shape right now, but young men can develop muscle and conditioning at a rate envied by everyone else. Physical activity is an excellent use of testosterone and raging hormones, much better than harassing young women.

* 🟩 **[fozzypendejo](https://www.reddit.com/user/fozzypendejo)** ⬆️ 3 _(2021-04-13 03:56:51)_

	Hey a lot of good stuff has already been said here so I’ll try to keep this brief. To reiterate several comments, it is completely normal and common for people to not have sex until their college years. Your worth as a human being is completely intact and is not tied to whether or not you have sex. I think one thing that could be helpful is to stop identifying as an incel. Sure, you haven’t had sex yet despite your desire to, but that does not define who you are. The term incel implies blame on others. 

	I would also refrain from blanket statements. Saying things like “all women...”, “most women...”, “women want...” is inaccurate and perpetuates the notion that they are a hive mind that is plotting against you. Just like any group of people, women are not a monolith. They have nuances, differences of opinion, experience, culture, and preferences. If you truly want to break down you misogynistic feelings, I think it’s important to be mindful of the language you use. 

	The best advice I can give you is to begin the journey of finding ways to love yourself. It sounds corny, but it’s very real. If you focus inward and start to truly love yourself, more people will want to be around you. Not just romantic or sexual partners. Everyone. The fact that you wrote this post shows you want to grow and change. This is all just part of your story. Be safe.

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 4 _(2021-04-13 04:00:56)_

	First, thank you SO much for doing this.  It shows strength of character.

	Second - it's a grim time these days.  "If you aren't crazy, there's something wrong with you."

	Third, you are _certain_ to get laid in your future, if you don't go crazy right now.  I grew up in Canada in the 70s, and many of my friends didn't have a sexual relationship until very late, but eventually they all did.

	There's nothing wrong with being a virgin.  My friend in high school could not get laid for the life of him, but no one thought the worse of him, and he finally did, and now he's very happily married with two kids and a good job.

	Some people like to mock others and feel better than them.  I would add that probably some of them are just lying about having sex.

	Fourth, the really really pretty girls are often bad in bed, and very often dull and demanding.  

	(And the girls who are amazingly good in bed are often crazy and dangerous. Trust me on this, I have the literal scars to prove it.)

	Some of the happiest men I know have plain wives who they really get along well with.  Conversely, some of the unhappiest men I've known have been men with pretty wives who made their lives a living hell.

	Fifth, dump the porn, the onlyfans, all of it.  It will give you unreasonable expectations, and it's all a lie.  I'd bet you, ten to one, that the whole story about the girl meeting the "random" fan was entirely set up to get her followers all hot and bothered.  Soon they will "break up" and every follower will be, "Perhaps if I send her more money, I'll be next!"

	What makes a man attractive to a woman?  Confidence.  Being relaxed.  If you make a woman laugh, you're a long way to scoring.  Detachment is also sexy.  If you really don't care, it makes you more attractive.  On the other hand, being needy is _not_ attractive.

	OK, but you're a mass of needs NOW! (We've all been there.)  So how do you become this confident guy?

	Answer is that you have to develop the rest of your life.  This is the time in your life you need to be picking up skills, and mastering them.  (And useful skills you can build on.  Hacking doesn't cut it, and I'm a computer programmer.)

	I assure you - once you get past your teens, there's nothing so sexy as a man on a mission.  All the better if it's some career that makes you money, but my friend who's a talented musician who probably makes $5000 a year _and_ treats his girlfriends badly is never without some girl around, because he's focused on his music.

	---

	I would also add that being well turned out is helpful in meeting women -  dressing well, having a nice haircut, shoes are very important.  Now, I didn't do very well on this front :-D but I did well enough.  I simply started wearing jackets all the time, and that was enough to give me some sort of style and makes you look older.  You could do a lot better here than I did.

	Dressing well does not mean spending a huge amount of money - it means looking comfortable, and neat, and not a slob.

	If you can find a somewhat older woman to help you choose your clothes, that really helps.

	---

	Finally, if you think things are better for women, guess again.  It's even more stressful for them, because looks are so important in this frustrating world, and in their hearts, women know that their looks are transitory, and will be gone in time.  Also, the risks are much higher for women - pregnancy, VD and social mockery are much worse for women than men.  

	I was basically a social outcast in high school, but I had a steady girlfriend (the same one the whole time) because I really didn't care what people thought about me.  I didn't even know this was what it was until years later when I talked to a girl I'd lusted after in high school.  But being a social outcast is just devastating for women.

	Time is on your side and against women in this one.   If you just tough it out, don't get bitter, develop some confidence, in a surprisingly small number of years, they will be coming to you.

	---

	I feel you have a natural common sense.  Right now, you're a mass of hormones and resentment which are fucking you up, and we've all been there, but you're smart enough to understand that this isn't a necessary state of affairs, so you came here.

	Rely on your common sense, chill out for a few years and develop yourself, and I am highly confident that you'll have a happy and fulfilling sex life.

	----

	EDIT:

	>  sex at a older age isn't as enjoyable compared to doing It in your younger years. 

	This is flat-out wrong.  I had the best sex in my life in my 40s.  Sex when you're young is stressful and high-stakes.  As a guy, you ejaculate too fast, and you have no idea how to bring a woman to climax.  Your partners don't know what they want and don't know what their relationship to sex is.

	When you're older, you're more relaxed, and it's just far more fun.

* 🟩 **[losingmystuffing](https://www.reddit.com/user/losingmystuffing)** ⬆️ 4 _(2021-04-13 07:11:55)_

	You mention “attractive” women multiple times. One idea would be to do a reality check and ask yourself if your standards for who you’d like to have sex with are unreasonably high. There are so so many women who might be average or below average in the looks department but who have lots of other great things to offer and who might be more receptive to your advances. Bottom line: I see a lot of guys complain about not being able to pull women but it turns out they want 7s, 8s, 9s, 10s, when they are only 2s, 3s, 4s,etc, in the looks department. Lower your beauty standards and you’ll increase your odds for making a connection with a female.

* 🟩 **[isChloeLamb](https://www.reddit.com/user/isChloeLamb)** ⬆️ 3 _(2021-04-23 12:32:28)_

	Being a virgin is totally fine, future partners may just ask why and if your answer is that you just didn’t have a lot of luck with women that will be ok! It’s usually more of a red flag if it’s because you think sex is morally wrong or something. It’s totally respectable to not focus on dating. 

	As a woman, I can tell you that the boys that are very successful with women early on usually just have qualities that girls get along with easily - super friendly, like the same music and movies, hang out with the same people etc. The ideals women have for men change as they get older and the size of you that is hard working and dedicated to knowledge will be a real turn on for women looking for a partner.

	Also, remember women on Onlyfans are not there to be in a relationship with followers but if it does happen they may have just had a connection that she thought was worth looking into. 

	I think you will do best to just surround yourself with understanding people who don’t have this weird false alpha/beta dichotomy mindset. No guy is “better” or worse than another. It’s totally subjective and you get to decide what matters to you. Fuck anyone else.
