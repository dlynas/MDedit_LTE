	"can't just take a whole strip of land and say Israel is really
	as can't live there.
	It doesn't make sense.
	This is our sovereign state.
	Would you live there?
	Of course.
	By the beach.
	Oh, for sure.
	Yes, my husband's also talking about a building.
	He has a Yashiva, a Talmudic Institute here.
	So building a branch.
	And yes, and as we have lists already about 500 families
	at a willing, on the drop of a hat,
	to just move into, we have North, Central, and South,
	Gaza, and people are going to stop building towns.
	We have names of the towns.
	We have where we're building them.
	It's already being planned.
	And we have people signed up.
	You can't leave it without Jews in the Gaza strip.
	It's too big a piece of land.
	It's too important for us to let it become,
	a Hamas town, as we call it, Philip terrorists."

	"The ceasefire resolution that Russian-China just vetoed at the UN isn't actually a ceasefire.
	The resolution the US proposed says that there's an imperative for an immediate ceasefire,
	but it never actually calls on Israel to stop its massacre.
	The core for media is reporting that Russian-China have just vetoed a ceasefire, but don't
	actually tell you that Russian-China vetoed the resolution precisely because the ambiguous
	language would allow Israel to continue its massacre.
	And that's exactly what the US and Israel wanted.
	They proposed this resolution knowing it would be vetoed so every headline in all the
	major news networks would say Russian-China vetoed a ceasefire.
	This is part of a clear strategy emerging within the US ruling class to flip the narrative
	by making it look like the US wants a ceasefire and then it's the Palestinians who are blocking"
