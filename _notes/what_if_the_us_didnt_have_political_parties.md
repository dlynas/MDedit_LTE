> People listen to George Washington's opinion on political parties and decided that every candidate would run as an independent.

	What would happen is there would be political parties.

		Humans are social primates. Whether officially or otherwise, we're going to form opposing groups.

	The system as it currently stands leads inexorably to parties. 

	There is no known system to avoid parties at the scale of the US, either now or through most of our history. It's just too big for independent to have an equal shot against someone with party backing, so....you get parties. 

	Different systemic features might change how many parties and how they interact, though. 

	Also, it's worth noting that Washington mostly just wanted a uniparty. A single party system can exist, but is generally terrible. For all the flaws of our two party system, countries with a one party system have far graver flaws. The desire for unity probably seemed important in the context of a small fledgling nation, and was a reasonable desire for him to have, but the 1800 election permanently transitioned us to a two party system, and with the benefit of hindsight, we can see that this was an incremental improvement over a one party system.

		Honestly, the main flaws I see with the single parties has little to do with the actual single party, but the high levels of corruption just outside. There aren't really any checks and balances. 
		
		Keep in mind the soviet/Chinese model of elections works essentially the same as a recall election would. Party shows candidate, and you vote yay or nay. Keep repeating until a candidate has high ratings. Works great on the local level, but once you go a little higher, you have too many people for this to work.
		
		They got around this by having the lower level people voted in to get in a council and select some people among themselves to go up. But since there's no checks and balances, separation of powers, or direct say from the people as a whole, this middle level eventually just becomes a cesspool of corruption and nepotism.
		
		
		Edit: though the american election system is fundamentally incompatible with this. Maybe could work on the level of a single city, but thats about it

	Political parties are unavoidable in democratic politics. Likeminded people band together to achieve common political goals. Also, Washington was a Federalist in all but name. When he said “we shouldn’t have parties” what he meant was “people shouldn’t be teaming up against me, Hamilton, and the gang.”

	People would make political parties. This wasn't some coincidental historical event. A two party system is a mathematical inevitability of any FPTP winner take all voting system.

	Literally impossible. There isn’t a country on Earth that doesn’t have political parties.

	You mean like Russia, China, North Korea, Cuba, Iran, Belarus, or Gaza? Brilliant.

	If we made them illegal, they would just do the same thing quietly.   

	The DNC and RNC are about power for themselves and fuck everyone else. Humans with that mindset just find a way to cheat the rules.

	Independent candidates, arriving in their state capitals or the District of Columbia from thier home districts, would find themselves in need of local accommodations for living, dining, and socializing while away from thier homes back in thier districts. Over time, legislators with similar ideological bents and are more likely to get along with one another will probably start lodging in the same hotels/boarding houses and attending the same local entertainment establishments. Over time, social and banqueting clubs would form around these places and attract the patronage and membership of prominent supporters, becoming a natural magnet and organizing centera for backers of these candidates and a shared political program. Even if its less formalized, every prospective candidate will know that having the membership and support of these clubs (with all thier ability to gather funds, stump speakers, connections with printers, ect.) is a major advantage. 

	The representives elected to the National Assembly in Revolutionary France did not have formal party affiliations either, but that does not mean factions did/would not form.

	A winner-takes-all, absolute-majority (of EVs) required political system (for President) essentially mandates 2 (never more) parties.

	Especially on the scale that the US has grown to.

	But... A lot of our problems in recent years stem from how \*weak\* the parties have gotten (thanks to the Democrats' post 1968 decision to create binding primaries)....

	For example, the idea that a non-member of a party could not only be nominated for President, but \*get elected\* never would have happened in the past... And yet it did in 2016.

	Meaningless, even if political parties were officially banned there would still be clandestinely organized factions. Famously despite the ban on factions in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, there was still constant factionalism basically the entire time except *maybe* during the war years and immediately afterwards. First it was Stalin vs. Trotsky, then Stalin vs. Bukharin, then Stalin vs. the old Bolsheviks like Kamenev, then after Stalin's death it was Khrushchev vs. Beria and Malenkov, then Khrushchev vs. Brezhnev... so on. This is a country with only one legal political party and no factions allowed within the party, yet there were still unofficial political organizations within various organs of the state and party apparatus.

	How could an individual campaign for office without some form of support?
