An important message through a comment to all students in Northern American and european universities, “Some moments, I thought that even if I survived this genocide, I've lost my sense of being part of human existence, but the recent movement at universities has begun to restore my sense of humanity.” Guys, your message have reached the victims in Gaza. You are doing well.
