"So, age group just released a, I'll admit, pretty effective intimidation
side-up video. You know, it's like the little Etsy shop of horse and it looks like
it's popping. They've industrialized the process. They've got multiple work
stations where they are constructing anti-personnel debt charges. And the fact
that they're releasing this video now indicates that they're kind of gonna
start to shift into a different style of attrition warfare. As you can see,
these anti-personnel charges, they can be hung on walls. They can be hidden
within the rubble. There are multiple ways they can detonate through infrared
detectors, which are kind of unreliable, or command detonation where you have a
guy pressing a button or a pressure detonation. We, you know, trip a wire or hit a
pressure pad or something. We know these ones are anti-personnel because we can
see the ball bearings. So, it explodes and a bunch of balls turn into bullets and fly
everywhere and a dispersed direction like shotgun, essentially. And this is a
style of insurgency that Americans know all about. So, you guys have fun with
this. But when I said that they're transitioning to another phase of warfare,
see, there was the ball bearings right there. Or should I say tactics, rather. It's
because right now Israel is reducing forces. They're taking people out of the
Gaza Strip. Divisions of less, brigades of left. Hamas has also lost 20% of its
fighters most likely. So, it's going to be lower intensity, attrition, urban warfare,
starting pretty soon. And I say soon, I don't have an estimate, but the fact that
they decided to put this video out right now is some indication of what they
expect to happen. There is something else that they could easily produce that
they didn't show in the video. Based off the shape of the charges they're making
and the industrial nature of that factory or Etsy shop, whatever you want to call it.
And that is the anti-vehicle variant. It's called an EFP,
explosively formed penetrator. If you were mechanized, infantry or artillery in
Iraq, you don't like these things because they can
fuck up a tank or a Bradley or a striker. So, basically, you have a concave copper disc
that explodes out and turns into a molten copper beam that can penetrate armor.
Yeah, you see the copper disc? Yeah. So, you can set them up in a
raise of like forward and ten of them if you just really want to slaying the
copper out there. You can also use steel tube, a copper is better. And explosive
that you have to in place will always be more effective if the enemy has
limited movement or limited movement options. So, things like tanks and armored
personnel carriers can go over most terrain. They're pretty rugged, except
lots of rubble because they'll start breaking tracks and become immobile. So, if you turn
the entire city into rubble, you're going to have limited options. You're going to create
canalizing terrain or canal, you know, canalizing where you can only go certain routes.
And those can be easily reconned and determined and they can just come in at night,
set them up and then wait at an observation point. Do a command detonation and, you know,
initiate an ambush or something like that. Remember, it takes a lot of effort to clear routes
through this mess because they have to use all those bulldozers. And technically, I was dismounted
in infantry, so I have no idea what it's like to conduct vehicle recovery operations under fire.
But here's the field manual if you give a sh**. I think we can all agree that's not something we
ever would want to do. So, it's likely they're entering a whole new nasty phase of
booby traps, ambushes and counter-ambushes. So, we should probably just do like a ceasefire now.
I feel like that is the most reasonable course of action. Essentially, it's no more call of duty
larping. No more just shooting rounds into empty buildings. It's walking really slowly, looking at
everything and, you know, your canine, your bomb detection dog running in circles, not sitting down
like you should because he's just overwhelmed by how many explosives are in there. That's a true
story. Good times. So, this completely unnecessary, unrewarding, slogging and ultimately incredibly
psychologically impactful phase that's there about the transition to could just be averted.
With a freaking ceasefire. It's gonna end that way anyways, but whatever. Cheers."
