## CMV: "I feel" statements, emphasized by most therapists, limit healthy resolution to conflict and promote emotional abuse

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bve90a/cmv_i_feel_statements_emphasized_by_most/](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bve90a/cmv_i_feel_statements_emphasized_by_most/)

> When I used to go to therapy, I was often told to phrase things in "I feel" terminology. For example, rather than "my partner doesn't love me anymore," "I *feel* that my partner doesn't love me anymore."
> 
> As I see it, "I feel" statements are *maybe* healthy in individual sessions (although even this is debatable). When applied to other people, though, I think they're actively harmful. Take the following example:
> 
> Partner/friend A: "I feel that your become distance and don't respect me anymore."
> 
> Partner/friend B: "That's not true."
> 
> Partner/friend A: "Don't be so dismissive. You're not acknowledging *how I feel.*"
> 
> In this scenario, B is screwed. Supposing what A says is counterfactual or incomplete, they can't acknowledge it without lying. And if they don't, A feels the right to complain.
> 
> This leads to "emotional abuse creep." Gradually, through this form of gaslighting, A convinces B that falsehoods are truths, and that B should feel very, very sorry for something B never did in the first place.

> CMV.

	It can create confusions but in your example the problem is the ambiguity: Is person B denying that person A feels X, or that X is true?

	Clearly it's the latter. But part of the problem is that A has not used an appropriate "I feel" statement to begin with. They are *not* expressing how they feel, they are just tacking "I feel" to the beginning of a claim about what the other person is guilty of.

	So person B's response is completely understandable.

	If you have a therapist who can't make these sorts of distinctions, they are just a bad therapist. The "I feel" statement isn't the real problem here, it's the misuse of it which a therapist should be quick to correct.

	Edit: To add some appropriate uses for contrast -

	"I feel that my partner doesn't love me anymore." should be -> "I don't feel loved".

	"I feel that you've become distant and don't respect me anymore." should be -> "I feel alone and not respected."

	There should be no "I feel *you* did this" claims. As a rule of thumb "I feel" statements should just not have the word "you" in them at all.

	Notice that the former are assertions about the other person while the latter don't assume the feelings are the fault of the other person? That's what you're going for with "I feel" statements, to get people to distinguish the feelings from the cause of the feelings which helps clarify the dynamics of the relationship. The other person can acknowledge the feelings without having to defend themselves from the accusation that those feelings are their fault. So its purpose is quite the opposite of what you're saying it does - it's not to make the "I feel" person right about anything they put that phrase in front of.

		This stood out to me as well. It's important to put an actual feeling word after an "I feel" statement. Even "I don't feel respected" isn't correct because being respected isn't a feeling so much as a judgement placed on the other person who is seen as "disrespectful". And that by nature will elicit the other person's defenses instead of their empathy, and also risks motivating them out of guilt instead of love.    
		
		
		OP I highly recommend the book called "Nonviolent Communication" by Rosenberg as it teaches exactly this and more

			It's possible for the lack of respect to be a lack of self respect, projected onto the other person. That's a complicated one though, and I'd agree someone saying "I don't feel respected" *probably* attributes the absence to another person, but it's not the only possibility. I'm not sure there's a better way to express it that avoids the complication.

				I get what you're saying, but that's why "I feel" statements are supposed to be in the general context of discussing ways to improve communication from both people. It doesn't work in a vacuum. 
				
				For example: one thing that's highly recommended in conflict resolution between couples is, "Would you tell me what you heard, what you interpreted from what I said?" Said calmly and with genuine curiosity. 
				
				If used correctly, it's a valuable technique. We have so much going on inside our heads, and sometimes we completely misinterpret things because it's being filtered through our own perspective. Which is why it can be valuable, if both people understand the point of the tool, to say, "What did you take in from that?" 
				If one partner *doesn't* understand the point of that tool, the question is immediately interpreted as "Were you even fucking listening to me?" Which obviously will just increase tension. 
				
				"I feel" statements are the same way - they are a great tool to use if both people are on the same page about the purpose and use the tool as intended. If misused/one person doesn't understand the tool, they often just fan the fire. We often say accusatory or inflammatory things because we have an unmet need and we don't know how to meet it, so we deflect, accuse, and/or become defensive. "I feel" statements are supposed to communicate important feelings and address the core issue in a way that two people can work together to problem solve the root issue in a caring and nonjudgmental way. But if both people aren't on the same page with *how* to use that tool, it will likely backfire.

				I think it’s ok to own your feelings. Like saying “I feel jealous when…” is ok. But then you can say “I acknowledge that it puts you in an unfair situation and I’m not asking you to do anything. But, I want you to understand and possibly reassure me that I don’t have anything to worry about.”
				
				Your feelings are valid and it’s important to acknowledge and validate them. You can validate them, and/or your partner can. But, as you touched on, behavior is an important component.
				
				If you said you were jealous of time spent with friend then continued to pester your partner about his friend, or do something inappropriate like troll her social media, then it starts to become inappropriate. 
				
				Also, you can tell your partner you’re jealous, and he can say “I love you, but I need to spend time with my friend because…. whatever.” It’s important to him for whatever reason. You can accept that or not. And you can make requests like “well, maybe if you sent me a text or two with a kiss or something like that, it would help make me feel better.”
				
				If you make a reasonable request, your partner would hear you and accommodate because in healthy relationships there’s a give and take. They wouldn’t give you grief over it. The idea is to work together to come up with a solution. Not fight and manipulate to get what you want. 
				
				Relationships aren’t always meant to work. So, at a certain point, walking away is sometimes the healthiest, most mature and self-aware thing you can do.

				This might not be true. Someone can feel jealous and NOT be attempting to manipulate someone else. The value of "I feel" statements is that they accurately represent someone's inner state and allow people to be open with each other.
				
				A longer version of that statement might be "I don't like seeing you with [platonic friend]. I can't focus when you're with them and I keep imagining what you might be doing. I know you aren't doing those things, and I trust you, so I'm also angry at myself for feeling this way."
				
				To which someone might respond "I'm sorry that you feel that way and I'm happy to do what I can so you feel better about my time with my friend. What do you think I can do to help you with those feelings?"
				
				And now the person with feelings can name what they want.

				You’re skipping to the possible solution without discussing the issue. “I’m working on not being jealous.” Puts the entire onus on person A. Realistically A: “I feel abandoned when you go out with your friends every weekend.” B: “I’m part of a league so I don’t want to back out of the commitment. What can I do to make it easier for you?” A: “Do you also have to go for drinks with coworkers during the week? I’d like to spend more time with you.” B: “I’ll skip drinks after work while I’m in this league.”

				But maybe Person B is unintentionally doing something that is adding to Person A's insecurity, and would gladly modify that behavior if they understood the feeling.
				
				Both partners should *want* the other to feel secure and safe with them, and sometimes that means a small acknowledgement to reinforce "I see you and am considering you".

Do you have specific concerns? Are there ways I can help you feel more connected and loved in our relationship?"

				Do you believe it's possible for Person A to have emotions, emotions that benefit from being communicated, without it being a situation that requires blame and finding fault?
				
				Because I'm reading your replies and it seems that for you, either Person A is at fault or Person B is at fault, and you're worried Person B will be passive aggressively forced to accept blame when they are not at fault.
				
				"I feel..." statements are actually designed to prevent that specific thing from happening! Among other benefits of course. The entire purpose is to shunt the conversation away from blame and prime the conversation to be about understanding and mutually agreeable solutions.
				
				Some people struggle to use "I feel..." that way, especially if they've normalized "somebody must be at fault" as a default way of understanding any "negative" emotions, but it's tried and true for a reason. With guidance/commitment and proper redirection any time blame creeps back in, it does work to allow people to address interpersonal issues and feelings more quickly, smoothly, and above all, fairly.
				
				If your starting presumption is that every time a person in a relationship has feelings, one of the people in said relationship is at fault and must take responsibility for causing or allowing those feelings, that would be the source of the issue here.

				- feeling statements are not requests 
				
				
				A request can come after a feeling statememt tho. And a big growth point is actually making a request, not a demand. We all have our own boundaries and needs and values y'know, we want both people to feel met and not encroached upon. 
				
				
				We gotta own our own feelings. And we share them in order to reveal our reality and empathize with each other, not control each other

				It can be used for manipulation but it can also be a direct conversation starter to address an issue. The issue may be one sided or 'wrong' in a sense but if it's effecting someone a conversation about it can't hurt. With your example maybe they internalized it with spending time with the friend but the solution is 'could we spend more time together'. Or 'I don't know them can  we set something up'. Who knows. Maybe they really do spend more time with someone. Maybe A thinks they are closer than they are and needs B to say they are closer to C or tell A where they stand. Or maybe A is hyper sensitive and has certain expectations that could either be delusional or reasonable. There's lots of potential.
				
				Admitting you feel a way is usually the first step to addressing it and sometimes they needs their friends, family, or partner to meet them where they are at to help them through it.

			This is not the purpose they serve as a therapeutic tool, though. The person saying "I feel" should be making an objective statement about how they do actually feel, not having an opinion about their feelings which would effectively make it unclear whether they are actually feeling them at all. 
			
			"I feel sad" is of course not an opinion if I actually feel sad when I say it. The feeling itself is only available to me as a subject, but insofar as I report this honestly it makes the objective fact about how I feel available to others.
			
			Not saying it's wrong to use "I feel" in other ways, but just in the context of therapy that's using this tool, there is a specific intended use.

					That's a practically inevitable initial difficulty given most people in therapy aren't professional therapists, but the therapist introducing it needs to teach clients how to use it properly.

		You make very good points but I disagree with the premise of your argument:
		
		*A has not used an appropriate "I feel" statement*
		
		I don't think a statement like this (which 90% of the people in this thread have used) does anything to suggest that "I feel" statements don't have serious pitfalls. In fact, it offers a potential warning: that "I feel" statements are difficult to correctly form.
		
		This is the same argument commonly used to argue against government firearms control. (Even if one disagrees that there should be more firearms control, it's possible to see the flaw in logic.) Gun accidents aren't due to the gun *because if only people had used it correctly, it wouldn't have happened.* No: the danger in the gun lies in the fact that it's easy to use incorrectly, and very dangerous when it's not used appropriately.

			A therapist can recognize when a therapeutic tool is too difficult for someone to use, and that simply depends on the client. "I feel" statements might not work for everyone, but they can work and they serve a legitimate therapeutic purpose.
			
			When someone makes a mistake with "I feel statements" this is also nowhere near as dangerous as making a mistake with a gun. People have to learn to communicate well with others to have good relationships and mistakes are a necessary part of that process. Clients in therapy will likely already have been using worse language towards eachother outside of therapy, especially if they're the sort who struggle with "I feel" statements.

					The main issue I see here, with your argument in general, is that you're confusing objective truth with subjective feelings. You may not feel loved but that doesn't mean that you are, in actual reality, not loved.
					
					That's why we use 'I feel' statements. You say 'I don't feel loved' as a productive discussion open calm communication point to figure out why that's the case and solve it. Whereas if you say 'I'm not loved' this automatically creates an argumentative defensive accusatory discussion about blame because they other person likely DOES love you. There's likely just a disconnect between their love and you feeling it.
					
					I feel statements don't automatically create an objective truth, by saying 'I don't feel loved' it doesn't mean person B has actually harmed person A. There could be a lot of things going on here. Mismatched love languages maybe, where person B is giving love to person A in a way that they don't feel loved etc. Or maybe person A is depressed and misinterpreting everything person B is doing to show love. This could be, in part, person A at fault and harming themselves by thinking it's all person B's fault. Whereas if they had an open honest, no blame or accusations, conversation they could learn how to love each other the way they want and solve the problem together. Or at the very least understand where each other is coming from.
					
					Edit: It's not person B's 'job' as a partner to make person A feel loved. That's not how relationships work. I've also seen many relationships where people are giving everything they can because they love the other person so much, but it's not enough for the other person or they don't feel it. This is generally a mismatch in love languages or its just how they grew up giving/recieving love so they don't know any differently or don't know how you want to be loved etc. 
					
					Like, personally, I'm someone who needs the most intense love and affection ever they have to like worship me and show me all the time 24/7 otherwise I don't feel loved. That's because I was loved on so much by my mother I expect my partners  to do the same otherwise it's not love to me. This is basically impossible for every partner I've been with until my husband. I'm self aware and realise this is kind of my fault for having such a high standard and capacity for love. My past partners have loved me and tried but it wasn't enough for me, that's in part my fault perhaps more than theirs. But I've also been with partners who were never properly loved by their parents (were never even hugged or never got told I love you) so didn't know how to love and were extremely stoic never expressing affection. People don't automatically know how to love people, they have to learn. And communication of feelings helps with that.

						>It's not person B's 'job' as a partner to make person A feel loved. That's not how relationships work.
						
						This is true, but I think it's worth expanding on a little bit.  I would argue that if you want your relationships to be successful, then you should care about your relationship partners' emotional experiences and you should care about trying to have a positive impact on that experience.  This includes doing things that the other person will interpret as love.
						
						The whole point of being in relationship with each other is to have a positive impact on each other's emotions.
						
						That said, there are obviously limits to what we are willing to do for each other.  For instance, I wouldn't murder somebody for a relationship partner, even if they said that it's the only way for them to feel loved.  That's an extreme example, but it establishes pretty clearly that there *are* limits.  Our job is to figure out what we are willing to do and what we are not willing to do for our partners, and to communicate our limits to our partners so that we can effectively determine our compatibility.
						
						All that said... I do think it is person B's job as a partner to take responsibility for their part of self-awareness and emotional communication, and then to fulfill their end of what they negotiate that they are willing to do for their partner to help them feel loved.

					>Implicit in "I don't feel loved" is that it's *Person B's fault.* Person A can feel however they want, but the moment they phrase it to Person B in this way, they're creating a truth where Person B has harmed Person A.
					
					(Ironically) I'm sorry you feel that way, but none of that is the case.
					
					The fault is only implicit if that is intended. "I don't feel loved" is an objective statement about your own feelings alone, not where that lack of loving feeling might be coming from. It might be that person A is painfully insecure, so no amount of affection could make them feel loved. Whereas, it might be that person B simply doesn't demonstrate their feelings openly enough which is what's causing it. But a self-contained objective statement about one's own feelings does not speak to the other's actions or intent. No truth is created unless you're actively looking to interpret it that way. 
					
					I wonder if your view comes from the fact that you've been on the receiving end of 'misuse' of this technique, and are now somewhat programmed to look for negative intent wherever you experience it?

					So you preface "I don't feel loved" with something else. For example - a plea to help me understand how you love me, while acknowledging that my feeling of not feeling loved, could be some communication differences or styles. Following that, a resolution or a request "I would be grateful if you could do XYZ so that I could feel loved."
					
					Something like this. 
					
					It's definitely important to communicate your feelings, because people are not mind readers. The other person cannot work with you to make you feel better, if they have no idea how you feel. And they won't have any idea about the negative emotions you feel, if you don't tell them. The alternative would be to not communicate at all, and let the resentment build. Or, if I get what you're saying (correct me if I'm wrong), to completely deny your own feelings and follow the societal standard of what is "right". This is obviously unworkable. Humans are not so malleable.  
					
					Obviously when you manipulate and abuse this style of communication it's not going to work. This only works when people have the right intentions, and are trying to make it work.
					
					Even if it doesn't work, then this means the people can't agree and hence are not compatible! So really, there is no issue with this style of communication, if used right. 
					
					Also, as others have pointed out, you can simultaneously acknowledge how the other person feels, and express how you yourself feel. You can also discuss how a person make the other person feels better. And if after discussion it is clear that the first mentioned person cannot do it for the other person, then part ways!

					only if you *want* to interpret it that way. 
					
					Person B could fully love them but be expressing it in ways that Person A doesn't notice. And since its a matter of communication, both sides are partly to blame.
					
					responding to "i dont feel loved" with "well i do love you, even if it doesnt come across" is not dismissive or accusative on either side (unless you *want* it to be), and is a much better way to talk about it than "you dont love me" and "yes i do".

					I disagree with this? It's a combination of B's actions and how A receives them. Working together to rectify A not feeling loved can involve steps from both parties.

					You're thinking about this in such a specific way that it's not productive to the conversation
					
					For instance: my fiance has done less going out with his buddies but has replaced some of that time by gaming with his buddies. He came to me the other day feeling a little down and said something along the lines of "I feel that I am neglecting you by gaming a few nights a week" 
					
					To which I responded "don't worry about it, we still get together time before and after gaming, plus when you don't go out with them, you don't spend money or stay out late. I like it this way" 
					
					In my situation, since my reaction to my fiance was positive, does that change how you feel about it? Your example is just a bit skewed. In your example, person B offers nothing to person A to reassure them, like I did with my fiance. If person B doesn't actually engage the conversation, then yes, it invalidates person As feelings. But invalidating person As feelings doesn't mean that person A stating how they feel is the problem. 
					
					Alternatively, if you think that "I feel" statements are garbage, what is the solution? Would it somehow be better for person A to attack person B by outright stating blame? 
					
					Person A: "you don't love me!" How should person B respond? How is doing it in an accusatory manner better? 
					
					The benefit of "I feel" statements is supposed to be that the person with the feeling (person A) is *not* placing blame by showing that they have a feeling, which they are responsible for, but want to convey that feeling to person B, and hopefully talk it out.

					I suspect that once you take a feeling for what it is and nothing more, you'll see that any added implications are optional. Let's assume both parties involved understand that feelings aren't facts. There are countless reasons why a person might not feel loved that don't have to be anyone's fault.
					
					In a situation like this, the ability to just take a statement at face value is essential. You can acknowledge a feeling without it being anything more than that.

					> Implicit in "I don't feel loved" is that it's Person B's fault.
					
					From personal experience, this is not actually true
					
					It is possible for someone to not feel loved because *they don't actually know what being loved feels like* - and they're confusing it with a more familiar feeling from a past relationship.
					
					e.g. Someone that has been emotionally abused may only feel loved when they are being treated like their past abuser treated them. Them saying "I don't feel loved" is an invitation to explore that (with their partner or with a therapist), and figure out what's missing, or what's askew in their understanding.
					
					Using "I feel..." statements can be useful, but only if both parties are committed to - first and foremost - understanding their partner. Otherwise, like any form of communication, misunderstandings, defensiveness and all sorts of chaos can follow.
					
					The reason for using "I feel..." is to help eliminate blamecasting, or projection. "I feel lonely." invites the question "Why do you feel lonely?" or "What could I do to help you feel less lonely?" instead of a defensive reaction. Similarly, "I don't feel loved" invites the question "What does feeling loved look like to you".
					
					One partner using "I feel..." is not nearly as useful as both partners using and understanding the reasons for them.

				* 🟪 **[1block](https://www.reddit.com/user/1block)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-04-04 10:49:48)_

					It might not be Person B's fault. It leaves the door open for another possibility. For instance, "love languages" vary. I show love by cuddling and touching. My wife feels loved by acts of service. If I show her love by trying to cuddle with her, she won't feel loved, even though I do love her. 
					
					"I feel like you don't love me" frames it around the idea that I actually don't love her. "I don't feel loved," leaves open the possibility that my feelings for her are real but I can express them in a way that communicates it better for her. And vice versa. That conversation would also probably lead to me telling her how to show love better towards me. 
					
					Or it could be that there's something in her past that keeps her from feeling love. We can talk about that. 
					
					The point is it is focused on her feelings, not my intentions or actions.

					Who says that it has to be anyone's fault? The dynamic you're describing is not what healthy communication looks like. 
					
					I think if you hear someone saying that they don't feel loved and immediately jump to thinking about who's to blame, there's a larger issue. A better response would be to ask what's got them feeling that way. There could be many reasons why someone might feel this way and not all of them are just "Person B's fault". 
					
					There is also the reality that to be in close relationship with another means that at times, you will cause some harm (ideally very small) to each other, even if you're really trying not to. It's unavoidable. In a healthy relationship harm should be infrequent, minimal, not repetitive, and heavily outweighed by the positive, but you can't avoid it altogether.

					I don't think so. The point of the "I" statement is that its better than "you don't love me."
					
					It allows the problem to be named - one person's emotions. That doesn't mean the other person is responsible for that first person's feeling. It doesn't solve the problem in the relationship but its a better way of communicating when the emotions are named honestly.

			If you are in couples counseling the point isn't for one person to be right or to win. It isn't supposed to be an argument. It is to resolve how the parties are feeling. If they say they don't feel loved the issue is not if you love them or not you know the answer to that and you say you do. The issue is that it is not being communicated correctly and how does that get communicated between you two. A failure to communicate doesn't automatically require it to be the other persons fault. Think about other times you have had misunderstandings in life in non-romantic situations to avoid too much emotion clouding things. You think they meant X but they meant Y. When John said get him a blue Gatorade you got him light blue but he wanted dark blue. The issue isn't that you are dumb and at fault it is that you both were talking about things differently so you need to clarify how you talk about the subject to avoid that confusion again. You learn that your default blues were different so once you are aware of that you can find the best way to resolve that issue going forward. Maybe you remember that their blue is light blue or maybe they say dark blue next time both are fine solutions.

			You mentioned gaslighting and abuse in your post, so that makes me think you've seen this exercise engaged in by people with disingenuous intentions. Because you seem to believe that Person A is lying when they say they don't feel loved.
			
			Assuming Person A truly is being honest when they say they don't feel loved, it's true that Person B is supposed to validate Person A's feelings. That's an essential part of empathy and making someone feel understood. So Person B is supposed to say, I hear you that you don't feel loved. They don't ascribe blame or a cause or a solution. They should be taking what Person A says at face value and acknowledging how they feel. Because we don't have control over our emotions. They are irrational, they are often not based on reality. They ellicit physical responses whether we like it or not. The only thing we can control is how to cope with them. 
			
			THEN brainstorming can happen to find a solution. Often the answer lies inside of the individual themselves who is experiencing the emotion. If Person A doesn't feel loved, is it because they have unresolved issues from childhood or false beliefs that don't serve them well? Do they need individual therapy to explore their own emotions? Are they able to properly express their needs and love language? Who else have they reached out to support for these emotions besides their partner - because feeling loved is not just about your romantic relationships. What can they do by themselves to make them more ready to understand the love languages that the people around them already use - eg. Does Person B say I love you all the time or does the dishes/acts of service to show love, but Person A is hoping for gifts instead and doesn't realize the dishes are an act of love? Should Person A be trying to fill that need from friendships or family instead of their romantic partner? And is Person A aware of how Person B wants to receive love?
			
			The point is not to argue or manipulate. It's to understand. Taking accountability for your own emotions is part and parcel. 
			
			If someone is a narcissist though, this all flies out the window and couples therapy is not productive, according to Lundy Bancroft (therapist of abusive men). There's no point in trying to teach empathy to an adult who fundamentally lacks it to begin with.

			I think what’s most important is that you look at the behavior that comes along with the statement.
			
			People with healthy boundaries can share feelings without the hidden agenda of trying to make someone do something or change themselves. People in unhealthy relationships will find ways to punish the other person if they don’t change.
			
			If someone tells me they feel something and it’s coupled with an accusation, or I think they’re trying to manipulate me, I’ll be very clear and say that I understand and I’m sorry my actions have caused them to feel x,y,z. But, I won’t own behavior or anything else they may be putting on me that I don’t think is accurate. And if the underlying intention is to ask me to change my behavior or boundaries, I’ll say no I can’t do that. And then, if it’s possible to find a compromise, I’ll insist on that.
			
			If you feel like someone is punishing you or you’re punishing someone else, then it becomes an unsafe situation and you or the other person would need to set stronger boundaries or walk away for their own health, which is completely acceptable.
			
			EDIT: you can try to tell someone you think their behavior is abusive, but most people don’t react well to that. sometimes it’s helpful and people will be able to see their behavior as inappropriate, but others will never see it. this is much more delicate and nuanced than using an “I feel” statement. I mean like you need more in your arsenal than just that to navigate an unsafe situation. Which is possible and lots of people do it who have loved ones with mental health issues.

			I think I see where you're coming from, but in terms of language meaning "I don't feel loved" =/= "I don't think you love me." Someone can affirm one or the other or both, so only affirming the first doesn't imply the second necessarily.
			
			So Person B can say: "I recognize you don't feel loved" *and* "I do love you" as it is possible for them to love person A without person A feeling loved. Person B is not committed to affirming something false when they acknowledge how person A feels.
			
			Someone might use "I don't feel loved" as a manipulative way to suggest someone doesn't love them, but it's not a given that this is the case. Generally therapy works when people are honestly committed to it, if someone is absolutely dedicated to being manipulative therapy will not help them which is why some people are practically speaking beyond (talk) therapeutic help. Most people will be manipulative *some* of the time but that can be worked through depending.
			
			Someone can not feel loved in spite of being loved because they don't interpret things as expressions of love even when they are. Maybe person B shows love by vocal affection but person A needs more physical, or vice versa. Love can get lost in translation when people have different standards for what count as expressions of love.

			Part of the problem is that the response shouldn't be denial. It should be a probing why A feels what they feel, and then why B feels what they feel. They should discuss what got them to this point, and any potential solutions.
			
			
			An abuser is going to abuse therapy speak regardless.
			
			
			But even in the situation of "You don't love me" versus "I don't feel loved" the former closes the door forever whereas the latter allows person B to lever it open with "why do you feel that way?".
			
			
			Both are a bombshell statement that should be taken as the more than likely end of the relationship. But at least the latter allows for some conversation.

			If one person does not feel loved in a relationship, then no, the other person cannot deny that and say "you're wrong." In this scenario, if the person B truly does love person A but person A doesn't feel loved, that's a problem that needs to be discussed. Can they learn how to express love in ways the other needs, and can they learn to hear the way their partner naturally expresses love?
			
			That's what the "I feel" statements (when done well) are exactly designed to get at. If person A feels unloved, that's a problem that needs to be addressed and the therapist is attempting to get the client to address that problem rather than assigning judgement and making accusations about if they actually love each other or not. When person A says "I don't feel loved" then person B has the choice to either reflect and realize maybe they don't love person A in the way person A wants or expects, or they can have a conversation about how they do love person A and try to understand why that isn't being communicated or felt.
			
			The feeling can't be refuted because it's real, it's not a judgment or accusation. (Again, if this is done well, which isn't always the case.)

			Your feelings are your emotional reaction to what you’re experiencing.
			
			Saying I feel you don’t love me, is a presupposition about another’s intent.
			
			I don’t feel loved. Is an expression of your personal experience in relation to another.
			
			The only way it’s manipulative, is if you do in fact feel loved and are lying about it.
			
			Person A not feeling loved doesn’t automatically conclude in person B being guilty of not loving person A.
			
			It simply lets person B know how their behaviour is being perceived and received by person A.
			
			None of this makes either party right or wrong. It’s simply getting to truths to have a conversation about where in the relationship things went wrong. This way repairs can occur if both parties want it.

			I don’t think your therapist has correctly taught the use of I feels. The main purpose is to identify an emotion, not a belief. Not being loved is a belief. Sad, scared, lonely, etc a feeling. A more effective communication would be “I feel sad when you do x because I believe you don’t love me.” That would identify the feeling and allow you name a behavior of a partner that is an issue. The partner in return can validate your feeling, understand the link between their behavior and your emotional response, explain anything you might be misinterpreting, adjust their behavior, etc

			"Loved/unloved" is not a feeling. It is a judgement of the other person's motivations. You're not supposed to express judgements while trying to disguise them as feelings. 
			
			Instead, you should express actual feelings such as, "I feel sad", "I feel anxious", or "I feel frustrated".
			
			Don't manipulatively use "I" language to express judgements while putting "I feel... " in front of them to make them appear to be feelings.
