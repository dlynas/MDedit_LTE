buried on page 15 in its 23 page "report", the UN's Pramila Patten admits that all her information comes directly from the Israeli regime, and that it blocks UN agencies with an actual investigative mandate from doing independent investigations into their propaganda claims

after claiming in the beginning she will "verify information", even though she has admitted before and it's in her official mandate that she has no investigative powers or abilities, she finally admits on page 20, near the very end, "yeah, we don't have an investigative mandate"

after admitting there's no evidence of rape in the videos and photos handed to them by the Israeli regime, she admits she has to rely solely on "positions of bodies and clothing", which she admits earlier Zaka hoaxers constantly moved around, and "testimonies" by the same hoaxers

this is amazing. Again buried late in the report, she admits the "testimonies" changed over time, and some of them now deny the claims they had made which were disseminated in the media. But she doesn't name them or the media (of course it's the NYT), or say if she relies on them

now this conclusion, buried late in the piece, directly contradicts the entire "mass rape" atrocity propaganda hoax fabricated by the New York Times' Jeffrey Gettleman, Adam Sella and Anat Schwartz, with their claim of a "systematic Hamas policy of rape". No one is quoting it

now here is what destroys the entire report, which again Pramila Patten admitted and it's in the official mandate has no investigative role or powers, and relied solely on Israeli regime propaganda. She says that one of the core claims by the regime proving "mass rape" is false:

the claim by the Israeli regime that they found instructions on bodies of Hamas fighters telling them to engage in systematic mass rape is still up on their government accounts. And Pramila Patten admits they fabricated this physical evidence. So it's over

Disturbing  On Nov 2, an Arabic-Hebrew transliteration glossary belonging to Hamas was discovered in Israel with sexual terminology, including “take your pants off.” This evidence suggests that Hamas terrorists planned to systematically rape Israeli women. This is a war

you admitted that the Israeli regime intentionally fabricated physical evidence and they gave it to you as evidence of systematic mass rape. You said it's fake. And you also admitted that your sole source of information was this very same regime. It's over. You have nothing

here again is Pramila Patten saying herself that she has no mandate to investigate, that's not her job, as she admits late in the report as well, while also directly contradicting the claim by the New York Times about clear proof of "systematic mass rape"

Quote



Replying to @zei\_squirrel

the amazing thing is, in the official UN press release announcing her mission and in her own prior statements, Pramila Patten said she has no investigative mandate or ability, yet the media class is saying "BREAKING, EXPERT UN TEAM DID EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND VINDICATED OUR HOAX"

now even though the report, which relies entirely on Israeli propaganda, testimonies from hoaxers, fabricated and contaminated "physical evidence", explicitly contradicts the NYT maximalist version of the hoax, they will still say it vindicates them

Quote



ahead of today's major Israeli propaganda laundering of the "mass rape" hoax via the UN's Pramila Patten, here's Gettleman, Sella and Schwartz admitting the regime is using her as a proxy, while blocking an actually independent UN agency with investigative authority and powers:
