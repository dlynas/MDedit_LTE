In a world where communication is often nuanced and layered with different meanings, a recent scientific review has shed light on an intriguing aspect of human interaction: sarcasm. The review, published in [_Current Opinion in Psychology_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352250X23001549), delves into the complex nature of sarcasm, exploring its potential to either clarify or confuse a speaker’s intentions.

The researchers embarked on this review to unravel the tightrope that sarcasm walks between being humorous and offensive. Their primary objective was to understand if sarcasm could be more than just a witty remark; specifically, they wanted to know if it helps or hinders the process of perspective-taking—the ability to see things from another person’s viewpoint.

“Sarcasm is used in a wide range of social interactions across cultures and over centuries. Many people enjoy it. I am interested in whether it actually helps communicate a speaker’s viewpoint and increase the recipients’ understanding,” explained lead author [Li Huang](https://www.insead.edu/faculty/li-huang), an associate professor of organizational behaviour at INSEAD.

Sarcasm, a form of verbal irony often used to express disapproval, has been a part of human communication for centuries, with its roots tracing back to the Bible and Ancient Greece. Despite its widespread use, the clarity it provides in understanding a speaker’s true intent remains a subject of debate.

The new review highlights two contrasting aspects: On one hand, sarcasm, by deviating from literal truthfulness, can create confusion and obscure the speaker’s perspective. On the other hand, it’s often quickly understood, even without vocal cues or the chance to re-read statements, suggesting it might enhance clarity.

The researchers point out several communicative and social functions of sarcasm, including criticism, amusement, and emotional control. Interestingly, the ‘tinge hypothesis’ suggests that sarcasm, by muting the intended meaning, makes criticisms appear less harsh, thereby maintaining politeness and preserving relationships.

Moreover, the review introduces the ‘SHARP’ model (Sarcasm Helps Activate Recipient Perspective-taking), proposing two mechanisms—deliberate processing and open-mindedness—through which sarcasm might enhance perspective-taking. Deliberate processing involves a cognitive effort to shift from one’s own viewpoint to consider another’s perspective. Sarcasm, by presenting a contrast between stated and intended meanings, may trigger this process.

The review also suggests that sarcasm could foster perspective-taking by promoting a form of open-mindedness rooted in relationship maintenance. It argues that when sarcasm alludes to a target’s beliefs or expectations, it may invite the recipient to reciprocate with their open-mindedness, enhancing their ability to see the world from the speaker’s viewpoint.

“The theoretical and empirical work in the last couple of decades indicate that, for a variety of reasons, sarcasm can provide the cognitive readiness and the motivational drive that enable recipients to see the world from the speaker’s viewpoint,” Huang told PsyPost.

“For example, sarcasm often involves a contradiction between its stated meaning and its intended meaning. Because it is more difficult to process than its literal equivalent, it can also be processed more deliberately by recipients, which helps them adjust away from their egocentric perspective, and better understand the speaker’s perspective. Additionally, because sarcasm often conveys disapproval, it can trigger guilt or embarrassment in recipients, which has also been shown to increase their ability to take others’ perspective.”

As an example, the researchers noted [a 2023 Ford commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddIwSkXqFU8) celebrating women’s history month.

Despite these findings, the review acknowledges that not all sarcasm is beneficial for perspective-taking. Factors such as the speaker’s tone, the recipient’s ability to decipher sarcasm, and the nature of their relationship play significant roles in determining the outcome. Overly critical sarcasm, for instance, can backfire, leading to close-mindedness rather than open-mindedness.

“Sarcasm is likely to decrease perspective taking under certain conditions as well,” Huang said. “For example, when sarcasm is overly critical of the recipients, it can induce anger (as opposed to guilt or embarrassment), which has been shown to decrease a person’s ability to see others’ viewpoint. Similarly, the recipient’s ability to decipher sarcasm can also determine whether they can benefit from its effect on perspective-taking.”

The researchers call for further studies to explore the conditions under which sarcasm most effectively promotes perspective-taking. They suggest examining recipient traits like guilt-proneness and aspects of the speaker-recipient relationship, such as mutual trust, to better understand the dynamic interplay of these factors.

The study, “[SHARP wit: Why receiving sarcasm improves perspective-taking](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2023.101709)“, was authored by Li Huang and Adam D. Galinsky.
