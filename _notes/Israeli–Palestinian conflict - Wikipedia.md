The conflict has its origins in the rise of [Zionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism "Zionism") in Europe and the [arrival of Jewish settlers to Ottoman Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah "Aliyah") in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<sup id="cite_ref-Benny_Morris_23-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Benny_Morris-23">[23]</a></sup> The local Arab population opposed Zionism, primarily out of fear of territorial displacement and dispossession.<sup id="cite_ref-Benny_Morris_23-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Benny_Morris-23">[23]</a></sup> The Zionist movement garnered the support of an imperial power in the 1917 [Balfour Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration "Balfour Declaration") issued by Britain, which promised to support the creation of a "[Jewish homeland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland_for_the_Jewish_people "Homeland for the Jewish people") in [Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region) "Palestine (region)")". Following the [British occupation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupied_Enemy_Territory_Administration "Occupied Enemy Territory Administration") of the formerly [Ottoman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") region during [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"), [Mandatory Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine "Mandatory Palestine") was established as a [British mandate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_for_Palestine "Mandate for Palestine"). Increasing Jewish immigration led to tensions between Jews and Arabs which grew into [intercommunal conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercommunal_conflict_in_Mandatory_Palestine "Intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine").<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> In 1936, [an Arab revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936%E2%80%931939_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine "1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine") erupted demanding independence, which the British suppressed.<sup id="cite_ref-Rashid_Khalidi4_26-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Rashid_Khalidi4-26">[26]</a></sup>

The 1947 [United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine "United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine") triggered the [1948 Palestine war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestine_war "1948 Palestine war"), which saw the [expulsion and flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion_and_flight "1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight") of most Palestinian Arabs, the establishment of [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel "Israel") on most of the Mandate's territory, and the control of the [Gaza Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Palestine_Protectorate "All-Palestine Protectorate") and the [West Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordanian_annexation_of_the_West_Bank "Jordanian annexation of the West Bank") by [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt "Egypt") and Jordan, respectively.<sup id="cite_ref-Ilan_Pappe3_27-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Ilan_Pappe3-27">[27]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Benny_Morris3_28-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Benny_Morris3-28">[28]</a></sup> In the 1967 [Six-Day War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War "Six-Day War"), Israel occupied the West Bank and the Gaza Strip (which became known as the [Palestinian territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories "Palestinian territories")), which is now considered to be the [longest military occupation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_occupations "List of military occupations") in modern history, and has [drawn international condemnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_Nations_resolutions_concerning_Israel "List of United Nations resolutions concerning Israel") for [violating the human rights of the Palestinians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_violations_against_Palestinians_by_Israel "Human rights violations against Palestinians by Israel").<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>

The conflict has claimed many civilian casualties, mostly Palestinian, since its [inception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict "Timeline of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict"). Various attempts have been made to resolve the conflict as part of the [Israeli–Palestinian peace process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_peace_process "Israeli–Palestinian peace process"), alongside efforts to resolve the broader [Arab–Israeli conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict "Arab–Israeli conflict").<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> Progress towards a negotiated solution between the [Israeli government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_government "Israeli government") and the [Palestine Liberation Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization "Palestine Liberation Organization") (PLO) was made with the [Oslo Accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords "Oslo Accords") of 1993–1995.

Palestinian [Arab-Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Christian "Arab Christian")\-owned newspaper [_Falastin_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falastin_(newspaper) "Falastin (newspaper)"), 18 June 1936, caricatured [Zionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism "Zionism") as a crocodile, protected by a British officer, telling Palestinian Arabs: "Don't be afraid! I will swallow you peacefully..."<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup>

The Israeli–Palestinian conflict began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the development of political Zionism and the arrival of Zionist settlers to Palestine.<sup id="cite_ref-Benny_Morris_23-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Benny_Morris-23">[23]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Nur_Masalha_44-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Nur_Masalha-44">[44]</a></sup> The modern political Zionist movement, with the goal of establishing a [Jewish state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_state "Jewish state") in [Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region) "Palestine (region)"), grew out of the last two decades of the 19th century, largely in response to [antisemitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism "Antisemitism") in Europe. While [Jewish colonization began during this period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Aliyah "First Aliyah"), it was not until the arrival of more [ideologically Zionist immigrants in the decade preceding the First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Aliyah "Second Aliyah") that the landscape of Ottoman Palestine would start to significantly change.<sup id="cite_ref-Ilan_Pappe2_45-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Ilan_Pappe2-45">[45]</a></sup> Land purchases, the eviction of tenant Arab peasants and armed confrontation with Jewish para-military units would all contribute to the Palestinian population's growing fear of territorial displacement and dispossession. This fear would gradually be replaced by a broader sense of Palestinian national expression which included the rejection of the Zionist goal of turning the mostly Arab populated land into a Jewish homeland.<sup id="cite_ref-Benny_Morris3_28-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Benny_Morris3-28">[28]</a></sup> From early on, the leadership of the Zionist movement had the idea of "transferring" (a euphemism for [ethnic cleansing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing "Ethnic cleansing")) the Arab Palestinian population out of the land for the purpose of establishing a Jewish demographic majority. The idea of transfer, Israeli historian [Benny Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Morris "Benny Morris") describes, was "inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism".<sup id="cite_ref-Benny_Morris2_46-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Benny_Morris2-46">[46]</a></sup> The Arab population felt this threat as early as the 1880s with the arrival of the first aliyah.<sup id="cite_ref-Benny_Morris3_28-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Benny_Morris3-28">[28]</a></sup>

[Chaim Weizmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Weizmann "Chaim Weizmann")'s efforts to build British support for the Zionist movement would eventually secure the [Balfour Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration "Balfour Declaration"), a public statement issued by the British government in 1917 during the First World War announcing support for the establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine.<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup> Weizmann would take on a maximalist interpretation of the declaration, in which negotiations on the future of the country were to happen directly between Britain and the Jews, excluding Arab representation. At the [Paris Peace Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference_(1919%E2%80%931920) "Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920)"), he would later famously share his interpretation of the declaration in his announcement of the goal "\[t\]o make Palestine as Jewish as England is English." Partially in response to the Zionist movement, a Palestinian national movement would develop more concretely in the interwar period. The years that followed would see Jewish-Palestinian relations deteriorate dramatically.<sup id="cite_ref-Avi_Shlaim_48-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Avi_Shlaim-48">[48]</a></sup>

The [Mandate for Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_for_Palestine "Mandate for Palestine"), which established British administrative rule over the territory, formally incorporated the Balfour Declaration into its wording, representing what [Laura Robson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Robson_(historian) "Laura Robson (historian)") has called the "colonial practice of territorializing sectarian identity" whereby the "designation "Jewish" would carry with it all sorts of political baggage totally absent from the prior experience of the many Jewish communities of the Arab Ottoman world and their Muslim and Christian compatriots".<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup>

### 1920s

With the commitment to establishing a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine, the creation of the British Mandate in Palestine after the end of the first world war would allow for large-scale Jewish immigration. This would be accompanied by the development of a separate Jewish controlled sector of the economy which was supported with large amounts of capital from abroad.<sup id="cite_ref-Rashid_Khalidi2_50-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Rashid_Khalidi2-50">[50]</a></sup> The more ardent Zionist ideologues of the [Second Aliyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Aliyah "Second Aliyah") would become the leaders of the [Yishuv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yishuv "Yishuv") starting in the 1920s and believed in the separation of Jewish and Arab economies and societies. During this period, the exclusionary nationalist ethos would grow to overpower the socialist ideals that the Second Aliyah had arrived with.<sup id="cite_ref-Benny_Morris_23-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Benny_Morris-23">[23]</a></sup>

The return of several hard-line Palestinian Arab nationalists, under the emerging leadership of [Haj Amin al-Husseini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haj_Amin_al-Husseini "Haj Amin al-Husseini"), from Damascus to [Mandatory Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine "Mandatory Palestine") marked the beginning of [Palestinian Arab nationalist struggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism "Palestinian nationalism") towards establishment of a national home for Arabs of [Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine "Mandatory Palestine").<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> Amin al-Husseini, the architect of the Palestinian Arab national movement, immediately marked [Jewish national movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism "Zionism") and [Jewish immigration to Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah "Aliyah") as the sole enemy to his cause,<sup id="cite_ref-al-Husseini_52-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-al-Husseini-52">[52]</a></sup> initiating large-scale riots against the Jews as early as 1920 [in Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920_Nebi_Musa_riots "1920 Nebi Musa riots") and in 1921 [in Jaffa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa_riots "Jaffa riots"). Among the results of the violence was the establishment of the Jewish paramilitary force [Haganah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah "Haganah"). In 1929, a series of violent [riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Palestine_riots "1929 Palestine riots") resulted in the deaths of 133 Jews and 116 Arabs, with significant Jewish casualties in [Hebron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Hebron_massacre "1929 Hebron massacre") and [Safed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Palestine_riots#Safed_massacre,_29_August "1929 Palestine riots"), and the evacuation of Jews from Hebron and Gaza.<sup id="cite_ref-SelaConflict_53-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-SelaConflict-53">[53]</a></sup>

### 1936–1939 Arab revolt

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Resistance_of_Palestinian_men_and_women.png/220px-Resistance_of_Palestinian_men_and_women.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Resistance_of_Palestinian_men_and_women.png)

The [Arab revolt of 1936–1939](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936%E2%80%9339_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine "1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine") in Palestine, motivated by opposition to mass [Jewish immigration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah "Aliyah") allowed by the British Mandate.

In the early 1930s, the Arab national struggle in Palestine had drawn many Arab nationalist militants from across the Middle East, such as [Sheikh Izaddin al-Qassam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam "Izz ad-Din al-Qassam") from Syria, who established the Black Hand militant group and had prepared the grounds for the [1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936%E2%80%931939_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine "1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine"). Following the death of al-Qassam at the hands of the British in late 1935, tensions erupted in 1936 into the Arab general strike and general boycott. The strike soon deteriorated into violence, and the Arab revolt was bloodily repressed by the British assisted by the British armed forces of the [Jewish Settlement Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Settlement_Police "Jewish Settlement Police"), the [Jewish Supernumerary Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Supernumerary_Police "Jewish Supernumerary Police"), and [Special Night Squads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Night_Squads "Special Night Squads").<sup id="cite_ref-HistoryPBS_54-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-HistoryPBS-54">[54]</a></sup> The suppression of the revolt would leave at least 14% of the adult male population killed, wounded, imprisoned or exiled.<sup id="cite_ref-Rashid_Khalidi3_55-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Rashid_Khalidi3-55">[55]</a></sup> In the first wave of organized violence, lasting until early 1937, most of the Arab groups were defeated by the British, and forced expulsion of much of the Arab leadership ensued. With much of the leadership in exile and the economy severely weakened, the Palestinians would struggle to confront the Zionist movement which was growing in strength, with the support of the British.<sup id="cite_ref-Rashid_Khalidi3_55-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Rashid_Khalidi3-55">[55]</a></sup>

The cost and risks associated with the revolt and the ongoing [inter-communal conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercommunal_conflict_in_Mandatory_Palestine "Intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine") led to a shift in British policies in the region and the appointment of the [Peel Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peel_Commission "Peel Commission") which recommended the partitioning of Palestine.<sup id="cite_ref-Rashid_Khalidi3_55-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Rashid_Khalidi3-55">[55]</a></sup> The two main Jewish leaders, [Chaim Weizmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Weizmann "Chaim Weizmann") and [David Ben-Gurion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ben-Gurion "David Ben-Gurion"), accepted the recommendations on the basis that it would allow for further expansion, but some secondary Jewish leaders disapproved of it.<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> The subsequent publication of the [White Paper of 1939](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Paper_of_1939 "White Paper of 1939"), which sought to limit Jewish immigration to the region, was the breaking point in relations between British authorities and the Zionist movement.<sup id="cite_ref-Avi_Shlaim2_59-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Avi_Shlaim2-59">[59]</a></sup>

The renewed violence, which continued sporadically until the beginning of World War II, ended with around 5,000 causualties on the Arab side and 700 combined on the British and Jewish side total.<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-61"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup> With the eruption of [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), the situation in Mandatory Palestine calmed down. It allowed a shift towards a more moderate stance among Palestinian Arabs under the leadership of the Nashashibi clan and even the establishment of the Jewish–Arab [Palestine Regiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Regiment "Palestine Regiment") under British command, fighting Germans in North Africa. The more radical exiled faction of al-Husseini, however, tended to cooperate with Nazi Germany, and participated in the establishment of a pro-Nazi propaganda machine throughout the Arab world. The defeat of Arab nationalists in Iraq and subsequent relocation of al-Husseini to Nazi-occupied Europe tied his hands regarding field operations in Palestine, though he regularly demanded that the Italians and the Germans [bomb Tel Aviv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_bombing_of_Mandatory_Palestine_in_World_War_II "Italian bombing of Mandatory Palestine in World War II"). By the end of World War II, a crisis over the fate of [Holocaust survivors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_survivors "Holocaust survivors") from Europe led to renewed tensions between the [Yishuv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yishuv "Yishuv") and Mandate authorities. Increased illegal immigration from Jewish refugees, along with a [paramilitary campaign of resistance against British authorities by Zionist militias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_insurgency_in_Mandatory_Palestine "Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine"), would effectively overturn the White Paper and eventually lead to the withdrawal of the British.<sup id="cite_ref-Rashid_Khalidi3_55-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Rashid_Khalidi3-55">[55]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-SelaConflict_53-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-SelaConflict-53">[53]</a></sup>

On the Jewish side, the civil war was managed by the major underground militias – the [Haganah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah "Haganah"), [Irgun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irgun "Irgun") and [Lehi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehi_(group) "Lehi (group)") – strengthened by numerous Jewish veterans of World War II and foreign volunteers. By spring 1948, it was already clear that the Arab forces were nearing a total collapse, while Yishuv forces gained more and more territory, creating a large scale [refugee problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_exodus "1948 Palestinian exodus") of Palestinian Arabs.<sup id="cite_ref-SelaConflict_53-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-SelaConflict-53">[53]</a></sup>

### 1948 Arab–Israeli War

Land in the lighter shade represents territory within the [borders of Israel at the conclusion of the 1948 war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Line_(Israel) "Green Line (Israel)"). This land is internationally recognized as belonging to Israel.

Following the [Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Establishment_of_the_State_of_Israel "Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel") on 14 May 1948, the Arab League decided to intervene on behalf of Palestinian Arabs, marching their forces into former British Palestine, beginning the main phase of the [1948 Arab–Israeli War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War "1948 Arab–Israeli War").<sup id="cite_ref-Baum_64-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Baum-64">[64]</a></sup> The overall fighting, leading to around 15,000 casualties, resulted in cease-fire and armistice agreements of 1949, with Israel holding much of the former Mandate territory, Jordan occupying and later annexing the [West Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordanian_annexation_of_the_West_Bank "Jordanian annexation of the West Bank") and Egypt taking over the Gaza Strip, where the [All-Palestine Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Palestine_Government "All-Palestine Government") was declared by the Arab League on 22 September 1948.<sup id="cite_ref-HistoryPBS_54-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-HistoryPBS-54">[54]</a></sup>

### 1956 Suez Crisis

Through the 1950s, Jordan and Egypt supported the [Palestinian Fedayeen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Fedayeen "Palestinian Fedayeen") militants' cross-border attacks into Israel, while Israel carried out [its own reprisal operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprisal_operations "Reprisal operations") in the host countries. The 1956 [Suez Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Crisis "Suez Crisis") resulted in a short-term Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and exile of the [All-Palestine Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Palestine_Government "All-Palestine Government"), which was later restored with Israeli withdrawal. The All-Palestine Government was completely abandoned by Egypt in 1959 and was officially merged into the [United Arab Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Republic "United Arab Republic"), to the detriment of the Palestinian national movement. [Gaza Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_occupation_of_the_Gaza_Strip "Egyptian occupation of the Gaza Strip") then was put under the authority of the Egyptian military administrator, making it a de facto military occupation. In 1964, however, a new organization, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), was established by Yasser Arafat.<sup id="cite_ref-Baum_64-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Baum-64">[64]</a></sup> It immediately won the support of most Arab League governments and was granted a seat in the [Arab League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League "Arab League").

### 1967 Six-Day War

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/6DayWarEnglish.png/170px-6DayWarEnglish.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:6DayWarEnglish.png)

During the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel captured the [West Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank "West Bank"), the [Gaza Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip"), the [Golan Heights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights "Golan Heights") and the [Sinai Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinai_Peninsula "Sinai Peninsula"). Each of these territories except the Sinai remain under [Israeli occupation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories "Israeli-occupied territories").

The 1967 [Six-Day War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War "Six-Day War") exerted a significant effect upon Palestinian nationalism, as Israel gained military control of the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt. Consequently, the PLO was unable to establish any control on the ground and established its headquarters in Jordan, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and supported the Jordanian army during the [War of Attrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_Attrition "War of Attrition"), which included the [Battle of Karameh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Karameh "Battle of Karameh"). However, the Palestinian base in Jordan collapsed with the [Jordanian–Palestinian civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September_in_Jordan "Black September in Jordan") in 1970. The PLO defeat by the Jordanians caused most of the Palestinian militants to relocate to South Lebanon, where they soon took over large areas, creating the so-called "Fatahland".

### 1973 Yom Kippur War

On October 6, 1973, a coalition of Arab forces consisting of mainly Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack against Israel on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur. Egyptian and Syria had crossed over the ceasefire lines that were agreed upon prior to 1973. Egypt had in particular tried to reoccupy much of the area surrounding the Suez Canal, whilst the frontline with Syria was mainly situated around the north in the Golan Heights. The war concluded with an Israeli victory, with both sides suffering tremendous casualties.

### 1982 Lebanon War

[Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_insurgency_in_South_Lebanon "Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon") peaked in the early 1970s, as Lebanon was used as a base to launch attacks on northern Israel and airplane hijacking campaigns worldwide, which drew Israeli retaliation. During the [Lebanese Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Civil_War "Lebanese Civil War"), Palestinian militants continued to launch attacks against Israel while also battling opponents within Lebanon. In 1978, the [Coastal Road massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_Road_massacre "Coastal Road massacre") led to the Israeli full-scale invasion known as [Operation Litani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Litani "Operation Litani"). Israeli forces, however, quickly withdrew from Lebanon, and the attacks against Israel resumed. In 1982, following an assassination attempt on one of its diplomats by Palestinians, the Israeli government decided to take sides in the Lebanese Civil War and the [1982 Lebanon War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_Lebanon_War "1982 Lebanon War") commenced. The initial results for Israel were successful. Most Palestinian militants were defeated within several weeks, Beirut was captured, and the PLO headquarters were evacuated to Tunisia in June by Yasser Arafat's decision.<sup id="cite_ref-HistoryPBS_54-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-HistoryPBS-54">[54]</a></sup>

### First Intifada (1987–1993)

The first Palestinian uprising began in 1987 as a response to escalating attacks and the endless occupation. By the early 1990s, international efforts to settle the conflict had begun, in light of the success of the Egyptian–Israeli peace treaty of 1982. Eventually, the [Israeli–Palestinian peace process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_peace_process "Israeli–Palestinian peace process") led to the [Oslo Accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords "Oslo Accords") of 1993, allowing the PLO to relocate from Tunisia and take ground in the [West Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank "West Bank") and [Gaza Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip"), establishing the [Palestinian National Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority "Palestinian National Authority"). The peace process also had significant opposition among radical Islamic elements of Palestinian society, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, who immediately initiated a campaign of attacks targeting Israelis. Following hundreds of casualties and a wave of radical anti-government propaganda, Israeli Prime Minister [Rabin was assassinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Yitzhak_Rabin "Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin") by an [Israeli far-right extremist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics_in_Israel "Far-right politics in Israel") who objected to the peace initiative. This struck a serious blow to the peace process, from which the newly elected government of Israel in 1996 backed off.<sup id="cite_ref-SelaConflict_53-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-SelaConflict-53">[53]</a></sup>

In 2005, Israeli Prime Minister Sharon ordered the [removal of Israeli settlers and soldiers from Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_disengagement_from_Gaza "Israeli disengagement from Gaza").

### Fatah–Hamas split (2006–2007)

In 2006, Hamas won a plurality of 44% in the [Palestinian parliamentary election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Palestinian_legislative_election "2006 Palestinian legislative election"). Israel responded it would begin [economic sanctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_economic_sanctions_against_the_Palestinian_National_Authority "2006–07 economic sanctions against the Palestinian National Authority") unless Hamas agreed to accept prior Israeli–Palestinian agreements, forswear violence, and recognize Israel's right to exist, all of which Hamas rejected.<sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> After internal Palestinian political struggle between Fatah and Hamas erupted into the [Battle of Gaza (2007)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gaza_(2007) "Battle of Gaza (2007)"), Hamas took full control of the area.<sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup> In 2007, Israel imposed a naval [blockade on the Gaza Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip "Blockade of the Gaza Strip"), and cooperation with Egypt allowed a ground blockade of the Egyptian border.

The tensions between Israel and Hamas escalated until late 2008, when Israel launched operation [Cast Lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_Lead "Cast Lead") upon Gaza, resulting in thousands of civilian casualties and billions of dollars in damage. By February 2009, a ceasefire was signed with international mediation between the parties, though the occupation and small and sporadic eruptions of violence continued.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

## Peace process

### Oslo Accords (1993, 1995)

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Israel_and_Palestine_Peace.svg/220px-Israel_and_Palestine_Peace.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Israel_and_Palestine_Peace.svg)

A [peace movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_movement "Peace movement") poster: [Israeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Israel "Flag of Israel") and [Palestinian flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_flag "Palestinian flag") and the word _peace_ in [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language") and [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language").

In 1993, Israeli officials led by [Yitzhak Rabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Rabin "Yitzhak Rabin") and Palestinian leaders from the [Palestine Liberation Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization "Palestine Liberation Organization") led by [Yasser Arafat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasser_Arafat "Yasser Arafat") strove to find a peaceful solution through what became known as the Oslo peace process. A crucial milestone in this process was Arafat's letter of recognition of Israel's right to exist. In 1993, the Oslo Accords were finalized as a framework for future Israeli–Palestinian relations. The crux of the Oslo agreement was that Israel would gradually cede control of the Palestinian territories over to the Palestinians in exchange for peace. The Oslo process was delicate and progressed in fits and starts. The process took a turning point at the [assassination of Yitzhak Rabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Yitzhak_Rabin "Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin") in November 1995 and finally unraveled when Arafat and [Ehud Barak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehud_Barak "Ehud Barak") failed to reach an agreement at Camp David in July 2000. [Robert Malley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Malley "Robert Malley"), special assistant to US President [Bill Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton "Bill Clinton") for Arab–Israeli Affairs, has confirmed that while Barak made no formal written offer to Arafat, the US did present concepts for peace which were considered by the Israeli side yet left unanswered by Arafat: "the Palestinians' principal failing is that from the beginning of the Camp David summit onward they were unable either to say yes to the American ideas or to present a cogent and specific counterproposal of their own".<sup id="cite_ref-96"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup> Consequently, there are different accounts of the proposals considered.<sup id="cite_ref-97"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-98"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-99"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-99">[99]</a></sup>

[Yitzhak Rabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Rabin "Yitzhak Rabin"), [Bill Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton "Bill Clinton"), and [Yasser Arafat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasser_Arafat "Yasser Arafat") during the Oslo Accords on 13 September 1993.

In July 2000, US President Bill Clinton convened a peace summit between Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Barak reportedly put forward the following as "bases for negotiation", via the US to the Palestinian President: a non-militarized Palestinian state split into 3–4 parts containing 87–92%.<sup id="cite_ref-100"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-100">[A]</a></sup> Thus, an Israeli offer of 91 percent (of 5,538 km<sup>2</sup> of the West Bank translates into only 86 percent from the Palestinian perspective<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPressman200316–17_101-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPressman200316%E2%80%9317-101">[100]</a></sup> of the West Bank including only parts of East Jerusalem, and the entire Gaza Strip,<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh_102-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Karsh-102">[101]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-103"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-103">[102]</a></sup> as well as a stipulation that 69 Jewish settlements (which comprise 85% of the West Bank's Jewish settlers) would be ceded to Israel, no right of return to Israel, no sovereignty over the Temple Mount or any core East Jerusalem neighbourhoods, and continued Israel control over the Jordan Valley.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPressman20037,_15–19_104-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPressman20037,_15%E2%80%9319-104">[103]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-nybooks.com_105-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-nybooks.com-105">[104]</a></sup>

Arafat rejected this offer.<sup id="cite_ref-Karsh_102-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Karsh-102">[101]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-106"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-106">[105]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-107"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-107">[106]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-108"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-108">[107]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-109"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-109">[108]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-110"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-110">[109]</a></sup> According to the Palestinian negotiators the offer did not remove many of the elements of the Israeli occupation regarding land, security, settlements, and Jerusalem.<sup id="cite_ref-JPressman_111-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-JPressman-111">[110]</a></sup> President Clinton reportedly requested that Arafat make a counter-offer, but he proposed none. Former Israeli Foreign Minister [Shlomo Ben-Ami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Ben-Ami "Shlomo Ben-Ami") who kept a diary of the negotiations said in an interview in 2001, when asked whether the Palestinians made a counterproposal: "No. And that is the heart of the matter. Never, in the negotiations between us and the Palestinians, was there a Palestinian counterproposal."<sup id="cite_ref-112"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-112">[111]</a></sup> In a separate interview in 2006 Ben Ami stated that were he a Palestinian he would have rejected the Camp David offer.<sup id="cite_ref-SBADN_113-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-SBADN-113">[112]</a></sup>

No tenable solution was crafted which would satisfy both Israeli and Palestinian demands, even under intense US pressure. Clinton has long blamed Arafat for the collapse of the summit.<sup id="cite_ref-114"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-114">[113]</a></sup> In the months following the summit, Clinton appointed former US Senator [George J. Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_J._Mitchell "George J. Mitchell") to lead a fact-finding committee aiming to identify strategies for restoring the peace process. The [committee's findings were published in 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Report_(Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict) "Mitchell Report (Arab–Israeli conflict)") with the dismantlement of existing Israeli settlements and Palestinian crackdown on militant activity being one strategy.<sup id="cite_ref-115"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-115">[114]</a></sup>

### Developments following Camp David

[Israeli West Bank barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier "Israeli West Bank barrier") in [Bethlehem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem "Bethlehem")

Following the failed summit Palestinian and Israeli negotiators continued to meet in small groups through August and September 2000 to try to bridge the gaps between their respective positions. The United States prepared its own plan to resolve the outstanding issues. Clinton's presentation of the US proposals was delayed by the advent of the [Second Intifada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada "Second Intifada") at the end of September.<sup id="cite_ref-JPressman_111-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-JPressman-111">[110]</a></sup>

Clinton's plan, eventually presented on 23 December 2000, proposed the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state in the Gaza strip and 94–96 percent of the West Bank plus the equivalent of 1–3 percent of the West Bank in land swaps from pre-1967 Israel. On Jerusalem, the plan stated that "the general principle is that Arab areas are Palestinian and that Jewish areas are Israeli." The holy sites were to be split on the basis that Palestinians would have sovereignty over the Temple Mount/Noble sanctuary, while the Israelis would have sovereignty over the Western Wall. On refugees the plan suggested a number of proposals including financial compensation, the right of return to the Palestinian state, and Israeli acknowledgment of suffering caused to the Palestinians in 1948. Security proposals referred to a "non-militarized" Palestinian state, and an international force for border security. Both sides accepted Clinton's plan<sup id="cite_ref-JPressman_111-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-JPressman-111">[110]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-USEmbassy_116-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-USEmbassy-116">[115]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-NYTsCP_117-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-NYTsCP-117">[116]</a></sup> and it became the basis for the negotiations at the Taba Peace summit the following January.<sup id="cite_ref-JPressman_111-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-JPressman-111">[110]</a></sup>

### Taba Summit (2001)

The Israeli negotiation team presented a new map at the [Taba Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taba_Summit "Taba Summit") in [Taba, Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taba_(Egypt) "Taba (Egypt)"), in January 2001. The proposition removed the "temporarily Israeli controlled" areas, and the Palestinian side accepted this as a basis for further negotiation. With Israeli elections looming the talks ended without an agreement but the two sides issued a joint statement attesting to the progress they had made: "The sides declare that they have never been closer to reaching an agreement and it is thus our shared belief that the remaining gaps could be bridged with the resumption of negotiations following the Israeli elections." The following month the [Likud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likud "Likud") party candidate [Ariel Sharon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Sharon "Ariel Sharon") defeated Ehud Barak in the Israeli elections and was elected as Israeli prime minister on 7 February 2001. Sharon's new government chose not to resume the high-level talks.<sup id="cite_ref-JPressman_111-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-JPressman-111">[110]</a></sup>

This plan did not attempt to resolve difficult questions such as the fate of Jerusalem or Israeli settlements, but left that to be negotiated in later phases of the process. The proposal never made it beyond the first phase, whose goals called for a halt to both Israeli settlement construction and Israeli–Palestinian violence. Neither goal has been achieved as of November 2015.<sup id="cite_ref-118"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-118">[117]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-119"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-119">[118]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-120"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-120">[119]</a></sup>

### Arab Peace Initiative (2002, 2007, 2017)

The Arab Peace Initiative ([Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): مبادرة السلام العربية _Mubādirat as-Salām al-ʿArabīyyah_), also known as the Saudi Initiative, was first proposed by Crown Prince [Abdullah of Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_of_Saudi_Arabia "Abdullah of Saudi Arabia") at the [Beirut Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut_Summit "Beirut Summit") (2002). The peace initiative is a proposed solution to the Arab–Israeli conflict as a whole, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in particular.<sup id="cite_ref-121"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-121">[120]</a></sup> The initiative was initially published on 28 March 2002, at the Beirut Summit, and agreed upon again in 2007 in the [Riyadh Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Arab_League_Summit "2007 Arab League Summit").

In a report published in February 2014 covering incidents over the three-year period of 2011–2013, [Amnesty International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International "Amnesty International") asserted that Israeli forces employed reckless violence in the West Bank, and in some instances appeared to engage in wilful killings which would be tantamount to [war crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_of_war_crimes_against_Israel "Allegations of war crimes against Israel"). Besides the numerous fatalities, Amnesty said at least 261 Palestinians, including 67 children, had been gravely injured by Israeli use of live ammunition. In this same period, 45 Palestinians, including 6 children had been killed. Amnesty's review of 25 civilians deaths concluded that in no case was there evidence of the Palestinians posing an imminent threat. At the same time, over 8,000 Palestinians suffered serious injuries from other means, including rubber-coated metal bullets. Only one IDF soldier was convicted, killing a Palestinian attempting to enter Israel illegally. The soldier was demoted and given a 1-year sentence with a five-month suspension. The IDF answered the charges stating that its army held itself "to the highest of professional standards", adding that when there was suspicion of wrongdoing, it investigated and took action "where appropriate".<sup id="cite_ref-145"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-145">[144]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-146"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-146">[145]</a></sup>

## Issues in dispute

The following outlined positions are the official positions of the two parties; however, it is important to note that neither side holds a single position. Both the Israeli and Palestinian sides include both moderate and [extremist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism "Extremism") bodies as well as [dovish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_dove "Political dove") and [hawkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Hawk "War Hawk") bodies.

One of the primary obstacles to resolving the conflict is a deep-set and growing distrust between its participants. Unilateral strategies and the rhetoric of hardline political factions, coupled with violence and incitements by civilians against one another, have fostered mutual embitterment and hostility and a loss of faith in the peace process. Support among Palestinians for [Hamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas "Hamas") is considerable, and as its members consistently call for the destruction of Israel and [violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_political_violence "Palestinian political violence") remains a threat,<sup id="cite_ref-170"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-170">[169]</a></sup> [security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#Israeli_security_concerns) becomes a prime concern for many Israelis. The expansion of [Israeli settlements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement "Israeli settlement") in the West Bank has led the majority of Palestinians to believe that Israel is not committed to reaching an agreement, but rather to a pursuit of establishing permanent control over this territory in order to provide that security.<sup id="cite_ref-171"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-171">[170]</a></sup>

The control of Jerusalem is a particularly delicate issue, with each side asserting claims over the city. The three largest [Abrahamic religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic_religions "Abrahamic religions")—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—hold Jerusalem as an important setting for their religious and historical narratives. Jerusalem is the holiest city for Judaism, being the former location of the Jewish temples on the [Temple Mount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Mount "Temple Mount") and the capital of the ancient Israelite kingdom. For Muslims, Jerusalem is the third holiest site, being the location of Isra and Mi'raj event, and the [Al-Aqsa Mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Mosque "Al-Aqsa Mosque"). For Christians, Jerusalem is the site of [Jesus' crucifixion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus "Crucifixion of Jesus") and the [Church of the Holy Sepulchre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Holy_Sepulchre "Church of the Holy Sepulchre").

The Israeli government, including the [Knesset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset "Knesset") and [Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Israel "Supreme Court of Israel"), is located in the "new city" of West Jerusalem and has been since Israel's founding in 1948. After Israel captured the Jordanian-controlled East Jerusalem in the Six-Day War, it assumed complete administrative control of East Jerusalem. In 1980, Israel passed the [Jerusalem Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Law "Jerusalem Law") declaring "Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of Israel."<sup id="cite_ref-kbl_172-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-kbl-172">[171]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS" title="Wikipedia:NOTRS"><span title="This claim needs references to better sources.

At the Camp David and Taba Summits in 2000–2001, the United States proposed a plan in which the Arab parts of Jerusalem would be given to the proposed Palestinian state while the Jewish parts of Jerusalem were given to Israel.

Both sides accepted the proposal in principle, but the summits ultimately failed.<sup id="cite_ref-SelaJerusalem_177-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-SelaJerusalem-177">[176]</a></sup>

Palestinian refugees are people who lost both their homes and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli conflict<sup id="cite_ref-Efrat_183-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Efrat-183">[182]</a></sup> and the 1967 [Six-Day War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War "Six-Day War").<sup id="cite_ref-PD_184-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-PD-184">[183]</a></sup> The number of Palestinians who fled or were expelled from Israel following its creation was estimated at 711,000 in 1949.<sup id="cite_ref-d_185-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-d-185">[184]</a></sup> Descendants of these original Palestinian Refugees are also eligible for registration and services provided by the [United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Relief_and_Works_Agency_for_Palestine_Refugees_in_the_Near_East "United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East") (UNRWA), and as of 2010 number 4.7 million people.<sup id="cite_ref-186"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-186">[185]</a></sup> Between 350,000 and 400,000 Palestinians were displaced during the 1967 Arab–Israeli war.<sup id="cite_ref-PD_184-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-PD-184">[183]</a></sup> A third of the refugees live in recognized refugee camps in [Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan "Jordan"), Lebanon, [Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria "Syria"), the [West Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank "West Bank") and the [Gaza Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip").

Most of these people were born outside Israel, but are descendants of original Palestinian refugees.<sup id="cite_ref-Efrat_183-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Efrat-183">[182]</a></sup> Palestinian negotiators, such as [Yasser Arafat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasser_Arafat "Yasser Arafat"), have so far publicly insisted that refugees have a right to return to the places where they lived before 1948 and 1967, including those within the [1949 Armistice lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1949_Armistice_lines "1949 Armistice lines"), citing the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights "Universal Declaration of Human Rights") and [UN General Assembly Resolution 194](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_General_Assembly_Resolution_194 "UN General Assembly Resolution 194") as evidence. However, according to reports of private peace negotiations with Israel they have countenanced the return of only 10,000 refugees and their families to Israel as part of a peace settlement. [Mahmoud Abbas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Abbas "Mahmoud Abbas"), the current Chairman of the [Palestine Liberation Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization "Palestine Liberation Organization") was reported to have said in private discussion that it is "illogical to ask Israel to take 5 million, or indeed 1 million. That would mean the end of Israel."<sup id="cite_ref-187"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-187">[186]</a></sup> In a further interview Abbas stated that he no longer had an automatic right to return to Safed in the northern Galilee where he was born in 1935. He later clarified that the remark was his personal opinion and not official policy.<sup id="cite_ref-Ind_188-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Ind-188">[187]</a></sup>

Palestinian and international authors have justified the right of return of the Palestinian refugees on several grounds:<sup id="cite_ref-189"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-189">[188]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-190"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-190">[189]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-191"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-191">[190]</a></sup> Several scholars included in the broader [New Historians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Historians "New Historians") argue that the Palestinian refugees fled or were chased out or expelled by the actions of the [Haganah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah "Haganah"), [Lehi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehi_(group) "Lehi (group)") and [Irgun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irgun "Irgun"), Zionist paramilitary groups.<sup id="cite_ref-192"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-192">[191]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-193"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-193">[192]</a></sup> A number have also characterized this as an ethnic cleansing.<sup id="cite_ref-194"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-194">[193]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-195"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-195">[194]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-196"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-196">[195]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-197"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-197">[196]</a></sup> The [New Historians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Historians "New Historians") cite indications of Arab leaders' desire for the Palestinian Arab population to stay put.<sup id="cite_ref-198"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-198">[197]</a></sup>

The Israeli [Law of Return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Return "Law of Return") that grants citizenship to people of Jewish descent is viewed by critics as discriminatory against other ethnic groups, especially Palestinians that cannot apply for such citizenship under the law of return, to the territory which they were expelled from or fled during the course of the 1948 war.<sup id="cite_ref-TH-P_199-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-TH-P-199">[198]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-YS_200-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-YS-200">[199]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-AK_201-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-AK-201">[200]</a></sup>

According to the [UN Resolution 194](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_194 "United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194"), adopted in 1948, "the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property which, under principles of international law or in equity, should be made good by the Governments or authorities responsible."<sup id="cite_ref-202"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-202">[201]</a></sup> [UN Resolution 3236](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_3236 "United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3236") "reaffirms also the inalienable right of the Palestinians to return to their homes and property from which they have been displaced and uprooted, and calls for their return".<sup id="cite_ref-203"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-203">[202]</a></sup> [Resolution 242 from the UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_242 "United Nations Security Council Resolution 242") affirms the necessity for "achieving a just settlement of the refugee problem"; however, Resolution 242 does not specify that the "just settlement" must or should be in the form of a literal Palestinian right of return.<sup id="cite_ref-204"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-204">[203]</a></sup>

The most common arguments for opposition are:

1.  On the 18 August 1948, at the [United Nations Security Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council "United Nations Security Council"), Israel declared that it is not reasonable to contemplate a return of the refugees as the Arab League and the Arab High Committee have announced their intentions to continue their [war of aggression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_aggression "War of aggression") and resume hostilities, noting that the state of war has not been lifted and that no peace treaty has been signed. However, Israel accepted the next year the return of some of the refugees, notably through the annexation of the Gaza Strip or by absorbing 100.000 of them in exchange of a peace treaty. The Arab countries refused the proposal, demanding a complete return.<sup id="cite_ref-205"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-205">[204]</a></sup>
2.  The Palestinian refugee issue is handled by a separate authority from that handling other refugees, that is, by [UNRWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA "UNRWA") and not the [UNHCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR "UNHCR"). Most of the people recognizing themselves as Palestinian refugees would have otherwise been assimilated into their country of current residency, and would not maintain their refugee state if not for the separate entities.<sup id="cite_ref-206"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-206">[205]</a></sup>
3.  Concerning the origin of the Palestinian refugees, the Israeli government said that during the 1948 War the [Arab Higher Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Higher_Committee "Arab Higher Committee") and the Arab states encouraged Palestinians to flee in order to make it easier to rout the Jewish state or that they did so to escape the fights by fear.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (January 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The Palestinian narrative is that refugees were largely expelled and dispossessed by Jewish militias and by the [Israeli army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces "Israel Defense Forces").

Historians still debate the [causes of the 1948 Palestinian exodus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_1948_Palestinian_exodus "Causes of the 1948 Palestinian exodus"). Notably, historian [Benny Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Morris "Benny Morris") states that most of Palestine's 700,000 refugees fled because of the "flail of war" and expected to return home shortly after a successful Arab invasion. He documents instances in which Arab leaders advised the evacuation of entire communities as happened in Haifa. In his scholarly work, however, he does conclude that there were expulsions which were carried out.<sup id="cite_ref-207"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-207">[206]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Israel_and_the_Palestinians_208-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Israel_and_the_Palestinians-208">[207]</a></sup> In his later work, Morris considers the displacement the result of a national conflict initiated by the Arabs themselves.<sup id="cite_ref-Israel_and_the_Palestinians_208-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Israel_and_the_Palestinians-208">[207]</a></sup> In a 2004 interview with Haaretz, he described the exodus as largely resulting from an atmosphere of transfer that was promoted by Ben-Gurion and understood by the military leadership. He also claimed that there "are circumstances in history that justify ethnic cleansing".<sup id="cite_ref-209"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-209">[208]</a></sup> He has been criticized by political scientist [Norman Finkelstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Finkelstein "Norman Finkelstein") for having seemingly changed his views for political, rather than historical, reasons.<sup id="cite_ref-210"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-210">[209]</a></sup>

Since [Jewish people who fled or otherwise emigrated from the Arab world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_Arab_and_Muslim_lands "Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim lands") after the Israeli declaration of independence were never compensated or repatriated by their former countries of residence—to no objection on the part of Arab leaders—a precedent has been set whereby it is the responsibility of the nation which accepts the refugees to assimilate them.<sup id="cite_ref-211"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-211">[210]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-212"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-212">[211]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-213"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-213">[212]</a></sup>

Although Israel accepts the right of the [Palestinian Diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees "Palestinian refugees") to return into a new Palestinian state, Israel insists that the return of this population into the current state of Israel would be a great danger for the stability of the Jewish state; an influx of Palestinian refugees would lead to the destruction of the state of Israel.<sup id="cite_ref-214"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-214">[213]</a></sup>

[Efraim Karsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efraim_Karsh "Efraim Karsh") believes Palestinians were themselves the aggressors in the 1948 war and attempted to "cleanse" a neighboring ethnic community. He argues the United Nations partition plan was forcefully subverted by the Arab world to create the refugee problem in the first place, citing large numbers of Palestinian refugees leaving even before the outbreak of the war due to disillusionment and economic privation. The British High Commissioner for Palestine spoke of the "collapsing Arab morale in Palestine" that he partially attributed to the "increasing tendency of those who should be leading them to leave the country". Huge numbers of Palestinians were also expelled by their leadership to prevent them from becoming Israeli citizens, and in Haifa and Tiberias tens of thousands were forcibly evacuated on the instructions of the Arab Higher Committee.<sup id="cite_ref-215"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-215">[214]</a></sup>

The motivations behind Palestinian violence against Israeli civilians are many, and not all violent Palestinian groups agree with each other on specifics. Nonetheless, a common motive is the desire to destroy Israel and replace it with a Palestinian Arab state.<sup id="cite_ref-218"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-218">[217]</a></sup> The most prominent [Islamist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamist "Islamist") groups, such as [Hamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas "Hamas") and [Palestinian Islamic Jihad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Jihad_Movement_in_Palestine "Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine"), view the Israeli–Palestinian conflict as a religious [jihad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihad "Jihad").<sup id="cite_ref-SelaHamas_219-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-SelaHamas-219">[218]</a></sup>

Fighting among rival Palestinian and Arab movements has played a crucial role in shaping Israel's security policy towards Palestinian militants, as well as in the Palestinian leadership's own policies.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

In the [First Intifada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Intifada "First Intifada"), more than a thousand Palestinians were killed in a campaign initiated by the [Palestine Liberation Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization "Palestine Liberation Organization") to crack down on suspected [Israeli security service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Bet "Shin Bet") informers and collaborators. The [Palestinian Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority "Palestinian Authority") was strongly criticized for its treatment of alleged collaborators, rights groups complaining that those labeled collaborators were denied fair trials. According to a report released by the [Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Human_Rights_Monitoring_Group "Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group"), less than 45 percent of those killed were actually guilty of informing for Israel.<sup id="cite_ref-238"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-238">[237]</a></sup>

In the [Gaza Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip"), Hamas officials have tortured and killed thousands of [Fatah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah "Fatah") members and other Palestinians who oppose their rule.

[Area C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_C_(West_Bank) "Area C (West Bank)"), controlled by Israel [under Oslo Accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank_Areas_in_the_Oslo_II_Accord "West Bank Areas in the Oslo II Accord"), in blue and red, in December 2011

As far as Israel is concerned, the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority is derived from the [Oslo Accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords "Oslo Accords"), signed with the PLO, under which it acquired control over cities in the Palestinian territories (Area A) while the surrounding countryside came either under Israeli security and Palestinian civil administration (Area B) or complete Israeli civil administration ([Area C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_C_(West_Bank) "Area C (West Bank)")). Israel has built additional highways to allow Israelis to traverse the area without entering Palestinian cities in Area A. The initial areas under Palestinian Authority control are diverse and non-contiguous. The areas have changed over time by subsequent negotiations, including [Oslo II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_II_Accord "Oslo II Accord"), [Wye River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wye_River_Memorandum "Wye River Memorandum") and [Sharm el-Sheik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharm_El_Sheikh_Memorandum "Sharm El Sheikh Memorandum"). According to Palestinians, the separated areas make it impossible to create a viable nation and fails to address Palestinian security needs; Israel has expressed no agreement to withdrawal from some Areas B, resulting in no reduction in the division of the Palestinian areas, and the institution of a safe pass system, without Israeli checkpoints, between these parts.

Under the Oslo Accords, as a security measure, Israel has insisted on its control over all land, sea and air border crossings into the Palestinian territories, and the right to set import and export controls. This is to enable Israel to control the entry into the territories of materials of military significance and of potentially dangerous persons.

The PLO's objective for [international recognition of the State of Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_the_State_of_Palestine "International recognition of the State of Palestine") is considered by Israel as a provocative "unilateral" act that is inconsistent with the Oslo Accords.

### Water resources

In the Middle East, [water resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_resources "Water resources") are of great political concern. Since Israel receives much of its water from two large underground [aquifers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquifer "Aquifer") which continue under the [Green Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Line_(Israel) "Green Line (Israel)"), the use of this water has been contentious in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Israel withdraws most water from these areas, but it also supplies the West Bank with approximately 40 million cubic metres annually, contributing to 77% of Palestinians' water supply in the West Bank, which is to be shared for a population of about 2.6 million.<sup id="cite_ref-241"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-241">[240]</a></sup>

While Israel's consumption of this water has decreased since it began its occupation of the West Bank, it still consumes the majority of it: in the 1950s, Israel consumed 95% of the water output of the Western Aquifer, and 82% of that produced by the Northeastern Aquifer. Although this water was drawn entirely on Israel's own side of the pre-1967 border, the sources of the water are nevertheless from the shared groundwater basins located under both West Bank and Israel.<sup id="cite_ref-242"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-242">[241]</a></sup>

In the [Oslo II Accord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_II_Accord "Oslo II Accord"), both sides agreed to maintain "existing quantities of utilization from the resources." In so doing, the Palestinian Authority established the legality of Israeli water production in the West Bank, subject to a [Joint Water Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_Joint_Water_Committee "Israeli–Palestinian Joint Water Committee") (JWC). Moreover, Israel obligated itself in this agreement to provide water to supplement Palestinian production, and further agreed to allow additional Palestinian drilling in the Eastern Aquifer, also subject to the Joint Water Committee.<sup id="cite_ref-Oslo2_Annex3_243-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Oslo2_Annex3-243">[242]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-244"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-244">[243]</a></sup> The water that Israel receives comes mainly from the Jordan River system, the Sea of Galilee and two underground sources. According to a 2003 BBC article the Palestinians lack access to the Jordan River system.<sup id="cite_ref-bbc20030616_245-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-bbc20030616-245">[244]</a></sup>

According to a report of 2008 by the [Food and Agriculture Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization "Food and Agriculture Organization") of the United Nations, water resources were confiscated for the benefit of the Israeli settlements in the Ghor. Palestinian irrigation pumps on the Jordan River were destroyed or confiscated after the 1967 war and Palestinians were not allowed to use water from the Jordan River system. Furthermore, the authorities did not allow any new irrigation wells to be drilled by Palestinian farmers, while it provided fresh water and allowed drilling wells for irrigation purposes at the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.<sup id="cite_ref-246"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-246">[245]</a></sup>

A report was released by the UN in August 2012 and [Max Gaylard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Gaylard "Max Gaylard"), the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in the occupied Palestinian territory, explained at the launch of the publication: "Gaza will have half a million more people by 2020 while its economy will grow only slowly. In consequence, the people of Gaza will have an even harder time getting enough drinking water and electricity, or sending their children to school". Gaylard present alongside Jean Gough, of the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), and Robert Turner, of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). The report projects that Gaza's population will increase from 1.6 million people to 2.1 million people in 2020, leading to a density of more than 5,800 people per square kilometre.<sup id="cite_ref-UN_Publications_247-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-UN_Publications-247">[246]</a></sup>

#### Future and financing

Numerous foreign nations and international organizations have established bilateral agreements with the Palestinian and Israeli water authorities. It was estimated that a future investment of about US$1.1bn for the West Bank and $0.8bn for the Gaza Strip Southern Governorates was needed for the planning period from 2003 to 2015.<sup id="cite_ref-HBS_248-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-HBS-248">[247]</a></sup>

In late 2012, a donation of $21.6 million was announced by the Government of the Netherlands—the Dutch government stated that the funds would be provided to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), for the specific benefit of Palestinian children. An article, published by the UN News website, stated that: "Of the $21.6 million, $5.7 will be allocated to UNRWA's 2012 Emergency Appeal for the occupied Palestinian territory, which will support programmes in the West Bank and Gaza aiming to mitigate the effects on refugees of the deteriorating situation they face."<sup id="cite_ref-UN_Publications_247-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-UN_Publications-247">[246]</a></sup>

_Occupied Palestinian Territory_ is the term used by the United Nations to refer to the West Bank, including [East Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Jerusalem "East Jerusalem"), and the Gaza Strip—territories which were captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War, having formerly been controlled by Egypt and Jordan.<sup id="cite_ref-249"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-249">[248]</a></sup>

In 1980, Israel annexed East Jerusalem.<sup id="cite_ref-BBC_annexation_250-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-BBC_annexation-250">[249]</a></sup> Israel has never annexed the West Bank, apart from East Jerusalem, or Gaza Strip, and the United Nations has demanded the "\[t\]ermination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force" and that Israeli forces withdraw "from territories occupied in the recent conflict" – the meaning and intent of the latter phrase is disputed. See [Interpretations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_242#Interpretations "United Nations Security Council Resolution 242").

It has been the position of Israel that the most Arab-populated parts of West Bank (without major Jewish settlements), as well as the entire Gaza Strip, must eventually be part of an independent Palestinian State; however, the precise borders of this state are in question. At [Camp David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Camp_David_Summit "2000 Camp David Summit"), for example, then-Israeli Prime Minister [Ehud Barak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehud_Barak "Ehud Barak") offered Arafat an opportunity to establish a non-militarized Palestinian State. The proposed state would consist of 77% of the West Bank split into two or three areas, followed by: an increase of 86–91% of the West Bank after six to twenty-one years; autonomy, but not sovereignty for some of the Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem surrounded by Israeli territory; the entire Gaza Strip; and the dismantling of most settlements.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPressman20037,_15–19_104-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPressman20037,_15%E2%80%9319-104">[103]</a></sup> Arafat rejected the proposal without providing a counter-offer.

A subsequent settlement proposed by President Clinton offered Palestinian sovereignty over 94 to 96 percent of the West Bank but was similarly rejected with 52 objections.<sup id="cite_ref-nybooks.com_105-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-nybooks.com-105">[104]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-251"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-251">[250]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-252"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-252">[251]</a></sup> The Arab League has agreed to the principle of minor and mutually agreed land-swaps as part of a negotiated two state settlement based in June 1967 borders.<sup id="cite_ref-253"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-253">[252]</a></sup> Official U.S. policy also reflects the ideal of using the 1967 borders as a basis for an eventual peace agreement.<sup id="cite_ref-254"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-254">[253]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-AJ04/2013_255-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-AJ04/2013-255">[254]</a></sup>

Some Palestinians say they are entitled to all of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem. Israel says it is justified in not ceding all this land, because of security concerns, and also because the lack of any valid diplomatic agreement at the time means that ownership and boundaries of this land is open for discussion.<sup id="cite_ref-Eran_256-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Eran-256">[255]</a></sup> Palestinians claim any reduction of this claim is a severe deprivation of their rights. In negotiations, they claim that any moves to reduce the boundaries of this land is a hostile move against their key interests. Israel considers this land to be in dispute and feels the purpose of negotiations is to define what the final borders will be. In 2017 Hamas announced that it was ready to support a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders "without recognising Israel or ceding any rights".<sup id="cite_ref-257"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-257">[256]</a></sup> Hamas has previously viewed the [peace process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_peace_process "Israeli–Palestinian peace process") "as religiously forbidden and politically inconceivable".<sup id="cite_ref-SelaHamas_219-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-SelaHamas-219">[218]</a></sup>

The power to impose a naval blockade is established under customary international law and [Laws of armed conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_war "Laws of war"), and a United Nations commission has ruled that Israel's blockade is "both legal and appropriate."<sup id="cite_ref-278"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-278">[277]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-279"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-279">[278]</a></sup> The Israeli Government's continued land, sea and air blockage is tantamount to [collective punishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_punishment "Collective punishment") of the population, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.<sup id="cite_ref-280"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-280">[279]</a></sup> The [Military Advocate General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Advocate_General "Military Advocate General") of Israel has provided numerous reasonings for the policy:

> The State of Israel has been engaged in an ongoing armed conflict with terrorist organizations operating in the Gaza strip. This armed conflict has intensified after Hamas violently took over Gaza, in June 2007, and turned the territory under its de facto control into a launching pad of mortar and rocket attacks against Israeli towns and villages in southern Israel.<sup id="cite_ref-281"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-281">[280]</a></sup>

According to [Oxfam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfam "Oxfam"), because of an import-export ban imposed on Gaza in 2007, 95% of Gaza's industrial operations were suspended. Out of 35,000 people employed by 3,900 factories in June 2005, only 1,750 people remained employed by 195 factories in June 2007.<sup id="cite_ref-282"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-282">[281]</a></sup> By 2010, Gaza's unemployment rate had risen to 40% with 80% of the population living on less than 2 dollars a day.<sup id="cite_ref-283"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-283">[282]</a></sup>

In January 2008, the Israeli government calculated how many calories per person were needed to prevent a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza strip, and then subtracted eight percent to adjust for the "culture and experience" of the Gazans. Details of the calculations were released following Israeli human rights organization [Gisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisha_(human_rights_organization) "Gisha (human rights organization)")'s application to the high court. Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, who drafted the plan, stated that the scheme was never formally adopted, this was not accepted by Gisha.<sup id="cite_ref-284"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-284">[283]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-285"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-285">[284]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-286"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-286">[285]</a></sup>

Starting in February 2008, the Israeli Government reduced the electricity it sells directly to Gaza. This follows the ruling of Israel's High Court of Justice's decision, which held, with respect to the amount of industrial fuel supplied to Gaza, that, "The clarification that we made indicates that the supply of industrial diesel fuel to the Gaza Strip in the winter months of last year was comparable to the amount that the Respondents now undertake to allow into the Gaza Strip. This fact also indicates that the amount is reasonable and sufficient to meet the vital humanitarian needs in the Gaza Strip." Palestinian militants killed two Israelis in the process of delivering fuel to the [Nahal Oz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahal_Oz "Nahal Oz") fuel depot.<sup id="cite_ref-287"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-287">[286]</a></sup>

With regard to Israel's plan, the Court stated that, "calls for a reduction of five percent of the power supply in three of the ten power lines that supply electricity from Israel to the Gaza Strip, to a level of 13.5 megawatts in two of the lines and 12.5 megawatts in the third line, we \[the Court\] were convinced that this reduction does not breach the humanitarian obligations imposed on the State of Israel in the framework of the armed conflict being waged between it and the Hamas organization that controls the Gaza Strip. Our conclusion is based, in part, on the affidavit of the Respondents indicating that the relevant Palestinian officials stated that they can reduce the load in the event limitations are placed on the power lines, and that they had used this capability in the past."

On 20 June 2010, Israel's Security Cabinet approved a new system governing the blockade that would allow practically all non-military or dual-use items to enter the Gaza strip. According to a cabinet statement, Israel would "expand the transfer of construction materials designated for projects that have been approved by the Palestinian Authority, including schools, health institutions, water, sanitation and more – as well as (projects) that are under international supervision."<sup id="cite_ref-Ynet_Cabinet_288-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Ynet_Cabinet-288">[287]</a></sup> Despite the easing of the land blockade, Israel will continue to inspect all goods bound for Gaza by sea at the port of [Ashdod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashdod "Ashdod").<sup id="cite_ref-JTA_Reaction_mixed_289-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-JTA_Reaction_mixed-289">[288]</a></sup>

Prior to a Gaza visit, scheduled for April 2013, Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan explained to Turkish newspaper _[Hürriyet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCrriyet "Hürriyet")_ that the fulfilment of three conditions by Israel was necessary for friendly relations to resume between Turkey and Israel: an apology for the May 2010 [Gaza flotilla raid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_flotilla_raid "Gaza flotilla raid") (Prime Minister Netanyahu had delivered an apology to Erdogan by telephone on 22 March 2013), the awarding of compensation to the families affected by the raid, and the lifting of the Gaza blockade by Israel. The Turkish prime minister also explained in the _Hürriyet_ interview, in relation to the April 2013 Gaza visit, "We will monitor the situation to see if the promises are kept or not."<sup id="cite_ref-290"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-290">[289]</a></sup> At the same time, Netanyahu affirmed that Israel would only consider exploring the removal of the Gaza blockade if peace ("quiet") is achieved in the area.<sup id="cite_ref-291"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-291">[290]</a></sup>

### Agricultural rights

Since the beginning of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, the conflict has been about land.<sup id="cite_ref-100_years_of_war_295-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-100_years_of_war-295">[294]</a></sup> When [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel "Israel") became a state after the war in 1948, 77% of Palestine's land was used for the creation on the state.<sup id="cite_ref-296"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-296">[295]</a></sup> The majority of those living in Palestine at the time became refugees in other countries and this first land crisis became the root of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.<sup id="cite_ref-Nakba_book_297-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Nakba_book-297">[296]</a></sup> Because the root of the conflict is with land, the disputes between Israel and Palestine are well-manifested in the agriculture of Palestine.

In Palestine, agriculture is a mainstay in the economy. The production of agricultural goods supports the population's sustenance needs and fuels Palestine's export economy.<sup id="cite_ref-CERP_Memo_298-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-CERP_Memo-298">[297]</a></sup> According to the Council for European Palestinian Relations, the agricultural sector formally employs 13.4% of the population and informally employs 90% of the population.<sup id="cite_ref-CERP_Memo_298-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-CERP_Memo-298">[297]</a></sup> Over the past 10 years<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers"><span title="The time period mentioned near this tag is ambiguous.

Unemployment rates peaked in 2008 when they reached 41% in Gaza.<sup id="cite_ref-Unemployment_and_economic_sectors_299-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Unemployment_and_economic_sectors-299">[298]</a></sup>

Palestinian agriculture suffers from numerous problems including Israeli military and civilian attacks on farms and farmers, blockades to exportation of produce and importation of necessary inputs, widespread confiscation of land for nature reserves as well as military and settler use, confiscation and destruction of wells, and physical barriers within the West Bank.<sup id="cite_ref-National_Land_Bans_300-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-National_Land_Bans-300">[299]</a></sup>

The barrier between Israel and Palestine

With the construction of the [separation barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_barrier "Separation barrier"), the Israeli state promised free movement across regions. However, border closures, curfews, and checkpoints has significantly restricted Palestinian movement.<sup id="cite_ref-Stein_book_301-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Stein_book-301">[300]</a></sup> In 2012, there were 99 fixed check points and 310 flying checkpoints.<sup id="cite_ref-302"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-302">[301]</a></sup> The border restrictions impacted the imports and exports in Palestine and weakened the industrial and agricultural sectors because of the constant Israeli control in the West Bank and Gaza.<sup id="cite_ref-Palestine_recovery_plan_303-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Palestine_recovery_plan-303">[302]</a></sup> In order for the Palestinian economy to be prosperous, the restrictions on Palestinian land must be removed.<sup id="cite_ref-National_Land_Bans_300-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-National_Land_Bans-300">[299]</a></sup> According to _[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")_ and a report for [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank"), the Palestinian economy lost $3.4bn (%35 of the annual GDP) to Israeli restrictions in the West Bank alone.<sup id="cite_ref-Guardian_Blog_304-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Guardian_Blog-304">[303]</a></sup>

### Economic disputes and boycotts

In Gaza, the agricultural market suffers from economic boycotts and border closures and restrictions placed by Israel.<sup id="cite_ref-305"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-305">[304]</a></sup> The PA's Minister of Agriculture estimates that around US$1.2 billion were lost in September 2006 because of these security measures. There has also been an economic embargo initiated by the west on Hamas-led Palestine, which has decreased the amount of imports and exports from Palestine.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (May 2014)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> This embargo was brought on by Hamas' refusal to recognize Israel's right to statehood.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (January 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> s a result, the PA's 160,000 employees have not received their salaries in over one year.<sup id="cite_ref-Embargo_Q&amp;A_306-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Embargo_Q&amp;A-306">[305]</a></sup>

## Actions toward stabilizing the conflict

In response to a weakening trend in Palestinian violence and growing economic and [security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_cooperation_between_Israel_and_the_Palestinian_Authority "Security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority"), the Israeli military removed over 120 check points in 2010 and planned on disengaging from major Palestinian population areas. According to the IDF, terrorist activity in the West Bank decreased by 97% compared to violence in 2002.<sup id="cite_ref-307"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-307">[306]</a></sup>

PA–Israel efforts in the West Bank have "significantly increased investor confidence", and the [Palestinian economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_State_of_Palestine "Economy of the State of Palestine") grew 6.8% in 2009.<sup id="cite_ref-308"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-308">[307]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-309"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-309">[308]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-310"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-310">[309]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-311"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-311">[310]</a></sup>

Since the [Second Intifada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada "Second Intifada"), Israel has banned Jewish Israelis from entering Palestinian cities. However, Israeli Arabs are allowed to enter West Bank cities on weekends.

The Palestinian Authority has petitioned the Israeli military to allow Jewish tourists to visit West Bank cities as "part of an effort" to improve the Palestinian economy. Israeli general [Avi Mizrahi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avi_Mizrahi "Avi Mizrahi") spoke with Palestinian security officers while touring malls and soccer fields in the West Bank. Mizrahi gave permission to allow Israeli tour guides into Bethlehem, a move intended to "contribute to the Palestinian and Israeli economies."<sup id="cite_ref-312"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-312">[311]</a></sup>

### Mutual recognition

#### Between Israel and the PLO

Beginning in 1993 with the [Oslo peace process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_peace_process "Oslo peace process"), Israel recognizes "the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people", though Israel does not recognize the State of Palestine.<sup id="cite_ref-313"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-313">[312]</a></sup> In return, it was agreed that Palestinians would promote peaceful co-existence, renounce violence and promote recognition of Israel among their own people. Despite Yasser Arafat's official renunciation of terrorism and recognition of Israel, some Palestinian groups continue to practice and advocate violence against civilians and do not recognize Israel as a legitimate political entity.<sup id="cite_ref-SelaConflict_53-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-SelaConflict-53">[53]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CaseforIsrael_314-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-CaseforIsrael-314">[313]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources"><span title="The material near this tag may rely on an unreliable source. (June 2012)">unreliable source?</span></a></i>]</sup> Palestinians state that their ability to spread acceptance of Israel was greatly hampered by Israeli restrictions on Palestinian political freedoms, economic freedoms, civil liberties, and quality of life.

#### Of Israel as a Jewish state

The Palestinian president [Mahmoud Abbas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Abbas "Mahmoud Abbas") has in recent years refused to recognize Israel as a Jewish state, citing concerns for Israeli Arabs and a possible future right to return for Palestinian refugees, though Palestine continues to recognize Israel as a state.<sup id="cite_ref-315"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-315">[314]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-316"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-316">[315]</a></sup>

Area A (light yellow) is exclusively administered by the [Fatah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah "Fatah")\-controlled Palestinian Authority.

The [Palestinian Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority "Palestinian Authority") is considered corrupt by a wide variety of sources, including some Palestinians.<sup id="cite_ref-319"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-319">[318]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-320"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-320">[319]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-321"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-321">[320]</a></sup> Some Israelis argue that it provides tacit support for militants via its [relationship with Hamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLO_and_Hamas "PLO and Hamas") and other Islamic militant movements, and that therefore it is unsuitable for governing any putative Palestinian state or (especially according to the right wing of Israeli politics), even negotiating about the character of such a state.<sup id="cite_ref-Eran_256-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Eran-256">[255]</a></sup> Because of that, a number of organizations, including the previously ruling [Likud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likud "Likud") party, declared they would not accept a Palestinian state based on the current PA.

Starting in 2006, the United States began training, equipping, and funding the Palestinian Authority's security forces, which had been cooperating with Israel at unprecedented levels in the West Bank to quell supporters of [Hamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas "Hamas").<sup id="cite_ref-Nathan_Thrall_230-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Nathan_Thrall-230">[229]</a></sup> The US government has spent over $500 million building and training the Palestinian National Security Forces and Presidential Guard.<sup id="cite_ref-Nathan_Thrall_230-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-Nathan_Thrall-230">[229]</a></sup> The IDF maintains that the US-trained forces will soon be capable of "overrunning small IDF outposts and isolated Israeli communities" in the event of a conflict.<sup id="cite_ref-322"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-322">[321]</a></sup>

### Views on dialogue versus violence

Societal attitudes in both Israel and Palestine are a source of concern to those promoting dispute resolution.

According to a June 2022 poll carried out by the [Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Center_for_Policy_and_Survey_Research "Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research") that asked Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank including East Jerusalem, "which of the following means is the most effective means of ending the Israeli occupation and building an independent state", 50% supported "armed struggle", 22% favored negotiations until an agreement could be reached, and 21% supported non-violent popular resistance.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_39-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-:0-39">[39]</a></sup> 59% of respondents cite the armed attack inside Israel carried out by Palestinians unaffiliated with known armed groups as contributing to ending the occupation; 37% disagree. Residents of the Gaza Strip, youth, students, low-income workers, public sector employees, and Hamas supporters are more likely to believe that armed attacks contribute to the national interest.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_39-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-:0-39">[39]</a></sup> An unconditional resumption of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations is opposed by 69% of Palestinians and supported by 22%.

### Criticism of casualty statistics

As reported by the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, since 29 September 2000 a total of 7,454 Palestinian and Israeli individuals were killed due to the conflict. According to the report, 1,317 of the 6,371 Palestinians were minors, and at least 2,996 did not participate in fighting at the time of death. Palestinians killed 1,083 Israelis, including 741 civilians, of whom 124 were minors.<sup id="cite_ref-332"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-332">[331]</a></sup>

The Israeli-based [International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Policy_Institute_for_Counter-Terrorism "International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism") criticized the methodology of Israeli and Palestinian rights groups, including B'Tselem, and questioned their accuracy in classifying civilian/combatant ratios.<sup id="cite_ref-333"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-333">[332]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-334"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_note-334">[333]</a></sup>

## Notes

## Explanatory notes

1.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#cite_ref-100 "Jump up")** Three factors made Israel's territorial offer less forthcoming than it initially appeared. First, the 91 percent land offer was based on the Israeli definition of the West Bank, but this differs by approximately 5 percentage points from the Palestinian definition. Palestinians use a total area of 5,854 square kilometers. Israel, however, omits the area known as No Man's Land (50 km<sup>2</sup> near Latrun), post-1967 East Jerusalem (71 km<sup>2</sup>), and the territorial waters of the Dead Sea (195 km<sup>2</sup>), which reduces the total to 5,538 km<sup>2</sup>

The Arabs failed to understand why the international community was awarding the Jews any part of Palestine. Further, as one Palestinian historian later put it, they could not fathom why 37 percent of the population had been given 55 percent of the land (of which they owned only 7 percent). Moreover, the Jews had been given the best agricultural lands (the Coastal Plain and Jezreel and Jordan Valleys) while the Arabs had received the 'bare and hilly' parts, as one Palestinian politician, 'Awni 'Abd al-Hadi, told a Zionist agent.162 More generally, 'the Palestinians failed to see why they should be made to pay for the Holocaust. . . . \[And\] they failed to see why it was _not_ fair for the Jews to be a minority in a unitary Palestinian state, while it _was_ fair for almost half of the Palestinian population—the indigenous majority on its own ancestral soil—to be converted overnight into a minority under alien rule.'"

Makdisi rightly argues that almost every law of South African Apartheid has its equivalent in Israel today.18 A significant example is the Law of Return (1950), which even Kretzmer claims is explicitly discriminatory against Palestinian citizens.... The Law of Return, which determines the second-class citizenship of Palestinians, is recognized as a fundamental principle in Israel and "is possibly even its very _raison d'etre_ as a Jewish state."19

In any case has the Law of Return, 1950 discriminatory effect for Palestinian Arab people since it allows any Jew to immigrate to Israel, while – at the same time – it deprives all native Palestinian Arab refugees residing outside the borders of the state of Israel of their fundamental right to return to their homes and villages from which they were expelled or took flight in the course of the 1948 war that broke out because of the establishment of Israel.

Under the heading of "Discrimination", the Committee cited Israel's Law of Return as discriminatory against Palestinian refugees because of Israel's refusal to readmit them. The committee said: "The Committee notes with concern that the Law of Return which permits any Jew from anywhere in the world to immigrate and thereby virtually automatically enjoy residence and obtain citizenship in Israel, discriminates against Palestinians in the Diaspora upon whom the Government of Israel has imposed restrictive requirements that make it almost impossible to return to their land of birth."
