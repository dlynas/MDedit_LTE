	Sam when talking about the scientific consensus: well, it's a coin toss.

	Sam when talking about consciousness: I am absolutely dead certain.

	And I was especially unimpressed with his discussion of Israel/Palestine. He spends a lot of time discussing how people can't be mad for more than a few minutes without something to sustain it and so apparently doesn't understand how folks in the middle east can be mad for decades.

	I wish Chris and Matt had pushed back a bit on the religious aspect a little more; compared various other ethnic conflicts throughout history. They did a touch but mostly in the context of violence levels. Plenty of people have gone over to their neighbors and wrecked shit in the past without needing to believe they're going to heaven for it. "From The River To The Sea" is a fundimentally _earthly_ goal, just as earthly as Israel's goal of security. They don't wear house keys because they think they're gonna unlock the pearly gates with them.

		There is a charitable and, I think, reasonable way to read this. With the former, he is saying that he is unsure how to weigh competing claims in a field in which he has no expertise. With the latter, he is discussing the subject to which he has devoted much of his career. Whether he is correct or not is beside the point; I can understand why he would be more confident in his assertions on the latter.
		
		>And I was especially unimpressed with his discussion of Israel/Palestine.
		
		Strongly agree. I haven't heard/read all that he has to say on the subject so perhaps he addresses this elsewhere, but I don't understand how he reconciles his views with the fact that until the '90s, Islamism wasn't a major factor in Palestinian politics/resistance/terrorism. The era of Fatah, the DFLP, the PFLP, etc. was driven by a spectrum ranging from radical left/communist to secular nationalist. The latter, for instance, was a pan-Arabist Marxist group responsible for some of the most infamous terror attacks back in the day such as the Lod Airport massacre (the first suicide attack in the conflict \[perpetrated by Japanese communists, oddly enough\]) and the Entebbe airplane hijacking. I don't understand how Islam/Islamism is the only lens through which he is able to interpret political violence and terrorism here. This seems to be downstream of a more general antipathy to religion in general and Islam in particular. Hamas are the chief exponents of terrorism in the 21st century but that is a fairly late development in the timeline of the Israel-Palestine conflict.
		
		I also think that his image of what is mainstream and what is fringe in Israeli politics is a couple decades out of date but that is a separate question.

			One field is a scientific field with studies he can look up, scientists he can read, and other hard facts. The other is the softest of soft sciences at best, and straight up religion at worst.
			
			
			He is putting self-knowledge obtained from meditation (and generalizing it across everyone!) well above the science of virology. It's not how I would expect a serious person to operate.

			On the contrary, I think you pretty much summed it up. Combine that with a strong inclination to go all-in on anything he considers unfairly perceived as racist.

			I don't think that the correct way to address Sam's fixation on Jihadism is to bothsides it though, in fact I was disappointed that that was the main angle. I think it's to point out very clearly that the Palestinian movement has earthly goals, reasonable or not, and is responding to earthly conditions that they find themselves in.

	Holy mother of God that was unlistenable. Fair play Chris and Matt for trying, but Sam Harris is just a solid block of filibustering nonsense. I genuinely cannot believe how much he talked there without even taking a second to consider if he should shut up. Was he always this bad?

		As someone who used to consume a lot of Harris content, I couldn't believe how he's still repeating the same exact responses and thought experiments from years ago. Like the "we know what JFK was not thinking about" shtick. I guess he's just decided that he's solved every philosophical problem already and doesn't need to think much deeper about anything anymore, it's really our fault for not understanding how correct he is.

	What irritated me most about this episode was that Sam was essentially filibustering at parts. Matt and Chris couldn't get a word in because Sam just kept plowing through his argument.

	Wish they continued to push a little more on the lab leak stuff, but I can see that they already thought about how they wanted this interview/debate to go, and they needed to move on.

	Overall it was a little bit of a frustrating, but still useful, listen.

	I don't understand why there isn't more of a fuss about Harris explicitly advocating ethnic cleansing (around the 1:28:00 mark). I mean this is straight up a crime against humanity, and he is presenting it as some kind of pragmatic solution. And yet nobody seems to have even noticed. Is it because this kind of thinking has been normalised now? I tried to raise it on r/samharris but my post was removed on the basis I don't have 500 karma points or something, but I do so I guess the mods are just embarrassed by the issue. His arguments for it were both idiotic ("history is full of ethnic cleansing") and borderline racist (saying it is because the Palestinians, not Hamas, the Palestinians, are the way they are which makes it necessary).  The fact that Harris can advocate for ethnic cleansing and people are just blase about it makes me wonder whether so much of this "moral" debate is just an intellectual exercise or a form of entertainment to them.

		Absolutely agree. The dude was straight up using bumper sticker slogans to justify ethnic cleansing ("if Palestinians lay down their arms, there will be no conflict; if Israelis lay down their arms, there will be no Israel"). And saying massive amount of dead civilians in Palestine are essentially justified because Israel tripped and accidentally killed them instead of targeting them directly. And he's supposed to be taken seriously?

				Sam is so convinced by his thought experiment about what both parties would do if they had perfect weapons (ie Palestinians would annihilate  Israel). I thought Matt’s point about the Pol Pots regime was such a good illustration of why these kinds of thought experiments have limited value. Also Matt briefly talked about the asymmetric power and how oppressed people have different modes of attack available to them. Sam barely engaged with these very reasonable points. This conversation was one person steam rolling with thought experiments and slogans and the other two people just politely throwing much better, more succinct points

	Harris' views on I/P are very surface-level. He doesn't want to engage with the complexities of Middle Eastern geopolitics or foreign policy beyond "Islam bad." 

	For instance, Harris is completely wrong on the prevalence of Jewish religious fundamentalism and settler extremism. There have been literal [pogroms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huwara_rampage) in Palestinian towns done by mobs of these people abetted by people like Ben-Gvir and Smotrich. Given the demographic trends in Israel (secular folks breeding less than the religious), this will likely become more of an issue moving forward.

		No Sam, it's worse. Israel is using bombardment on a landmass it ALREADY CONTROLS. the only reason they haven't used nukes is because the world frowns on that, and they'd strike themselves with the fallout.
		
		IIRC Israel also HAS done fire bombing. They dropped white phosphorous all over Gaza. It's just that concrete doesn't burn very well. Didn't save the people it touched though.
		
		Israel also has access to weaponry that nobody has in WWII. And what they're doing with it is dropping precision guided JDAMs on the home of every journalist inside Gaza. Journalists are getting killed at a rate far above any other particular class of person in Gaza.
		
		What's more Israel IS doing the same level of destruction as the nukes. On territory they have already captured they are bulldozing all structures flat. The destruction is as complete as if a nuke had gone off.
		
		> Did we kill all the fighting age males?
		
		The IDF numbers on casualties are that 10,000 Hamas fighters have been killed and 20,000 women and children have been collateral.
		
		The IDF are LITERALLY COUNTING ALL ADULT MALES AS ENEMY COMBATANTS!
		
		Every fucking thing Harris is claiming is too extreme and a reason Hamas can't be negotiated with is a thing Israel is actively perpetrating.

	I don’t know exactly what it is, but Sam’s extra long pauses searching for the exact right SAT word to express himself in this interview was very off-putting. It gives the vibe that he’s only ever talking to himself. There’s something more fluent about the exchange of ideas with someone in an authentic way. He talks like every comment he makes is going to become a NYT Op-Ed and he can’t mess it up.

	Th content aside, I found this to be the least flattering comportment exhibited by Sam I can remember.

	I really dislike Harris' response to the lab leak criticism essentially being "well, if I had a time machine, I would do things differently." One, maybe some more introspection on what factors lead you to make poor judgments of arguments (the closest we get here is him acknowledging he was just really annoyed with claims that the lab leak was a racist theory). Second, there's nothing stopping you from giving the counterargument at any point after! As Chris pointed out, it's Harris' platform, he can do what he wants, and if he just isn't interested in the lab leak topic anymore, fine. But he could have at any point after the lab leak episode brought on virologists to give the other side. The coulda/shoulda/woulda argument is so weak.

	His willingness to applaud Douglas Murray's character, and then defend himself from criticism by saying "well, I don't know about those things. I just know what I've seen from Douglas myself" is also so weak. It's one thing to say you still think Murray is good despite certain opinions or behaviors (although that would be... something), but to just always claim ignorance just feels like gross negligence. Feel like it reveals, along with some other things said by Harris, how much the idea of radical Islam colors his worldview.

	The stuff on the mind was fair though, I enjoyed the back and forth and thought Harris defended himself better than he did in the rest of the podcast.

	* 🟨 **[reductios](https://www.reddit.com/user/reductios) (OP)** ⬆️ 59 _(2024-02-17 07:46:13)_

		He tried to justify his lack of research on the lab leak by saying he was focused on challenging people calling lab leakers racist. So he’s based his opinion almost entirely on a book by a couple of known conspiracy theorists because he reflexively took the opposite opinion to whatever he thought the woke were saying.
		
		What makes it worse is that the idea that people were going around calling anyone who thought Covid came from a lab racist was a conservative narrative. It had a grain of truth to it but was massively overblown.

			This is exactly right. People say he’s an independent thinker, but the fact is he’s a *reactionary* thinker.    
			
			He’s got himself so keyed up as a anti-woke that he views every accusation of racism as false woke bullshit. He has a bit in his act (he’s been repeating the same rationales for years, so I have started to see them as stand up routines) where he vehemently defends Trump against racism charges. He tries to justify this by saying he knows beyond reasonable doubt that Trump is a real racist because he knows about the supposed “Apprentice tape” where he freely uses the N word on set. As if we need a fucking secret tape to prove his racism, rather than the thousands of horrible things he’s said about Mexicans and Arabs from the White House press room.  Sam says there are countless examples of his “real” racism, yet every time the subject comes up, Sam is Trump’s shield. And he never talks about any of those “real” examples outside of this tape.   
			
			Just because Sam is incredibly intelligent doesn’t mean he can’t have blind spots. He’s clearly been accidentally radicalized by the content he ingests and the people he keeps around him.

					He has allowed that he might have blind spots, yet he seems totally unwilling to actually address them.
					
					If all of my online buddies are right-wing reactionaries, or religious nut jobs, or anti-science grifters, I’d have to stop and take inventory. In fact, this happened to me. I was big into GameGate in 2014, believing it to be about “ethics in journalism.” It took a couple of years, but I had my “are we the baddies?” moment and walked away.

	The standard Sam expects of himself in terms of how much research he should do before publishing a podcast is crazy low. His excuse is basically: “I’m pumping out way too much content to do that level of research”. Then maybe… don’t? Listen to Ezra Klein and hear the level of research that goes into every interview. Even other interview podcasts like Trevor Noah and Louis Theroux, which aare not academic and more about the celebrities, you can see so much work has gone into it.

	Regarding Harris' strong views on Israel and Palestine, I think I am hearing a man who is absolutely transformed by his rage against the extremes of Islamic religious belief. He is not mistaken that the worldview of the most conservative and reactionary flavors of Islam are frighteningly loathsome. It's hard to find any reasonable defense of these ideologies. I think where he is failing is his lack of ability to see beyond his horror at this repellent extremism into the underlying economics and history of global conflict that has created the phenomenon of reactionary extremist flavors of religion. People don't tend to lean towards these strains of religious belief when they have their material needs met. Global spread of this austere Islam is directly a reaction to Imperialism and colonial meddling for resource extraction. If we don't want this type of religion to take hold, perhaps focus on how to raise people's level of education and standard of living would do more than just repulsion and condemnation.

		I just don’t think this is really true, and I would like it to be because I have a fairly materialist take on things, but unless I’m very mistaken many of the most violent and extreme Islamists are not people who have been living lives of deprivation, they are middle and upper middle class Muslims. Maybe it’s selection bias, these are just the guys who can be counted on to learn to fly planes into skyscrapers.
		
		You can say, well they’re mad about the material deprivation of their people caused by the west. Except again, there are many middle and upper income Muslim countries that produce very, very bad politics. The median Saudi income is above the Czech Republic. 
		
		Finally just listen to what they say in their writing and videos. It’s not anti colonial, seize the means class warfare against the oppressive Western empires. It’s almost entirely about religion. 
		
		I think Sam is essentially right when he says that Western people search around for answers other than religion because we have completely abandoned faith and can’t actually imagine taking it seriously, so there must be another explanation. I think ‘You say you do something for X, but we know you really do it for Y, you just can’t see it’ is actually a colonial mindset.
		
		All that said, what Israel is doing in Gaza is horrible and Sam can’t seem to really wrap his head around the fact that religious Jews also follow a Bronze Age religion filled with commands from God to go forth and slaughter, not just Muslims. 
		
		Sorry to pop off on you, I wrote a lot. This is just a topic I think about a lot for some stupid reason.

			You don't think the rise of Wahhabist and other conservative Islamic ideology is intertwined with anti-colonialism? And also with western support for the house of Saud, and the influence of the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Algeria among other conflicts? There are a lot of flavors of Islam and many of the world's Muslims are not extremists. The most brutally reactionary ones seem to have arisen as an opposition to western imperialism and alleged "decadent" values.

	I think Sam's positions are very ideological even though he tries to paint them over with silly thought experiments. But the main take away for me is that he is incapable of admitting any failure in his thinking. Like when have you ever heard him say "oh I was completely wrong there, sorry guys"? He has too high a level of self regard to be a good philosopher (or whatever he is trying to be).

	Oh and him saying multiple times that he is able to confirm to HIMSELF that the self doesn't exist was pretty funny...

	I know some of you love him so don't take this personally. I just have a hard time understanding why he is so revered.

		As someone who kind of likes his material, I'd say his inability to admit to mistakes is exasperating. It's worse than not being able to say " I was completely wrong there". Even when he's sort of wrong, he won't say it. He'll concede various points, but always conclude that he was still in the right.
		
		For example, on the lab leak, he concedes he didn't do much research, that Ridley has had some fringe, now disproven takes, that having on a counter point would have been good. He puts out the excuse that around that time there were various new government reports that said lab leak was likely. But he can't just say "yeah, that was a mistake. I should have done more research or had someone else on too".
		
		Maybe it's because he is trying to rebut the suggestion that he's hypocritical because he criticizes Rogan on vaccines. But there's a separate argument to be had about the validity of comparison.

That's how it's supposed to go if you want to gain actual knowledge.

					Agreed. Sam's approach is contrary to the persona he presents - as someone who interrogates issues from a range of perspectives.  He's an ideologue and issue advocate, and his approach is basically just a more palatable form of Bret Weinstein's (because he's less wrong on some issues).  There's nothing inherently wrong with being an issue advocate but it's problematic when an issue advocates presents himself as a guru of equanimity and equipoise.

		As someone who was quite the fan of him during his New Atheist days I think the reason he's so revered is that he has an aesthetic of calm rationality. By that I mean that he speaks and presents his points in a way that appears to be totally logical and rational, kind of like if a computer were saying them. That aesthetic is pretty appealing and can mask people's biases in a way that allows them to view their own biases as not emotionally or ideologically driven, but coming from a basis of logic and reason.
		
		And believe me, 20s me found that incredibly appealing. It's pretty enticing to think that you're smart and don't have biases and are operating on pure reason. 30s me though, not so much. I'm still a fan of Harris, but it's kind of more based on nostalgia than being a fan boy. I still agree with a lot of what he says in broad principles, but not as much in specific.

			he can't distinguish between honest criticism and an attack, it seems like he takes things quite personal when I think DTG quite often try paint an honest interpretation. It just makes him look like a jackass and emotional.
			
			On this episode there were some topics where he was evidently emotional and angered, I wonder if he notices this or not. he still tries to keep his style but it just sounds a bit whiny as you know he's fluttered and can't admit to holding a position he's either wrong on, or went in too deep.

	Im about 2/3 of the way through and may give more comprehensive thoughts later, but one thing that’s really sticking in my craw is Sam on the subject of Gaza. 

	I’m a fairly longtime listener of Sam’s and I have heard him use this canard before: if you could give Israel magical weapons that only killed Hamas, they would never kill a civilian. The people who die are not desired and always inadvertent. They would turn Gaza into the south of France.

	 I’ve never trusted this explanation (because I am aware of who and what Benjamin Netanyahu is) but now that explanation is officially and forever defunct. It’s incredibly disheartening to hear Sam run this same tired story again, especially as it is proven false each and every day. 

	And the false equivalence of asking what Hamas would do if they had their way (vs what Israel would do) is maddening. Hamas is a symptom of the oppression of Palestinians. They would not even exist if Palestinians had their way.

	Many  comments below - rather than reiterating the obvious, will just say that my favourite moment was when Sam, in kindly informing Chris, a Northern Irishman, about The Troubles in 1970/80's Northern Ireland came out with "The troubles would have been much more troublesome ..."  

	Also, after passionately defending Douglas Murray  

	"I've never spoken to Douglas about any of that", followed by  "I haven't spoken to Douglas all that much".   Another 10 minutes and it'd have been "I don't even know Douglas" ?  

	It was good to hear Chris mention Anne Applebaum twice and Sam seem to concur with her worth as a reliable commentator.  

	In the end, Matt and Chris are fettered by their unwritten rules of fairness in letting Sam talk, whilst also turning down their own argumentativeness a few notches.

	Hey all. Jay Shapiro here. I wrote and produced the 10 part series "The Essential Sam Harris" for the Making Sense podcast... [https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/essentials](https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/essentials)

	If you are jaw-dropped by how utterly disconnected from reality Sam is when it comes to Palestine, you are not alone. If you are horrified by his shockingly stubborn, stupid, and tribalist essentialists takes on the intentions of Israel, you are not alone. If you are stunned by how little intellectual curiosity that he seems to exhibit while wondering if he has fallen victim to some rather obvious Zionist history which is easily refuted, you are not alone either.

	If you are interested... I have a collection of shows coming out on this week The Palestine Series which will be addressing some of these things. [](http://whatjaythinks.com)

	I love Sam as a person. None of this ought to be taken personally, but on the topic of Israel and Palestine he is willfully-ignorant, driven by cowardice and intellectual hubris, and shows little hope of progress unfortunately.

	More importantly, this episode confirmed to me that Sam Harris is not a well informed man. Much of his thought is guided less by rational enquiry than by his extremely predictable and unchanging list of things that trigger him. 

	The fact the lab leak was called racist (thus tickling his anti-woke antenna) gets him emotionally energized, but not intellectually rigorous to actually sit down and read across the issue.

	His rant about the UK was frankly "clickbait news old man saw on facebook" territory. Apparently "the barbarians have been let inside the gates" of the UK, where his brave pal Doug is bravely "living on the front line of that clash of civilizations". After seeing videos of protests, Sam decides "OK London is ruined". Huh? Again, he must have just swallowed D. Murray's takes wholesale without bothering widen his funnel of research. Totally fine for the average nobody, but if you make a living from espousing these opinions, and do so with such outstanding confidence, the standard should be much higher.

	There are so many problems with Harris's characterization of the Israel Palestine conflict. I don't even know where to start. I think the biggest issue is his focus on so-called intentions. There are really two issues here. 

	1. Intentions don't matter nearly as much as Sam suggests. History is full of unnecessary suffering caused by people with more or less decent intentions. Obviously the war in Iraq being a great example. It really doesn't factor into the equation when we're talking about the justification of certain actions. Israel's indiscriminant bombing of Gaza is morally abhorrent regardless of their long-term intentions. 

	2. The intentions of Israel are not good. This isn't a Germany WW2 scenario. The Israeli government has long supported, with military force, the agenda of those who wish to fully disenfranchise and ethnically cleanse the Palestinian people from Gaza and the West Bank. Israel's intention, or at least the intention of their government is to remove Palestinians from the lands of Palestine. If they could snap their fingers and solve the problem however they want they would solve it by vaporizing the Palestinian people. The fact that Sam wants to insist that Israel would just be okay with some type of peaceful solution at this point is infuriating. He really is nothing more than an Israeli propagandist at this point when it comes to this topic.

		Well-said. He’s argument was also full of essentializing, imperialist tropes about the moral depravity and intractability of the Palestinians. In his mind, there is no separation between Hamas and all Palestinians. According to Harris, both are wedded to jihadism, nationalism, and the right to self-determination, only being a secondary motivation. Also, he fails to see Zionism as a form of religious extremism. He didn’t have much to say in regards to Chris’s point about the power differentials between Israel and Hamas that, although not excusing the events of Oct. 7, historicizes them. Again, I don’t find Harris a nuanced and lucid thinker on these points.

	Matt and Chris tend to bend over backwards to accommodate guests on these "right to reply" episodes, and guests like Sam take advantage. A couple of moments that broke my brain without much pushback (or weakly conceded to him):

	Sam comparing the mass slaughter of Gazan civilians with us choosing not to lower speed limits. His fussiness on inconvenient analogies and dumb credulity on this one is wild.

	Sam claiming that the mass slaughter of Gazan civilians is not a deliberate choice by the Israeli government and military. This even after he cited the invocation of Amalek (without saying it was Bibi invoking this Biblical injunction to genocide). Of course the President (Herzog) has claimed there are no innocent Gazans. Sam dismissing these as "just a few people" doesn't hold water. On social media we've been inundated with videos of IDF soldiers celebrating the destruction of Gaza and the Gazan people, mocking their displacement, starvation, and murder. It gives to lie to his dumbest Kantian obsession with ideological motivations over addressing material, political conflicts.

	Sam trying to pass off ethnic cleansing as a perfectly acceptable thing, and not something that, despite it being distinct from genocide, is often accompanied by genocide.

	Sam claiming that Islam is culturally illegitimate because it hasn't created a Gandhi. India created Gandhi, but in his lifetime it also went through Partition, one of the most destructive ethnic cleansings in history. Token heroes don't remove the violent nature of humans in politically volatile conditions.

	*To reference my comment from Patreon here, I think this episode exposed Harris rather well.*

	**First of all**, it was extremely annoying how many times Harris interrupted and didn’t let Matt interject or Chris finish his point. And the many times he responded to criticisms by stating that the people with the critique are “confused”. It just speaks to Harris’ arrogance, ego, inability to take criticism and self-righteousness. 

	- - - -

	**Secondly,** thank you guys for pushing him on Israel and Douglas Murray. It made it clear that Harris is a reactionary and holds old school, western supremacist views about clash of civilisations etc. He basically flat out said that the amount of dead Palestinian children didn’t matter because of “intentions”. I mean I am critical of Islam plus broadly sympathise with Jews and Israeli causes AND EVEN to me that was a reprehensible statement. He also negated &amp; downplayed the harm caused by a hard-right government like Likud in power &amp; the various associated extremists who have comments justifying even ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. No to Harris, everything is a result and consequence of Islam. *Other people are acting disproportionately or badly? Well what can you do? They have to fight Islam!*

	- - - -

	**Thirdly** the gall of him to say that Douglas Murray is just making strange bedfellows in his fight against Islam. His own party threw out his membership because of his extreme comments. And how many Muslims are there in Hungary btw? That he is compelled to fawn over and ally with Orban. Plus Harris made hysterical, crazy comments about London falling to Islam and repeated quasi Great Replacement talking points. And it’s unsurprising that his view of Europe is largely shaped by the hard-right perspectives of Murray and Ali. Also see how hard he went at the left while being more charitable to the right. He’s not a liberal guys, he’s right wing. Calling him a liberal is an insult to many moderate conservatives like Tom Nichols, Anne Applebaum, Stuart Stevens, Rick Wilson, Max Boot etc who are way more compassionate &amp; way less extreme in their statements on similar geopolitical issues.

	- - - -

	Bottomline is that Harris is a racist, reactionary bastard who is a painfully ignorant and shallow guru. He’s intellectually lazy and emotionally immature too. And i haven’t even mentioned his other previous ignorant comments on British colonialism, Sati or a hundred other things.

		> He basically flat out said that the amount of dead Palestinian children didn’t matter because of “intentions”.
		
		He didn't say that at all. He said something along the lines that the intentions make a difference - collateral damage is not the same as intentionally killing people.
		
		I don't buy his argument on this - I think Israel likes their own narrative about minimising collateral damage but their idea of minimising this damage is completely unconvincing. And I don't think there's any way to justify a high level of collateral damage using an intentions argument, but I agree with part of the principle Sam was clumsily trying to invoke.

			In his [blog post](https://www.samharris.org/blog/5-myths-about-israel-and-the-war-in-gaza), he basically did say that the amount of Palestinian children dead didn't matter. 
			
			> Eventually Muslim societies need to understand that their religious beliefs—specifically the doctrines about jihad and martyrdom—make any conflict of this kind far more pointlessly horrible than it needs to be. That is their fault. And it will remain their fault _no matter how many children die in Gaza._
			
			In other words, the unique evil of Islam and the superiority of Western values means that Israel could kill or maim every Palestinian child living in Gaza and have no moral culpability.
			
			Of course, if pressed on this, Harris would wiggle his way out and claim we're misinterpreting him and that he doesn't _really_ mean Israel could kill every Palestinian child with impunity. But why write something so obviously provocative, without any qualification or limit ("no matter how many"), in the first place?

	Advocating ethnic cleansing and an inability to assess the Israel / Palestine conflict beyond a rigid focus on religious fundamentalism is so baffling.

Post-WW2, one strategy the US employed to maintain its military and economic hegemony was by building up the economies of these these countries to be allies against the anti-capitalist / socialist / communist movements in countries like the USSR and China. If it wasn't to the benefit of the US and European Union, they would not have spent so much to rebuild the infrastructure of these countries.

If that’s the case when are we storming the evangelical churches etc etc?

	This has been more evidence for me that Sam Harris is poorly informed about most things. When he speaks on Islam - my area of academic expertise - I cannot help but be angry (maybe I should meditate) with how he sounds like the first year uni student who picked up one book by Bernard Lewis and suddenly thinks he knows and understands all of the history of a religion and numbers if civilisations touched or informed by the religion. However this first-year student has a massive audience that must believe him to genuinely know what he's talking about at least to some extent. He's never gotten past the first hump of the Dunning-Kruger effect in my field of expertise, so I must assume it's not the only realm in which he's spouting off at the mouth in ignorance and it seems evidenced further by his admitted terrible preparation for the lab-leak interview, where I'm not an expert but know if someone is preparing an interview well it cannot just be reading the guests' book without exposing oneself to counter arguments.

	Sam's continued interest in the lab leak theory seems to stem from the fact that having that conversation (according to him) was considered "racist" and as he says, he considers that to be ridiculous. Fair enough.

	But who exactly said that? I'm browsing around seeing Tweets from a few individuals I've never heard of saying that calling it the "China virus" was racist and I've seen at least one instance of someone calling the wet market theory racist. But I see way more references in articles to how much "the left" called the lab leak theory racist than I'm actually seeing "the left" call the lab leak theory racist. What am I missing?

	The innocents in Israel are worth more than the innocents in Gaza because Israelis don’t want to delete Gaza. Right. Except for many Israelis do indeed want to delete Gaza, and not all Gazans want to delete Israel. At the end of the day…the worse Palestinians are treated and the more radical and desperate they become…the less they deserve to be treated as human…completely not accounting for the fact that Palestinians have a legitimate beef and a Israel has none.

	Some Sam Harris' arguments feel week even on their own merit.

	He talks about good intentions and revealed preferences, but immediately afterwards when faced with actions and words of the current Israeli government he ascribes them to an unhelpful minority of extremists and to a pragmatic reaction to Palestinians being too uncooperative. Which may be fair, but it undermines the point about obvious revelead preferences, and makes Israeli unquestionable moral high ground less unquestionable. The logical conclusion of this view would be that Israel has good intentions, but practical implementation of this intentions are shaped by multiple factors, some of which may undermine the moral righteousness, and so Israel's actions and words should be critically examined to keep Israeli government true to the good intentions.

	With car crash victims, even if we agree that this is an apt comparision to victims of a war, speed limits are being discussed and reassessed in many countries. In most countries if there was a spike of car crash victims with many children dying every day there would be a public disussion about road safety and speed limits.

	With bedfellows argument the immediate implication is that if  you want Sam Harris' support you can try getting it by exaggerating the threat of Islamism and presenting yourself as a brave defender of the Western Civilisations. Harris may even ignore some you more unsavoury political views.

			Indeed. imo the Israeli public have a greater ceteris paribus responsibility for their leaders than Palestinians. And this assumption only really hinges on two (arguable) premises: 1) responsibility can be collective, not just individual (implying each individual in the collective has a small portion of that responsibility) 2) liberal democracy is a freer system in terms of "the people" compared to autocracy, and so the persona ficta known as the demos and its will is more properly represented in democracy compared to autocracy.

		Sam do you think maybe the material conditions under which people find themselves might just affect the way they conduct themselves?
		
		
		I think it's partly the consequence of his start in New Atheism, the premise of which, partially, was that the bad things people did were religiously motivated and if we could only give up those doctrines the world would be a better place.
		
		
		Full  circle: here he is saying that he would align himself with religious extremists. I don't think he realizes that maybe the fact that he aligns with them so well might indicate that religion itself isn't the primary motivator.

	It’s a relatively minor point compared to Sam’s blatantly jingoistic takes on Israel/Palestine, but I was, again, gobsmacked by his angle on what he can know by way of his introspective practices. He concedes, multiple times, that he resists making metaphysical conclusions from his meditations, but then goes right on to claim that he can tell that there is no self from those same practices, while seeming to just not notice that this is a metaphysical claim. He does the same thing re free will, and even mentions this as an analogue. This, again, is another metaphysical claim. Something seeming to be indubitable to you by way of introspection simply does not license making justifiable metaphysical conclusions. Descartes made the same mistake in the other direction. People coming to wildly different conclusions from bouts of intense subjective experience is in itself evidence for why doing that is not reliable. It’s exasperating!

* 🟩 **[Philostotle](https://www.reddit.com/user/Philostotle)** ⬆️ 11 _(2024-02-17 10:35:44)_

	Post this on the samharris sub:

	This was a strange one for Sam. On one hand, he seemed as agitated as I’ve ever seen him. I can understand this to some degree as a few of the points that were brought up, especially the first couple on Gaza were quite poor from the hosts and seemed as biased as Sam in the other direction. But the stuff on the lab leak… I think he basically admitted he didn’t do much research on his guests… which essentially concedes the argument, yet he somehow thought he won lol. I’m like — dude, I love you, but you do a podcast for a living — I do a podcast myself plus my full time job — and apparently more research than you. Not acceptable imo. And I again, this is coming from a Sam Harris fanboy. 

	Now on the other hand, Sam was rightfully tested on some of his views toward the Palestinian suffering and religious component of the conflict. This was by far the most interesting segment. 

	(1) Sam made his best argument and a convincing one at that, about how religion IS the biggest factor. This is something I doubted before watching but his clarifications in this discussion changed my mind. The key moment was when he made a very simple point… almost an embarrassingly simple point: if both sides were of the same religion, there would be no conflict. And although it’s true that there is plenty of Muslim on Muslim conflict out there, I think the nature of whatever conflict wouldn’t be anything close to what we are saying in reality. I think the same actually applies to the conflict between Armenia and Azeris (and Turks), and probably wouldn’t have happened if all parties were Christian or Muslim. This is an embarrassingly simple point but if we zoom out we can say, oh wait, it’s actually correct. Religion IS the fucking problem. But — to be fair — it’s both religions. The difference being, Jews are far less religious than Muslims as Sam pointed out. 

	(2) Sam still seems unable to grasp how he COMMUNICATES in terms of style about the conflict makes him look cold and borderline sociopathic (which by no means am I implying he is). It’s just when he uses words like “unhelpful” to describe awful things done by Israel and “barbaric” to describe anything from the Palestinian side, it makes him look biased. 

	(3) to piggy back on (2), he also seemed to casually imply that ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians isn’t such a crazy idea — although it was unclear exactly what he proposed should happen, while rejecting that it would be his idea to do that. Again, although I could understand some of his logic on this part of the discussion, his tone toward Palestinians was quite dismissive of their suffering and the contributions of Israel towards the conflict. 

	Overall, strong and weak points from both Sam and the hosts. But respect to BOTH for engaging in this discussion.

	Harris thinks ideas exist and shape material conditions before material conditions give rise to and influence susceptibility to ideology. I think this is obviously wrong. Does anyone honestly believe an organization like Hamas would have the support it does if Palistinians had basic material needs met (food, shelter, jobs, healthcare, self-determination, functional societal infrustracture) and prospects of a decent future? After establishing a religious state on top of where Palistinians were living without giving them democratic proportional representation in forming this new state, they were made effectively second class citizens. The IDF and Zionist Israeli state increasingly imposed conditions that have driven Gazans, often those too young to have even voted for Hamas, to join Hamas in their guerilla warfare because they represent the main group opposing those visibly responsible for their suffering. Explaining the behavior of supporting Hamas or joining Hamas as simply due to Islamist Jihadist ideology is naive. It's like acting as if all employees at company agree with and embody their corporation's mission state and code of conduct. They just want to get paid so they can afford to live. Sure their are some company fanatics that drink the cool aid, but they are just looking for a paycheck to make ends meat.

	Sam Harris is also incoherent about intention. He points to stated intentions when they support his ideology narrative, but is often only willing to point out that stated intentions may not be accurate when they contradict his narrative. Evaluating the actual material outcome of a groups' behavior, like body count, and the material conditions that may have given rise to that behavior, cuts through the bullshit of ideology and intention. I don't care if you're trying to kill Hamas soldiers with bombs, you're killing more civilians and you're repeating same justification for atrocities against civilians in just about every war ever. 

	I also don't think that Sam's point about thoughts and emotions being fleeting and his example of not being able to stay upset for very long (unless you actively focus on thinking about whatever it is) has the prescriptive implications that he thinks it has. I agree with his description of what's happening in the mind/brain, but this isn't good or bad, nor does it mean you should just ignore most things that can be upsetting. It seems like Sam is ultimately telling people to let the emotions pass so that material reality can be ignored. This is fine in certain instances like if someone bumps into you by accident. It's antisocial and maladaptive to feel very upset at a person, if at all, especially for very long or if you weren't particularly harmed. However, in a different situation, if you're constantly being exploited at your work everyday, being given more and more work to do, with little to no increase in pay or no wage adjustments for inflations, letting the thoughts and unpleasant emotions associated with these conditions to just pass and die down encourages the normalization of these worsening material conditions that impact you physically and emotionally day in and day out. In this instance, the fleetingness or dulling of human thoughts and emotions caused by our neurobiology, can be arguably maladaptive to us as humans beings in the long run by influencing us to accept being worse off materially for unjust reasons.

	Also, the Khmer Rouge example is kind of ridiculous if you dig into it. You need to separate out differences between Marxism, Marxism Leninism, ML-MZT, and analyze what was done by the Khmer Rouge vs what is supported by the variants of Marxist theory. It complicated, but I think Pol Pot was a clearly a totalitarian fascist opportunist masquerading as a communist, who had connections to Reagan and CIA, and was ultimately defeated by actual Vietnamese Communists.

	His point about Murray (being called a good friend by Harris, and yet hasn't discussed his right-wing bent) being supportive of Orban as "have to pick the allies you can find" flies right in the face of his claim that the left was essentially supporting Hamas after October 7. Get rekt! The left was supporting civilian lives not being murdered by Israeli bombing. 

	This was a disgusting interview and Harris really was allowed to belabor Zionist talking points ad nauseam. The DTG lads needed to call him out way more. Harris claiming he had to leave so he could press his points and run when pressed.

		2. he says to take jihadists at their word and "academics" don't believe them when they say they believe in heaven. But he also doesn't take Hamas at their word when they say will not kill all jews and they indirectly acknowledge Israel's existence by demanding the 1967 borders
		
		3. finally he makes the wild claim that if it wasn't for the jihadist element in Islam, the conflict would have long been resolved. As if fighting for independence, land and self-determination are unique to Islam
		
		he did not "concede" points on every issue. He maintained his position on basically everything, with a step back on the lab leak stuff
		
		edit: oh and I forgot to add the Douglas Murray stuff. wow. 
		
		4.publicly stating he is willing to make allies with illiberal christian far-right, in order to "fight" islam. This hints at his history of spreading the Eurabia conspiracy (a.k.a The Great Replacement). Most infamously, France is supposed to be majority muslim in 2031. Only 7 more years!

	Great episode so far. Something that struck me - and always strikes me when encountering the framing of revelations about the illusory nature of self and mind toward which people like Sam Harris are inclined - is the apparent ignorance of/disregard for the different functioning of some minds. There’s a tendency to frame the disintegration of self through introspection (or psychedelics) as a nearly universally positive outcome; while I agree that the most anodyne insights sited as resulting from such experiences - for example, the awareness that thoughts and emotions are transitory and intertwined that Harris references in this episode - can improve most people’s ability to regulate their emotions, as a person who has severe panic attacks, I also know intimately the darker side of that coin.

	Because I have panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, it’s actually very easy for me to lose the thread of continuity that connects my autobiographical experience of time and my own life, as well as the sense of myself as a cohesive whole (what Harris discusses as the self as subject herein). From his position on the goals of mediation, this means I’m ahead of the curve; however, I’m keenly aware that, in practice, that experience is terrifying and makes it extremely difficult for me to function in a world that DOES rely on us all perceiving ourselves AS selves, time as linear, etc. I’m not saying the epiphanies he describes are bad, but I wish more meditation/psychedelics advocates would account for the fact that there are certain types of people for whom the most profound results of that kind of introspection are actually kind of dangerous, and that there’s states of mind in which the distance from thought and experience that are required to make those revelations functionally applicable are impossible.

	I think this is the first time I heard more from Sam Harris than a snippet here and there, and I always pictured him being a little more mindful in the way he's debating. I wouldn't say his arguments were that bad - although unconvincing for me in the end - but the interrupting and the repeating of points that were already acknowledged by matt and chris got pretty annoying during the Gaza discussion. Still worth listening though if you don't know too much about Sams views I guess.
