## Better luck next life!

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nonduality/comments/1bv9oqb/better_luck_next_life/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nonduality/comments/1bv9oqb/better_luck_next_life/)

> I just need to vent here.
> 
> I was listening to a lecture series about the Mandukya Upanishad, and it's starting to explain a lot about the behavior I see here. The Swami tells his students, “This alone is sufficient to liberate you. If you can just understand this teaching, you will be liberated.” I feel like claims like this explain why everyone is so eager to one-up each other on this subreddit and why everyone is so rude to each other. Some of you have been led to believe your intellectual understanding gives you spiritual superiority.
> 
> If you feel a compulsion to showcase your understanding of Advaita Vedanta and let us know you are more realized than the other person, that is all ego, not realization. It's not a hard philosophy to understand. A person of average intelligence could easily understand it. When someone in the Swami's class said, "I understand this, but I’m still suffering," he first suggested the person didn’t actually understand it. When that failed to satiate the doubts, he told a cute little story that ended with the sentiment “better luck next life.”
> 
> It's insane to think that if your life is in turmoil, an intellectual understanding of a philosophy will liberate you. If your teacher isn’t enlightened, why should you be any different?
> 
> I agree with Ram Dass when he says that if you get it and you’re still suffering, you might have some karma that needs to be resolved. But I would argue it is more than that. I would argue it only feeds the flames. A restless mind needs a practice to become quiet, not more intellectual activity. Swami Vivekananda said it has the potential to liberate, not that it will necessarily liberate you. There are other factors involved here. If you have no experience with yoga (your body is a mess), if you’ve never even tried to meditate (your mind is a mess), if you don’t learn to breathe correctly—in other words, if you're not primed for liberation—I doubt it is that easy. It is just feeding ego, giving the mind more ideas to obsess over. More insights to be proud of. Isn’t liberation about ego transcendence and stilling the mind?
> 
> “I understand it best, so I am your spiritual superior” is the attitude I see, not genuine heartfelt insights.
> 
> Then there are those who take Vedanta’s “highest teaching” to mean the more advanced path. How is an intellectual trapped in samsara better than a yogi trapped in samsara? A yogi who is actually working to become a better individual for himself and those around him, as opposed to an intellectual just looking to argue?
> 
> I also want to say Not all Swamis are enlightened. Some are actually just trying to do a job- to make a living, like a cop or firefighter. All commendable occupations, btw. They get mad when a phone rings in their class, like a normal person—they are not perfect like Jesus. It is Ok to question them. Despite my criticism, this is still a great man whom I respect.
> 
> Every day I read a post that says, “I am done with non-duality.” Does that mean they never actually understood it? This Swami would say they never did. But I firmly believe that you must work to bring what is abstract into direct realization. One is all head, one is all heart.
> 
> At this point many of you are feeling the irresistible urge to say “there is no one to realize anything.” Have you asked why you have this compulsion? Don’t get me wrong, I’m here on Reddit, so I obviously have work myself. I just want to highlight the incongruity here. This is a philosophy based on experience, which many of you seem to take on faith, with little or no self inquiry.
> 
> Again “what self? What self?!”
> 
> Then there is this aversion to meditation that boggles my mind. The Mandukya Upanishad is a meditation on the syllable AUM. It is a technique meant to be applied in meditation. It is a truth to be realized in meditation. Why such an aversion to meditation? To experience? To self inquiry? To work?

	Well said

	I arrived at non-dual practice after several near death experiences. The truth was revealed without words. Then in the aftermath, ego got strong again and I needed to reverse engineer what happened. So I'm doing things kind of backwards, from a traditional point of view.  I don't meditate regularly, mostly because letting go of mind is easy for me. I find the teachings more useful than meditation. 

	You can meditate your whole life and still not "get it." I lived in a Buddhist monastery for 3 years and it was a waste of time compared to the insight gained by almost dying.  

	At an entry level, if you can't let go of mind or even recognize the difference between mind and consciousness, then yes you must meditate. At some point though, everything becomes a meditation, if you are earnest. I can meditate while walking or doing the dishes or even while I'm seemingly being social with friends. It's about how awareness is focused.  I agree there are a lot of lazy practitioners. I've lived with them. They think attending endless satsangs and hanging out with sangha means they're on the right path, but they are as lost as ever. 

	There doesn't seem to be any substitute for genuine awakening and I'm not sure if there is any real formula for making it happen.

		Sounds like your experience was totally transformative. That’s awesome. When I say meditation , I’m talking more of meditation in the yogic, tantric sense. Beyond mindfulness or calm abiding. Working with kundalini and the central channel to experience deeper, non dual meditative states. To slowly get in the habit of thinking non conceptually. Something that requires total focus and practice. Working to basically take apart the ego using tantric methods. Something that is very hard to do once you begin to move around. As soon as you begin to navigate the world, subtle egoistic movements always return and our perspective again narrows. But my ego was pretty destructive, so it’s not something some people need or even should do.

			I am on the Vedantic path so to speak, and I don't relate to the yogic or tantric approaches, though I have tried them and know people who are deeply into them. Having experienced satvic states through tantra and yoga, in my case the mind is absurdly overpowered and I find the intellectual/knowledge based path of Vedanta is the only way to reckon with it so that it lets go. They are all different paths leading to the same thing though. 
			
			
			Interesting that you mention the destructive ego. A lot of people I've met who "get it" have suffered horribly and somehow that seems to be a key ingredient. Not that we would wish it upon anyone.

				If I understand you right, we are both working to cultivate concentration. To eliminate the things that distract us and keep us unhappy. In my case, it is dealing with destructive habits and emotions, in your case it is your intelligence. Is that right? 
				
				And I would totally agree with suffering. To identify the fact that we suffer only in opinion requires intimate knowledge of it.

				* 🟪 **[DruidWonder](https://www.reddit.com/user/DruidWonder)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-04-06 14:28:55)_

					Well, a life of comfort is not really conducive to awakening. Usually the opposite is what triggers it. The suffering gets so intense that it suspends belief in the apparent world, and then there's truth in that.
					
					Personally, I am less interested in happiness than truth. I know some people get to a certain level on the path where they reckon with their human psychology, and then that helps them feel content enough to return to believing in Maya. Whereas in my case, I have mostly turned away from the apparent world -- I do not find there are any solutions to be found by chasing it. Liberation can't be found there. Once I abided in what was real for the first time years ago, I couldn't "unsee it." It's always there, whether I am apparently happy, sad, ecstatic, joyful, depressed, etc. The temporary states of the mind-body make no difference. So for me it's too late to go back into the comfortable lie. I have to go all the way or remain stuck somewhere in the middle, which is actually torture and feels like purgatory.
					
					It turns out that awakening is actually the easy part. The hard part is reckoning with all the false realities and egos that arise, one by one, to maintain clarity in the pond. Otherwise all the ripples create distortions. It's easy to feel nice and clear while meditating, but then you get up, stub your toe, feel pain, and you're in Samsara again. Reckoning with things like that, one by one, while abiding in what is real, is tricky.

						But the truth makes you happy doesn’t it? That is what gives you fulfillment right? Same here. I came to non duality after ego death. I wanted to understand what happened and what I experienced. Understanding that, specifically Mandukya, led me to meditation. The conceptual mind just couldn’t grasp the truth. Not only that but it increased my mental attachments and gave me more to mull over. So it became problematic for me. Again, this is just my experience. It all leads us to liberation, which is inherently blissful. I think we all know the truth and happiness are related. I mean just saying the word, pure consciousness can put me into a meditative state. But my problem was it just couldn’t be conveyed with words, so it felt like I came to a point where faith was required, and I had none. When I began to practice kundalini I realized that the insights meditation offers are immediate while syllogisms are not. This appealed to me. Being a former addict, I had little patience. That all changed in meditation. The truth is right under the surface. But the greatest thing I learned was that consciousness is inherently blissful and that bliss is starting to leak out into my waking experience, which is why I get on my soapbox . As a student of western philosophy, The truth was what made me happy, and that truth was always there to be realized immediately. Again everyone has different experiences. I find your perspective interesting and totally respect it. But what I’m ultimately saying is the truth doesn’t increase our suffering, it leads us to liberation which is blissful. I’m not sure any of this is indicative of me being happy to return to ignorance as you said. It all leads to the truth, one requires study one meditation. But it is always experience which informs knowledge.

							It seems we are just splitting hairs at this point, given what you just said. Bliss and happiness are not the same thing. Bliss is nondual nature. Happiness is a temporary emotional state.
							
							If the person's body is being tortured by a sadist but the consciousness is abiding in nondual bliss, then is the body happy? Probably not because it's in pain. However, the body has no effect on the atman (the "real self") so the bliss is unbroken.
							
							This is why happiness has very little to do with it. Even after realization, the mind-body does what it does, has its emotional states, has its momentary pains... but consciousness isn't attached to that. I mean, it's always been that way but I guess ego clouds the reality of it.
							
							Basically... "happiness" occurs in the realm of experience, while the real self, the nondual self, cannot be found in experience. The nondual self cannot "make" the mind-body happy. If the mind-body is happy of its own accord, then great... but that state will always be temporary because it's in the experience realm.

	Thanks. Brilliant. 

	I will note most everything I write, this applies to me. Idk what I'm doin but I'm also not sure what everyone else doin. I try to be empathic but do realize I think the "try" is ego. Have to stop trying and just flow, I think would be what perfect as Jesus means.... he said be perfect in way that he is perfect. Idk because we only have his own words of what he is and he himself said if he bears witness of himself it is false.

	Yes I am awful/terrible about intellectual understanding. I feel rebuked there, raining on everyone's parade. I became the thing I swore to destroy. *Any greater oath comes of evil*, eh?

	Also will say I'm 99% sure the "anti meditation" is a gag/"trolling". It's a group of vultures standing around a fire hydrant saying it's dangerous to go near the fire hydrant it will spread the fire faster if you touch it! Essentially. 

	Zen point blank translates as "meditation" but most I have seen speak on zen say meditation is a cult. So are saying zen is a cult, thus a joke or gag or "in joke" basically. 

	But yeah what is zen, what is meditation. Idk.

	Also speaking of zen you pwnt the hell out of me lmao.

	>"A sound soul, dwells within a sound mind, and a sound body"

	In Japanese that is "ken zen" first two words. Pwnt to hell and back you intellectualized one of my old favorite *Animes* trademark line and humbled me with it, lmao 🤣 namaste 🙏

	May your meditations on AUM be fruitful in this Life! 

	It’s the Primordial vibrational energy in which universe comes to existence from its potential. Great Advaita meditation from its origins. 

	I Understand your concern with forum noises. Be at peace.  It’s nature of the non dual bazaar. If I feel like I might comment ( who knows how it is but take care to respect )  but generally live and let things be. Maybe all the  haji Bhaji  makes the bazaar ambience.

	The mind doesnt exist. If u wanna make a practice: take a step back from ur crazy thoughts and just observe...do this over and over. Return to yourself over and over. States are never permanent unless we keep giving power

		Saying the mind doesn’t exist is the equivalent of a child plugging their ears with their fingers and yelling “BLAH BLAH BLAH I CANT HEAR YOUUUU”.
		
		The mind exists, in the exact same way everything else exists. You cannot suppress the mind, and as you may try to—you are creating unrest within yourself. 
		
		Your second half rings with truth, that you can become *separate* from mind, letting it continue its functions of thought without identifying with its actions.

					That is a practice called mindfulness. I’m not talking about taking vows of celibacy here… merely suggesting we all learn techniques to deal with the mind instead of philosophy.

							That is literally what is meant by practice. I think you Advaita people are so used to approaching things conceptually, when the opposite is suggested your brains short circuit . You are trapped in argument mode. Even when you are agreeing with me. Still, even with mindfulness you still need a practice to deal with emotions. Thoughts are only one layer of the self. What are you going to do when an unconscious mental habit triggers your ego?

	I don't read all the posts but I can't say I've come across any that seem that haughty or judgemental, like they know better.  I generally see a genuine attempt to help/understand/community. Maybe if you identified specific posts then maybe we can see if we're on the same page.  But even if there were such a judgemental post,  it is all part of the fabric, it is the Unity practicing self-deception as usual. 

	I didn't have the irresistible urge as you describe but I don't think there's anything wrong with that. If that urge was there, it would be arising from Unity.  

	But the urge I did have was: Have you wondered why these posts are bothering you? 

	As an intellectual counterpoint, I don't think you have to do work at all. If you want to do work, great go for it. If not, that is also fine. It is all good. 

	Maybe you'll find this video useful:

Or I see people on the cusp of liberation only to see the ego come back with a vengeance. In both cases there is regression. Just words of warning. It is my sentimentality.
