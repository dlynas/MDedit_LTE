From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

**Full-reserve banking** (also known as **100% reserve banking**, or **sovereign money system**) is a system of banking where banks do not lend [demand deposits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_deposit "Demand deposit") and instead only lend from [time deposits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_deposits "Time deposits"). It differs from [fractional-reserve banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking "Fractional-reserve banking"), in which banks may lend funds on deposit, while fully reserved banks would be required to keep the full amount of each customer's [demand deposits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposit_account "Deposit account") in [cash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash "Cash"), available for immediate withdrawal.

[Monetary reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_reform "Monetary reform") that included full-reserve banking have been proposed in the past, notably in 1935 by a group of economists, including [Irving Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Fisher "Irving Fisher"), under the so-called "[Chicago plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_plan "Chicago plan")" as a response to the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression").<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>

Currently, no country in the world requires full-reserve banking across primary credit institutions, although Iceland has considered it.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> In [a 2018 ballot referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Swiss_sovereign-money_initiative "2018 Swiss sovereign-money initiative"), 75% of Swiss voters voted against the [Sovereign Money Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_Money_Initiative "Sovereign Money Initiative") which had full reserve banking as a prominent component of its proposed reform of the Swiss monetary system.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

### In favor\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Full-reserve_banking&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: In favor")\]

Economist [Milton Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman "Milton Friedman") at one time advocated a 100% [reserve requirement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_requirement "Reserve requirement") for checking accounts,<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> and economist [Laurence Kotlikoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Kotlikoff "Laurence Kotlikoff") has also called for an end to fractional-reserve banking.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-:3-9">[9]</a></sup> [Austrian School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School "Austrian School") economist [Murray Rothbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard "Murray Rothbard") has written that reserves of less than 100% constitute fraud on the part of banks and should be illegal, and that full-reserve banking would eliminate the risk of [bank runs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run "Bank run").<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-The_Case_for_a_100%_Gold_Dollar_11-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-The_Case_for_a_100%_Gold_Dollar-11">[11]</a></sup> [Jesús Huerta de Soto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jes%C3%BAs_Huerta_de_Soto "Jesús Huerta de Soto"), another economist of the Austrian school, has also strongly argued in favor of full-reserve banking and the outlawing of [fractional reserve banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_reserve_banking "Fractional reserve banking").<sup id="cite_ref-Soto_12-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-Soto-12">[12]</a></sup>

The [financial crisis of 2007–2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008 "Financial crisis of 2007–2008") led to renewed interest in full reserve banking and [sovereign money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_money "Sovereign money") issued by a [central bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank "Central bank"). [Monetary reformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_reform "Monetary reform") point out that fractional reserve banking leads to unpayable debt, growing [economic inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality "Economic inequality"), inevitable [bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy "Bankruptcy"), and an imperative for perpetual and [unsustainable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability "Sustainability") [economic growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth "Economic growth").<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> [Martin Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Wolf "Martin Wolf"), chief economist at the _[Financial Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times "Financial Times")_, endorsed full reserve banking, saying "it would bring huge advantages".<sup id="cite_ref-Weisenthal_14-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-Weisenthal-14">[14]</a></sup>

[Martin Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Wolf "Martin Wolf"), Chief Economics Commentator at the _[Financial Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times "Financial Times")_, argues that many people have a fundamentally flawed and oversimplified conception of what it is that banks do. [Laurence Kotlikoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Kotlikoff "Laurence Kotlikoff") and [Edward Leamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_E._Leamer "Edward E. Leamer") agree, in a paper entitled "A Banking System We Can Trust", arguing that the current financial system did not produce the benefits that have been attributed to it.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_9-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-:3-9">[9]</a></sup> Rather than simply borrowing money from savers to make loans towards investment and production, and holding "money" as a stable liability, banks in reality create credit increasingly for the purpose of acquiring existing assets.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_15-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-:1-15">[15]</a></sup> Rather than financing real productivity and investment, and generating fair asset prices, Wall Street has come to resemble a casino, in which trade volume of securities skyrockets without having positive impacts on the investment rate or economic growth.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_9-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-:3-9">[9]</a></sup> The credits and debt banks create play a role in determining how delicate the economy is in the face of crisis.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_15-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-:1-15">[15]</a></sup> For example, Wall Street caused the housing bubble by financing millions of mortgages that were outside budget constraints, which in turn decreased output by 10 percent.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_9-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-:3-9">[9]</a></sup>

#### Money supply problems\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Full-reserve_banking&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Money supply problems")\]

In _[The Mystery of Banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mystery_of_Banking "The Mystery of Banking")_, [Murray Rothbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard "Murray Rothbard") argues that legalized fractional-reserve banking gave banks "carte blanche" to create money out of thin air.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_16-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-:4-16">[16]</a></sup> Economists that formulated the Chicago Plan following the Great Depression argue that allowing banks to have fractional reserves puts too much power in the hands of banks by allowing them to determine the amount of money in circulation by changing the amount of loans they give out.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

#### Fractional-reserve banking fraud issues\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Full-reserve_banking&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Fractional-reserve banking fraud issues")\]

Deposit bankers become loan bankers when they issue fake warehouse receipts that are not backed by the assets actually held, thus constituting fraud.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_16-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-:4-16">[16]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This citation requires a reference to the specific page or range of pages in which the material appears. (February 2022)">page&nbsp;needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Rothbard likens this practice to counterfeiting, with the loan banker extracting resources from the public.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_16-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-:4-16">[16]</a></sup> However, [Bryan Caplan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Caplan "Bryan Caplan") argues that fractional-reserve banking does not constitute fraud, as by Rothbard's own admission an advertised product must simply meet the "common definition" of that product believed by consumers. Caplan contends that it is part of the common definition of a modern bank to make loans against demand deposits, thus not constituting fraud.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>

#### Balance sheet fundamentals\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Full-reserve_banking&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Balance sheet fundamentals")\]

Furthermore, Rothbard argues that fractional reserve banking is fundamentally unsound because of the timescale of a bank's balance sheet.<sup id="cite_ref-:42_19-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-:42-19">[19]</a></sup> While a typical firm should have its assets be due prior to the payment date of its liabilities, so that the liabilities can be paid, the fractional reserve deposit bank has its demand deposit liabilities due at any point the depositor chooses, and its assets, being the loans it has made with someone else's deposits, due at some later date.<sup id="cite_ref-:42_19-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-:42-19">[19]</a></sup>

### Against\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Full-reserve_banking&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Against")\]

#### New fees\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Full-reserve_banking&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: New fees")\]

Some economists have noted that under full-reserve banking, because banks would not earn revenue from lending against demand deposits, depositors would have to pay fees for the services associated with checking accounts. This, it is felt, would probably be rejected by the public.<sup id="cite_ref-White2003_20-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-White2003-20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Allen_1993_703–717_21-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-Allen_1993_703%E2%80%93717-21">[21]</a></sup> However, in economies where central banks enact zero and negative interest rate policies, some writers have noted depositors are already paying to put their savings in fractional reserve banks.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

#### Shadow banking and unregulated institutions\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Full-reserve_banking&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Shadow banking and unregulated institutions")\]

In their [influential paper on financial crises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond%E2%80%93Dybvig_model "Diamond–Dybvig model"), economists [Douglas W. Diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_W._Diamond "Douglas W. Diamond") and [Philip H. Dybvig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_H._Dybvig "Philip H. Dybvig") warned that under full-reserve banking, since banks would not be permitted to lend out funds deposited in demand accounts, this function would be taken over by unregulated institutions. Unregulated institutions (such as [high-yield debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-yield_debt "High-yield debt") issuers) would take over the economically necessary role of [financial intermediation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_intermediation "Financial intermediation") and [maturity transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maturity_transformation "Maturity transformation"), therefore destabilizing the financial system and leading to more frequent financial crises.<sup id="cite_ref-Diamond-Dybvig_23-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-Diamond-Dybvig-23">[23]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

Writing in response to various writers' support for full reserve banking, [Paul Krugman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krugman "Paul Krugman") stated that the idea was "certainly worth talking about", but worries that it would drive financial activity outside the banking system, into the less regulated [shadow banking system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_banking_system "Shadow banking system").<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup>

#### Misses the problem\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Full-reserve_banking&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Misses the problem")\]

[Krugman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krugman "Paul Krugman") argues that the 2008 financial crisis was not largely a result of depositors attempting to withdraw deposits from commercial banks, but a large-scale run on shadow banking.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_26-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-:2-26">[26]</a></sup> As financial markets seemed to have recovered more quickly than the 'real economy', Krugman sees the recession more as a result of excess leverage and household balance-sheet issues.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_26-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-:2-26">[26]</a></sup> Neither of these issues would be addressed by a full-reserve regulation on commercial banks, he claims.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_26-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-:2-26">[26]</a></sup>

## Further reform\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Full-reserve_banking&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Further reform")\]

Kotlikoff and Leamer promote the concept of limited purpose banking (LPB), in which banks, now mutual funds, would never fail, as they would be barred from owning financial assets, and their borrowing would be limited to financing their own operations.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_9-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-:3-9">[9]</a></sup> By establishing a Federal Financial Authority, with the task of rating, verifying, disclosing and clearing all LPB mutual funds, there would be no need to outsource such tasks to private entities with perverse incentives or lack of oversight.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_9-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-:3-9">[9]</a></sup> Cash mutual funds would also be created, holding only cash tied to the value of the United States dollar, eliminating the threat of bank runs, and insurance mutual funds would be established to pay off the losses of those that own part of the mutual fund, as insurance companies are currently able to sell plans that purport to insure events for which it would be impossible for them to pay off the entirety of the losses experienced by the insured parties.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_9-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-:3-9">[9]</a></sup> The authors contend that LPB can accommodate any conceivable risk product, including [credit default swaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap "Credit default swap").<sup id="cite_ref-:3_9-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-:3-9">[9]</a></sup> Under LPB, liquidity would increase as such funds become publicly available to the market, which would determine how much bank employees would be paid.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_9-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-:3-9">[9]</a></sup>

Most importantly, what limited purpose banking won't do is leave any bank exposed to [CDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Default_Swap "Credit Default Swap") risk since people, not banks, would own the CDS mutual funds.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_9-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking#cite_note-:3-9">[9]</a></sup>

Furthermore, the proposal is likely to be ineffective in increasing stability since it will be impossible to control the institutions that will enter in the vacuum left when banks can no longer create liquidity. Fortunately, the political realities make it unlikely that this radical and imprudent proposal will be adopted.
