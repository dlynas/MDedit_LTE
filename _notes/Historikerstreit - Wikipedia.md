The _**Historikerstreit**_ (German: [\[hɪsˈtoːʁɪkɐˌʃtʁaɪt\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German "Help:IPA/Standard German") [](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/6/6b/De-Historikerstreit.ogg/De-Historikerstreit.ogg.mp3 "Play audio")<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:De-Historikerstreit.ogg" title="File:De-Historikerstreit.ogg">ⓘ</a></sup>, "historians' dispute")<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> was a dispute in the late 1980s in [West Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany "West Germany") between [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative "Conservative") and [left-of-center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-of-center "Left-of-center") academics and other intellectuals about how to incorporate [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany") and [the Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust "The Holocaust") into German [historiography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography "Historiography"), and more generally into the German people's view of themselves.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> The dispute was initiated with the [Bitburg controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitburg_controversy "Bitburg controversy"), which related to a commemorative service at a German military cemetery where members of the [Waffen-SS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffen-SS "Waffen-SS") were buried. The service was attended by [President of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States") [Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan "Ronald Reagan"), who had been invited by the West German Chancellor [Helmut Kohl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Kohl "Helmut Kohl"). The Bitburg ceremony was widely interpreted in Germany as the beginning of the "normalization" of the nation's Nazi past, and inspired a slew of criticisms and defenses that made up the initiating arguments of the _Historikerstreit_. The dispute quickly outgrew the initial context of the Bitburg controversy, however, and became a series of broader historiographic, political, and critical debates about how the episode of the Holocaust should be understood in Germany's history and identity.

The position taken by conservative intellectuals, most prominently [Ernst Nolte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Nolte "Ernst Nolte"), was that the Holocaust was not unique and therefore Germans should not bear any special burden of guilt for the "[Final Solution to the Jewish Question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Solution_to_the_Jewish_Question "Final Solution to the Jewish Question")".<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Pakier_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Pakier-4">[4]</a></sup> Nolte argued that there was no moral difference between the crimes of the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") and those of Nazi Germany, and that the Nazis acted as they did out of fear of what the Soviet Union might do to Germany.<sup id="cite_ref-Kattago,_Siobhan_Ambiguous_Memory_page_62_5-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Kattago,_Siobhan_Ambiguous_Memory_page_62-5">[5]</a></sup> Others argued that the memory of the Nazi era could not be "normalized" and be a source of national pride,<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> and that it echoed [Nazi propaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_propaganda "Nazi propaganda").<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> Other central questions and topics debated within the dispute included the singularity of the Holocaust, the [functionalist and intentionalist models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism%E2%80%93intentionalism_debate "Functionalism–intentionalism debate") of the Holocaust, methodological approaches to historiography, the political utility of history, the question of whether the Holocaust ought to be studied comparatively, and ethics of public commemorations of history.

The debate attracted much media attention in West Germany, with its participants frequently giving television interviews and writing [op-ed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editorial "Editorial") pieces in newspapers. It flared up again briefly in 2000 when Nolte, one of its leading figures, was awarded the [Konrad Adenauer Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Adenauer_Prize "Konrad Adenauer Prize") for science.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

## Background\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Background")\]

Immediately after [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), intense debates arose in intellectual circles about how to interpret Nazi Germany, a contested discussion that continues today. Two of the more hotly debated questions were whether [Nazism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism "Nazism") was in some way part of the "German national character" and how much responsibility, if any, the German people bore for the crimes of Nazism. Various non-German historians in the immediate post-war era, such as [A. J. P. Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._P._Taylor "A. J. P. Taylor") and Sir [Lewis Namier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Namier "Lewis Namier"), argued that Nazism was the culmination of German history and that the vast majority of Germans were responsible for Nazi crimes. Different assessments of Nazism were common among [Marxists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist "Marxist"), who insisted on the economic aspects of Nazism and conceived of it as the culmination of a capitalist crisis, and [liberals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism "Liberalism"), who emphasized [Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler")'s personal role and responsibility and bypassed the larger problem of the relation of ordinary German people to the regime.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> Within [West Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany "West Germany"), then, most historians were strongly defensive. In the assessment of [Gerhard Ritter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_Ritter "Gerhard Ritter") and others, Nazism was a [totalitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarian "Totalitarian") movement that represented only the work of a small criminal clique<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (January 2017)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>; Germans were victims of Nazism, and the Nazi era represented a total break in German history.

Starting in the 1960s, that assessment was challenged by younger German historians. [Fritz Fischer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Fischer_(historian) "Fritz Fischer (historian)") argued in favor of a _[Sonderweg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonderweg "Sonderweg")_ conception of German history that saw Nazism as the result of the way German society had developed. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the [functionalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism_versus_intentionalism "Functionalism versus intentionalism") school of historiography emerged; its proponents argued that medium- and lower-ranking German officials were not just obeying orders and policies but actively engaged in the making of the policies that led to the Holocaust. The functionalists thereby cast blame for the Holocaust across a wider circle. Many right-wing German historians disliked the implications of the _Sonderweg_ conception and the functionalist school; they were generally identified with the left and [structuralism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism "Structuralism") and were seen by the right-wingers as being derogatory toward Germany<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (January 2017)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>.

By the mid-1980s, right-wing German historians began to think that enough time had passed since 1945 and thus it was time for the German nation to start celebrating much of its history again<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (January 2017)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>. A sign of the changed mood was the ceremony at [Bitburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitburg "Bitburg") in May 1985, where US President [Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan "Ronald Reagan") and West German Chancellor [Helmut Kohl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Kohl "Helmut Kohl") honored the German war dead buried at Bitburg, including the SS men buried there, which was widely seen as a sign that the memory of the Nazi past had been "normalized" (i.e., that the Nazi period was "normal" and therefore Germans should not feel guilty).<sup id="cite_ref-:4_10-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:4-10">[10]</a></sup> President Reagan justified laying a wreath to honor all the Germans buried at Bitburg who died fighting for Hitler, including the SS men, and his initial refusal to visit the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp under the grounds that the SS men buried at Bitburg were just as much victims of Hitler as the Jews murdered by the SS and that "They \[the Germans\] just have a guilt feeling that's been imposed on them and I just think it's unnecessary".<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> The ceremony at Bitburg and Reagan's remarks about the need to do away with a German "guilt feeling" about the Nazi past were widely interpreted by German conservatives as the beginning of the "normalization" of the memory of Nazi Germany.<sup id="cite_ref-:6_12-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:6-12">[12]</a></sup> [Michael Stürmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_St%C3%BCrmer "Michael Stürmer")'s 1986 article "Land without History" questioned Germany's lack of positive history in which to take pride.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> Stürmer's position as Chancellor Kohl's advisor and speechwriter heightened the controversy.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> At the same time, many left-wing German historians disliked what they saw as the nationalistic tone of the Kohl government.

A project that raised the ire of many on the left, and which became a central issue of the _Historikerstreit_,<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> consisted of two proposed museums celebrating modern German history, to be built in [West Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Berlin "West Berlin") and [Bonn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonn "Bonn"). Many of the left-wing participants in the _Historikerstreit_ claimed that the museum was meant to "exonerate" the German past and asserted that there was a connection between the proposed museum, the government, and the views of such historians as [Michael Stürmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_St%C3%BCrmer "Michael Stürmer"), [Ernst Nolte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Nolte "Ernst Nolte"), and [Andreas Hillgruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Hillgruber "Andreas Hillgruber"). In October 1986, [Hans Mommsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Mommsen "Hans Mommsen") wrote that Stürmer's assertion that he who controls the past also controls the future, his work as a co-editor of the _Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung_ newspaper—which had been publishing articles by [Ernst Nolte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Nolte "Ernst Nolte") and [Joachim Fest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_Fest "Joachim Fest") denying the "singularity" of the Holocaust—and his work as an advisor to Chancellor Kohl should cause "concern" among historians.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>

## Overview\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Overview")\]

### Participants\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Participants")\]

On one side were the philosopher and historian [Ernst Nolte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Nolte "Ernst Nolte"), the journalist [Joachim Fest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_Fest "Joachim Fest"), and the historians [Andreas Hillgruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Hillgruber "Andreas Hillgruber"), [Klaus Hildebrand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Hildebrand "Klaus Hildebrand"), [Rainer Zitelmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Zitelmann "Rainer Zitelmann"), [Hagen Schulze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagen_Schulze "Hagen Schulze"), and [Michael Stürmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_St%C3%BCrmer "Michael Stürmer"). Opposing them were the philosopher [Jürgen Habermas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas "Jürgen Habermas") and the historians [Hans-Ulrich Wehler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Ulrich_Wehler "Hans-Ulrich Wehler"), [Jürgen Kocka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Kocka "Jürgen Kocka"), [Hans Mommsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Mommsen "Hans Mommsen"), [Martin Broszat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Broszat "Martin Broszat"), [Heinrich August Winkler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_August_Winkler "Heinrich August Winkler"), [Eberhard Jäckel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberhard_J%C3%A4ckel "Eberhard Jäckel"), and [Wolfgang Mommsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Mommsen "Wolfgang Mommsen"). [Karl Dietrich Bracher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Dietrich_Bracher "Karl Dietrich Bracher") and [Richard Löwenthal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_L%C3%B6wenthal "Richard Löwenthal") argued for some compromise; they said that comparing different totalitarian systems was a valid intellectual exercise, but they insisted that the Holocaust should not be compared to other genocides.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (December 2019)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

### Issues\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Issues")\]

The views of [Ernst Nolte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Nolte "Ernst Nolte") and [Jürgen Habermas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas "Jürgen Habermas") were at the center of the debate, conducted almost exclusively through articles and [letters to the editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_to_the_editor "Letter to the editor") in the newspapers _[Die Zeit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Zeit "Die Zeit")_ and the _[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurter_Allgemeine_Zeitung "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung")_. People in West Germany followed the debate with interest.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The debate was noted for its vitriolic and aggressive tone, with the participants often engaging in _ad hominem_ attacks.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> In Hillgruber's 1986 book, _Zweierlei Untergang_ ("Two Kinds of Downfall: The Smashing of the German Reich and the End of European Jewry"), he lamented the mass expulsions of [ethnic Germans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_Germans "Ethnic Germans") from Czechoslovakia and Poland at the end of World War II and compared the suffering of the _[Heimatvertriebene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimatvertriebene "Heimatvertriebene")_ ("those expelled from their native land") to that of victims of the Holocaust.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Hillgruber had not supported Nolte, but the controversy over _Zweierlei Untergang_ became linked with Nolte's views when Habermas and Wehler characterized both men as conservatives trying to minimize Nazi crimes.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

The debate centered on four questions:<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

-   Were the crimes of [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany") uniquely evil or were other crimes, such as those of [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin") in the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union"), comparably so? Were other [genocides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide "Genocide") comparable to the Holocaust? Many scholars believed that such comparisons trivialized the Holocaust. Others maintained that the Holocaust could best be understood in the context of other crimes.
-   Did German history follow a "special path" (_[Sonderweg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonderweg "Sonderweg")_) leading inevitably to [Nazism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism "Nazism")?
-   Were the crimes of the Nazis a reaction to Soviet crimes under Stalin?
-   Should the German people bear a special burden of guilt for Nazi crimes, or can new generations of Germans find sources of pride in their history?

## Immediate background\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Immediate background")\]

### "Between Myth and Revisionism"\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: "Between Myth and Revisionism"")\]

In 1980, the _[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurter_Allgemeine_Zeitung "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung")_ newspaper published a _[feuilleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feuilleton "Feuilleton")_ "Between Myth and Revisionism: The Third Reich In the Perspective of the 1980s", where Nolte sketched out many of the same ideas that later appeared in his 1986 essay "The Past That Will Not Go Away". The essay "Between Myth and Revisionism" was also published in English in the 1985 book _Aspects of the Third Reich_ by the Anglo-German historian H. W. Koch, where it was billed incorrectly as an essay written for _Aspects of the Third Reich_. It was the 1985 version of "Between Myth and Revisionism" that Habermas noticed and referred to in his essay "On Damage Control".<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

According to Nolte in “Between Myth and Revisionism”, during the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution") in Britain, the shock of the replacement of the old craft economy by an industrialized, mechanized economy led to various radicals starting to advocate what Nolte calls “annihilation therapy” as the solution to social problems.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> In Nolte's views, the roots of communism can be traced back to 18th and 19th century radicals like [Thomas Spence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Spence "Thomas Spence"), John Gray, William Benbow, Bronterre O’Brian, and [François-Noël Babeuf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois-No%C3%ABl_Babeuf "François-Noël Babeuf").<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> Nolte has argued that the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution "French Revolution") began the practice of “group annihilation” as state policy, but not until the Russian Revolution did the theory of “annihilation therapy” reach its logical conclusion and culmination.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> He asserts that much of the European Left saw social problems as being caused by “diseased” social groups, and sought “annihilation therapy” as the solution, thus leading naturally to the [Red Terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Terror "Red Terror") and the _[Yezhovshchina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yezhovshchina "Yezhovshchina")_ in the Soviet Union.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> Nolte suggests that the Right mirrored the Left, with “annihilation therapy” advocated by such figures as [John Robison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Robison_(physicist) "John Robison (physicist)"), [Augustin Barruel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin_Barruel "Augustin Barruel"), and [Joseph de Maistre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_de_Maistre "Joseph de Maistre"); [Malthusianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusianism "Malthusianism") and the Prussian strategy of utter destruction of one's enemies during the [Napoleonic Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars "Napoleonic Wars") also suggest sources and influences for National Socialism.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> Ultimately, in Nolte's view, the Holocaust was just a “copy” of Communist “annihilation therapy”, albeit one that was more terrible and sickening than the “original”.<sup id="cite_ref-Nolte_in_Koch_1985_p._36_23-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Nolte_in_Koch_1985_p._36-23">[23]</a></sup>

### Bitburg controversy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Bitburg controversy")\]

In 1984, the West German Chancellor [Helmut Kohl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Kohl "Helmut Kohl") invited the U.S. President [Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan "Ronald Reagan") to mark the 40th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe by attending a memorial service at a military cemetery in Bitburg.<sup id="cite_ref-FS430_24-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-FS430-24">[24]</a></sup> Reagan accepted the offer, unaware that members of the Waffen-SS were buried in the Bitburg cemetery, and when this was reported in early 1985, many Americans urged Reagan to cancel the planned visit to Bitburg under the grounds it was offensive for president of the United States to lay a memorial wreath honoring those SS men who died fighting for Hitler.<sup id="cite_ref-FS430_24-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-FS430-24">[24]</a></sup>

Kohl insisted that if Reagan snubbed the Bitburg ceremony that it would be the end of his chancellorship, saying the majority of Germans would find it offensive.<sup id="cite_ref-FS430_24-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-FS430-24">[24]</a></sup> Reagan, arguing that placing a memorial wreath at Bitburg was no different from doing so at Auschwitz, stated that Waffen-SS men who died fighting for Hitler were just as much victims of Hitler as the Jews exterminated in the death camps.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> This clumsy attempt at public relations damage control only increased the controversy, with both veterans' groups and Jewish groups in the United States being adamantly opposed to Reagan attending the Bitburg ceremony.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_26-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:3-26">[26]</a></sup>

Reagan also refused to visit a concentration camp to balance out the visit to the Bitburg cemetery by saying the Germans "have a guilt feeling that's been imposed on them, and I just think it's unnecessary".<sup id="cite_ref-:3_26-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:3-26">[26]</a></sup> The Franco-Romanian Holocaust survivor and writer Elie Wiesel issued a public letter to Reagan saying: "That place, Mr. President, is not your place.

### "History In A Land Without History"\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: "History In A Land Without History"")\]

In a _[feuilleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feuilleton "Feuilleton")_ published in the _Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung_ on 25 April 1986, the German historian [Michael Stürmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_St%C3%BCrmer "Michael Stürmer") complained that most Germans lacked pride in their history, which he felt threatened the future. Stürmer wrote "...that in a land without history, the future is controlled by those who determine the content of memory, who coin concepts and interpret the past".

### _Zweierlei Untergang_\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Zweierlei Untergang")\]

In May 1986, a book by [Andreas Hillgruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Hillgruber "Andreas Hillgruber"), _Zweierlei Untergang: Die Zerschlagung des Deutschen Reiches und das Ende des europäischen Judentums_ (_Two Kinds of Ruin: The Smashing of the German Reich and the End of European Jewry_), was published in Berlin. The book consisted of two essays by Hillgruber, in which he argued the end of Germany as a great power in 1945 and the Holocaust were morally equivalent tragedies.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup>

Much of the controversy generated by _Zweierlei Untergang_ was due to the essay _Der Zusammenbruch im Osten 1944/45_ (_The Collapse in the East 1944/45_) in which Hillgruber presented an account of the Eastern Front in 1944–45 and mourned the end of "the German east". Hillgruber had been born and grew up in the town of Angerburg (modern Węgorzewo, Poland) in what was then East Prussia and often wrote nostalgically about his lost _Heimat_. Hillgruber expressed much anger in _Zweierlei Untergang_ about the Oder-Neisse line, the expulsions of the Germans from Eastern Europe and the partitioning of Germany, all of which he used to argue that the policies of the Allies towards the Germans during and after World War II were just as horrific as the Holocaust.<sup id="cite_ref-:8_35-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:8-35">[35]</a></sup>

In particular, Hillgruber accused Winston Churchill and the rest of the [British government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom "Government of the United Kingdom") of being obsessed with anti-German and anti-Prussian prejudices going back to at least 1907, and maintained it was always Britain's goal to "smash" the German _Reich_. Hillgruber accused the British of holding "a negative image of Prussia, exaggerated to the point of becoming a myth", which according to Hillgruber led them to seek the complete dismantlement of the Prussian-German state in World War II and blinded them to the fact that only a strong Central European state led by Prussia could have prevented the "flooding" of Central Europe by the Red Army.<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup>

Hillgruber in _Der Zusammenbruch im Osten 1944/45_ was also concerned with the "justified" last stand of the Wehrmacht on the Eastern Front in 1944–45, giving a lengthy account of Red Army war crimes against German civilians. Hillgruber argued that the Wehrmacht in 1944-1945 was fighting "for a centuries-old area of German settlement, for the home of millions of Germans who lived in a core of the German _Reich_ - namely in eastern Prussia, in the provinces of East Prussia, West Prussia, Silesia, East Brandenburg and Pomerania".<sup id="cite_ref-:8_35-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:8-35">[35]</a></sup>

Hillgruber wrote:

> "If the historian gazes on the winter catastrophe of 1944–45, only one position is possible...he must identify himself with the concrete fate of the German population in the East and with the desperate and sacrificial exertions of the German Army of the East and the German Baltic navy, which sought to defend the population from the orgy of revenge of the Red Army, the mass rapine, the arbitrary killing, and the compulsory deportations."<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup>

Besides for his call for historians to "identify" with the Wehrmacht, Hillgruber condemned the _putsch_ of 20 July 1944 as irresponsible and wrong and praised those Wehrmacht officers who stayed loyal to Hitler as making the correct moral choice.<sup id="cite_ref-:9_38-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:9-38">[38]</a></sup> Hillgruber argued that the need to protect German civilians from the Red Army should have been the overriding concern of all Wehrmacht officers, which required remaining loyal to Hitler.<sup id="cite_ref-:9_38-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:9-38">[38]</a></sup>

### "The Past That Will Not Pass"\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: "The Past That Will Not Pass"")\]

Nolte launched the _Historikerstreit_ ("Historians' Dispute") on 6 June 1986 with an article in the _[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurter_Allgemeine_Zeitung "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung")_: _Vergangenheit, die nicht vergehen will: Eine Rede, die geschrieben, aber nicht mehr gehalten werden konnte_ ("_The Past That Will Not Pass: A Speech That Could Be Written but Not Delivered_") . His _feuilleton_ was a distillation of ideas he had first introduced in lectures delivered in 1976 and in 1980.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Nolte began his _feuilleton_ by remarking that it was necessary in his opinion to draw a "line under the German past".<sup id="cite_ref-n19_42-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n19-42">[42]</a></sup> Nolte argued that the memory of the Nazi era was "a bugaboo, as a past that in the process of establishing itself in the present or that is suspended above the present like an executioner's sword".<sup id="cite_ref-n18_43-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n18-43">[43]</a></sup> Nolte used as an example of the problem of the "Past That Will Not Go Away" that in Nazi Germany, the "mania of masculinity" was "full of provocative self-confidence", but now German men were afraid to be manly because German feminists had made National Socialism the "present enemy".<sup id="cite_ref-n18_43-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n18-43">[43]</a></sup> In the same way, Nolte charged that Germans were being forced to live under the fear of being labelled anti-semitic; Nolte wrote based on his viewing of the film _Shoah_ it was clear that the SS guards of the death camps were "victims of a sort and that among the Polish victims of National Socialism there was virulent anti-Semitism".<sup id="cite_ref-n20_44-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n20-44">[44]</a></sup>

Nolte complained that excessive present-day interest in the Nazi period had the effect of drawing "attention away from the pressing questions of the present-for example, the question of "unborn life" or the presence of genocide yesterday in Vietnam and today in Afghanistan".<sup id="cite_ref-n19_42-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n19-42">[42]</a></sup> Nolte argued that the furor in 1985 over the visit of the American president [Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan "Ronald Reagan") to the [Bitburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitburg "Bitburg") cemetery reflected in his view the unhealthy effects of an obsession with the memory of the Nazi era.<sup id="cite_ref-n20_44-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n20-44">[44]</a></sup> Nolte suggested that, during [West German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_German "West German") Chancellor [Konrad Adenauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Adenauer "Konrad Adenauer")'s visit to the United States in 1953, if he had failed to visit [Arlington National Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_National_Cemetery "Arlington National Cemetery") a storm of controversy would have ensued.<sup id="cite_ref-n20_44-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n20-44">[44]</a></sup> Nolte argued that since some of the men buried at Arlington had in his view "participated in terror attacks on the German civilian population", there was no moral difference between Reagan visiting the Bitburg cemetery, with its graves of [Waffen SS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffen_SS "Waffen SS") dead, and Adenauer visiting Arlington with its graves of American airmen.<sup id="cite_ref-n20_44-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n20-44">[44]</a></sup> Nolte complained that because of the "past that would not pass", it was controversial for Reagan to visit Bitburg, but it was not controversial for Adenauer to visit Arlington.<sup id="cite_ref-n20_44-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n20-44">[44]</a></sup> Nolte cited the Bitburg controversy as an example of the power exerted by historical memory of the Nazi past.<sup id="cite_ref-n20_44-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n20-44">[44]</a></sup> Nolte concluded that there was excessive contemporary interest in the Holocaust because it served the concerns of those descended from the victims of Nazism, and placed them in a "permanent status of privilege".<sup id="cite_ref-n19_42-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n19-42">[42]</a></sup> Nolte argued that Germans had an unhealthy obsession with guilt for Nazi crimes, and called for an end to this "obsession".<sup id="cite_ref-mai39_45-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-mai39-45">[45]</a></sup> Nolte's opinion was that there was no moral difference between German self-guilt over the Holocaust, and Nazi claims of Jewish collective guilt for all the world's problems.<sup id="cite_ref-mai39_45-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-mai39-45">[45]</a></sup> He called for an end to the maintaining of the memory of the Nazi past as fresh and current, and suggested a new way of viewing the Nazi past that would allow Germans to be free of the "past that will not pass".<sup id="cite_ref-n20_44-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n20-44">[44]</a></sup>

In his _feuilleton_, Nolte offered a new way of understanding German history which sought to break free of the "past that will not pass", by contending that Nazi crimes were only the consequence of a defensive reaction against Soviet crimes.<sup id="cite_ref-ev28_46-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ev28-46">[46]</a></sup> In Nolte's view, National Socialism had only arisen in response to the "class genocide" and "Asiatic barbarism" of the [Bolsheviks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsheviks "Bolsheviks").<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> Nolte cited as example the early Nazi [Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Maximilian_Erwin_von_Scheubner-Richter "Ludwig Maximilian Erwin von Scheubner-Richter"), who during [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") had been the German consul in [Erzerum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erzerum "Erzerum"), [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey "Turkey"), where he was appalled by the [genocide of the Armenians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide "Armenian genocide").<sup id="cite_ref-n21-22_49-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n21-22-49">[49]</a></sup> In Nolte's view, the fact that Scheubner-Richter later became a Nazi shows that something must have changed his values, and in Nolte's opinion it was the [Russian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1917 "Russian Revolution of 1917") and such alleged Bolshevik practices as the "rat cage" [torture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture "Torture") (said by Russian émigré authors to be a favorite torture by [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China") serving in the [Cheka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheka "Cheka") during the [Russian Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War "Russian Civil War")) that led to the change.<sup id="cite_ref-n21_50-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n21-50">[50]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> Nolte used the example of the "rat cage" torture in [George Orwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell "George Orwell")'s 1948 novel [_1984_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four "Nineteen Eighty-Four") to argue that the knowledge of the "rat cage" torture was widespread throughout the world.<sup id="cite_ref-n21_50-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n21-50">[50]</a></sup> Nolte wrote about the horrors perpetuated by the "Chinese Cheka" as showing the "Asiatic" nature of the Bolsheviks.<sup id="cite_ref-n21_50-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n21-50">[50]</a></sup> Furthermore, Nolte argues that the ["rat cage" torture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_torture "Rat torture") was an ancient torture long practiced in [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China"), which in his opinion further establishes the "Asiatic barbarism" of the Bolsheviks.<sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> Nolte cited a statement by Hitler after the [Battle of Stalingrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Stalingrad "Battle of Stalingrad") that Field Marshal [Friedrich Paulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Paulus "Friedrich Paulus") would be soon sent to the “rat cage” in the [Lubyanka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubyanka_(KGB) "Lubyanka (KGB)") as proof that Hitler had an especially vivid fear of the “rat cage” torture.<sup id="cite_ref-n21_50-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n21-50">[50]</a></sup>

In Nolte's view, Nazi anti-communism was "understandable and up to a certain point, justified".<sup id="cite_ref-ev28_46-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ev28-46">[46]</a></sup> For Nolte, the "racial genocide" as he calls the Holocaust was a "punishment and preventive measure" on the part of the Germans for the "class genocide" of the Bolsheviks.<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup> American historian Peter Baldwin noted parallels between Nolte's views and those of American Marxist historian [Arno J.

The crux of Nolte's thesis was presented when he wrote:

> "It is a notable shortcoming of the literature about National Socialism that it does not know or does not want to admit to what degree all the deeds—with the sole exception of the technical process of gassing—that the National Socialists later committed had already been described in a voluminous literature of the early 1920s: mass deportations and shootings, torture, death camps, extermination of entire groups using strictly objective selection criteria, and public demands for the annihilation of millions of guiltless people who were thought to be "enemies".
> 
> It is probable that many of these reports were exaggerated. It is certain that the “[White Terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Terror_(Russia) "White Terror (Russia)")” also committed terrible deeds, even though its program contained no analogy to the “extermination of the bourgeoisie”. Nonetheless, the following question must seem permissible, even unavoidable: Did the National Socialists or Hitler perhaps commit an “Asiatic” deed merely because they and their ilk considered themselves to be the potential victims of an “Asiatic” deed? Wasn't the '[Gulag Archipelago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag_Archipelago "Gulag Archipelago")' more original than Auschwitz? Was the Bolshevik murder of an entire class not the logical and factual _prius_ of the "racial murder" of National Socialism? Cannot Hitler's most secret deeds be explained by the fact that he had _not_ forgotten the rat cage? Did Auschwitz in its root causes not originate in a past that would not pass?"<sup id="cite_ref-n21-22_49-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n21-22-49">[49]</a></sup>

Nolte wrote the principal problem "for the coming generations...must be liberation from collectivist thinking", which Nolte claimed dominated scholarship on Nazi Germany.<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup> Nolte ended his essay with calling for a "more comprehensive debate" about the memory of Nazi Germany that would allow for "the past that will not go away" to finally go away "as is suitable for every past".<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup>

Nolte called the Auschwitz death camp and the other German death camps of World War II a "copy" of the Soviet Gulag camps.

Nolte subsequently presented a 1940 book by American author [Theodore N. Kaufman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_N._Kaufman "Theodore N. Kaufman") entitled _[Germany Must Perish!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_Must_Perish! "Germany Must Perish!")_. The text contends that all German men should be sterilized, evidencing, according to Nolte, the alleged "Jewish" desire to "annihilate" Germans prior to the Holocaust.<sup id="cite_ref-koch27-28_61-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-koch27-28-61">[61]</a></sup> An August 1941 appeal to the world by a group of Soviet Jews seeking support against Germany was also cited by Nolte as evidence of Jewish determination to thwart the _Reich_.<sup id="cite_ref-ker176_62-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ker176-62">[62]</a></sup> Nolte argued that the Nazis felt forced to undertake the Holocaust by Hitler's conclusion that the entire Jewish population of the world had [declared war on Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_war_conspiracy_theory "Jewish war conspiracy theory").<sup id="cite_ref-koch27-28_61-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-koch27-28-61">[61]</a></sup> From Nolte's point of view, the Holocaust was an act of “Asiatic barbarism” forced on the Germans by the fear of what [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin"), whom Nolte believed to have significant Jewish support, might do to them. Nolte contends that the U.S. [internment of Japanese Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans "Internment of Japanese Americans") in the wake of the [Pearl Harbor attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor_attack "Pearl Harbor attack") provides a parallel to the German "internment" of the Jewish population of Europe in [concentration camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_camps "Concentration camps"), in light of what Nolte alleges was the "Jewish" declaration of war on Germany in 1939 which Weizmann's letter allegedly constitutes.<sup id="cite_ref-Nolte_in_Koch_1985_p._28_63-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Nolte_in_Koch_1985_p._28-63">[63]</a></sup>

Subsequently, Nolte expanded upon these views in his 1987 book _Der europäische Bürgerkrieg, 1917–1945_ (_The European Civil War, 1917–1945_) in which he claimed that the entire 20th century was an age of [genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide "Genocide"), [totalitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarianism "Totalitarianism"), and [tyranny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny "Tyranny"), and that the Holocaust had been merely one chapter in the age of violence, terror and population displacement. Nolte claimed that this age had started with the [genocide of the Armenians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide "Armenian genocide") during World War I, and also included the [Stalinist terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge "Great Purge") in the Soviet Union, the [expulsion of ethnic Germans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_Germans_after_World_War_II "Expulsion of Germans after World War II") from Eastern Europe, Maoist terror in China as manifested in such events as the [Great Leap Forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward "Great Leap Forward") and the [Cultural Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution "Cultural Revolution"), [compulsory population exchanges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_of_populations_between_Greece_and_Turkey "Exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey") between Greece and Turkey from 1922 to 1923, American war crimes in the [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War "Vietnam War"), the [Khmer Rouge genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide "Cambodian genocide") in [Cambodia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia "Cambodia"), and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.<sup id="cite_ref-L211_64-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-L211-64">[64]</a></sup> In particular, Nolte argued that the [expulsion of ethnic Germans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_Germans_after_World_War_II "Expulsion of Germans after World War II") from Eastern Europe in 1945–46 was "to be categorized...under the concept of genocide".<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup> As part of this argument, Nolte cited the 1979 book of the American historian [Alfred-Maurice de Zayas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred-Maurice_de_Zayas "Alfred-Maurice de Zayas"), [_Die Wehrmacht Untersuchungsstelle_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wehrmacht_War_Crimes_Bureau,_1939-1945 "The Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau, 1939-1945"), which argues that the Allies were just as guilty of war crimes as the Germans as the "happy evidence of the will to objectivity on the part of a foreigner"<sup id="cite_ref-ev162_66-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ev162-66">[66]</a></sup> In Nolte's opinion, Hitler was a "European citizen" who fought in defence of the values of the West against "Asiatic" Bolshevism, but due to his "total egocentrism" waged this struggle with unnecessary violence and brutality<sup id="cite_ref-ev56_67-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ev56-67">[67]</a></sup> Since in Nolte's view, the _[Shoah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoah "Shoah")_ was not a unique crime, there is no reason to single out Germans for special criticism for the Holocaust.<sup id="cite_ref-ev27_68-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ev27-68">[68]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-L211_64-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-L211-64">[64]</a></sup>

In addition, Nolte sees his work as the beginning of a much-needed revisionist treatment to end the "negative myth" of Nazi Germany that dominates contemporary perceptions.<sup id="cite_ref-69"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> Nolte took the view that the principal problem of German history was this "negative myth" of Nazi Germany, which cast the Nazi era as the _ne plus ultra_ of evil.<sup id="cite_ref-70"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup> Nolte wrote that after the [American Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War"), the defeated South was cast as the symbol of total evil by the victorious North, but later “revisionism” became the dominant historical interpretation against the “negative myth” of the South, which led to a more balanced history of the Civil War with a greater understanding of the “motives and way of life of the defeated Southern states”, and led to the leaders of the [Confederacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America "Confederate States of America") becoming great American heroes.<sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> Nolte urged that a similar "revisionism" destroy the "negative myth" of Nazi Germany.<sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup> Nolte argued that the Vietnam War, the Khmer Rouge genocide, the expulsion of "boat people" from Vietnam, the Islamic revolution in Iran, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan meant the traditional picture of Nazi Germany as the ultimate in evil was no longer tenable, and proved the need for "revisionism" to put an end to the "negative myth" of Nazi Germany.<sup id="cite_ref-n5_73-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n5-73">[73]</a></sup> In Nolte's view, the first efforts at revisionism of the Nazi period failed because [A. J. P. Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._P._Taylor "A. J. P. Taylor")'s 1961 book _The Origins of the Second World War_ was only a part of the "anti-German literature of indictment" while [David Hoggan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hoggan "David Hoggan") in _Der erzwugnene Krieg_, by only seeking to examine why World War II broke out in 1939, "cut himself off from the really decisive questions".<sup id="cite_ref-n5_73-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n5-73">[73]</a></sup> Then the next revisionist efforts Nolte cites were the Italian historian [Domenico Settembrini](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Domenico_Settembrini&action=edit&redlink=1 "Domenico Settembrini (page does not exist)")'s favorable treatment of Fascism for saving Italy from Communism, and the British historian [Timothy Mason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Mason "Timothy Mason")'s studies in working class German history.<sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup> The best of the revisionists according to Nolte is [David Irving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Irving "David Irving"), with whom Nolte finds some fault, although "not all of Irving's theses and points can be dismissed with such ease".<sup id="cite_ref-75"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup> Nolte praises Irving as the first to understand that [Weizmann's letter to Chamberlain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_war_conspiracy_theory "Jewish war conspiracy theory") was a "Jewish declaration of war" on Germany that justified the "interning" of the Jews of Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-n8-9_76-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n8-9-76">[76]</a></sup> Nolte went on to praise Irving for putting the Holocaust "in a more comprehensive perspective" by comparing it to the [Allied bombing of Hamburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Hamburg_in_World_War_II "Bombing of Hamburg in World War II") in 1943, which Nolte views as just much of an act of genocide as the "Final Solution".<sup id="cite_ref-n8-9_76-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n8-9-76">[76]</a></sup> The sort of revisionism needed to end the "negative myth" of Nazi Germany is, in Nolte's opinion, an examination of the impact of the Russian Revolution on Germany.<sup id="cite_ref-77"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup>

Nolte contends that the great decisive event of the 20th century was the [Russian Revolution of 1917](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1917 "Russian Revolution of 1917"), which plunged all of Europe into a long-simmering civil war that lasted until 1945. To Nolte, fascism, Communism's twin, arose as a desperate response by the threatened middle classes of Europe to what Nolte has often called the “Bolshevik peril”.<sup id="cite_ref-ev28_46-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ev28-46">[46]</a></sup> He suggests that if one wishes to understand the Holocaust, one should begin with the industrial revolution in Britain, and then understand the rule of the [Khmer Rouge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge "Khmer Rouge") in [Cambodia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia "Cambodia").<sup id="cite_ref-n9_78-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n9-78">[78]</a></sup> Nolte then proceeds to argue that one should consider what happened in the Soviet Union in the interwar period by reading the work of [Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn "Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn").<sup id="cite_ref-n9_78-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n9-78">[78]</a></sup> In a marked change from the views expressed in _The Three Faces of Fascism_, in which Communism was a stream of “transcendence”, Nolte now classified communism together with fascism as both rival streams of the “resistance to transcendence”.<sup id="cite_ref-m86-87_79-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-m86-87-79">[79]</a></sup> The “metapolitical phenomenon” of Communism in a Hegelian dialectic led to the “metapolitical phenomenon” of fascism, which was both a copy of and the most ardent opponent of Marxism.<sup id="cite_ref-80"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup> As an example of his thesis, Nolte cited an article written in 1927 by [Kurt Tucholsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Tucholsky "Kurt Tucholsky") calling for middle-class Germans to be gassed, which he argued was much more deplorable than the celebratory comments made by some right-wing newspapers about the assassination of the German Foreign Minister [Walther Rathenau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walther_Rathenau "Walther Rathenau") in 1922.<sup id="cite_ref-81"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup> [Richard J.

### "A Kind of Damage Control"\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: "A Kind of Damage Control"")\]

The philosopher [Jürgen Habermas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas "Jürgen Habermas") in an article entitled "A Kind of Damage Control: On Apologetic Tendencies In German History Writing" in the _[Die Zeit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Zeit "Die Zeit")_ of 11 July 1986 strongly criticized Nolte, along with [Andreas Hillgruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Hillgruber "Andreas Hillgruber") and [Michael Stürmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_St%C3%BCrmer "Michael Stürmer"), for engaging in what Habermas called “apologetic” history writing in regards to the Nazi era, and for seeking to “close Germany's opening to the West” that in Habermas's view has existed since 1945.<sup id="cite_ref-:36_86-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:36-86">[86]</a></sup> Habermas criticized Stürmer for his essay "History in a land without history" as engaging in "damage control" with German history and wrote that Hillgruber and Nolte were putting his theories into practice.<sup id="cite_ref-87"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup>

Habermas criticized Hillgruber for demanding historians "identify" with the Wehrmacht's last stand on the Eastern Front as being purely "selective".<sup id="cite_ref-88"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-88">[88]</a></sup> Habermas charged that as long as the Wehrmacht held out, the Holocaust continued, but that Hillgruber's approach which emphasized the war on the Eastern Front from the viewpoint of the ordinary German soldier and the "desperate civilian population" serves to sever the "Final Solution of the Jewish Question" from history.<sup id="cite_ref-:10_89-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:10-89">[89]</a></sup> Habermas charged that Hillgruber had much sympathy with the German soldiers who found a "picture of horror of raped and murdered women and children" at Nemmersdorf, but his way of "identifying" with the Wehrmacht meant the Holocaust went unmentioned.<sup id="cite_ref-:10_89-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:10-89">[89]</a></sup> Habermas wrote in the second part of his essay, Hillgruber who previously insisted on a "bird's eye" view of the Eastern Front from the viewpoint of the ordinary German soldier now used the perspective of a historian to argue the Allies were always planning on destroying Germany and it was wrong for the Allies to impose the Oder-Neisse line as the new eastern frontier of Germany, which Habermas felt to be a double standard.<sup id="cite_ref-:10_89-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:10-89">[89]</a></sup> Habermas wrote Hillgruber had failed as a historian, stating: "Hillgruber is most deeply appalled by the high proportion of university-trained men who participated \[in the Holocaust\]-as if there were not a completely plausible explanation for that. In short, the phenomenon that a civilized populace let these horrible things happen is one that Hillguber removes from the technical competence of the overburdened historian and blithely pushes off into the dimension of the generally human".<sup id="cite_ref-90"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup>

Habermas called Nolte the "officious-conservative narrator" who presented a version of history in which the "annihilation of the Jews appears as a regrettable, but perfectly understandable result".<sup id="cite_ref-:2_91-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:2-91">[91]</a></sup> Habermas criticized Nolte for claiming that Chaim Weizmann declared war on Germany in 1939 which "was supposed to _justify_ Hitler in treating German Jews as prisoners of war-and then in deporting them".<sup id="cite_ref-:2_91-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:2-91">[91]</a></sup> Habermas wrote:

> “The culture section of _Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung_, June 6, 1986 included a militant article by Ernst Nolte. It was published, by the way, under a hypocritical pretext with the heading “the talk that could not be delivered”. (I say this with knowledge of the exchange of letters between the presumably disinvited Nolte and the organizers of the conference). When the Nolte article was published Stürmer also expressed solidarity. In it Nolte reduces the singularity of the annihilation of the Jews to “the technical process of gassing”. He supports his thesis about the Gulag Archipelago is “primary” to Auschwitz with the rather abstruse example of the Russian Civil War. The author gets little more from the film _Shoah_ by [Lanzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Lanzmann "Claude Lanzmann") than the idea that “the SS troops in the concentration camps might themselves have been victims of a sort and that among the Polish victims of National Socialism there was virulent anti-Semitism”. These unsavoury samples show that Nolte puts someone like [Fassbinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Werner_Fassbinder "Rainer Werner Fassbinder") in the shade by a wide margin. If the _Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung_ was justifiably drawn to oppose the planned performance of Fassbinder's play, then why did it choose to publish Nolte's letter \[A reference to the play _The Garbage, the City, and Death_ by Rainer Werner Fassbinder about an unscrupulous Jewish businessman who exploits German guilt over the Holocaust that many see as anti-Semitic\]...The Nazi crimes lose their singularity in that they are at least made comprehensible as an answer to the (still extant) Bolshevist threats of annihilation. The magnitude of Auschwitz shrinks to the format of technical innovation and is explained on the basis of the “Asiatic” threat from an enemy that still stands at our door”.<sup id="cite_ref-92"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup>

In particular, Habermas took Nolte to task for suggesting a moral equivalence between the Holocaust and the [Khmer Rouge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge "Khmer Rouge") genocide. In Habermas's opinion, since Cambodia was a backward, Third World agrarian state and Germany a modern, First World industrial state, there was no comparison between the two genocides.<sup id="cite_ref-Low_p._474_93-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Low_p._474-93">[93]</a></sup>

Habermas then linked what he called the revisionism of Nolte, Hillgruber and Stürmer with the planned German Historical Museum in Berlin and the House of History in Bonn, which he criticized for a nationalistic view of German history.<sup id="cite_ref-94"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup> Habermas accused Stürmer of subordinating history to politics and of attempting to strangle the emergence of individualistic society with his demand for "historical consciousness as vicarious religion".<sup id="cite_ref-95"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup> Habermas wrote: "The unconditional opening of the Federal Republic to the political culture of the West is the greatest intellectual achievement of our postwar period; my generation should be especially proud of this. This event cannot and should not be stabilized by a kind of NATO philosophy colored with German nationalism. The opening of the Federal Republic has been achieved precisely by overcoming the ideology of Central Europe that our revisionists are trying to warm up for us with their geopolitical drumbeat about \`"the old geographically central position of the Germans in Europe" (Stürmer) and "the reconstruction of the destroyed European Center" (Hillgruber).

The sub-title of Hillgruber's book drew controversy with the Swiss historian [Micha Brumlik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micha_Brumlik "Micha Brumlik") in an essay entitled "New Myth of State" first published in _Die Tagezeitung_ newspaper on 12 July 1986, commenting that the use of the word _Zerschlagung_ (destruction) for the Germans indicated that an act of extreme violence was committed against the Germans while the Jews were assigned only the neutral term _Ende_ (end) to describe the Holocaust.<sup id="cite_ref-Brumlik,_Micha_pages_45-49_96-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Brumlik,_Micha_pages_45-49-96">[96]</a></sup> Brumlik argued that in his view, Hillgruber by his use of the word "End" to label the Holocaust implied that the _Shoah_ was just something terrible that happened to the Jews of Europe, but it was not anybody's fault.<sup id="cite_ref-Brumlik,_Micha_pages_45-49_96-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Brumlik,_Micha_pages_45-49-96">[96]</a></sup> Brumlik accused Hillgruber of reducing German history down to the level of _Landserheft_ (a type of comics in Germany glorifying war).<sup id="cite_ref-97"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup> Brumlik argued that Hillgruber's thesis about the Holocaust as one of many genocides, instead of a unique event, was a form of "psychological repression" to avoid dealing with guilt over the Holocaust.<sup id="cite_ref-98"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup> Brumlik wrote: "Even if we do not look into Stalinist totalitarianism and its murderous work camps, the expansionism of the Soviet Union since 1945, the irresponsible foreign policy adventures of the Soviet Union and its thoroughly repressive regime, it now is becoming clear what role anticommunism played and plays in the political culture of psychological repression...Only if this equation is made; only if is further insinuated that the Soviet Union wanted to exterminate the Germans; other then does it seem legitimate that the nation conducting the war protected the annihilation camps".<sup id="cite_ref-Brumlik,_Micha_pages_45-49_96-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Brumlik,_Micha_pages_45-49-96">[96]</a></sup> Brumlik wrote that Hillgruber was clearly trying to suggest that the Soviet Union was waging genocide against the Germans, which made the war effort of Nazi Germany in the East to be as Hillgruber would have it a "justified" defense of German civilians even as at the same time the defensive efforts of the Wehrmacht allowed the Holocaust to continue.<sup id="cite_ref-Brumlik,_Micha_pages_45-49_96-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Brumlik,_Micha_pages_45-49-96">[96]</a></sup> Brumlik wrote though _Zweierlei Untergang_ only covered the period from June 1944 to May 1945, it did serve to implicitly to turn what was a war of conquest on the part of Germany into a defensive struggle to protect Germans while pushing the Jews being exterminated by the _Reich_ into the background.<sup id="cite_ref-Brumlik,_Micha_pages_45-49_96-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Brumlik,_Micha_pages_45-49-96">[96]</a></sup> Brumlik wrote that Hillgruber in _Zweierlei Untergang_ had played up the role of Germans as victims in World War II at the expense of Germans as perpetrators.<sup id="cite_ref-99"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-99">[99]</a></sup> The American historian [Gordon A.

Nolte for his part, started to write a series of letters to various newspapers such as _[Die Zeit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Zeit "Die Zeit")_ and _[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurter_Allgemeine_Zeitung "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung")_ attacking his critics; for an example, in a letter to _Die Zeit_ on 1 August 1986, Nolte complained that his critic [Jürgen Habermas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas "Jürgen Habermas") was attempting to censor him for expressing his views, and accused Habermas of being the one responsible for blocking him from attending the Römerberg Conversations.<sup id="cite_ref-107"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-107">[107]</a></sup> In the same letter, Nolte described himself as the unnamed historian whose views on the reasons for the Holocaust had at dinner party in May 1986 in Bonn had caused [Saul Friedländer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Friedl%C3%A4nder "Saul Friedländer") to walk out in disgust that Habermas had alluded to an earlier letter<sup id="cite_ref-108"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-108">[108]</a></sup>

Responding to the essay "The Age of Tyrants: History and Politics" by [Klaus Hildebrand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Hildebrand "Klaus Hildebrand") defending Nolte and Hillgruber, Habermas wrote that Hillgruber's approach "perhaps would be a legitimate point of view for the memoirs of a veteran-but not for a historian writing from the distance of four decades".<sup id="cite_ref-109"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-109">[109]</a></sup> Habermas wrote:

> "In his essay Ernst Nolte treats the 'so-called' annihilation of the Jews (in H.W. Koch, ed. _Aspects of the Third Reich_, London, 1985). Chaim Weizmann's declaration in the beginning of September 1939 that the Jews of the world would fight on the side of England, 'justified' – so opinioned Nolte – Hitler to treat the Jews as prisoners of war and to intern them. Other objections aside, I cannot distinguish between the insinuation that world Jewry is a subject of international law and the usual anti-Semitic projections. And if it had at least stopped with deportation. All this does not stop Klaus Hildebrand in the _Historische Zeitschrift_ from commending Nolte's 'pathfinding essay', because it 'attempts to project exactly the seeming unique aspects of the history of the Third Reich onto the backdrop of the European and global development'.

> "The gas chambers with which the executors of the annihilation of the Jews went to work without a doubt signal a particularly repulsive form of mass murder, and they have justifiably become a symbol for the technicized barbarism of the Hitler regime. But can it really be said that the mass liquidations by a bullet to the back of the neck, as was common practice during the years of the Red Terror, are qualitatively different? Isn't, despite all the differences, the comparable element stronger?... The thesis of the singularity of Nazi crimes is finally also placed in question by the consideration that Hitler himself frequently referred to the practices of his revolutionary opponents of the Left as lessons and models. But he did more than just copy them. Determined to be more radical than his most bitter enemy, he also outdid them"<sup id="cite_ref-116"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-116">[116]</a></sup>

Moreover, Fest argued in his defence of Nolte that in the overheated atmosphere in [Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich "Munich") following the overthrow of the [Bavarian Soviet Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavarian_Soviet_Republic "Bavarian Soviet Republic") in 1919 "... gave Hitler's extermination complexes a real background", writing that Nolte was indeed correct that reports of Bolshevik atrocities in the Russian Civil War together with a number of Jews serving in the Bavarian Soviet Republic inspired Hitler to exterminate the Jews.<sup id="cite_ref-117"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-117">[117]</a></sup> Fest defended Nolte's point about Poles being "virulently anti-semitic" by mentioning the Kielce pogrom of July 1946 as proving that the Polish people were indeed murderously anti-semitic, writing that historians should take account of this.<sup id="cite_ref-118"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-118">[118]</a></sup> Finally, Fest wrote as part of his attack on the "singularity" of the Holocaust that:

> "There are questions upon questions, but no answer can be offered here. Rather, it is a matter of rousing doubt in the monumental simplicity and one-sidedness of the prevailing ideas about the particularity of the Nazi crimes that supposedly had no model and followed no example. All in all, this thesis stands on weak ground. And it is less surprising that, as Habermas incorrectly suggests in reference to Nolte, it is being questioned. It is far more astonishing that this has not seriously taken place until now. For that also means that the countless other victims, in particular, but not exclusively those of Communism, are no longer part of our memory. Arno Borst once declared in a different context that no group in today's society has been ruthlessly oppressed as the dead. That is especially true for the millions of dead of this century, from the Armenians all the way to the victims of the Gulag Archipelago or the Cambodians who were and still being murdered before all of our eyes-but who have still been dropped from the world's memory"<sup id="cite_ref-119"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-119">[119]</a></sup>

> "Hitler often said why he wished to remove and kill the Jews. His explanation is a complicated and structurally logical construct that can be reproduced in great detail. A rat cage, the murders committed by the Bolsheviks, or a special fear of these are not mentioned. On the contrary, Hitler was always convinced that Soviet Russia, precisely because it was ruled by Jews, was a defenseless colossus standing on clay feet. Aryans had no fear of Slavic or Jewish subhumans. The Jew, Hitler wrote in 1926 in _Mein Kampf_, "is not an element of an organization, but a ferment of decomposition.

Jäckel attacked Nolte's statement that Hitler had an especially intense fear of the Soviet "rat cage" torture by arguing that Hitler's statement of February 1, 1943 to his generals about captured German officers going off to the "rat cage" clearly meant the [Lubyanka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubyanka_(KGB) "Lubyanka (KGB)") prison, and this is not as Nolte was arguing to be interpreted literally.<sup id="cite_ref-j77_123-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-j77-123">[123]</a></sup> Jäckel went on to argue that Nolte had done nothing to establish what the remarks about the "rat cage" had to do with the Holocaust.<sup id="cite_ref-j77_123-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-j77-123">[123]</a></sup> Jäckel accused Nolte of engaging in a [_post hoc, ergo propter hoc_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc "Post hoc ergo propter hoc") argument to establish the "causal nexus" between Hitler's supposed fear of the "rat cage" torture, and the Holocaust.<sup id="cite_ref-j77_123-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-j77-123">[123]</a></sup> Against Nolte's claim that the Holocaust was not unique but rather one among many genocides, Jäckel rejected the assertion of Nolte and his supporters, such as [Joachim Fest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_Fest "Joachim Fest"):

> "I, however claim (and not for the first time) that the National Socialist murder of the Jews was unique because never before had a nation with the authority of its leader decided and announced that it would kill off as completely as possible a particular group of humans, including old people, women, children and infants, and actually put this decision into practice, using all the means of governmental power at its disposal. This idea is so apparent and so well known that is quite astonishing that it could have escaped Fest's attention (the massacres of the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire during the First World War were, according to all we know, more like murderous deportations than planned genocide)".<sup id="cite_ref-124"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-124">[124]</a></sup>

The German historian [Jürgen Kocka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Kocka "Jürgen Kocka") in an essay first published in _Die Zeit_ on September 26, 1986, contended against Nolte that the Holocaust was indeed a “singular” event because it had been committed by an advanced Western nation, and argued that Nolte's comparisons of the Holocaust with similar mass killings in [Pol Pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Pot "Pol Pot")'s [Cambodia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia "Cambodia"), [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin")'s [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union"), and [Idi Amin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idi_Amin "Idi Amin")'s [Uganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda "Uganda") were invalid because of the backward nature of those societies.<sup id="cite_ref-129"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-129">[129]</a></sup> Kocka dismissed Fest's claims that Habermas was a racist for rejecting comparisons with Cambodia, writing "it has to do with historical knowledge about the connection between economic development and the possibilities of sociopolitical organization, and also with taking seriously the European tradition, in consideration of which the Enlightenment, human rights and the constitutional state cannot be simply ignored".<sup id="cite_ref-:14_130-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:14-130">[130]</a></sup> Kocka went to criticize Nolte's view of the Holocaust as "a not altogether incomprehensible reaction to the prior threat of annihilation, as whose potential or real victims Hitler and the National Socialists allegedly were justified in seeing themselves".<sup id="cite_ref-:14_130-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:14-130">[130]</a></sup> Kocka wrote that:

> "The real causes of anti-Semitism in Germany are to be found neither in Russia nor the World Jewish Congress. And how can one, in light of the facts, interpret the National Socialist annihilation of the Jews as a somewhat logical, if premature, means of defense against the threats of annihilation coming from the Soviet Union, with which Germany had made a pact in 1939, and which it then subsequently attacked? Here the sober historical inquiry into real historical connections, into causes, and consequences, and about real motives and their conditions would suffice to protect the writer and the reader from abstruse speculative interpretations. Nolte fails to ask such questions. If a past "that is capable of being agreed on" can be gained by intellectual gymnastics of this sort, then we should renounce it."<sup id="cite_ref-131"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-131">[131]</a></sup>

[Hagen Schulze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagen_Schulze "Hagen Schulze") in an essay first published in _Die Zeit_ on September 26, 1986, defended Nolte, together with [Andreas Hillgruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Hillgruber "Andreas Hillgruber"), and argued Habermas was acting from "incorrect presuppositions" in attacking Nolte and Hillgruber for denying the "singularity" of the Holocaust.<sup id="cite_ref-s94_134-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-s94-134">[134]</a></sup> Schulze argued that Habermas's attack on Nolte was flawed because he never provided any proof that the Holocaust was unique, and argued there were many "aspects" of the Holocaust that were "common" with other historical occurrences.<sup id="cite_ref-s94_134-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-s94-134">[134]</a></sup> In Schulze's opinion:

> "For the discipline of history, singularity and comparability of historical events are thus not mutually exclusive alternatives. They are complementary concepts. A claim that historians such as Ernst Nolte or Andreas Hillgruber deny the uniqueness of Auschwitz because they are looking for comparisons stems from incorrect presuppositions. Of course, Nolte and Hillgruber can be refuted if their comparisons rest on empirically or logically false assumptions. But Habermas never provided such proof."<sup id="cite_ref-s94_134-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-s94-134">[134]</a></sup>

Schulze defended Stürmer's call for the historians to explore the "German question", writing that it was "important" for historians to "make the national identity of the Germans an object of their research".<sup id="cite_ref-135"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-135">[135]</a></sup> Schulze dismissed Habermas's call for "constitutional patriotism" under the grounds a form of national identity grounded in loyalty to the Basic Law of 1949 was too dry to work, and the German people needed a national identity that was more emotional to work.<sup id="cite_ref-136"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-136">[136]</a></sup>

The Swiss journalist Hanno Helbling in an essay first published in the _Neu Zuricher Zeitung_ newspaper on September 26, 1986, accused Nolte and his allies of working to destroy "the 'negative myth' of Nazi Germany, not only by revising our inevitable understanding of this reign of terror, but also by restoring the national past."<sup id="cite_ref-:15_137-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:15-137">[137]</a></sup> Nelbling complained: "Revisionists who gloss over the evils of National Socialism and deny its atrocities have raised a ruckus latterly.

Or can take refuge in countermyths of the negative kind and thus come close to a leveling strategy, just as announcements of horrors from the distant past are not suited to proving that back then, too, murderous deeds were committed. And what about the recent past: "Didn't Stalin..."; in Cambodia, didn't they..." These are sad calcuations \[_[sic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic "Sic")?_\], which in a strange way have propagated themselves into the political view of the present".<sup id="cite_ref-138"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-138">[138]</a></sup>

### "The Search for the 'Lost History'?"\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: "The Search for the 'Lost History'?"")\]

[Hans Mommsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Mommsen "Hans Mommsen") in an essay first published in the September 1986 edition of [_Merkur_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkur_(journal) "Merkur (journal)") accused Nolte of attempting to "relativize" Nazi crimes within the broader framework of the 20th century.<sup id="cite_ref-m108_139-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-m108-139">[139]</a></sup> Mommsen asserted that by describing Lenin's Red Terror in Russia as an "Asiatic deed" threatening Germany, Nolte was arguing that all actions directed against Communism, no matter how morally repugnant, were justified by necessity.<sup id="cite_ref-m108_139-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-m108-139">[139]</a></sup> Mommsen wrote that the problem with German conservatives after 1945 was lack of a "reservoir of conservative values to which it could connect without interruption".<sup id="cite_ref-140"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-140">[140]</a></sup> Mommsen wrote the theory of totalitarianism served Cold War needs so "that could not only decorate itself with the epithet "anti-Fascist" but could also rule out and criminalize leftist efforts" and for the "bracketing out the period of the Third Reich from the continuity of German history".<sup id="cite_ref-141"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-141">[141]</a></sup> Mommsen argued this "bracketing out" was necessary because of the continuity of the German bureaucracy from the Weimar to Nazi to post-war periods, which required a "psychological repression of the criminal politics of the Third Reich".<sup id="cite_ref-:35_142-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:35-142">[142]</a></sup> In this regard, Mommsen wrote: "It is significant that the Weimar Republic was viewed in the years immediately following 1945 as an experiment failed from the onset; not until the success of the chancellor democracy did this image brighten. Then the Weimar experience could be trotted out for the additional legitimization of the Federal Republic and the fundamental superiority the Federal Republic assured".<sup id="cite_ref-:35_142-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:35-142">[142]</a></sup> Mommsen wrote that the Bitburg controversy of 1985 had "made surprisingly clear that the burdens of the Second World War now as before possess traumatic meaning. These burdens disturbed the dramaturgy of the Bitburg spectacle, which, under the fiction of final reconciliation among friends, was supposed to replace the idea of a crusade by the Allies against the Hitler dictatorship with the idea of a crusade against Communist world dictatorship".<sup id="cite_ref-143"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-143">[143]</a></sup>

Mommsen wrote it was a reaction to the Bitburg controversy that led historians like Michael Stürmer to insist that the Germans needed a positive history to end what Stürmer called the "collective obsession with guilt".<sup id="cite_ref-:16_144-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:16-144">[144]</a></sup> Mommsen praised what Stümer deplored, writing the "prevailing mistrust in the Federal Republic, independent of every party affiliation of any cult of community, organized by the state, of appeals for national willingness to make sacrifices and of sentiment against national pathos and national emblems has its roots in the political sobering up that arose from the experiences of the Third Reich. Whoever wants to see in this a lack of patriotic sentiment should be clear once and for all that there is no lack of willingness for democratic participation, although this frequently takes place outside of the corrupt apparatus of the large parties... It is therefore absurd to want to rehabilitate older authoritarian attitudes through historical relativizing. It is a mistake to characterize as a wrong path the consequences of action inferred from the flawed developments of the period between the wars".<sup id="cite_ref-:16_144-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:16-144">[144]</a></sup> Mommsen accused the Kohl government of seeking to revive German nationalism "via a detour" of "strengthening national consciousness" through the planned German Historical Museum in West Berlin.<sup id="cite_ref-145"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-145">[145]</a></sup> Mommsen wrote the purposes of the German Historical Museum together with the House of History in Bonn was to "make us forget the Holocaust and Operation Barbarossa under the slogan of "normalizing". This intention has nothing to do with the understanding of history that has grown stepwise in postwar Germany, an understanding that has come about apart from the classical monumental history and frequently independently of the scholarly discipline".<sup id="cite_ref-146"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-146">[146]</a></sup>

### "The New Historical Consciousness"\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: "The New Historical Consciousness"")\]

In another essay first published in the _Blätter für deutsche und internationale Politik_ magazine in October 1986, Mommsen was to call Nolte's claim of a "causal nexus" between National Socialism and Communism "not simply methodologically untenable, but also absurd in it premises and conclusions".<sup id="cite_ref-147"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-147">[147]</a></sup> Mommsen wrote in his opinion that Nolte's use of the Nazi era phrase "Asiatic hordes" to describe Red Army soldiers, and his use of the word "[Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia "Asia")" as a byword for all that is horrible and cruel in the world reflected racism.<sup id="cite_ref-148"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-148">[148]</a></sup> Mommsen wrote:

> "In contrast to these irrefutable conditioning factors, Nolte's derivation based on personalities and the history of ideas seems artificial, even for the explanation of Hitler's anti-Semitism…If one emphasizes the indisputably important connection in isolation, one should not then force a connection with Hitler's _weltanschauung_, which was in no ways original itself, in order to derive from it the existence of Auschwitz. The battle line between the political right in Germany and the Bolsheviks had achieved its aggressive contour before Stalinism employed methods that led to the death of millions of people. Thoughts about the extermination of the Jews had long been current, and not only for Hitler and his satraps. Many of these found their way to the NSDAP from the [_Deutschvölkisch Schutz-und Trutzbund_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutschv%C3%B6lkischer_Schutz_und_Trutzbund "Deutschvölkischer Schutz und Trutzbund") \[German Racial Union for Protection and Defiance\], which itself had been called into life by the [Pan-German Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alldeutscher_Verband "Alldeutscher Verband"). Hitler's step from verbal anti-Semitism to practical implementation would then have happened without knowledge of and in reaction to the atrocities of the Stalinists. And thus one would have to overturn Nolte's construct, for which he cannot bring biographical evidence to bear. As a Hitler biographer, Fest distanced himself from this kind of one-sidedness by making reference to "the Austrian-German Hitler's earlier fears of and phantasies of being overwhelmed". It is not completely consistent that Fest admits that the reports of the terrorist methods of the Bolsheviks had given Hitler's "extermination complexes" a "real background". Basically, Nolte's proposal in its one-sidedness is not very helpful for explaining or evaluating what happened. The anti-Bolshevism garnished with anti-Semitism had the effect, in particular for the dominant elites, and certainly not just the National Socialists, that Hitler's program of racial annihilation met with no serious resistance. The leadership of the Wehrmacht rather willingly made themselves into accomplices in the policy of extermination. It did this by generating the “criminal orders” and implementing them. By no means did they merely passively support the implementation of their concept, although there was a certain reluctance for reasons of military discipline and a few isolated protests. To construct a “causal nexus” over all this amounts in fact to steering away from the decisive responsibility of the military leadership and the bureaucratic elites."<sup id="cite_ref-149"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-149">[149]</a></sup>

Mommsen wrote it was no accident that Stürmer sat on the editorial board of the _Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung_, the same newspaper that run the essays by Nolte and Fest denying the "singularity" of the Holocaust given that Stürmer's self-proclaimed mission was to give Germans a history that would inspire national pride.<sup id="cite_ref-150"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-150">[150]</a></sup> Mommsen wrote: "What is taking place at present is no conspiracy. A better description would be that national sentiments, long dammed up and visible only in marginal literature, are coming together in an unholy alliance and seeking new shores".<sup id="cite_ref-151"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-151">[151]</a></sup> Mommsen wrote the question of the "singularity" of the Holocaust was legitimate, but the motives of Hildebrand and Stürmer were political rather than scholarly, to end the "German obsession with guilt".<sup id="cite_ref-152"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-152">[152]</a></sup> Mommsen wrote" "To accept with resignation the acts of screaming injustice and to psychologically repress their social prerequisites by calling attention to similar events elsewhere and putting the blame on the Bolshevist world threat recalls the thought patterns that made it possible to implement genocide".<sup id="cite_ref-:17_153-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:17-153">[153]</a></sup> Mommsen that when in the spring of 1943 the graves of the Polish officers massacred by the NKVD were discovered in Katyn Wood, the massacre was given massive publicity in Germany as a symbol of Soviet terror, going on to note those Germans opposed to the Nazi regime continue to view the Nazi regime as something worse despite all the publicity about the Katyn Wood massacre in Germany.<sup id="cite_ref-:17_153-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:17-153">[153]</a></sup> Mommsen wrote the present campaign was a form of "psychological repression" intended to end any guilt over the Holocaust.<sup id="cite_ref-154"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-154">[154]</a></sup>

In another essay entitled "Reappraisal and Repression The Third Reich In West German Historical Consciousness", Mommsen wrote that:

> "Nolte's superficial approach which associates things that do not belong together, substitutes analogies for causal arguments, and – thanks to his taste for exaggeration – produces a long outdated interpretation of the Third Reich as the result of a single factor. His claims are regarded in professional circles as a stimulating challenge at best, hardly as a convincing contribution to an understanding of the crisis of twentieth-century capitalist society in Europe. The fact that Nolte has found eloquent supporters both inside and outside the historical profession has little to do with the normal process of research and much to do with the political implications of the relativization of the Holocaust that he has insistently championed for so long... The fundamentally apologetic character of Nolte's argument shines through most clearly when he concedes Hitler's right to deport, through not to exterminate, the Jews in response to the supposed "declaration of war" issued by the World Jewish Congress; or when he claims that the activities of the SS _Einsatzgruppen_ can be justified, at least subjectively, as operations aimed against partisans fighting the German Army."<sup id="cite_ref-155"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-155">[155]</a></sup>

Mommsen was later in a 1988 book review entitled "Resentment as Social Science" to call Nolte's book, _Der Europäische Bürgerkrieg_, a "regression back to the brew of racist-nationalistic ideology of the interwar period".<sup id="cite_ref-156"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-156">[156]</a></sup>

But Stalin's insanity was, in contrast to Hitler's insanity, a realist's insanity. After all this drivel comes one thing worth discussing: whether Stalin pumped up Hitler and whether Hitler pumped up Stalin. This can be discussed, but the discussion does not address the issue. It is indeed possible that Stalin was pleased by how Hitler treated his bosom buddy Ernst Röhm and the entire SA leadership in 1934. It is, not possible that Hitler began his war against Poland because he felt threatened by Stalin's regime... One does not have to agree in everything with Konrad Adenauer. But in the light of the crass tendency to deny the co-responsibility of the Prussian-German Wehrmacht ("The oath!

### "Standing Things On Their Head"\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=33 "Edit section: "Standing Things On Their Head"")\]

In another _feuilleton_ entitled "Standing Things On Their Heads" first published in _Die Zeit_ on October 31, 1986, Nolte dismissed criticism of him by Habermas and Jäckel under the grounds that their writings were no different from what could find in an East German newspaper.<sup id="cite_ref-n153_176-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n153-176">[176]</a></sup> Nolte contended that criticism over his use of the phrase “rat cage” was unwarranted since he was only using the phrase “rat cage” as an embodiment of the “Asiatic” horror he alleges Hitler felt about the Bolsheviks.<sup id="cite_ref-177"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-177">[177]</a></sup> Nolte wrote he was not trying to reintroduce the Nazi concept of “[Jewish Bolshevism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Bolshevism "Jewish Bolshevism")” and that “…even for the uninformed reader, the reference to the Chinese Cheka…" should have made clear that he was writing about overblown fears in Germany of the Bolsheviks instead of an objective reality.<sup id="cite_ref-n153_176-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n153-176">[176]</a></sup> In reply to the criticism of Habermas and Jäckel, Nolte wrote:

> “The Gulag Archipelago is primary to Auschwitz precisely because the Gulag was in the mind of the originator of Auschwitz; Auschwitz was not in the minds of the originators of the Gulag…If Jäckel proves his own definition for the singularity of the Final Solution, then I think that his concept simply elaborates what can be more briefly expressed with the term "racial murder". If, however, he wants to say that the German state, through the mouth of its _Führer_, unambiguously and publicly announced the decision that even Jewish women, children and infants were to be killed, then he has illustrated with one short phrase all that does not have to be demonstrated in the current intellectual climate, but can be "imputed". Hitler was certainly the most powerful man that has ever lived in Germany. But he was not powerful enough to ever publicly equate Bolshevism and Christianity, as he often did in his dinner conversations. He also not powerful enough to publicly demand or to justify, as Himmler often did in his circle of friends and associates, the murder of women and children. That, of course, is not proof of Hitler's "humanity", but rather of the remnants of the liberal system. The "extermination of the bourgeoisie" and the "liquidation of the kulaks" were, in contrast proclaimed quite publicly. And I am amazed at the coldheartedness with which Eberhard Jäckel says that not every single bourgeois was killed. Habermas's “expulsion of the kulaks” speaks for itself"<sup id="cite_ref-178"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-178">[178]</a></sup>

### Interview with Andreas Hillgruber, 31 October 1986\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=34 "Edit section: Interview with Andreas Hillgruber, 31 October 1986")\]

Hillgruber defended his call for the identification with the German troops fighting on the Eastern Front in an interview with the _[Rheinischer Merkur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheinischer_Merkur "Rheinischer Merkur")_ newspaper on 31 October 1986, on the ground that he was only trying "…to experience things from the perspective of the main body of the population".<sup id="cite_ref-:1_179-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:1-179">[179]</a></sup> In the same 1986 interview, Hillgruber said it was necessary for a more nationalistic version of German history to be written because the East German government was embarking upon a more nationalist history, and if West German historians did not keep up with their East German counterparts in terms of German nationalism, it was inevitable that Germans would come to see the East German regime as the legitimate German state.<sup id="cite_ref-180"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-180">[180]</a></sup> Hillgruber was most furious with Augstein's "constitutional Nazi" line, and stated that he was considering suing Augstein for libel.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_179-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:1-179">[179]</a></sup>

Replying to the interviewer's question about whether he thought the Holocaust was unique, Hillgruber stated:

> ...that the mass murder of the kulaks in the early 1930s, the mass murder of the leadership cadre of the Red Army in 1937–38, and the mass murder of the Polish officers who in September 1939 fell into Soviet hands are not qualitatively different in evaluation from the mass murder in the Third Reich.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_179-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:1-179">[179]</a></sup>

In response to the interviewer's question about whatever he was a "revisionist" (by which the interviewer clearly meant [negationist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_revisionism_(negationism) "Historical revisionism (negationism)")), Hillgruber stated that:

> Revision of the results of scholarship is, as I said, in itself the most natural thing in the world. The discipline of history lives, like every discipline, on the revision through research of previous conceptualizations...Here I would like to say that in principle since the mid-1960s substantial revisions of various kinds have taken place and have rendered absurd the clichéd "image" that Habermas as a nonhistorian obviously possesses.<sup id="cite_ref-181"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-181">[181]</a></sup>

Replying to the interviewer's question about whether he wanted to see the revival of the original concept of the _[Sonderweg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonderweg "Sonderweg"),_ that is of the idea of Germany as a great Central European power equally opposed to both the West and the East, Hillgruber denied that German history since 1945 had been that "golden", and claimed that his conception of the Central European identity he wanted to see revived was cultural, not political.<sup id="cite_ref-Hillgruber,_Andreas_pages_155-161_182-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Hillgruber,_Andreas_pages_155-161-182">[182]</a></sup> Hillgruber called the idea of Germany as great power that would take on and being equally opposed to the United States and the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") as:

> ...historically hopeless because of the way the Second World War ended. To want to develop such a projection now would mean to bring the powers in the East and the West together against the Germans. I cannot imagine that anyone is earnestly striving for that. Reminiscences of good cooperation between the Germans and Slavic peoples in the middle of Europe before the First World War, and in part also still between the wars, are awakened whenever journalists or historians travel to Poland, Czechoslovakia, or Hungary. In that atmosphere it seems imperative to express how closely one feels connected to representatives of these nations. This is understandable, but it cannot all merge into a notion of "Central Europe" that could be misunderstood as taking up the old concept again, which is, as I have said, no longer realizable. In a word, I think the effort to latch on to the connections torn apart in 1945, because of the outcome of the war, and then in turn because of the Cold War, is a sensible political task, especially for West Germans.<sup id="cite_ref-Hillgruber,_Andreas_pages_155-161_182-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Hillgruber,_Andreas_pages_155-161-182">[182]</a></sup>

### "On the Public Use of History"\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=35 "Edit section: "On the Public Use of History"")\]

In another essay first published in the _Die Zeit_ newspaper on 7 November 1986, Habermas wrote the central question about the memory of the Nazi past was: "_In which way_ is the Nazi period going to be understood in the public consciousness?"<sup id="cite_ref-183"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-183">[183]</a></sup> Habermas wrote the Bitburg ceremony was meant to create nationalist feelings and a certain rehabilitation of the Nazi era with President Reagan and Chancellor Kohl laying wreaths at the cemetery to honor the Waffen-SS men buried there, but that for Nolte "Bitburg did not open the floodgates widely enough".<sup id="cite_ref-184"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-184">[184]</a></sup> Habermas wrote that: "This longing for the unframed memories from the perspective of the veterans can now be satisfied by reading Andreas Hillgruber's presentation of the events on the Eastern Front in 1944–45. The 'problem of identification', something that is unusual for an historian, poses itself to the author only because he wants to incorporate the perspective of the fighting troops and the affected civilian population".<sup id="cite_ref-185"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-185">[185]</a></sup>

Habermas argued that "we in Germany...must, undisguisedly and not simply intellectually, keep awake the memory of the suffering of those murdered at German hands".<sup id="cite_ref-186"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-186">[186]</a></sup> Habermas accused Nolte, Hildebrand and Fest of engaging in personal attacks instead of debating him.<sup id="cite_ref-187"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-187">[187]</a></sup> About Nolte's criticism over the line "expulsion of the kulaks", Habermas wrote: "I accept the criticism that, "annihilation", not "expulsion" of the kulaks is the appropriate description of this barbaric event. Enlightenment is a mutual undertaking. But the public settling of accounts by Nolte and Fest does not serve the end of enlightenment. They affect the political morality of a community that-after being liberated by Allied troops and without doing anything itself-has been established in the spirit of occidental conception of freedom, responsibility and self-determination".<sup id="cite_ref-188"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-188">[188]</a></sup>

### "Eternally in the Shadow of Hitler?"\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=36 "Edit section: "Eternally in the Shadow of Hitler?"")\]

[Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler"). The German historian [Heinrich August Winkler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_August_Winkler "Heinrich August Winkler") wrote: "No German historian has ever accorded Hitler such a sympathetic treatment” as did Nolte.

In an essay first published in the _Frankfurter Rundschau_ newspaper on November 14, 1986, [Heinrich August Winkler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_August_Winkler "Heinrich August Winkler") wrote of Nolte's essay "The Past That Will Not Pass" that:

> “Those who read the _Frankfurter Allgemine_ all the way through to the culture section were able to read something under the title “The Past That Will Not Pass” that no German historian to date had noticed: that Auschwitz was only a copy of a Russian original-the Stalinist Gulag Archipelago. For fear of the Bolsheviks’ Asiatic will to annihilate, Hitler himself committed an “Asiatic deed”. Was the annihilation of the Jews a kind of putative self-defence? Nolte's speculation amounts to that.”<sup id="cite_ref-w173_189-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-w173-189">[189]</a></sup>

Writing of Nolte's claim that Weizmann's letter was a “Jewish declaration of war”, Winkler stated that “No German historian has ever accorded Hitler such a sympathetic treatment”.<sup id="cite_ref-w173_189-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-w173-189">[189]</a></sup> Winkler wrote the current controversy over the memory of the Nazi past was caused by the controversy over Bitburg ceremony, writing that just as American had learned to forget about the My Lai massacre, the Bitburg ceremony was meant to allow German "to be able to feel an unbroken sense of pride".<sup id="cite_ref-190"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-190">[190]</a></sup> Winkler charged the editors of the _Frankurter Allgemeine Zeitung_ in response to the Bitburg controversy had started a campaign meant to end any sense of guilt over the Nazi past.<sup id="cite_ref-191"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-191">[191]</a></sup> Winkler asked what was the point of these comparisons of Nazi Germany to the Soviet Union and Cambodia, writing: "Culturally, Germany is a country of the West. It participated in the European Enlightenment and in a long tradition of the rule of law. That is not the case for Russia and certainly not for Cambodia. The crimes of Stalin and the Khmer Rouge are in no way excused by this fact. But Hitler and his helpers must be judged by our Western norms. In this historical context, the systematic genocide of the Jews ordered by the German state-but also the murder of Sinti and Roma-is the greatest crime of the twentieth century, in fact of world history".<sup id="cite_ref-192"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-192">[192]</a></sup>

### \[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=37 "Edit section: "Not A Concluding Remark"")\]

In a later newspaper _feuilleton_ first published in the _Frankurter Allgemeine Zeitung_ on November 20, 1986, Meier again asserted that the Holocaust was a “singular” occurrence, but wrote that:

> “It is to be hoped that Ernst Nolte's suggestion that we should remain more keenly aware of the various million-fold mass murders of this century bears fruit. When one seeks orientation about this-and about the role of mass murder in history-one is surprised by how difficult it is to find. This would appear to be an area that historical research should look into. By pursuing these questions, one can recognize more precisely the peculiarity of our century-and certain similarities in its “liquidations”. But Nolte's hope to be able to attenuate this distressing aspect of our Nazi past will probably not succeed. If we, and much speaks for this, to prevent National Socialist history from becoming an enduring negative myth about absolute evil, then we will have to seek other paths”.<sup id="cite_ref-m178_193-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-m178-193">[193]</a></sup>

Meier praised Nolte in his article “Standing Things On Their Head” for speaking to “modify” the thesis that he had introduced in “The Past That Will Not Pass” about the “causal nexus” by claiming the “causal nexus” only existed in Hitler's mind”.<sup id="cite_ref-m178_193-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-m178-193">[193]</a></sup> Meier expressed his approval of Jäckel's argument for the "singularity" of the Holocaust, writing that "industrial extermination" by Nazi Germany was a "qualitative leap".<sup id="cite_ref-m178_193-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-m178-193">[193]</a></sup> In response to Fest's argument that it was racist not to compare Germany with Cambodia, Meier stated that Germany by being a First World nation had "duties" that a Third World nation like Cambodia did not.<sup id="cite_ref-m178_193-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-m178-193">[193]</a></sup> Meier wrote the _Historikerstreit_ was really about the future, namely how to "live with a past that is so deeply anchored in our consciousness?".<sup id="cite_ref-194"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-194">[194]</a></sup> Meier wrote that historians are always influenced by the present and historians "should also be able to discern uncomfortable truths".<sup id="cite_ref-195"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-195">[195]</a></sup> About Stürmer's call for history as an unifying force to hold together West German society for the Cold War, Meier wrote that Habermas had the right to challenge him, but did not understand the Atlanticist Stürmer was not an advocate of Germany as a Central European power as he alleged.<sup id="cite_ref-:21_196-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:21-196">[196]</a></sup> Meier called Stürmer's theories as "probably not...illegitimate" but argued that a democratic society was always going to have diverse opinions.<sup id="cite_ref-:21_196-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:21-196">[196]</a></sup> Meier ended his essay that the problems faced by Germans was: "How are going to live with this history and what conclusions can we draw from it?...We will make no progress if we use the Nazi past as a club in partisan disputes...But it is to be wished that the center, especially will be strong, for in the past, the political middle has always been capable of providing reasonable solutions, results and maxims."<sup id="cite_ref-197"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-197">[197]</a></sup>

In response to Meier's article, Nolte wrote in a letter to the editor of the _Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung_ published on December 6, 1986, that he did not “defuse” the thesis he presented in his essay “The Past That Will Not Pass”, but merely corrected a few mistakes in his essay "Standing Things On Their Head".<sup id="cite_ref-198"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-198">[198]</a></sup>

The political scientist Kurt Sontheimer in an essay first published in the _Rheinischer Merkur_ newspaper on November 21, 1986, accused Nolte and company of attempting to create a new “national consciousness” meant to sever the Federal Republic's “intellectual and spiritual ties to the West”.<sup id="cite_ref-199"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-199">[199]</a></sup> Sontheimer accused Hillgruber of being guilty of "revisionism" (by which Sontheimer clearly meant [negationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_revisionism_(negationism) "Historical revisionism (negationism)")) in his writings on German history.<sup id="cite_ref-:22_200-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:22-200">[200]</a></sup> Sontheimer wrote it was impossible for historians to claim "pure and strict scholarly research" while at the same time engaging in a political project like attempting to shape national identity.<sup id="cite_ref-:22_200-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:22-200">[200]</a></sup> Sontheimer wrote the political basis of the Federal Republic founded in 1949 was in the Western tradition of liberal democracy and without mentioning Stürmer by name declared that the search for some basis in German national identity in the Imperial period to provide a "unified an understanding of history as possible" was "dubious" because there was "so little to be found there" and "because every attempt to provide political meaning via our predemocratic national history threatens to end the consensus of the postwar era".<sup id="cite_ref-:23_201-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:23-201">[201]</a></sup> Sonthemier wrote that the great achievements of German historians since 1945 was seeking to understand why the Weimar Republic failed and how Nazi Germany came to be, stating:"We were attempting to overcome the past, not to invoke it...I cannot see what better lesson those who are struggling to provide meaning through history can offer us".<sup id="cite_ref-:23_201-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:23-201">[201]</a></sup>

The German political scientist [Richard Löwenthal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_L%C3%B6wenthal "Richard Löwenthal") noted that news of Soviet dekulakization and the _[Holodomor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor "Holodomor")_ did not reach Germany until 1941, so that Soviet atrocities could not possibly have influenced the Germans as Nolte claimed.<sup id="cite_ref-b9_215-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-b9-215">[215]</a></sup> Löwenthal argued in a letter to the editor of the _Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung_ on 29 November 1986 for the "fundamental difference" in mass murder in Germany and the Soviet Union, and against the "balancing" out of various crimes in the 20th century.<sup id="cite_ref-L199_216-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-L199-216">[216]</a></sup> Löwenthal contended that comparisons between Hitler and Stalin were appropriate, but comparisons between Hitler and Lenin were not.<sup id="cite_ref-L199_216-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-L199-216">[216]</a></sup> For Löwenthal, the decisive factor that governed Lenin's conduct was that right from the onset when he took power, he was involved in civil wars within Russia<sup id="cite_ref-L199_216-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-L199-216">[216]</a></sup> Löwenthal argued that “Lenin's battle to hold on to power” did not comprise “one-sided mass annihilation of defenceless people”<sup id="cite_ref-L199_216-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-L199-216">[216]</a></sup> Speaking of the [Russian Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War "Russian Civil War"), Löwenthal argued that “In all these battles there were heavy losses on both sides and horrible torture and murders of prisoners” <sup id="cite_ref-217"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-217">[217]</a></sup> Speaking of the differences between Lenin and Stalin, Löwenthal argued that “What Stalin did from 1929 on was something entirely different”<sup id="cite_ref-L200_218-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-L200-218">[218]</a></sup> Löwenthal argued that with [dekulakization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dekulakization "Dekulakization"), the so-called “kulaks” were to destroyed by the Soviet state as:

Löwenthal wrote that:

> What Stalin did from 1929 both against peasants and against various other victims, including leading Communists... and returned soldiers, was in fact historically new in its systematic inhumanity, and to this extent comparable with the deeds of Hitler. Certainly, Hitler, like all his contemporaries, had a preconception of the civil wars of Lenin's time. Just as certainly his own ideas about the total annihilation of the Jews, the Gypsies, the “unworthy of life”, and so on, were independent of Stalin's example. At any rate the idea of total annihilation of the Jews had already been developed in the last work of Hitler's mentor, [Dietrich Eckart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietrich_Eckart "Dietrich Eckart"), who died in 1924.

## _Historikerstreit_ in the winter of 1986–87\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=43 "Edit section: Historikerstreit in the winter of 1986–87")\]

### "Neither Denial Nor Forgetfulness Will Free Us"\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=44 "Edit section: "Neither Denial Nor Forgetfulness Will Free Us"")\]

Hans Mommsen's twin brother, [Wolfgang Mommsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Mommsen "Wolfgang Mommsen"), in an essay entitled "Neither Denial nor Forgetfulness Will Free Us" (_Frankfurter Rundschau_, 1 December 1986), argued that the debate about the planned German Historical Museum in West Berlin—which was to cover German history from antiquity to the present—and the planned House of History in Bonn—which was to cover the Federal Republic from 1949 to the present—showed the German people were deeply interested in their history.<sup id="cite_ref-220"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-220">[220]</a></sup>

In Mommsen's view, the decisive issue was whether the Federal Republic was a continuation of the _Reich_ that had existed from 1871 to 1945 or not. He argued that at first the continuity thesis dominated, as shown by the lavish celebrations of the 150th anniversary of Bismarck's birthday in 1965, but as a younger generation came of age, a more critical attitude towards the past emerged.<sup id="cite_ref-Mommsen1993p205_221-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Mommsen1993p205-221">[221]</a></sup> He wrote further that German reunification "would presume the collapse of the Soviet empire, a premise unthinkable at the time".<sup id="cite_ref-Mommsen1993p206_222-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Mommsen1993p206-222">[222]</a></sup> As a result, since German reunification was impossible in the 1950s–60s, together with the resumption of Germany as a great power, led West Germans to embrace the idea of integration into the European Economic Community and NATO as the best substitutes. Adenauer's policies of integration into the EEC and NATO suggested that the only role possible for the Federal Republic was at best as a middle-size world power whose influence stemmed from working with other Western powers. The policies of Western integration caused the idea of a continuity of German history to lose its appeal to the younger generation of West Germans, he wrote, leading to the idea popular by the late 1960s that the state founded in 1949 represented discontinuity.<sup id="cite_ref-Mommsen1993p207_223-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Mommsen1993p207-223">[223]</a></sup>

Finally, Mommsen maintained that the discontinuity thesis led to the younger generation of West Germans to become more critical of the old _Reich_ that had existed from 1871 to 1945.<sup id="cite_ref-:28_224-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:28-224">[224]</a></sup> Mommsen argued that for those nationalists still attached to the idea of national continuity, these were painful developments, noting that an article by Nolte in _Die Zeit_ had its title "Against Negative Nationalism in Interpreting History" where Nolte lashed out against historians critical of the German past.<sup id="cite_ref-:28_224-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:28-224">[224]</a></sup> Mommsen argued much of the writing by Nolte, Hildebrand, and Stürmer was clearly aiming to provide for a version of history that celebrated the continuities of German history while trying to get around the more unpleasant aspects of the [German Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire "German Empire") and even more so [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany").<sup id="cite_ref-225"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-225">[225]</a></sup> Mommsen wrote that Nolte, Hildebrand, Stürmer and Hillgruber were in different ways seeking a version of history that allowed for the continuity of German history to be celebrated despite the Nazi era. Mommsen argued that the Nazi period, was however painful and distasteful, part of German history and the memory of which was something all Germans had to face.<sup id="cite_ref-:29_226-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:29-226">[226]</a></sup> Mommsen wrote the Bitburg ceremony of 1985 was intended to "be a kind of line drawn under that segment of German history. But it turned out that, at least in terms of intellectual honesty, that cannot be done, and that no matter what we do, other peoples will not be willing to accept such an act from us".<sup id="cite_ref-:29_226-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:29-226">[226]</a></sup>

Mommsen charged that Nolte was attempting to egregiously whitewash the German past.<sup id="cite_ref-227"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-227">[227]</a></sup> Mommsen argued that Nolte was attempting a "justification" of Nazi crimes and making "inappropriate" comparisons of the Holocaust with other genocides.<sup id="cite_ref-m209_228-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-m209-228">[228]</a></sup> Mommsen wrote that Nolte intended to provide the sort of history that would allow Germans to feel good about being Germans by engaging in “…an explanatory strategy that…will be seen as a justification of National Socialist crimes by all those who are still under the influence of the extreme anti-Soviet propaganda of National Socialism".<sup id="cite_ref-m209_228-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-m209-228">[228]</a></sup> Mommsen wrote about Hillgruber's demands that historians identified with the "justified" German defence of the Eastern Front that:

> Andreas Hillgruber recently attempted to accord a relative historical justification to the Wehrmacht campaign in the East and the desperate resistance of the army in the East after the summer of 1944. He argued that the goal was to prevent the German civilian population from falling into the hands of the Red Army. However, the chief reason, he argued, was that the defense of German cities in the East had become tantamount to defending Western civilization. In light of the Allied war goals, which, independent of Stalin's final plans, envisioned breaking up Prussia and destroying the defensive position of a strong, Prussian-led Central European state that could serve as a bulwark against Bolshevism, the continuation of the war in the East was justified from the viewpoint of those involved. It was, as Hillgruber's argument would have it, also justified even from today's standpoint, despite the fact that prolonging the war in the East meant that the gigantic murder machinery of the Holocaust would be allowed to continue to run. All this, the essay argued, was justified as long as the fronts held. Hillgruber's essay is extremely problematic when viewed from the perspective of a democratically constituted community that orients itself towards Western moral and political standards.

> There is no getting around the bitter truth that the defeat of National Socialist Germany was not only in the interest of the peoples who were bulldozed by Hitler's war and of the peoples who were selected by his henchmen for annihilation or oppression or exploitation - it was also in the interest of the Germans. Accordingly, parts of the gigantic scenery of the Second World War were, at least as far as we were concerned, totally senseless, even self-destructive. We cannot escape this bitter truth by assigning partial responsibility to other partners who took part in the war.<sup id="cite_ref-229"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-229">[229]</a></sup>

Also in an essay published in the December 1, 1986 edition of _The New Republic_, the American historian [Charles S. Maier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_S._Maier "Charles S.

> Hillgruber comes to the conclusion, on the basis of British files that were declassified in the meantime, that the destruction of the German _Reich_ was planned before the mass murder of the Jews became known - and that the mass murder does not explain the end of the _Reich_ ... It is hardly disputable that the attempt to hold the Eastern Front as long as possible against the Red Army meant protection for the German civilian populace in the eastern provinces against murders, rapes, plundering and expulsions by Soviet troops. It was not simply Nazi propaganda against these "Asiatic hordes" that caused this climate of fear.

Reacting to Habermas's criticism that in the Holocaust essay in _Zweierlei Untergang_ that his use of the word "could" in a sentence where Hillgruber wrote that Hitler believed only through genocide of the Jews could Germany become a great power, which Habermas claimed might have indicated that Hillgruber shared Hitler's viewpoint, Hillgruber took much umbrage to Habermas's claim. Hillgruber stated that what he wrote in his Holocaust essay was that the German leadership in 1939 was divided into three factions. One, centred on the Nazi Party and the SS, saw the war as a chance to carry out the "racial reorganization" of Europe via mass expulsions and German colonization, whose roots Hillgruber traced to the war aims of the [Pan-German League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alldeutscher_Verband "Alldeutscher Verband") in the First World War.<sup id="cite_ref-Hillgruber,_Andreas_pages_222-236_243-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Hillgruber,_Andreas_pages_222-236-243">[243]</a></sup> Another faction comprised the traditional German elites in the military, the diplomatic service and the bureaucracy, who saw the war as a chance to destroy the settlement established by the Treaty of Versailles and to establish the world dominance that Germany had sought in the First World War.<sup id="cite_ref-Hillgruber,_Andreas_pages_222-236_243-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Hillgruber,_Andreas_pages_222-236-243">[243]</a></sup> And finally, there was Hitler's "race" program, which sought the genocide of the Jews as the only way to ensure that Germany would be a world power.<sup id="cite_ref-Hillgruber,_Andreas_pages_222-236_243-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Hillgruber,_Andreas_pages_222-236-243">[243]</a></sup> Hillgruber insisted that he was only describing Hitler's beliefs, and did not share them.<sup id="cite_ref-Hillgruber,_Andreas_pages_222-236_243-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Hillgruber,_Andreas_pages_222-236-243">[243]</a></sup> Hillgruber argued that only by reading his second essay about the Holocaust in _Zweierlei Untergang_ could one understand the first essay about the "collapse" on the Eastern Front.<sup id="cite_ref-Hillgruber,_Andreas_pages_222-236_243-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Hillgruber,_Andreas_pages_222-236-243">[243]</a></sup> Hillgruber compared the feelings of Germans about the lost eastern territories to the feelings of the French about their lost colonies in Indochina.<sup id="cite_ref-Hillgruber,_Andreas_pages_222-236_243-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Hillgruber,_Andreas_pages_222-236-243">[243]</a></sup> Hillgruber claimed that, when writing about the end of the "German East" in 1945, to understand the "sense of tragedy" that surrounded the matter one had to take the side of the German civilians who were menaced by the Red Army, and the German soldiers fighting to protect them.<sup id="cite_ref-244"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-244">[244]</a></sup> Hillgruber went on to write that Habermas was seeking to censor him by criticizing him for taking the German side when discussing the last days of the Eastern Front.<sup id="cite_ref-245"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-245">[245]</a></sup> Replying to Habermas's charge that he was a "neo-conservative", Hillgruber wrote:

> How does he come to come categorize my work as having so-called neoconservative tendencies? For decades I have never made any bones about my basic conservative position. Deeply suspicious as I am of all "leftist" and other world-improving utopias, I will gladly let the label "conservative" apply to me, meant though it is as a defamation. But what is the meaning of the prefix "neo"? No one "challenges" this new "battle" label, so often seen these days, in order to turn this APO jargon against the inventor of the label.<sup id="cite_ref-246"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-246">[246]</a></sup>

Hillgruber argued that there was a contradiction in Habermas's claim that he was seeking to revive the original concept of the _[Sonderweg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonderweg "Sonderweg"),_ that is, the ideology of Germany as a great Central European power that was neither of the West or the East which would mean closing Germany off to the culture of the West while at the same time accusing him of trying to create a "NATO philosophy".<sup id="cite_ref-247"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-247">[247]</a></sup> Hillgruber took the opportunity to once more restate his belief that there was no moral difference between the actions of the German Nazis and the Soviet Communists, and questioned whether the Holocaust was a "singular" event.<sup id="cite_ref-248"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-248">[248]</a></sup> Finally, Hillgruber accused Habermas of being behind the "agitation and psychic terror" suffered by non-Marxist professors in the late 1960s, and warned him that if he was trying to bring back "...that unbearable atmosphere that ruled in those years at West German universities, then he is deluding himself".<sup id="cite_ref-249"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-249">[249]</a></sup>

In an essay entitled "The Nazi Era-A Case of Normal Tyranny?" first published in _Die neue Gesellschaft_ magazine in late 1986, the political scientist Walter Euchner wrote that Nolte was wrong when he wrote of Hitler's alleged terror of the Austrian Social Democratic Party parades before 1914, and argued that Social Democratic parties in both Germany and Austria were fundamentally humane and pacifistic, instead of the terrorist-revolutionary entities that Nolte alleged them to be.<sup id="cite_ref-e240_250-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-e240-250">[250]</a></sup> Euchner wrote that:

> "Politicians like [Karl Kautsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Kautsky "Karl Kautsky") and [Eduard Bernstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Bernstein "Eduard Bernstein") certainly did not inspire anyone to phantasies about annihilation.

Euchner went to argue that there was no comparison of German and Soviet crimes in his view because Germany had had an "outstanding intellectual heritage" and the Nazis had carried out a policy of genocide with the "voluntary support of a substantial part of the traditional elites".<sup id="cite_ref-e240_250-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-e240-250">[250]</a></sup> Eulchner wrote that Hildebrand's claim that the Allied powers had "horrifying" war aims was meant to show there everyone was equally evil in World War II and no one had the right "to point his finger at others", which Euchner wrote was clearly meant to end any reason for to see the Holocaust as special.<sup id="cite_ref-e238_251-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-e238-251">[251]</a></sup>

The journalist Robert Leicht in an essay first published in _Die Zeit_ on December 26, 1986, asserted that Nolte was attempting to end the German shame over the Holocaust by making "absurd" arguments.<sup id="cite_ref-L246_252-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-L246-252">[252]</a></sup> Leicht argued that Stalin was not the "real" cause of the Holocaust as Nolte alleged, and that because the Holocaust was without precedent in German history, it was indeed "singular".<sup id="cite_ref-L246_252-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-L246-252">[252]</a></sup> Leicht complained about the apologist effect of lines like evil "done in the German name" as making it sound as if "the Germans had not done these things themselves but had hired a subcontractor".<sup id="cite_ref-L246_252-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-L246-252">[252]</a></sup> Leicht argued that Germans "cannot erect straight genealogical trees" with regards to their history as the Nazi period could not be a source of pride, meaning there was always going to be a "broken relationship" with their history.<sup id="cite_ref-:31_253-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:31-253">[253]</a></sup> Leicht asserted that the Nazi era was a part of the German past that justifiably inspired shame, and there was nothing that historians and politicians could do to end this shame, as the _Historikerstreit_ and the Bitburg controversy had just proved.<sup id="cite_ref-254"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-254">[254]</a></sup> Leicht argued that aspects of German history that made Hitler possible could not be celebrated today, that the "historiczation" of National Socialism as suggested by Broszat was necessary, and that Germans should resist the appeal of myths intended to make the shame caused by the Nazi era go away.<sup id="cite_ref-:31_253-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:31-253">[253]</a></sup> Leicht ended his essay by writing "we also stand in the shadow of a history that we can no longer heal.

### "Those Who Refused to Go Along"\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=49 "Edit section: "Those Who Refused to Go Along"")\]

The political scientist Joachim Perels in an essay first published in the _Frankfurter Rundschau_ newspaper on December 27, 1986, argued that Nolte's bias could be seen in that Nolte was full of fury against the "permanent status of privilege" that he alleged that those who were descendants of Nazi victims were said to enjoy while at the same time having the utmost sympathy for Hitler and his alleged terror of Bolshevik "Asiatic deeds".<sup id="cite_ref-256"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-256">[256]</a></sup> Perels thought it was outrageous for Hillgruber to praise those German officers who stayed loyal to Hitler during the July 20th _putsch_ as making the right moral choice, and felt that Hillgruber had slandered those Germans who chose to resist the Nazi regime as traitors who let down their country in its hour of need.<sup id="cite_ref-257"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-257">[257]</a></sup> Perels wrote that Hillgruber's identification with those Wehrmacht officers who stayed loyal to Hitler with Germany meant excluding all of the Germans suffering in the concentration camps in 1944–45 from history.<sup id="cite_ref-:32_258-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:32-258">[258]</a></sup> In the same way, Perels wrote that Meier had praised those Germans who joined the Wehrmacht as doing their duty to the Fatherland which Perels felt disparaged those Germans who refused to join the Wehrmacht and were sent to concentration camps.<sup id="cite_ref-259"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-259">[259]</a></sup> Perels felt that both Meier and even more so Hillgruber with his call for historians to "identify" with the Wehrmacht had equated Germany with those who fought for Hitler, charging this way of writing history excluded those Germans opposed to Hitler.<sup id="cite_ref-:32_258-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:32-258">[258]</a></sup>

Perels used as an example of what he arguing against that in 1956 the West German Supreme Court upheld the death sentences handed down to Lutheran pastor [Dietrich Bonhoeffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietrich_Bonhoeffer "Dietrich Bonhoeffer") and the lawyer [Hans von Dohnányi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_von_Dohn%C3%A1nyi "Hans von Dohnányi") as legal, under the grounds that Hitler was the legal leader of Germany and Bonhoeffer and Dohnayi were guilty of treason by working for his overthrow, meaning their executions by the SS were lawful and the judge and prosecutor in their case did nothing wrong.<sup id="cite_ref-:33_260-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:33-260">[260]</a></sup> Perels wrote that Hillgruber's book _Zweierlei Untergang_ which praised those German officers who stayed to Hitler as making the correct ethical choice served to put him in the same moral camp as the judges of the Supreme Court who regarded Bonhoeffer and Dohnányi as traitors who were properly executed. Perels argued it was time for historians to have a "serious discussion about the hereditary encumbrance of National Socialism".<sup id="cite_ref-261"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-261">[261]</a></sup> In this regard, Perels argued that far being "The Past That Will Not Go Away", that the memory of the Nazi period was a subject that the Germans were only tentatively even in the 1980s starting to explore.<sup id="cite_ref-:33_260-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:33-260">[260]</a></sup>

In an essay first published in the _Evangelische Kommentare_ magazine in February 1987, Geiss called Nolte's claim about Weizmann's letter being a Jewish “declaration of war” as “hair-raising nonsense”<sup id="cite_ref-262"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-262">[262]</a></sup> Geiss wrote that both essays in _Zweierlei Untergang_ were "respectable", but that it was "irritating" and ill-advised on the part of Hillgruber to publish them together, with the implied moral equivalence between the expulsion of the Germans from Eastern Europe, and the genocide of the Jews.<sup id="cite_ref-Geiss_pages_254-258_263-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Geiss_pages_254-258-263">[263]</a></sup> Geiss accused Habermas of engaging in a "malicious insinuation" in his attacks on Hillgruber.<sup id="cite_ref-Geiss_pages_254-258_263-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Geiss_pages_254-258-263">[263]</a></sup> Geiss wrote that Hillgruber's demand that historians had to side with German troops fighting on the Eastern Front was problematic, but it did "...not justify the merciless severity, almost in the tone of an Old Testament prophet with which Habermas goes after this dissident historian".<sup id="cite_ref-Geiss_pages_254-258_263-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Geiss_pages_254-258-263">[263]</a></sup>

### Habermas's Note of 23 February 1987\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=51 "Edit section: Habermas's Note of 23 February 1987")\]

Habermas in "Note" of 23 February 1987 responded to the criticism of Hillgruber and Hildebrand of dishonesty by noting a small error in his article "Damage Control in German History" that both Hillgruber and Hildebrand ignored.<sup id="cite_ref-:34_264-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:34-264">[264]</a></sup> Habermas responded to the criticism of Stürmer denying that he was seeking "endow history with meaning" by citing his remark from his 1986 book _Dissonanzen des Fortschritts_: "It appears necessary to abandon the merely apparent difference between social history and cultural history and to understand that at the end of the twentieth century humans residing in industrial cultures must more than ever before seek and comprehend their historical identity in order not to lose themselves".<sup id="cite_ref-:34_264-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:34-264">[264]</a></sup> About the line of "true and tried" Nazi officials, Habermas justified the procedure under the grounds that in general Hillgruber spoke warmly of the role that Nazi Party officials played in helping to sustain the "justified" defense in eastern Germany in _Zweierlei Untergang_, writing that Hillgruber's approach to the subject is one where the war effort of Nazi Germany is applauded.<sup id="cite_ref-:34_264-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-:34-264">[264]</a></sup>

Habermas went on to argue that: "And in any case, this ridiculous dispute about words and secondary virtues just confirms Hillgruber's lack of objectivity about this entire sphere. This a case of praising the fire department that set the fire".<sup id="cite_ref-Habermas_pages_260-262_265-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Habermas_pages_260-262-265">[265]</a></sup> Habermas ended his article with the remark that Hillgruber was an extremely shoddy historian, claiming that Hillgruber's charge that he was a leading 60s radical who was behind "...the agitation unleashed by extreme leftists at West German universities and on the psychic terror aimed at individual non-Marxist colleagues" was simply not supported by the facts, and told Hillgruber to read one of his own books about his actions in the late 1960s before making such claims.<sup id="cite_ref-Habermas_pages_260-262_265-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Habermas_pages_260-262-265">[265]</a></sup>

Nolte in his "Note" of 15 April 1987 wrote his principal objection to the subtitle to Piper's book<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="The text near this tag may need clarification or removal of jargon.

Nolte's admirer [Joachim Fest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_Fest "Joachim Fest") was later to argue in his "Postscript" of April 21, 1987 that Nolte was motivated by purely scholarly concerns, and was only attempting the "historicization" of National Socialism that [Martin Broszat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Broszat "Martin Broszat") called for<sup id="cite_ref-f265_267-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-f265-267">[267]</a></sup> Fest wrote that in his view:

> "In its substance, the dispute was initiated by Ernst Nolte's question whether Hitler's monstrous will to annihilate the Jews, judging from its origin, came from early Viennese impressions or, what is more likely, from later Munich experiences, that is, whether Hitler was an originator or simply being reactive. Despite all the consequences that arose from his answer, Nolte's question was, in fact, a purely academic exercise. The conclusions would probably not have caused as much controversy if they had been accompanied by special circumstances"<sup id="cite_ref-268"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-268">[268]</a></sup>

Fest accused Habermas and his allies of attempting to silence those whose views they disliked. Fest wrote that:

> "Standing on the one side, to simplify, are those who want to preserve Hitler and National Socialism as a kind of antimyth that can be used for political intentions—the theory of a conspiracy on the part of the political right, to which Nolte, Stürmer, and Hillgruber are linked. This becomes evident in the defamatory statements and the expansion of the dispute to the historical museums. It is doubtless no coincidence that Habermas, Jäckel, Mommsen and others become involved in the recent election campaign in this way. Many statements in favor of the pluralistic character of scholarship and in favor of an ethos representing a republic of learned men reveal themselves as merely empty phrases to the person who has an overview of these things"<sup id="cite_ref-f265_267-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-f265-267">[267]</a></sup>

Fest argued that:

> "Strictly speaking, Nolte did nothing but take up the suggestion by Broszat and others that National Socialism be historicized. It was clear to anyone with any sense for the topic-and Broszat's opening article made it evident that he too had recognized it-that this transition would be beset with difficulties. But that the most incensed objections would come from those who from the beginning were the spokesmen of historicization-this was no less surprising then the recognition that yesterday's enlighteners are today's intolerant mythologues, people who want to forbid questions from being posed"<sup id="cite_ref-f265_267-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-f265-267">[267]</a></sup>

Fest predicated that scholarship in the future will vindicate Nolte and called Habermas and his allies "the advocates of a hopeless cause".<sup id="cite_ref-f265_267-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-f265-267">[267]</a></sup>

### The controversy over Nolte's thesis\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=54 "Edit section: The controversy over Nolte's thesis")\]

These views ignited a firestorm of controversy. Most historians in West Germany and virtually all historians outside Germany condemned Nolte's interpretation as factually incorrect, and as coming dangerously close to justifying the Holocaust.<sup id="cite_ref-ker173_269-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ker173-269">[269]</a></sup> Many historians, such as [Steven T. Katz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_T._Katz "Steven T. Katz"), claimed that Nolte's “Age of Genocide” concept “trivialized” the Holocaust by reducing it to one of just many 20th century genocides.<sup id="cite_ref-270"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-270">[270]</a></sup> A common line of criticism were that Nazi crimes, above all the Holocaust, were singularly and uniquely evil, and could not be compared to the crimes of others. Some historians such as [Hans-Ulrich Wehler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Ulrich_Wehler "Hans-Ulrich Wehler") were most forceful in arguing that the sufferings of the “kulaks” deported during the Soviet “dekulakization” campaign of the early 1930s were in no way analogous to the suffering of the Jews deported in the early 1940s. Many were angered by Nolte's claim that "the so-called annihilation of the Jews under the Third Reich was a reaction or a distorted copy and not a first act or an original", with many such as [Ian Kershaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Kershaw "Ian Kershaw") wondering why Nolte spoke of the "so-called annihilation of the Jews" in describing the Holocaust.<sup id="cite_ref-ker173_269-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ker173-269">[269]</a></sup> Some of the historians who denounced Nolte's views included [Hans Mommsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Mommsen "Hans Mommsen"), [Jürgen Kocka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Kocka "Jürgen Kocka"), [Detlev Peukert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detlev_Peukert "Detlev Peukert"), [Martin Broszat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Broszat "Martin Broszat"), [Hans-Ulrich Wehler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Ulrich_Wehler "Hans-Ulrich Wehler"), [Michael Wolffsohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Wolffsohn "Michael Wolffsohn"), [Heinrich August Winkler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_August_Winkler "Heinrich August Winkler"), [Wolfgang Mommsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Mommsen "Wolfgang Mommsen"), [Karl Dietrich Bracher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Dietrich_Bracher "Karl Dietrich Bracher") and [Eberhard Jäckel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberhard_J%C3%A4ckel "Eberhard Jäckel"). Much (though not all) of the criticism of Nolte came from historians who favored either the _[Sonderweg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonderweg "Sonderweg")_ (_Special Way_) and/or [intentionalist/functionalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism_versus_intentionalism "Functionalism versus intentionalism") interpretations of German history. From the advocates of the _Sonderweg_ approach came the criticism that Nolte's views had totally externalized the origins of the National Socialist dictatorship to the post-1917 period, whereas in their view, the roots of the Nazi dictatorship can be traced back to the 19th century [German Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire "German Empire").<sup id="cite_ref-Low_p._474_93-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Low_p._474-93">[93]</a></sup> In particular, it was argued that within the virulently and ferociously anti-Semitic [Völkisch movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lkisch_movement "Völkisch movement"), which first arose in the latter half of the 19th century, the ideological seeds of the _Shoah_ were already planted.<sup id="cite_ref-Low_p._474_93-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Low_p._474-93">[93]</a></sup> From both functionalist and intentionist historians came the similar criticism that the motives and momentum for the "Final Solution to the Jewish Question" came primarily from within Germany, not as the result of external events. Intentionalists argued that Hitler did not need the Russian Revolution to provide him with a genocidal mindset, while functionalists argued it was the unstable power structure and bureaucratic rivalries of the Third Reich, which led to genocide of the Jews. Another line of criticism centered around Nolte refusal to say just precisely when he believes the Nazis decided upon genocide, and have pointed out that at various times, Nolte has implied the decision for genocide was taken in the early 1920s, or the early 1930s or the 1940s.

Coming to Nolte's defence were the journalist [Joachim Fest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_Fest "Joachim Fest"), the philosopher Helmut Fleischer, and the historians' [Klaus Hildebrand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Hildebrand "Klaus Hildebrand"), [Rainer Zitelmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Zitelmann "Rainer Zitelmann"), [Hagen Schulze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagen_Schulze "Hagen Schulze"), Thomas Nipperdey and [Imanuel Geiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imanuel_Geiss "Imanuel Geiss"). The latter was unusual amongst Nolte's defenders as Geiss was normally identified with the left, while the rest of Nolte's supporters were seen as either on the right or holding centrist views. In response to Wehler's book, Geiss later published a book entitled _Der Hysterikerstreit. Ein unpolemischer Essay_ (_The Hysterical Dispute An Unpolemical Essay_) in which he largely defended Nolte against Wehler's criticisms. Geiss wrote Nolte's critics had "taken in isolation" his statements and were guilty of being "hasty readers"<sup id="cite_ref-271"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-271">[271]</a></sup>

Further adding to the controversy was a statement by Nolte in June 1987 that Adolf Hitler "created the state of Israel", and that "the Jews would eventually come to appreciate Hitler as the individual who contributed more than anyone else to the creation of the state of Israel".<sup id="cite_ref-IHR_Newsletter_#51_272-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-IHR_Newsletter_#51-272">[272]</a></sup> As a result of that remark, Nolte was sacked from his position as chief editor of the German language edition of [Theodore Herzl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Herzl "Theodore Herzl")'s letters by the _Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft_ (German Research Community), the group that was responsible for the financing of the Herzl papers project.<sup id="cite_ref-IHR_Newsletter_#51_272-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-IHR_Newsletter_#51-272">[272]</a></sup> Another controversial claim by Nolte was his statement that massacres of the _[Volksdeutsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksdeutsch "Volksdeutsch")_ minority in Poland after the German invasion of 1939 were an act of genocide by the Polish government, and thereby justified the German aggression as part of an effort to save the German minority.<sup id="cite_ref-ev56_67-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ev56-67">[67]</a></sup> Another contentious set of claims by Nolte was his argument that the film [_Shoah_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoah_(film) "Shoah (film)") showed that it was "probable" that the [SS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel "Schutzstaffel") were just as much victims of the Holocaust as were the Jews, and the Polish victims of the Germans were just as much anti-Semites as the Nazis, thereby proving it was unjust to single out Germans for criticism.<sup id="cite_ref-n20_44-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n20-44">[44]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ev31_273-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ev31-273">[273]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-L214_274-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-L214-274">[274]</a></sup> Nolte claimed that more “Aryans” than Jews were murdered at Auschwitz, a fact overlooked because most Holocaust research comes “to an overwhelming degree from Jewish authors”.<sup id="cite_ref-L214_274-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-L214-274">[274]</a></sup> Likewise, Nolte has implied that the atrocities committed by the Germans in Poland and the Soviet Union were justified by earlier Polish and Soviet atrocities.<sup id="cite_ref-275"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-275">[275]</a></sup> In response, Nolte's critics have argued that though there were massacres of ethnic Germans in Poland in 1939 (about 4,000 to 6,000 being killed after the German invasion), these were not part of a genocidal program on the part of the Poles, but were rather the _ad hoc_ reaction of panic-stricken Polish troops to (sometimes justified) rumors of [fifth column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_column "Fifth column") activities on the part of the _volksdeutsch_, and can not in any way be compared to the more systematic brutality of the German occupiers towards the Poles, which led to a 25% population reduction in Poland during the war.<sup id="cite_ref-276"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-276">[276]</a></sup> Another contentious statement by Nolte was his argument that the [Wannsee Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wannsee_Conference "Wannsee Conference") of 1942 never occurred.<sup id="cite_ref-L214_274-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-L214-274">[274]</a></sup> Nolte wrote that too many Holocaust historians were "biased" Jewish historians, whom Nolte strongly hinted manufactured the minutes of the Wannsee conference.<sup id="cite_ref-ev83_277-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ev83-277">[277]</a></sup> The British historian [Richard J. Evans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_J._Evans "Richard J. Evans") was highly offended by Nolte's claims that German massacres of Soviet Jews carried out by the _[Einsatzgruppen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsatzgruppen "Einsatzgruppen")_ and the Wehrmacht were a legitimate "preventive security" measure that was not a [war crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime "War crime").<sup id="cite_ref-ev82_278-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ev82-278">[278]</a></sup> Nolte wrote that during [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"), the Germans would have been justified in exterminating the entire Belgian people as an act of "preventive security" because of _[franc-tireur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francs-tireurs "Francs-tireurs")_ attacks, and thus the [Rape of Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_of_Belgium "Rape of Belgium") was an act of German restraint; similarly, Nolte wrote that because many [Soviet partisans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_partisans "Soviet partisans") were Jews, the Germans were within their rights in seeking to kill every single Jewish man, women and child they encountered in Russia as an act of "preventive security".<sup id="cite_ref-ev82_278-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ev82-278">[278]</a></sup>

In particular, controversy centered on an argument of Nolte's 1985 essay “Between Myth and Revisionism” from the book _Aspects of the Third Reich_, first published in German as _"Die negative Lebendigkeit des Dritten Reiches"_ (_"The Negative Legend of the Third Reich"_) as an opinion piece in the _Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung_ on 24 July 1980, but which did not attract widespread attention until 1986 when [Jürgen Habermas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas "Jürgen Habermas") criticized the essay in a _feuilleton_ piece.<sup id="cite_ref-279"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-279">[279]</a></sup> Nolte had delivered a lecture at the Siemans-Sitftung in 1980, and excerpts from his speech were published in the _Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung_ without attracting controversy.<sup id="cite_ref-280"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-280">[280]</a></sup> In his essay, Nolte argued that if the [PLO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization "Palestine Liberation Organization") were to destroy Israel, then the subsequent history written in the new Palestinian state would portray the former Israeli state in the blackest of colors with no references to any of the positive features of the defunct state.<sup id="cite_ref-koch21_281-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-koch21-281">[281]</a></sup> In Nolte's opinion, a similar situation of history written only by the victors exists in regards to the history of Nazi Germany.<sup id="cite_ref-koch21_281-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-koch21-281">[281]</a></sup> Many historians, such as British historian [Richard J. Evans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_J._Evans "Richard J. Evans"), have asserted that, based on this statement, Nolte appears to believe that the only reason why Nazism is regarded as evil is because Germany lost World War II, with no regard for the Holocaust.<sup id="cite_ref-282"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-282">[282]</a></sup> [Klaus Hildebrand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Hildebrand "Klaus Hildebrand") called in a review in the _Historische Zeitschrift_ journal on 2 April 1986 called Nolte's essay "Between Myth and Revisionism" “trailbrazing”.<sup id="cite_ref-L213_283-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-L213-283">[283]</a></sup> In the same review of Nolte's essay "Between Myth and Revisionism", Hildebrand argued Nolte had in a praiseworthy way sought:

### _Entsorgung der deutschen Vergangenheit?_ (1988)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=55 "Edit section: Entsorgung der deutschen Vergangenheit? (1988)")\]

[Hans-Ulrich Wehler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Ulrich_Wehler "Hans-Ulrich Wehler") was so enraged by Nolte's views that he wrote a book _Entsorgung der deutschen Vergangenheit?: ein polemischer Essay zum "Historikerstreit"_ (_Exoneration of the German Past?: A Polemical Essay about the "Historikerstreit"_) in 1988, a lengthy polemic attacking every aspect of Nolte's views. Wehler described the _Historikerstreit_ as a "political struggle" for the historical understanding of the German past between "a cartel devoted to repressing and excusing" the memory of the Nazi years, of which Nolte was the chief member, against "the representatives of a liberal-democratic politics, of an enlightened, self-critical position, of a rationality which is critical of ideology".<sup id="cite_ref-mu40_285-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-mu40-285">[285]</a></sup> In another essay, Wehler declared:

> "Hitler supposedly believed in the reality of this danger \[of the Soviet Union threatening Germany\]. Moreover, his dread of being overwhelmed by the "Asiatic" Bolsheviks was allegedly the prime motivating force behind his policies and personality. Nolte restated his axiom-one which perhaps reflects the naiveté of an historian who has devoted his life's work to the power of ideologies-in a blunter, more pointed form than ever before in the fall of 1987: "To view Hitler as a German politician rather the anti-Lenin", he reproved hundreds of knowledgeable historians, "strikes me as a proof of a regrettable myopia and narrowness". Starting from his premise, and falling under the sway of the very fears and phobias he himself has played up, Nolte once again defiantly insisted: "If Hitler was a person fundamentally driven by fears-by among others a fear of the "rat cage"-and if this renders "his motivations more understandable", then the war against the Soviet Union was not only "the greatest war ever of destruction and enslavement", but also "in spite of this, objectively speaking \[!\], a preemptive war".
> 
> While Nolte may like to describe his motive as the purely scientific interest of (as he likes to put it) a solitary thinker in search of a supposedly more complex, more accurate understanding of the years between 1917 and 1945, a number of political implications are clearly present. The basic tendency of Nolte's reinterpretation is to unburden German history by relativizing the Holocaust. Nolte claims the Nazi mass murder was modeled on and instigated by the excesses of the Russian Revolution, the Stalinist regime and the Gulag; that it countered this "Asiatic" danger by imitating and surpassing it. This new localization of "absolute evil" in Nolte's [political theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_theology "Political theology") leads away from Hitler, National Socialism and German history. It shifts the real origins of fascist barbarism onto the Marxist postulate-and the Bolshevik practice-of extermination. Once again the classic mechanism of locating the source of evil outside one's own history is at work. The German war of destruction certainly remains inhuman. But because its roots supposedly lie in the Marxist theory and Bolshevik class warfare, the German perpetrator is now seen to be reacting in defensive, understandable panic to the "original" inhumanity of the East. From there, it is only one more step to the astounding conclusion that Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 and the war of conquest and extermination that followed were "objectively speaking"-one can hardly believe one's eyes-"a preemptive war".<sup id="cite_ref-286"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-286">[286]</a></sup>

### _Der europäische Bürgerkrieg_ (1987)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=56 "Edit section: Der europäische Bürgerkrieg (1987)")\]

Another area of controversy was Nolte's 1987 book _Der europäische Bürgerkrieg_ and some accompanying statements, in which Nolte appeared to flirt with [Holocaust denial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_denial "Holocaust denial") as a serious historical argument.<sup id="cite_ref-ev83_277-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ev83-277">[277]</a></sup> In a letter to Otto Dov Kulka of 8 December 1986 Nolte criticized the work of French Holocaust denier [Robert Faurisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Faurisson "Robert Faurisson") on the ground that the Holocaust did in fact occur, but went on to argue that Faurisson's work was motivated by admirable motives, in the form of sympathy for Palestinians and opposition to Israel.<sup id="cite_ref-287"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-287">[287]</a></sup> In _Der europäische Bürgerkrieg_, Nolte claimed that the intentions of Holocaust deniers are "often honorable", and that some of their claims are "not obviously without foundation".<sup id="cite_ref-L214_274-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-L214-274">[274]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ev83_277-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ev83-277">[277]</a></sup> Kershaw has argued that Nolte was operating on the borderlines of Holocaust denial with his implied claim that the "negative myth" of Nazi Germany was created by Jewish historians, his allegations of the domination of Holocaust scholarship by Jewish historians, and his statements that one should withhold judgment on Holocaust deniers, whom Nolte insists are not exclusively Germans or fascists.<sup id="cite_ref-ker176_62-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ker176-62">[62]</a></sup> In Kershaw's opinion, Nolte is attempting to imply that perhaps Holocaust deniers are on to something.<sup id="cite_ref-ker176_62-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ker176-62">[62]</a></sup>

In _Der europäische Bürgerkrieg_, Nolte made five different arguments as a way of criticizing the uniqueness of the _Shoah_ thesis. There were:

-   There were other equally horrible acts of violence in the 20th century.<sup id="cite_ref-288"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-288">[288]</a></sup> Some of the examples Nolte cited were the [Armenian genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide "Armenian genocide"), Soviet [deportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_transfer_in_the_Soviet_Union "Population transfer in the Soviet Union") of the so-called “traitor nations” like the [Crimean Tatars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_Tatars "Crimean Tatars") and the [Volga Germans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga_Germans "Volga Germans"), Allied “[area bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II "Strategic bombing during World War II")” in World War II, and American war crimes in the Vietnam War.<sup id="cite_ref-Evans,_Richard_page_81_289-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Evans,_Richard_page_81-289">[289]</a></sup>
-   Nazi genocide was only a copy of Soviet genocide, and thus can in no way can be considered unique.<sup id="cite_ref-Evans,_Richard_page_81_289-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Evans,_Richard_page_81-289">[289]</a></sup> In support of this, Nolte claimed that Lenin had “exterminated” the Russian _intelligentsia_, and used Hitler's remark at press conference of November 10, 1938 where he commented he might have to “exterminate” the German _intelligentsia_ as an example how he feels that Hitler had merely copied Lenin.<sup id="cite_ref-Evans,_Richard_page_81_289-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Evans,_Richard_page_81-289">[289]</a></sup>
-   Nolte argued that the vast majority of Germans had no knowledge of the _Shoah_ while it was going on<sup id="cite_ref-Evans,_Richard_page_81_289-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Evans,_Richard_page_81-289">[289]</a></sup> Nolte claimed that the genocide of the Jews was Hitler's personal pet project, and the Holocaust was the work of only a few Germans entirely unrepresentative of German society<sup id="cite_ref-Evans,_Richard_page_81_289-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Evans,_Richard_page_81-289">[289]</a></sup> Against the American historian [Raul Hilberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raul_Hilberg "Raul Hilberg"), who claimed that hundreds of thousands of Germans were complicit in the _Shoah_ from high-ranking bureaucrats to railway clerks and locomotive conductors, Nolte argued that the functional division of labour in a modern society meant that most people in Germany had no idea of how they were assisting in genocide.<sup id="cite_ref-Evans,_Richard_page_82_290-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Evans,_Richard_page_82-290">[290]</a></sup> In support of this, Nolte cited the voluminous memoirs of German generals and Nazi leaders like [Albert Speer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Speer "Albert Speer") who claimed to have no idea that their country was engaging in genocide during World War II.<sup id="cite_ref-Evans,_Richard_page_82_290-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Evans,_Richard_page_82-290">[290]</a></sup>
-   Nolte maintained that to a certain degree, Nazi anti-Semitic policies were justified responses to Jewish actions against Germany such as Weizmann's alleged 1939 “declaration of war” on Germany.<sup id="cite_ref-Evans,_Richard_page_82_290-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Evans,_Richard_page_82-290">[290]</a></sup>
-   Finally, Nolte hinted that perhaps the Holocaust never happened at all.<sup id="cite_ref-Evans,_Richard_page_83_291-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Evans,_Richard_page_83-291">[291]</a></sup> Nolte claimed that the [Wannsee Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wannsee_Conference "Wannsee Conference") never happened, and argues that most Holocaust scholarship is flawed because most Holocaust historians are Jewish, and thus “biased” against Germany and in favour of the idea that there was a Holocaust.<sup id="cite_ref-Evans,_Richard_page_83_291-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Evans,_Richard_page_83-291">[291]</a></sup>

In _Der europäische Bürgerkrieg_, Nolte wrote that in 1939 Germany was a "liberal" country compared with the Soviet Union.<sup id="cite_ref-Evans,_Richard_page_156_292-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Evans,_Richard_page_156-292">[292]</a></sup> Nolte argued that most German citizens provided that there were "Aryans" and were not politically active had little to fear from the [Gestapo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestapo "Gestapo") whereas in the Soviet Union at the same time millions were being arrested, tortured and executed by the [NKVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKVD "NKVD").<sup id="cite_ref-Evans,_Richard_page_156_292-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Evans,_Richard_page_156-292">[292]</a></sup> Likewise, Nolte argued that the death rate in the German [concentration camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camps "Nazi concentration camps") was lower those in the Soviet [Gulag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag "Gulag") camps, and used Hitler's long-running dispute with the German judiciary over the "correct" sentences to hand down as an example of how 1939 Germany was a "normal" country compared to the Soviet Union since Stalin did not have the same trouble with his judges over the "correct" sentences to hand out.<sup id="cite_ref-Evans,_Richard_page_156_292-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Evans,_Richard_page_156-292">[292]</a></sup> The British historian [Richard J.

Another controversial statement by Nolte in _Der europäische Bürgerkrieg_ was his comment that the _[Kristallnacht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht "Kristallnacht")_ pogrom was not that bad as [pogroms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Jewish_pogroms_in_the_Russian_Empire "Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire") in Imperial Russia killed far more Jews than those killed in _Kristallnacht_, and that further more people were in being killed in the Soviet Union during the [Great Terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge "Great Purge") at the same time than were killed in the _Kristallnacht_.<sup id="cite_ref-Evans,_Richard_page_155_293-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Evans,_Richard_page_155-293">[293]</a></sup> Likewise, Nolte argued that Nazi anti-Semitic laws had hardly affected Jewish participation in the German economy.<sup id="cite_ref-Evans,_Richard_page_155_293-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Evans,_Richard_page_155-293">[293]</a></sup> In this respect, Nolte favourably cited the remarks by Sir [Horace Rumbold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Horace_Rumbold,_9th_Baronet "Sir Horace Rumbold, 9th Baronet"), the British Ambassador to Germany 1928–33 who claimed that the “ostentatious kind of lifestyle of Jewish bankers and monied people inevitably aroused envy, as unemployment spread generally” and who spoke of “the sins of the Russian and Galician Jews” who came to Germany after 1918.<sup id="cite_ref-Evans,_Richard_page_155_293-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Evans,_Richard_page_155-293">[293]</a></sup> The British historian [Richard J.

A further controversial claim was Nolte's statement that violence in the defence of the social order is always preferable to violence aiming at the destruction of the social order.<sup id="cite_ref-Evans,_Richard_page_29_294-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Evans,_Richard_page_29-294">[294]</a></sup> Thus, Nolte argued that the notorious lenience of judges in the [Weimar Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic "Weimar Republic") towards perpetrators of violence from the right while imposing stiff sentences on perpetrators of violence from the left was justified.<sup id="cite_ref-Evans,_Richard_page_29_294-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Evans,_Richard_page_29-294">[294]</a></sup> In this way, Nolte maintained that the very harsh sentences given to the leaders of the _Rote Ocktober_ (Red October) _putsch_ attempt in [Hamburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg "Hamburg") of October 1923 were justified while the light sentences that Hitler and the other Nazi leaders received for the [Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich "Munich") [Beer Hall Putsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_Hall_Putsch "Beer Hall Putsch") of November 1923 were also completely warranted because Nolte claimed that the Nazis were only attempting to overthrow the Weimar Republic in order to save the social order.<sup id="cite_ref-Evans,_Richard_page_29_294-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Evans,_Richard_page_29-294">[294]</a></sup> Nolte claimed that the German Communists were seeking the "social destruction of the bourgeoisie" in the interests of the Soviet Union, which "physically exterminated these classes" while the Nazis sought only the destruction of the "Versailles system".<sup id="cite_ref-295"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-295">[295]</a></sup>

Nolte's critic, the British historian [Richard J. Evans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_J._Evans "Richard J.

Criticism from abroad came from [Ian Kershaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Kershaw "Ian Kershaw"), [Gordon A. Craig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_A._Craig "Gordon A. Craig"), [Richard J.

Mason wrote against Nolte in a call for the sort of theories of generic fascism that Nolte himself had once championed:

> “If we can do without much of the original contents of the concept of ‘fascism’, we cannot do without comparison. “Historicization” may easily become a recipe for provincialism. And the moral absolutes of Habermas, however politically and didactically impeccable, also carry a shadow of provincialism, as long as they fail to recognize that fascism was a continental phenomenon and that Nazism was a peculiar part of something much larger. Pol Pot, the rat torture and the fate of the Armenians are all extraneous to any serious discussion of Nazism; Mussolini's Italy is not.”<sup id="cite_ref-300"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-300">[300]</a></sup>

In response to Nolte's article "Between Myth and Revisionism", Israeli historian [Otto Dov Kulka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Dov_Kulka "Otto Dov Kulka") in a letter to Nolte on November 24, 1985, criticized Nolte for abandoning the view that he expressed in _The Three Faces of Fascism_ that the Holocaust was a "singular" event, and asked "Which of the two Ernst Noltes should we regard as the authentic one?"<sup id="cite_ref-308"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-308">[308]</a></sup> In his reply, Nolte told Kulka to read his up-coming book _Der europäische Bürgerkrieg_ to better understand his "shift of emphasis".<sup id="cite_ref-309"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-309">[309]</a></sup> In a reply of May 16, 1986, Kulka accused Nolte of engaging in a "shift of responsibility" with the Holocaust as a "preventive measure" forced on the Germans by the "Jewish provocation" of Weizmann's letter to Chamberlain.<sup id="cite_ref-k154_310-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-k154-310">[310]</a></sup> In a letter to Nolte on July 18, 1986, Kulka wrote in defense of the "singularity" of the Holocaust that: "The uniqueness of the National Socialist mass murder of the Jews must be understood in the world-historical sense attributed to it-as an attempt to bring about a change in the course of universal history and its goals.

The Anglo-German historian [H.W. Koch](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=H.W._Koch&action=edit&redlink=1 "H.W.

In a 1987 essay, the Austrian-born Israeli historian [Walter Grab](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Walter_Grab&action=edit&redlink=1 "Walter Grab (page does not exist)") accused Nolte of engaging in an “apologia” for Nazi Germany.<sup id="cite_ref-Grab,_Walter_pp._273-278_313-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Grab,_Walter_pp._273-278-313">[313]</a></sup> Grab called Nolte's claim that Weizmann's letter to Chamberlain was a "Jewish declaration of war" that justified the Germans "interning" European Jews a "monstrous theses" that was not supported by the facts.<sup id="cite_ref-Grab,_Walter_pp._273-278_313-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Grab,_Walter_pp._273-278-313">[313]</a></sup> Grab accused Nolte of ignoring the economic impoverishment and the total lack of civil rights that the Jewish community in Germany lived under in 1939.<sup id="cite_ref-Grab,_Walter_pp._273-278_313-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Grab,_Walter_pp._273-278-313">[313]</a></sup> Grab wrote that Nolte "mocks" the Jewish victims of National Socialism with his "absolutely infamous" statement that it was Weizmann's with his letter that caused all of the Jewish death and suffering during the Holocaust.<sup id="cite_ref-Grab,_Walter_pp._273-278_313-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Grab,_Walter_pp._273-278-313">[313]</a></sup>

One of Nolte's letters created another controversy in late 1987, when [Otto Dov Kulka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Dov_Kulka "Otto Dov Kulka") complained that a letter he wrote to Nolte criticizing his views was edited by Nolte to make him appear rather sympathetic to Nolte's arguments, and then released to the press.<sup id="cite_ref-ker171_314-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ker171-314">[314]</a></sup> In 1987, Nolte wrote an entire book responding to his critics both German and foreign, _Das Vergehen der Vergangenheit: Antwort an meine Kritiker im sogenannten Historikerstreit_ (_The Offense Of The Past: Answer At My Critics In The So-Called Historians' Dispute_), which again attracted controversy because Nolte reprinted the edited version of Kulka's letters, despite the latter's objections to their inclusion in the book in their truncated form.<sup id="cite_ref-ker171_314-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ker171-314">[314]</a></sup> In _Das Vergehen der Vergangenheit_, Nolte declared that the _Historikerstreit_ should have begun 25 years earlier because "everything which has provoked such excitement in the course of this dispute had already been spelled out in those books \[Nolte's earlier work\]" and that "_the simple scheme 'perpetrators-victims' reduces the complexities of history too much_" (emphasis in the original).<sup id="cite_ref-k154_310-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-k154-310">[310]</a></sup> In _Das Vergehen der Vergangenheit_, Nolte appeared to backtrack from some of his theories, writing that after Weizmann's letter, European Jews should be treated as "civil internees" rather as "prisoners of war".<sup id="cite_ref-ev152_315-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ev152-315">[315]</a></sup> Evans wrote that the sole purpose of _Das Vergehen der Vergangenheit_ appeared to be to obscure the issues by making confusing statements about what he actually said and wrote, and that Nolte's real purpose to justify the _Shoah_ as there is not other reason why Nolte should have been making these arguments.<sup id="cite_ref-ev152_315-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ev152-315">[315]</a></sup> When an anthology was published about the _Historikerstreit_, Nolte objected to the subtitle “The Documentation of the Controversy Concerning the Singularity of the National Socialist Annihilation of the Jews”, and instead demanded that the subtitle be “Documentation of the Controversy Surrounding the Preconditions and the Character of the “Final Solution of the Jewish Question”.<sup id="cite_ref-n263_316-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n263-316">[316]</a></sup> Only when it became clear that the book could not be published, did Nolte yield on his demands.<sup id="cite_ref-n263_316-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-n263-316">[316]</a></sup>

The _Historikerstreit_ attracted much [media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media "Mass media") attention in [West Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany "West Germany"), where historians enjoy a higher public profile than is the case in the English-speaking world, and as a result, both Nolte and his opponents became frequent guests on West German [radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio "Radio") and [television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television "Television").<sup id="cite_ref-ker170_317-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ker170-317">[317]</a></sup> The _Historikerstreit_ was characterized by a highly vitriolic tone, with both Nolte and his supporters and their opponents often resorting to vicious personal attacks on each other.<sup id="cite_ref-318"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-318">[318]</a></sup> In particular, the _Historikerstreit_ marked the first occasion since the “[Fischer Controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer_Controversy "Fischer Controversy")” of the early 1960s when German historians refused to shake hands with each other.<sup id="cite_ref-319"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-319">[319]</a></sup> Abroad, the _Historikerstreit_ garnered Nolte some fame, to a somewhat lesser extent.<sup id="cite_ref-ker170_317-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ker170-317">[317]</a></sup> Outside of Austria, foreign press coverage tended to be hostile towards Nolte, with the fiercest criticism coming from Israel.<sup id="cite_ref-ker170_317-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ker170-317">[317]</a></sup> In 1988, an entire edition of _Yad Vashem Studies_, the journal of the [Yad Vashem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yad_Vashem "Yad Vashem") Institute in [Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem "Jerusalem"), was devoted to the _Historikerstreit_.

> “Quotations from [Latsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Latsis "Martin Latsis"), who was First Cheka Chief; Tucholsky, the satirist and journalist, and Theodore Kaufmann (who knows who Theodore Kaufmann was?) were used as historical sources. Can an assorted collection of this kind serve as a basis for serious scholarly analysis, the starting point for the claim that poor Hitler was so frightened by the “Asiatic deeds” of the Bolsheviks that he started to exterminate Jewish children? All this without taking into account the historical development of the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union, the military co-operation during the twenties which as well known to the German General Staff and to Hitler, [Tukhachevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Tukhachevsky "Mikhail Tukhachevsky")'s speech in 1935 was applauded at a meeting of the General Staff of Germany for its anti-Western remarks. Then there are the negotiations between Stalin and Hitler from ’36 and ’37 onwards which brought a rapprochement and led to the dismissal of Jewish diplomats and other public officials until the division of Poland in 1939”.<sup id="cite_ref-322"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-322">[322]</a></sup>

The Anglo-American historian of Stalin's terror, [Robert Conquest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Conquest "Robert Conquest") was quoted as saying about Nolte's theories:

> “I think we all accept the proposition that Nazi crimes were unique and uniquely horrible, that they were a reaction against the Communist terrors seems untenable. It is conceivable that _support_ for the National Socialists may largely have come as a reaction to Lenin's international civil war launched in 1918, but the actual crimes of the Holocaust are of a totally different nature from Stalin's crimes and I see no connection whatever. But although there is no causative connection, comparisons can still be made”.<sup id="cite_ref-323"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-323">[323]</a></sup>

[Lord Annan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Annan,_Baron_Annan "Noel Annan, Baron Annan") was quoted as saying "Nolte's article may have been sinister, even malevolent, but we have had a great example of an informed debate, of great heart-searching and of a profound examination of the nature of Germany's past and present"”.<sup id="cite_ref-324"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-324">[324]</a></sup> The German historian Julius Schoeps stated:

> "I would like stress a seminal factor in the _Historikerstreit_: The historians who caused this dispute are men in their sixties, that is, men who were old enough to be in the Hitler Youth, _Hitlerjugend_; men who were perhaps soldiers in the war; men for whom the collapse of the Third Reich turned into a trauma which is inextricably linked to the key terms Holocaust and Auschwitz. Nolte's reaction is, I think, typical of this generation of scholars. Contrary to some historians who assert that Germans should not ask such questions at all, I believe that Germans must ask them. But there is no need for slanted questions and ambiguous statements which whitewash German history. Unfortunately, questions of this kind were posed in the _Historikerstreit_; such assertions were made. If historians are suggesting today that Hitler had the right to intern the Jews, they may be tempted to suggest tomorrow that he had the right to kill the Jews. That is why it is crucial to discuss such moral, political, ethical lies".<sup id="cite_ref-325"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-325">[325]</a></sup>

During the course of the debate, [Eberhard Jäckel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberhard_J%C3%A4ckel "Eberhard Jäckel") and [Joachim Fest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_Fest "Joachim Fest") again clashed over the question of the "singularity" of the Holocaust with Fest accusing Jäckel of presenting a "caricature" of his opponents.<sup id="cite_ref-326"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-326">[326]</a></sup> Writing in 1989, the British historian [Richard J. Evans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_J._Evans "Richard J. Evans") declared that:

> "Finally, Nolte's attempts to establish the comparability of Auschwitz rest in part upon an extension of the concept of "genocide" to actions which cannot plausibly justify being described in this way. However much one might wish to criticize the Allied strategic-bombing offensive against German cities, it cannot be termed genocidal because there was no intention to exterminate the entire German people. Dresden was bombed after Coventry, not the other way around, and it is implausible to suggest that the latter was a response to the former; on the contrary, there was indeed an element of retaliation and revenge in the strategic bombing offensive, which is precisely one of the grounds on which it has often been criticized. There is no evidence to support Nolte's speculation that the ethnic Germans in Poland would have been entirely exterminated had the Nazis not completed their invasion quickly. Neither the Poles nor the Russians had any intention of exterminating the German people as a whole. At this point, it is useful to recall the conclusion of the German historian and Hitler specialist Eberhard Jäckel that "the Nazi murder of the Jews was unique because never before had a state decided and announced, on the authority of its responsible leader, that it intended to kill in its entirety, as far as possible, a particular group of human beings, including its old people, women, children and infants, and then put this decision into action with every possible instrument of power available to the state".
> 
> The attempts undertaken by Nolte, Hillgruber, Fest and other neoconservative historians to get around this fact are all ultimately unconvincing. It requires a considerable degree of myopia to regard the policies of the USA in Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s or the occupation of Afghanistan by the USSR in the 1980s as "genocide". However much one may deplore the conduct of the occupying armies, there is no evidence of any deliberate policy of exterminating the inhabitants of the countries in question. The terrible massacres of the Armenians by the Turks in 1915 were more deliberate, on a wider scale and concentrated into a far shorter time, then the destruction of human life in Vietnam and Afghanistan, and they were not carried out as part of a military campaign, although they did occur in wartime. But these atrocities were committed as part of a brutal policy of expulsion and resettlement; they did not constitute an attempt to exterminate a whole people. Similar things may be said of the forcible removal of Greeks from Asia Minor during the 1920s, although this has not, in contrast to the events of 1915, generally been regarded as genocide.
> 
> The Pol Pot regime in Cambodia witnessed the horrific spectacle of a nation's rulers turning upon their own people, in a manner comparable to that of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin a few years previously. The victims, whose numbers exceeded a million, were killed, not on racial grounds, but as part of a deliberate policy of terror to subdue opposition and revenge against those thought to have collaborated with the American enemy during the previous hostilities. Moreover, the barbarities inflicted on the Cambodian people by the Pol Pot regime were to a considerable extent the result of a brutalizing process that had accompanied a terrible war, during which vast quantities of bombs were dropped on the country, destroying a large part of the moral and physical basis of Cambodian society in the process. This in no way excuses the murderous policies of the Khmer Rouge. But it does show up, once more, the contrast with the Nazi genocide of the Jews, which, as we have seen, was a gratuitous act carried out by a prosperous, advanced industrial nation at the height of its power.".<sup id="cite_ref-Evans,_pp._85–87_327-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Evans,_pp._85%E2%80%9387-327">[327]</a></sup>

Evans criticized Nolte for crediting the remark about the Armenian genocide as an "Asiatic deed" to Scheubner-Richter, when in fact, it came from a 1938 biography of Scheubner-Richter.<sup id="cite_ref-ev35_328-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ev35-328">[328]</a></sup> Moreover, Evans maintained that there is no evidence to support Nolte's claim that because [Max Scheubner-Richter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Maximilian_Erwin_von_Scheubner-Richter "Ludwig Maximilian Erwin von Scheubner-Richter") was opposed to the Armenian genocide, that proved that Hitler thought the same way in 1915.<sup id="cite_ref-ev35_328-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ev35-328">[328]</a></sup> Citing _[Mein Kampf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mein_Kampf "Mein Kampf")_, Evans argued that Hitler was an anti-Semitic long before 1914 and that it was the moderate left [SPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany "Social Democratic Party of Germany"), not the Bolsheviks that Hitler regarded as his main enemies<sup id="cite_ref-329"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-329">[329]</a></sup>

Nolte's opponents have expressed intense disagreement with his evidence for a Jewish "war" on [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany"). They argue that Weizmann's letter to Chamberlain was written in his capacity as head of the World Zionist Organization, not on behalf of the entire Jewish people of the world,<sup id="cite_ref-ev38_330-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ev38-330">[330]</a></sup> and that Nolte's views are based on the spurious idea that all Jews comprised a distinct "nationality" who take their marching orders from Jewish organizations.<sup id="cite_ref-ev38_330-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ev38-330">[330]</a></sup> Lipstadt criticized Nolte's thesis on the grounds that first, Weizmann had no army in 1939 to wage “war” against Germany with, and that Nolte had totally ignored the previous six years of Nazi persecution of the Jews, making it sound like as if Weizmann had struck a low blow against Germany for no apparent reason in 1939.<sup id="cite_ref-L213_283-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-L213-283">[283]</a></sup> Furthermore, it has been contended that there is no evidence that Hitler ever heard of Weizmann's letter to Chamberlain, and that it was natural for Weizmann, a British Jew, to declare his support for his country against a fiercely anti-Semitic regime.<sup id="cite_ref-331"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-331">[331]</a></sup>

As for Kaufman's book, the Nazis were certainly aware of it; during the war, _Germany Must Perish!_ was translated into [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language") and widely promoted as an example of what Jews thought about Germans. But most historians contended that the radical views of one American Jew can in no way be taken as typical of what all European Jews were thinking, and to put the call for the forced [sterilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_(medicine) "Sterilization (medicine)") of Germans that was never carried out as Allied policy in the same league as the Holocaust shows a profound moral insensitivity.<sup id="cite_ref-332"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-332">[332]</a></sup> Moreover, it has been shown that there is no indication that Kaufman's book ever played any role in the decision-making process that led to the Holocaust.<sup id="cite_ref-ker176_62-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-ker176-62">[62]</a></sup> Finally, it has been contended that Nolte's comparison of the Holocaust with the [internment of Japanese Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_American_internment "Japanese American internment") is false, because the Jews of Europe were sent to [death camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_camps "Death camps") rather than internment camps, and the U.S. government did not attempt to exterminate the Japanese Americans in the internment camps.<sup id="cite_ref-333"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-333">[333]</a></sup>

### Later views\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historikerstreit&action=edit&section=59 "Edit section: Later views")\]

The British historian [Norman Davies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Davies "Norman Davies") argued in 2006 that revelations made after the [Revolutions of 1989](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989 "Revolutions of 1989") resulting in the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe after 1989–91 about Soviet crimes had discredited the left-wing position taken in the 1980s during the _Historikerstreit_ debate.<sup id="cite_ref-Davies2006_334-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historikerstreit#cite_note-Davies2006-334">[334]</a></sup>
