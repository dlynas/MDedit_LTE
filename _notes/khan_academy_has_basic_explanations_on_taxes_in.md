	Yeah most of the crying and whining about taxes on the internet is from people who don't know how they work and refuse to learn. The mere mention of an increase in the top marginal rate invites an onslaught of idiots who think their income at that point would just disappear. They have no idea what "marginal" means and would never bother to run some calculations.

		People also aren’t usually aware that a big portion of the taxes they pay are social security taxes, which are phased out for income above 168k. And the confusion between withholding and actual taxation. People think if they had 25% withheld that means their tax rate is 25%.

		I have had an actual conversation with a gay couple complaining that Trump's TCJA increased their taxes as they both use to get 2K - 2.5K as refund and now are getting just 1K.

		Remember half the population is below average intelligence(okay, I'm making the assumption that average intelligence is at the median)

		Most of the crying is that people think that by taxing the rich more its going to improve their life's situation, when it won't.

	Mostly agreed, but now 70% of Americans are eligible to file taxes online for free directly with the IRS instead of having to work around companies trying to sell you "audit protection" and whatnot.

	Yeah but they would need people to care… and they just don’t. Ignorance is bliss.

	Most  Redditors aren’t economic illiterate because they are dumb. They are economic illiterates because knowledge is detrimental to their socialist worldview. They avoid it like Superman avoids kryptonite.
