## 🕊️ 🕊️🕊️ (EDIT: a few people have noted that many Israelis are Sephardic, and that’s true. What I meant when I wrote that many of the settlers are white, I meant the new settlers that are coming in, not the Israelis that have been there for decades. I don’t call them settlers, I call them Israelis, even though technically they are still settlers. The other thing is, and this is very important, despite being racialized or even historically oppressed, you can still be white supremacist!)
