Kevin Kelly reports the exciting news that all the Whole Earth-related publications from the last 40 year are scanned and online at [wholeearth.com](http://www.wholeearth.com/index.php).

> One could read back issues if you could find them. I had the privilege of producing many of the issues of _CoEvolution Quarterly_ and some of the Catalogs, so I had my own personal library of them. (Therefore you should also discount my enthusiasm for them.) I can't tell you how many wonderful evenings I have spent sitting in my reading chair re-exploring the fantastic worlds captured in these back issues. It is impossible to pick one up and not be mesmerized, thrilled, amazed, and informed by at least two stories or reviews. There is a timeless nature to this work that is due to their anti-fashionable status. The _Whole Earth Catalogs_ and _CoEvolutions_ were idea-based journalism, rather than event-based. Instead of reporting on top of things, they liked to get to the bottom of things. These issues zagged while the rest of the culture zigged, only to zag later.
> 
> The good news is that all this goodness is now online. Danica Remy and the last holdouts of the old Point Foundation, publishers of the Catalogs and magazine until its last issue in 2002, have given a second life to this gold mine of material by arranging them to be scanned and posted online. The entire 35-year archive of _Whole Earth Catalogs_, _Supplements_, _Reviews_ and _CoEvolutions_ are all up and ready to be studied. You can read them for free, or download them for a fee.
