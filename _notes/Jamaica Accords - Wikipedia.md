From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The **Jamaica Accords** were a set of international agreements that ratified the end of the [Bretton Woods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system "Bretton Woods system") monetary system.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica_Accords#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> They took the form of recommendations to change the "articles of agreement" that the [International Monetary Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund") (IMF) was founded upon.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica_Accords#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> The agreement was concluded after meetings 7–8 January 1976 at [Kingston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_Jamaica "Kingston, Jamaica"), [Jamaica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica "Jamaica") by a committee of the board of governors of the IMF.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica_Accords#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

The accords allowed the price of [gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold "Gold") to [float](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_exchange_rate "Floating exchange rate") with respect to the [U.S. dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar "United States dollar") and other currencies, albeit within a set of agreed constraints. In practice the dollar had been floating in this way, in contravention of the articles of an agreement of the IMF, since the [Nixon shock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock "Nixon shock") in 1971. The accords also made provisions for financial assistance to [developing countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country "Developing country") representing the [Group of 77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_77 "Group of 77") member countries to compensate for lost earnings from the export of primary commodities.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica_Accords#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> An amendment was made in 1978 to allow for the creation of [Special Drawing Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_drawing_rights "Special drawing rights"), described as a low-cost [line of credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_credit "Line of credit") for developing countries.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica_Accords#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>
