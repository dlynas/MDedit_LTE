## What would happen if we dissolved the political parties?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/2dg4if/what_would_happen_if_we_dissolved_the_political/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/2dg4if/what_would_happen_if_we_dissolved_the_political/)

> Would it make Americans more inclined to actually review and investigate the politicians and the policies they are voting for? I think the majority of Americans lately just look and say, well ill vote for him or her because she's a Democrat or he's a Republican but don't actually review the content of the individual.

	First, you couldn't as it would violate the first amendment right of [freedom of assembly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_assembly).

	Second, I doubt much would change.  How many people watch MSNBC or Fox and get their "viewpoint" from there.  If not there, then Daily Kos, Huffington Post, Rush Limbaugh... they'll just take their cues from other tells rather than a "D" or "R".

		Your first isn't accurate.  You can eliminate the official (R)s and (D)s without stepping on freedom of assembly. Nebraska has done so for years. 
		
		Your second is spot on. It doesn't change a damn thing. See Nebraska.

			Nebraska is formally non-partisan.  But there are Republicans and Democrats in their house.

				That's what I said :).  They're not identified by party either in the legislature or, usually, by the media. But everyone still knows who's who.  You can constitutionally get rid of the names, but there's no way (constitutionally or practically) you can get rid of the association.  Nor would you want to.

					That's what /[u/AuditorTux](https://www.reddit.com/user/AuditorTux) was saying. OP wants to know if we could *dissolve* the parties, not just remove their labels from ballots. Thus, the first point *was* accurate.

			Furthermore, in the case of Nebraska, voters have a hard time holding politicians accountable because it is more difficult to identify the coalitions of people that have voted certain ways.

	One of the main functions political parties serve is a way to communicate information easily to voters.  The labels 'Democrat' or 'Republican' can tell a voter a lot about a candidate's positions, something that's become increasingly true as the parties have become more polarized and unified over the last few decades.  If I walk into a voting booth without knowing much about the candidates, I can infer with some confidence how a candidate feels about the role of government in the economy, gun control, social issues, etc from the D or R next to the candidate's name.  This is a good thing!  

	It's especially good in a place like the United States, where we hold elections for seemingly every position in government.  On election day where I live, I'll be casting votes for: US senator, US representative, state senator, state representative, district attorney, clerk of the court, sheriff, a variety of state court judges, and a soil and water supervisor.  And that's in an off year!  Citizens should be informed about candidates, but many of these races will receive little media attention and little outreach by the candidates.  The party label allows voters to obtain a relatively large amount of information about the candidate very easily.  

	I can't think of any large non-partisan democracies off the top of my head, but a few authoritarian states have been / are non-partisan (see [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-partisan_democracy#Examples) for more info).  I would say that two parties is better than one or zero, but multiple parties would be even better by providing voters with even more fine-tuned information about candidates.

	Well, we have at least some evidence for what this would look like - non-partisan elections. City councils, for example, are typically non-partisan. 

	* 🟨 **[pattonc](https://www.reddit.com/user/pattonc)** ⬆️ 5 _(2014-08-13 20:23:17)_

		However, I would argue that these are non-partisan in name only. Just because  there isn't a label next to a name, doesn't mean that the candidates as well as voters are viewing the elections and policy issues through those lenses.

	You can't dissolve a political party in the way you probably are trying to intend.  The parties exist as gatherings of people with similar ideas and beliefs - it's only after many years and through the pressures of campaign financing and getting voter attention that they seemingly exist as government institutions.  They just have the power to act as such.

	Tell a party they can't exist and they'll just create a new one.  Say no parties can exist and you'll just force some kind of work around/underground faux-parties to exist.  People want and need to know who shares similar political ideals with them to simplify both voting for representatives and working out legislative action in office.

	There does need to be some reform to allow people not associated with a large party the opportunity to run for office anywhere in the country, but the existence of parties themselves isn't so much the issue as what we as humans do once we begin looking at everything through a party lens.

			If political parties had their campaign financing powers reduced *then* you might see the "little man" come up more.  In this day and age money is a real barrier to entry into higher level politics, requiring you to either have a lot of it yourself or the backing of someone/some group who does.  Parties not only have recognition among the voter base but they also can agree to funnel their donors' cash towards candidates who are a part of their group, which provides an incentive for wanna-be politicians/office holders to join a party and act in line with party leadership.

				Agreed, how would you propose this? Maybe get rid of the lobbyists?

				* 🟪 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 2 _(2014-08-14 19:05:23)_

					Lobbyists are a bit complicated.  They have power in two ways:  the first is they represent corporations/groups who can donate lots of money to campaigns, and the second is that they pay way better than congress and are always hiring former representatives.  Even though we don't like lobbyists for these kinds of behaviors and influence they are a somewhat necessary part of politics - their job is to bring issues important to their clients in front of congress to either support or contest legislation.
					
					To me we should eliminate super PACs and corporate donations, and put a cap on the amount any single person can donate to a single candidate, with all donations coming from individuals.  This forces candidates to appeal to the voters rather than just the rich and large businesses.  I also think they're should be term limits in the legislature to eliminate "career politicians" who stay in one seat forever.  To remain in government office they would eventually have to move on to other seats like going from congress to senate, senate to governor, or governor to president.  A longer ban on taking lobbying jobs after leaving office would be nice as well.
					
					The issue we have today is a lack of focus on working for the people and too much focus on a stable job, corporate donations for expensive campaigns, fame, and personal fortunes.

	I think Madison's Federalist #10 comes I to play here. First, it would be impractical to do so as it would stifle liberty and thus, the cure is worse than the disease. Given that, if you were able to do so, they would just form again. Factions in and of themselves are not bad, they link people and government, they provide a voice for people, they build social capital, and because they are naturally occurring, we will always have them.  

	The danger, is when groups wield disproportionally large power and are unresponsive to the people. What we need is reform and a new injection of civic virtue. Currently, our system does indeed favor the privileged, but at the same time, until the American people come out of their complacency nothing is go ing to change.

* 🟩 **[jkovach89](https://www.reddit.com/user/jkovach89)** ⬆️ 1 _(2014-08-13 17:31:31)_

	The issue is that nothing is holds the parties together to begin with. Sure, people organize and people donate but really that would happen in any election with 300+ million people. Even if tomorrow Obama went on the news and said there was no democrat or republican party, people would still hold their biases and vote in that direction. There are plenty of factors in this (upbringing, media exposure, education to name a few) but ultimately people vote republican or democrat because that is the party they most closely associate with. you might end up with a multiparty system, but those never last long (see [first past the post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo))

		I agree with you, people with always hold their biasis but i think it would at least make the voters look a little more closely at each individuals policies and dont you think it would give the little guys more of a chance?

	Two organizations that fulfill most of the same functions of the two major parties would come to exist after a brief period of confusion.

	More importantly, nothing would actually be fixed. If you really want to improve America in a way you want, go volunteer for a candidate you like.

	Democracy would cease to function. Seriously.

	Political parties are the central tools of organization in the American political system. They allow those in power to coordinate their efforts to achieve desired policy ends (such as creating new laws) and allow those out of power a forum to argue for different ideas. 

	Without political parties, how would anyone be able to organize Congress to oppose something the President was doing? How would anyone be able to organize a slate of candidates to try and advance a particular policy position? 

	This is why authoritarian regimes often outlaw opposition parties, they don't want an organizational forum that exists that challenges their rule.

	On a less dramatic level, you're right that party is the largest single determinator in how people vote, but I don't really think that's a bad thing. Party's adopt policies and make it publicly known that they will advocate for them. Want a stronger social welfare state? Generally you can vote D. Want strong 2nd amendment protections? Vote R. This allows people who aren't intimately familiar with every individual who represents them (in any given state a person has probably at least 10 electeds who represent them at one level or another) to vote for people who agree with them on the issues.

	I know that parties get a bum rap, but they really are vital to the functioning of American Democracy. Virtually every major political decision in our country's history, from the abolition of slavery to the creation of the welfare state and beyond, is a result of party politics. God knows the parties aren't perfect, but they are an essential part of the system.

		The founders of the Constitution were against political parties though. We started off our democracy without political parties. And obviously there will always be people with similar views on certain topics but that doesnt say we need a "party" or group of people to push certain agenda's.  Also shouldn't people of the United States be pretty familiar with the candidate that they are choosing? I hate the fact that when you ask someone why they voted for candidate A or B they cant even tell you why, or ask them which policies they agree with for that candidate and their face just goes blank. I think people have stopped caring to much for politics and have really lost faith in the way our country governs itself.

			We had political parties pretty much before we even finished organizing the country. The Federalists and the Ant-Federalists (sometimes called the Democratic-Republicans or just the Republicans) were the first party system. Both groups were involved in the debate over the ratification of the Constitution and remained the major parties until the collapse of the first party system with the election of Monroe in 1816 (it is true that we then had a brief period without major parties, the so-called Era of Good Feelings, but that had it's own complications and ended with the election of Jackson in 1828).
			
			While it is true that some of the Founders had seriously concerns about political parties, it's also true that most of the more prominent ones were party men through and through. Adams and Hamilton were both avowed Federalists. Jefferson was the leader of the Democratic-Republicans. Washington began his Presidency only nominally as a Federalist, but as his Administration continued and the conflicts between the parties became more pronounced  he became more and more of a Federalist, to the point where some Federalists asked him to be their candidate again in the 1800 elections (he died in 1799, putting an end to that discussion). 
			
			I want to stress that is impossible in a republican system of government to govern without a political party. At the very least you need a party to organize the legislative branch and decide who goes on what committee and what legislation will be a party priority. You also need a system that individual legislators can participate in in order to get their policy goals through. There are 100 Senators in the Senate, without a party system a Senator is a minority of 1 and doesn't have tools to help build a majority for any given policy idea. 
			
			On the flip side political parties provide a way for people to force their elected officials to listen to them. For example let's say you live in Nevada and you want your government to lower taxes on sheep. Without a political party you can only go to your congressional delegation (your 2 senators and 1 representative) and ask them to lower the taxes on sheep. You have no way to reach out to other Congressmembers in other states and they have no reason to listen to you. With a party you instead have a tool to coordinate with other people who live in other states to not only advocate for lowering taxes on sheep, but also to help identify and support candidates who agree with you and want to lower taxes on sheep. 
			
			Basically parties allow politicians to organize and govern, allow people to organize their voting and provide a bridge between the citizenry and their government. 
			
			As for your comment that people should be familiar with their electeds, without being snide, I'd be curious how much you know (without googling) about your state representative and state senator.
