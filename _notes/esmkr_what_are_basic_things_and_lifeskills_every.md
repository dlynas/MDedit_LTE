	The fact you recognize that you should learn how to do things yourself instead of relying on others is impressive, and a sign of good character.

	A man on youtube goes by the name "Dad, how do I?", he specifically goes over all the things a father should be teaching his son. The most important thing you need to know is how to research. Your dad didn't start out knowing how to do everything, he learned it from someone else, or he figured it out by reading, asking around, or looking it up. 

	Generally though, your only going to *really* learn life skills and basic things through trial and error, and if your father wont help you, then your friends, your teachers, your neighbor even just might. Your going to learn how to manage money after fucking up with debt. Your going to learn how to communicate with your relationships after some major arguments and heartbreak. Your going to learn how to unclog a toilet after it floods your bathroom. How to shave after cutting yourself a lot.

	Finally, dont feel stupid for asking for help for things you dont know or understand. You dont know what you dont know, and people who put you down for not knowing just want to feel superior. They should be bringing you up to their level, not kicking you down for being below.

		This is really the answer. The only thing I'd add is learn how to cook and basic car mechanics. You're gonna learn real quick when you buy groceries and fuck up a meal, or mess up your car and have to pay a mechanic a couple grand to fix it.
		
		Solid advice about the research. Always look it up.

	* 🟨 **[SacredGeometry9](https://www.reddit.com/user/SacredGeometry9)** ⬆️ 32 _(2024-04-16 15:36:29)_

		I’ll add to that last one: how to motivate yourself to do something without an emotional reward. You need to be able to recognize that something needs to be done and be able to do it, without getting that immediate feeling of accomplishment.
		
		
		Or even a feeling of accomplishment *ever*; lots of stuff can mess with your brain, and being able to do what you need to without relying on that dopamine system will help you tremendously. It’ll help you get things done even if you’re receiving criticism/punishment for what you’re doing. Just make sure you make the decision that you want to do the thing, and don’t let others make it for you.
		
		
		It’s a really, really difficult skill to learn (for some more than others), and it requires practice. It will get easier over time - you’ll develop a (metaphorical) groove in your brain that you can just click into place and start doing work. I recommend writing lists, it’ll help direct you if you find yourself on “autopilot” and struggling with executive function. If you have trouble deciding on what to do, write out a flowchart, break down tasks and goals into smaller ones.

* 🟩 **[Eagle95Talon](https://www.reddit.com/user/Eagle95Talon)** ⬆️ 55 _(2024-04-16 14:17:13)_

	Basic no, essential life skill yes. Learning how to recognize and control your emotions will make your life easier and better.

	* 🟨 **[HanGoza](https://www.reddit.com/user/HanGoza)** ⬆️ 24 _(2024-04-16 14:31:20)_

		Good advice. I'd argue it's not controlling your emotions, but more so your reactions to your emotions. You can't dictate how you feel, but you can control what you do in response. If you want to dive deeper, you can investigate why you get those emotions in the first place.
		That can be incredibly uncomfortable, though liberating.

		* 🟧 **[Eagle95Talon](https://www.reddit.com/user/Eagle95Talon)** ⬆️ 6 _(2024-04-16 16:10:57)_

			You’re right but you can control how you feel, you can choose to feel angry or indifferent if some stranger cuts you off on the highway. I say everyone should practice living the stoic philosophy.

			* 🟦 **[HanGoza](https://www.reddit.com/user/HanGoza)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-04-16 17:39:58)_

				That's managing your reactions imo, but maybe I'm being semantic. The initial emotion is surprise (uncontrollable), and you then decide the appropriate emotional reaction (anger vs. indifference). I think we are getting at the same thing. Agreed, stoicism has good lessons to teach from the little that I've studied it

		God I'm so tired of meeting mid 30's men who can't cook a single thing. It's not that hard, you don't have to be great at it. You're a fully grown adult. And of course they give the "I'll load the dishwasher if you do all the cooking". There's a reason why parents give that task to children. Society needs to stop letting men be infantilized this way.

		* 🟧 **[wobblysauce](https://www.reddit.com/user/wobblysauce)** ⬆️ 6 _(2024-04-16 19:56:39)_

			Even if it is only one meal… know how to do it and cooking is trial and error, not just quoting if the recipe doesn't look like what is on the picture… but how does it taste?

		* 🟧 **[huskers2468](https://www.reddit.com/user/huskers2468)** ⬆️ 4 _(2024-04-17 06:24:58)_

			Easy now.  There's no need to say that they are being infantilized. I grew up with two parents that could cook decently, but nothing that would impress my wife. I wouldn't say I've been babying myself to keep my cooking skills low.
			
			I do plenty around the house that my wife won't or can't do that we could classify in the same way.  However,  I would never do that because we each bring different skills to the marriage. The relationship is a give and take. We couldn't have gotten far if we called each other childish when the other needed help with a skill. 
			
			I'm still only a decent cook, breakfast I'm ok with. Funnily enough, she hates doing dishes and cleaning after she cooks, but hates a messy house. We have adapted a system to make it work. I wouldn't classify it as infantile.

				You did learn to cook though. You know how to cook **something**. I have run into countless men, (and some women), who literally cannot cook a single dish, even if handed a recipe. I've had to verbally explain and coach a 40 year old through making scrambled eggs, while I was on the verge of passing out from low blood sugar. 
				
				I'm not saying, "anyone who doesn't cook regularly" is bad. I am saying anyone who has lived to the age of 40, that doesn't know how to cook a single dish, (even a simple one) should not believe that is okay.

	Be proficient with a drill so you can fix basic things or put things together.  YouTube is great for instructions on basic projects.  If you can, get a nice drillset and always put the pieces back.

	I’d also say learn how to shop for groceries. This comes with trial and error also. Most stores will have a “price per ____”. It may be ounce or another unit of measurement. Generally, the cheaper ones are the better price. My mom taught me this when I was a teen and it has saved me a ton of money. 

	Learning how to budget and live below your means. Be responsible with your debts (they’re inevitable) and learn how they are used for and against. 

	Don’t be like my cousin and spend all of your money on the 3 most important things in *his* life in this order: booze, marijuana, girlfriend, cigarettes, then rent. He hasn’t payed his rent in months. Don’t be that guy.

		FTFY.
		
		Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:
		
		 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*
		
		 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

	You may know some of these but these helped me learn what I needed to be an adult. 

	1) The true value of money. If you are affluent then you may not know. Most people are not well off even of they appear to be. Learn how to budget regardless of how much money you have.

	2) Learn how to learn. Internet is awesome for this.

	3) Observe the people around you. If you see people you want to be like, see how they act and treat other people and try some of their "moves"

	4) Since we did number 1 we can learn how to clean things, maintain your stuff, cook for yourself, dress and shop for yourself. Always be on the lookout for new things to learn.  You are looking for quality here not shortcuts.

	5) Vocabulary. Work on this. It allows you to express yourself to yourself and others in the most accurate way. 

	6) Last but not least. Be kind, patient, and tolerant with people that deserve it. Stand up for yourself and others if they do not.

				I've never paid to rotate my tires, wherever you buy your tires typically will rotate them for free to try and keep your business there.
				
				For oil changes - You have to go get oil and take the time to change it, you're going to make a bit of a mess, and you now have oil to dispose of.  From all the time it takes and the price of the oil itself, it's really not a bad deal to pay someone a little bit more to take care of that.

				* 🟪 **[Black0tter1](https://www.reddit.com/user/Black0tter1)** ⬆️ 0 _(2024-04-16 15:14:52)_

					$50 for an oil change kit instead of $100 at the stealership. Rotating tires gets you the knowledge of how to change tires if/when you have a blowout so you won’t have to spend money on a tow truck. Knowledge carries over so you have basic knowledge of how a car operates to when/if you take it in to get a service and they start blowing unnecessary service item down your throat and will save money that way. But yeah, go ahead and dismiss it the advice

	I'll drop some advice on you that I wish someone had told me at your age. You wanna have... let's call it "a successful dating career"? 

	Learn. To. Cook.  

	And I don't mean like putting some broccoli in your mac and cheese or adding cream cheese to anything and calling it "million dollar ..." whatever or "marry me..." something. I mean grab a copy of *The Food Lab* by Kenji Lopez-Alt and start studying. 

	My man, it's the best thing ever. Do you want to drop $200 on a really nice dinner out and try to convince her that you have something awesome at your place she should come see? Or do you want to drop $50 on some good ingredients plus a bottle of something nice, invite her over, and knock her socks (+more) off with your cooking ability? 

	It's not that hard, it's not expensive to get started, it's an essential life skill that you will use for the rest of your days.

	There are many great answers here, but not what I would be looking for if I'd asked the question. 

	How to tie a necktie. How to shine your dress shoes. How to wash a load of laundry. How to sew a button back on. How to iron a dress shirt/suit without burning it.

	How to change a tire. Sure, the shop can do this, but you need to be ready for a roadside flat. How to add air to a tire. How to add windshield wiper fluid. How to change your oil is nice, but then you have to dispose of the oil. Plus, electric cars don't have oil. 

	How to drive a nail. How to drill a hole. How to hang a picture. How to change a lock/doorknob. How to replace a light switch or electrical outlet. Find the main water shutoff in your house. Find the circuit breaker. Change the furnace filter. (these last three I teach all our renters when they sign a lease) Use a plunger on a toilet. 

	Learn a few simple knots. A square knot (and the difference between a square knot and granny knot). A slip knot. A tautline hitch (I use this a lot to hold my car's hatch closed when carrying oversized things). 

	How to start a wood fire (camp or fireplace). 

	Boil an egg. Peel and chop a carrot (or potato). Make chocolate chip cookies. Get the cookies out of the oven without burning yourself. Make pancakes. 

	Grow a few simple things. Put a bean between a wet paper towel and the side of a glass. Take the top off that carrot before you peel it, and put it in some wet dirt. Leave a potato until the eyes start to grow and set it on some wet dirt. 

	Bonus points section: ==================

	Get a simple electronics kit and solder it together. You may never use this skill again, or you may open a whole new world. I bought a stack of Larson Scanners and taught the neighborhood kids to do this. Several started borrowing my tools to modify their Halloween costumes. One finished my programmable Christmas lights circuit board while I was distracted. 

	This may require some parental cooperation, but build and launch a model rocket. If you're lucky, you got to do this in school. If not, you can do it, but you might need a ride to a good launch site. 

	Crochet something simple. My first project was a yarn pot that I can hold in my hand. I didn't have to turn around and get weird edges. Just go around and around for awhile, then get smaller and smaller. Your second project can be a granny square so you can learn some decoration. You may never do it again, but now you know how.

	Learn to accept that everyone makes mistakes, including you.  A mistake is a chance to learn and better yourself. If you make a mistake, when you find out, learn what went wrong and why, and how to fix it.  Use that knowledge going forward in life. 

	On top of that, accept that you don’t know everything.  No one does.  When someone or something proves you wrong it’s okay to admit it, to learn from it and grow. It is not manly to double down or stick to your guns when society, science, and common sense all say you’re wrong.

	Basic maintenance is a good start (both home and car); learn how to use basic tools the right way like a drill, a saw, etc. Managing finances, saving and budgeting is also an under utilized skill! 

	Learn to be reliant on yourself in potentially stressful situations; things like a CPR class, maybe fun self defense training like ju jitsu classes, basic first aid, will help you be the person that people GO to for help, rather than needing others to help YOU. Things like that will teach you to be comfortable handling uncomfortable situations in life (what to do if there's an emergency, what to do if the power goes out for a long time, what to do if a stranger approaches you asking for money at a gas station, etc etc).

	And at the end of the day, YouTube everything! I've learned how to fix my washing machine, change my oil, install lighting, and a bunch of other stuff from YouTube!

* 🟩 **[SolarUpdraft](https://www.reddit.com/user/SolarUpdraft)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-04-16 17:09:15)_

	I'll add good hygiene to this list. Shower once a day, brush twice, floss at least once. Use deodorant and consider learning about cologne. (Only use a drop or two, it's strong smelling.)

	Keep your hair cut, clean, and style it if you want. Wash your face with clean water before bed. If you grow a beard, trim it.

	Wash your clothes, toss out clothes that get ragged.

	There's other stuff you can do if you want, but this much will be a great start. Hygiene saves money and makes you look smarter, healthier, and you'll feel good about yourself.

	How to engage in small talk and, by extension, how to have a conversation. Hint:.you'll usually be the one doing the least amount of talking.

	How to turn acquaintances into friends. It's not an instant interaction as an adult like it can be when you're young and in school. Being willing to initiate and invite people you don't know that well to things is a hard step for a lot of people, so you might as well be that person. That doesn't mean you have to be an extrovert or social butterfly,  but you'll find that friends come and go throughout the course of your life and it's easy to find yourself alone if you don't try to cultivate new friendships while maintaining others.

	How, who, and when to ask for help. The internet is great for practical tasks, but less so for complex tasks or advanced projects. It's the same with family and friends for social, emotional, medical, or psychological advice. Sometimes you need a professional. A little struggle can be good in some situations, so immediately asking for help isn't always a solution, but more often than not, waiting too long is very much a problem.

	Finally, learning to be comfortable with change. You aren't in control of anything but your physical and emotional wellbeing (and, at times, you won't even be fully in charge of either or those), so the earlier you can develop skills and attitudes conducive to being able to handle change effectively, you'll better position yourself for the next thing that comes along.

	This is a little advanced, but it's stuff I wasn't told.

	Keep your appliance owner's manuals.

	You can raise and lower your lawn mower's blades, usually by a lever that looks like a gearshift somewhere on the body. Most mowers are set at the bottom, which is usually too low and will wear your motor out faster. (also it helps to raise the blades if you live somewhere that it won't stop raining)

	Change your home's air filters the way they recommend. If you never change them, it can destroy your AC, and this will somehow always happen in summer.

	If you have an issue (creditors, need an extension on bills, etc), call someone. If you show willing, most people will work with you and be more kindly disposed than if they never hear from you.

	Don't just walk off your injuries. 40 comes at you faster than you think, and you WILL pay for it.

	Don't get too hung up on what age you need to have "accomplished" things by. Advertisers want to make you feel bad about yourself and their messages are given in bad faith. The fact of the matter is, our lives are never going to look like the last generation's did- the world has changed too much. If you haven't got everything checked off your life to do list at 30, that's not a failure and whoever tells you it is, is probably trying to sell you something.

	Basic survival techniques. What I mean by that is learn how to start a fire and build a little shelter. I’ve never had to use it in a true survival emergency, but with a group of guys it always amazes me how few people know how to actually get a good fire going.

	Easy to fix things on vehicles. Once you know how to change a battery, you'll never pay for others to do it again. Same with wind shield wipers, air filter. Taking apart almost any door based on YouTube videos has been insanely easy with most likely a $2 part. The fact that some vehicles will only sell a whole piece with many parts, but not a single part meaning you will pay 150$+... Just go to the nearest pick&amp;pull and pay the 2-5$ (you have to tear apart that piece yourself).

	In order to not repeat what others have said:

	-Dancing. Especially if you're straight but it'll always help. But if you're straight it'll put you light-years ahead.

	-How to maintain shoes &amp; fine fabrics.

	-How to sew on buttons 

	-How to have at least one grass touching hobby that you can talk about in absence of other topics 

	AND.

	Most importantly of all for someone your age.

	How to be funny.  You can be ugly, short &amp; stupid with a shitty voice and build and all those other things people obsess about endlessly.

	But if you're sufficiently funny people stop seeing that.
