## Andrew Fisher does an interview for SKY NEWS calling out the hypocrisy and double standard of the UK and Western nations saying the reality is we donâ€™t care about international law or human rights. Best 1.5 min you are going to listen to in your day!

![](3281141105095901502.mp4)"I think what it highlights is the extreme double standards.
Here we are.
The hoodies have been attacking shipping lanes.
No deaths so far. Thankfully.
Israel's been bombarding Gaza for the last three months.
Tens of thousands of people died.
Children being amputated without anaesthetic.
And that's fine.
No sanctions on Israel.
No strikes against them.
No arms embargo.
I guess this is because of this.
Against the UK target, though, right?
Is that not?
It's because we don't care about international law or human rights.
We have this rhetoric that we do, but we don't.
This is absolutely nonsense.
And this whole conflict is exposing that.
We say that the Iran-backed hoothy rebels,
well, they've been bombed by the US and UK-backed Saudi Arabia
for the last 10 years.
Cut, you know, actually, the last Labour administration
was calling for sanctions on Saudi Arabia over this for an
arms embargo, Hillary Benz.
Somebody who's serving under a Kirstan was leading this
within the last shadow cabinet.
So, you know, we talk about this in completely bizarre ways
that spins it into this sort of thing of one side is bad.
And the other side's crimes are airwashed.
I mean, we've got a case in the International Court of Justice
today brought by South Africa against Israel for genocide.
We're not talking about that.
We're talking about some interruption to shipping lanes.
And it's pretty small-scale stuff when tens of thousands
of people are being killed.
And, you know, I don't care what adjectives you call it,
whether you call it a massacre, a slaughter, ethnic cleansing,
genocide.
It doesn't really much matter.
Tens of thousands of people are being killed.
And we're not talking about that.
We're talking about some shipping lanes.
It's perverse.
And the rest of the world can see it."
