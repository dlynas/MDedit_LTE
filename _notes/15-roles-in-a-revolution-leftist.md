## “15 roles in a revolution” #leftist

![[3271872314626193935.mp4]]

"I have an awful habit of spreading myself too thin, which is interesting because as a kid with severe ADHD
I was often accused of being lazy simply because although I was starting a lot of tasks
I wasn't necessarily finishing them all and I definitely wasn't cleaning up after myself after starting like the 15th hobby that year
and I wish I could say that I've gotten better about it but to be honest with you all I kind of really haven't
because here's the thing once that you get radicalized and you realize that the world isn't such desperate need of change
it's very difficult for you not to want to try everything in order to get it to change
and I think that that's in part why we see so much burnout in politics
because like once that you realize that the world is on fire it's really hard one to not see that it's on fire
and two to not think about the fact that it's on fire and so naturally it makes sense that those same people
because politics is a matter of life and death and oftentimes you get sucked in through personal
off-elived experiences that demonstrate the failures of the status quo
it would make sense then that those same people poor whatever water they can find on said flames
they pour everything they've got into it which can take so many different forms from actively
engaging in like going to protests and joining an org all the way to now constantly staying up to date
with politics both of which consume time and energy and because the world seemingly stays on fire
no matter how much of your own personal water you pour onto it you can start feeling hopeless
and it can lead you down these spirals and so instead of us all individually running around like
chickens without heads just pouring our own little cups on these flames we need to get organized
enough to create some sort of fire department right just following with the analogy there is a
reason why as a society we moved towards fire departments and not just everyone individually
dealing with their own fires you know it's because they can do it much more efficiently than if we
do it all on our own and individually but it's interesting though because once that people start
getting a hold of like yeah we need a fire department a lot of people will then including me be like
what I need to fill all of the spots in the fire department like I need to do it all because we're
just that desperate so I need to be the person holding the hose I need to be the one pumping the
hose I need to be the one doing all of it you know and in case it wasn't obvious enough there is a
reason why we do not have many one-man fire departments because everyone has their role to play and
I as someone who desperately wants the world to change fall in that trap of trying to do it all
so this year I'm switching strategy so with the help of AI I brainstormed 15 essential roles in
a revolution and this is in no way the end all be all okay I'm just trying to give people an idea
of the roles that they could play so I'm gonna quickly read them and then we'll talk about it
so first and foremost we're gonna have the shiniest example which is gonna be the visionary leader
the one that often also has the target on their back but they develop and communicate the
revolution's vision they are oftentimes charismatic they're a people person and they're really good
at communicating and rambling up crowds the second role that we've got is strategist strategist I don't
know plants and executes strategic moves for the revolution oftentimes working closely with visionary
leader you are already probably picking up on why ords are essential for a revolution success
because a lot of these roles rely on each other desperately which is why we need to work together
but anyway I continue third we've got tactical commander manages on the ground tactics during
protests and conflicts this is really good for people who have EMT expertise or military background
if you and your friends can get together and start just building out resources for this type of
information to disseminate to the left that would be sick then we've got communicator slash order
you're also gonna start noticing that a lot of these overlap with skills which is why I just
wanted to read out some roles because you can work on the skills individually with the role itself
demands a larger organization the communicator or orator conveys messages effectively to inspire
and mobilize the masses next we've got the ideal log or the philosopher they shapes the ideological
foundation of the revolution not to shit on anyone's plans but this one has kind of been done by a lot
of people in the past so like we can read and learn from them rather than reinventing the wheel
like if you really have a passion for political philosophy maybe applying those and trying to find
ways to communicate them to other people would be best rather than again trying to reinvent the wheel
not saying that anyone can't next we've got the organizer who coordinates logistics events and
resources for the movement a lot of people have asked me in the past what it means to be an organizer
it can be as simple as just being the person that the organization uses to do phone calls for them
it can be as simple as joining an organ being the person who takes the notes during the meetings
like it doesn't have to be some big flashy thing obviously it can be more extensive than that
like starting your own community food pantry and things like that but you can start small too
and just do what needs to be done a lot of orgs are desperately in need of help so seriously all
hands on deck and there's something for you to do which then classifies as organizing next on the
list we have the educator who disseminates knowledge and information to the public we also have
the spokesperson who represents the revolution to the media and the public very similar to the
communicator also the visionary leader see there's a lot of overlap but i will say i think that
a difference between the spokesperson and the communicator and the visionary leader would be that
the spokesperson is a little more tactful than the others like the others can come in guns blazing the
spokesperson tends to be a little more PR oriented not saying that guns blazing can't be good for PR because
it definitely can next we've got diplomat if international involvement think like christmas going
all around to increase the awareness and the global solidarity for the amazon lay reunion like he
is playing the role of diplomat when he's doing that and engages with foreign entities for support or
recognition next we've got the financeer the financeer is so fucking important and it is a job
that unfortunately not many of us can do very well because the majority of us are unfortunately broke
as all help and we don't know anyone who isn't broke but if you do happen to know those people or
you yourself have money that you could manage and that you could help raise for the movement this
is the perfect role for you because they raise and manage funds for the movement and that's the one
where i get mad at rich leftist for because like if nothing else if you're not going to spend your
time doing any of the other roles the least you could do is give money to do the rest of it but
that's a whole different video so next on list we've got the propagandist whose role is to manage
the narrative through various media channels think social media think graphic design think those
classic ussr communist posters that are still famous to this day that is what we call effective
propaganda especially since we don't have all the funding that the CIA has to you know start entire
news channels across the world that just peddle their propagandists instead we've got to rely on
like memes and shit but memes and graphics and posters and art and just videos and everything just
media is incredibly effective even if you don't have a big budget i promise next we've got
influential supporter which i kind of think of like an undercover really good bootlicker like
someone who can bootlick to our advantage you know because they gain the support from influential
figures or groups next we've got the negotiator who engages in negotiations with the existing power
structure i think that this is a very sock dem way to engage in activism think like dsa or
Bernie Sanders types of more like i'm going to get what we can out of the systems that we currently
have rather than being on the side that's more working towards building an alternative system
only two more i swear we're almost there next we've got the technologist last strategist strategist
i don't know how to say but applies technology for communication and organization the most
extreme example of this would obviously be some groups like anonymous that use their technological
powers or whatever to disseminate information that is needed but a lower stakes one would be people
who are working on app developments that would actually help the left mobilize such as like one that
would make us find protests more easily but that is end-ten encrypted things like that or how
if you're good at canva and you're good at doing things like that for work posting or graphic
design for that falls under propaganda too but that would be a really good place for people to help
and last but definitely not least this community organizer connects with local communities and
builds grassroots support if you are considered a local anywhere as in you get recognized when you
walk into a restaurant and you have like a regular order or whatever you would be a phenomenal
community organizer because odds are you already know a portion of your community so this year
instead of spreading myself too thin and trying to be a one man fire department i am going to
specialize my roles so given where i'm at in life in terms of me constantly moving in terms of
my chronic illness affecting my physical abilities i'm going to lean into my strengths and decide
preemptively this year that i'm focusing on being an educator as well as being a propagandist
and consequently i'll probably be practicing the skills needed for communicators such order too
so yeah just food for thought what type of skills would you like to build or what type of role would
you like to take on that could help us inch closer to a better world because like i keep on saying
it's all hands on deck until these unjust institutions fall "
