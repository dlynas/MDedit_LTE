    "I don't know, but anyway, can you help the story maybe continue Hamas so this can all end?
    What?
    Can you help the story maybe against Hamas?
    It's been going on since 1948, okay?
    And for us, we believe it's our land and this, this, this, anything.
    You believe it's your land and this is the fight we'll never end.
    And tell the last day of this, of this life, okay?
    But what I'm not understanding.
    I can't say all the people that's marching towards this to the safe, repolify, they don't
    really care honestly.
    Not because they did care.
    They would go and fight the world together.
    There are people who are sick.
    All the people that say in the comments when you post the post, they say things like
    they don't, they don't, they don't.
    You destroyed the whole strip.
    It's the only part that we are like happy about having a small part of our country, okay?
    And it's now destroyed.
    When you were right, when you come the first time that will be armed, that will be more
    bombing, more killing, don't go, don't say it to you.
    The first time you come, I was terrified because a lot of the journalists lost their lives.
    But now, believe me, now, I swear to God, I don't give a fuck because we are gonna, we
    are all gonna die.
    So at least I will, if I die, I don't."


## Someone reached out to me from an anonymous number and it’s not his first time, I answered the first time and he said things to me that actually happened.

I picked up the call disregarding the inherent risks and peril of answering such a call amidst these incredibly unbelievable circumstances. Responding to such a call utterly means putting my life on the line. 

Through this conversation, the caller made it evident that the colonization forces had a clear agenda—to silence the Palestinian narrative by employing every possible means to obscure and manipulate it. 
Their aim is to wield control over media coverage, a crucial tool we employ objectively to convey the true events unfolding in Gaza.
I’m so glad that I was able to document thier intent of the settler colonial project. he openly acknowledged and declared that, under the relentless bombardment, we were going to be compelled to seek refuge in Egypt instead of remaining here. 

The devastating consequence of this admission has been the near-destruction of my entire city—a deliberate effort to obliterate any semblance of life in Gaza, leaving my people with no choice but to seek existence in more hospitable places.
Despite this, Gaza is our homeland, where we were born, educated, and have lived. Therefore we would prefer death, facing starvation, and enduring the hardships of life here, than to pursue a more comfortable existence elsewhere, the harsh reality is that circumstances often force us into difficult choices. 
Peace out
