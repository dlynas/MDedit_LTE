## Wtf is up with ISIS?ü§îüßê Part 1üè¥

This is just a little teaser of the bombshell we're about to present in part 2, but if you think all of these examples are "co√Øncidences", you're too fast asleep to wake up anyway.

In part 3 we really need to have a conversation about how long the US has been using the Mujahideen, Al-Q*ada and other terrorist groups in de Middle East and beyond, because the coming years are going to be full of psy-ops, false flag attacks & other US/NATO/Israeli-terrorism and y'all are nowhere near recognizing them as such.

We need to have these conversations now.

	"Oh no! What? It appears that ISIS might attack Russia. Really? When?
	Ah! ISIS just attacked a concert venue in Moscow. Dang it!
	Why do you keep saying ISIS like that? What do you mean? ISIS is their name.
	Yeah, but why don't you keep putting ISIS in quotes? Duh! Because it's ISIS."
