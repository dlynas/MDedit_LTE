## What did modern French philosophers like Foucault, Derrida and Lacan actually believe? What kind of influence has it had on society?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/18kyntg/what_did_modern_french_philosophers_like_foucault/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/18kyntg/what_did_modern_french_philosophers_like_foucault/)

> Many on the right (and elsewhere - Chomsky, for instance, disregards some of them entirely) deride these and others as, essentially, charlatans writing gibberish to look brilliant, and many accuse of them of having ushered in an era of amorality through their belief in postmodernist relativism and such and such. But even on the left, I find precious little clear explanation of what exactly postmodernism, or structuralism, or poststructuralism, or any of the other terms associated with them actually mean. So, what makes them so influential, so notable? Why are they still remembered? What were they arguing, and what effects has it had?

	This is going to simplify a lot and leave a lot out, but at its core Post-Modernism is a reaction to the Enlightenment drive towards universalism, and especially against one Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.  So to explain the origins of 20th century French philosophy, we really have to spend some time in 19th century Germany.  

	It is hard to overstate just how much Hegel, and his dialectical unfolding Reason through history, towered over 19th century philosophy on the Continent.  His Phenomenology of Spirit, and the people in conversation with it was the contemporary philosophy cannon at most universities.  This isn‚Äôt to say that Hegel stood alone, Schopenhauer was Hegel‚Äôs contemporary and great rival, but firmly relegated to number 2 in the philosophical cannon.  

	It is against this cannon that the two grandfathers of postmodernism were reacting.  S√∏ren Kierkegaard, never a household name in his own time, and Friedrich Nietzsche, whose legacy was much harmed by his sister‚Äôs association with German nationalism and antisemitism after his death.  

	Kierkegaard objects to Hegel‚Äôs ‚Äúphilosopher‚Äôs God‚Äù of Reason, because for him, the only way to God is the leap of faith, where faith is antithetical to reason.  Crucially, for Kierkegaard the journey to faith is rooted in ‚Äúthe stages of life‚Äù, or as we might rephrase it, the existential position of the subject.  This is why he is typically identified as the progenitor of Existentialism, later picked up (atheistically) by the likes of Sartre and De Bouvier.  

	Nietzsche too attacks Hegel for his ‚Äúotherworldliness‚Äù.  I‚Äôm not going unpack Nietzsche‚Äôs most selectively quoted aphorism, that God is dead, but suffice it to say that if Hegel is interested in the unfolding of Reason through history, Nietzsche is principally concerned with the ability of the individual to impose their own Will on history.  

	I should pause here to explain, that while for Kierkegaard, God very much did mean the literal Christian deity, for Hegel and Nietzsche and most of their contemporaries, you could easily substitute God for the Idea, or Reason, or Universality.  The philosopher‚Äôs God that Kierkegaard derided, is really a stand in the singularity of Being, which overcomes the observer problem of Kant and Descartes and the division of object and subject,  and gets to the single universal Truth.  

	The next step in my, already too long, story is Martin Heidegger and his magnum opus Being and Time.  Heidegger has a very complex legacy, for the way both his philosophy and his personal actions are implicated in Nazism, which I also don‚Äôt want to unpack, so for our purposes the two key takeaways are first that where Kierkegaard and Nietzsche criticized the Hegelian ontology, Heidegger aspired to replace it.  Second, in his attempt to do so, he adds another crucial element that shapes what fallows, which is the emphasis on what he calls Dasein or ‚ÄúBeing-in-the-World‚Äù.  

	Finally, we get to France in the 1930s and 40s, where folks like Jean Paul Sartre, Simone De Bouvier, Albert Camus etc, who create the Existentialism as a philosophical movement.  Where the last 300 years of European philosophy had been struggling in different ways with the problem of subjectivity, where even if Universality/Truth/Oneness/Knowing God, etc. were impossible, it was at least seen as desirable, the existentialists flip this moral framework.  

	For me it‚Äôs this moral element, and the emphasis on freedom, that you can find in things like Sartre‚Äôs Existentialism as Humanism, which is the key takeaway.  His famous quote that existence precedes essence isn‚Äôt just an ontological statement, it‚Äôs an ethical statement, which gives rise to social criticism.  We can see this in action in the most consequential text of this movement Simone De Bouvier‚Äôs Second Sex, which becomes a pillar of feminist philosophy for the critique of the ways in which the imagined essence of womanhood is imposed on half the population and serves to subjugate them.

		As Existentialism became the predominant philosophical movement, it opened up new questions.  If we have abandoned the moral drive for universality in our to embrace our subjective human freedom, then where does meaning come from?  If one becomes a woman, and isn‚Äôt born one, because existence precedes essence, then how does one become one, and how have we arrived at a shared understanding of what it is to be a woman?  In other words, how to reconcile an ontology of existential freedom, with a lived reality of constraint, even oppression? 
		
		The Structuralists, folks like Saussure and Levi-Strauss in the 1950s and early 60s turned to the examination of language itself as offering a potential source of meaning, and an answer to this question.  The sought to find structural patterns in various social and cultural phenomena, in mythology, in family structure, etc, rooted in the binary relationship between the signifier and the signified.  
		
		Finally, the Post-Structuralists emerge in reaction to this, including the folks you mentioned, Foucault, Lacan, and Derrida, and the people they inspired, folks like Judith Butler and Slavoj Zizek.  It is difficult to fit any of these folks together, because they all believe very different things and have very different contributions.  It‚Äôs hard to even give them meaning as a category.  
		
		Derrida really picks up the baton of structuralist semiotics developing his idea of diff√©rance (the French is important), and deconstruction, which is all about problematizing the relationship between signifier and signified.  Because, while they can presented as a binary, that is only possible if we imagine meaning to be fixed.  But, or so Derrida argues, meaning making is always relational, always dependant of an infinite number of possible signs giving rise to infinite possible readings, so that meaning can never become fixed or static.  
		
		Foucault isn‚Äôt really interested in semiotics, his critique is all about power relations, and language  as a hegemonizing force.  A little like Nietzsche  what‚Äôs important to Foucault isn‚Äôt the reading of a sign, but the imposition of the sharing and replication, and imposition of that reading. 
		
		Lacan takes structuralist semiotics and mashes it together with Freudian psychoanalysis, to create his own theory of the Symbolic Order, and the ways meaning is made (and often suppressed) through the interactions of signifier and signified and the conscious and unconscious minds.  
		
		No doubt I‚Äôve badly butchered some of that, because Lacan remains impenetrable to me, and I‚Äôve made at least 3 failed attempts to get through Derrida‚Äôs Writing and Difference. 
		
		
		As to why Poststructuralism has become a boogeyman, it depends who we are talking about.  
		
		For Chomsky, specifically, his linguistics theory where he made his name before his activism, is all about the biological programming of the syntactic building blocks of language in human beings.  For Chomsky all human languages are reducible to and  inter-relatable via these building blocks, which would mean (he thinks) the structuralists are right and that there have to be universal structures of meaning across social and cultural phenomena, because they come preprogrammed in our brains as the basis for our language.  
		
		More generally, there is another historical divide in philosophy between the Continental and English or Analytic traditions.  To make a long story very short, the English didn‚Äôt take to Hegel.  As far as the beefeaters were concerned the Enlightenment gave them the steam engine, after emerging from 25-ish years of war triumphant, there was no need to agonize over whether the Enlightenment had also produced Napoleon.  So they continued with the Enlightenment project of rationalism, that there is definitely a capital T Truth, which is discernible in the material world and through the application of Reason.  And everything since Hegel on the Continent is over intellectualized hooey, trying to make a problem where there isn‚Äôt one.  
		
		As far as American conservative reaction, up until the second half of the 20th century American universities generally adopted the Analytic tradition.  It was only post-WW2 and especially post 1968 that French philosophy, began to shape the work of American scholars.  I‚Äôll go back to what I said about Sartre and DeBouvier, because these philosophical traditions have a fundamental liberationist moral core.  They reject the naturalness or inevitability of the social order as it is.  
		
		In particular, I think there‚Äôs an acute moral panic on the American right about the way critical theory has reshaped the American academy. There‚Äôs no better example than Queer Theory, with a French father, Michele Foucault, and an American mother, Judith Butler, the perfect lavender marriage üòâ. Today, every university in North America has a gender studies department, and every discipline has a feminist journal, where Butler is the bedrock of the philosophical cannon.  And at the same time academia has leaked into activism and even the cultural mainstream.

					I just had the words counted, it's 1431. Maybe add Marx, going up to 2000 in the process, then go and publish it somewhere as the world's most unabashedly ambitious 2000-word essay. I'd frame it and hang it on my wall, I'm not even joking (I love philosophy).

					God, that'd be a mess. A past thread on the French "philosophy and leftist justification for pedophilia" controversy was as long as your first reply. 
					
					Also thanks as I did have to major in Communications after my first school ran into issues, and your reply helped understand some concepts better. Some days I'd leave class *looking forward* to my second majors 6 hour labs, and definitely appreciating the business or psychology based courses. 
					
					The boogey-man thing is hilarious as 90% of people I know fall into two camps: Disbelief it exists, or belief that it's brainwashing students. 99% of us just wanted a better job and to graduate. I don't know anyone whose political views were changed via college. 
					
					Post-structuralism was required by the state to teach, but faculty views ranged widely. As you pointed out with Chomsky, "the left" aren't always fans of these boogy-men. 
					
					We had a visiting assistant professor who identified with "classical fascist" thought teach the state-mandatory gender studies course; "tragedy of the commons" is taught in high school but came from a crypto fascist call-to-arms; I don't know why people find New School theorists &amp; post-structuralists in academia shocking. Until fairly recently, academia was, as a Dissent author put it, "an escape from capitalism, where anyone could teach anything, and get brilliant rewards."

			It should be noted that the label ‚Äòpoststructuralism‚Äô established itself in the  intellectual debate of the 1980s and 1990s in the Anglo-American world, in Central, Southern and Eastern Europe, in Central and South America and in East Asia ‚Äì in short, everywhere but in France. Thus, the very term ‚Äúpoststructuralism‚Äù, although designating a strain of French Theory, is an Anglo-Saxon and German invention.

				Basically, because it‚Äôs used (especially in English translations) to convey that Derrida is using a made up word.  He is sort of playing on a French homonym, combining the meanings to differ and to defer.  
				
				Derrida‚Äôs writings are filled with these kind of puns or slippages or language jokes, which are difficult to catch, if like me, you‚Äôre a monolingual Anglophone, relying on translations.

			>English or Analytic traditions
			
			\> And everything since Hegel on the Continent
			
			OUCH. That hurt. The Analytical-Continental split happened in Germany. Basically Heidegger said our anxiety is evidence of the existence of Nothing and Carnap said it is bullshit. In 1931. Remember what happened in 1933.
			
			Carnap was a logical positivist, where positivism is basically empiricism, indeed, observations about the material world. But I would emphasize the logical part more, Carnap came from the tradition of German philosophers like Frege or Leibniz who were also mathemathicians and drove their philosophy something close to mathemathics, something precisely logical.
			
			This was actually kind of fun. Heidegger's inaugural speech was " ‚ÄúWhat is Metaphysics? in 1929 and then in 1931 Carnap wrote: "The Elimination of Metaphysics through the Logical Analysis of Language" which was in the politely precise language of philosophy a huge personal fuck you. Basically "if you could think logically, you would realize that crap you talk about does not even exist". That was definitely throwing down the gauntlet. Talking about someone's inauguration speech as "especially obvious violations of logical syntax"! That was fun. It really caused a bang. This was like rappers dissing ech other. And of course German philosophers had to take sides. How could you be neutral about something like that? Carnap left no choice but either to support him or oppose him.
			
			Meanwhile the Nazis came to power in 1933 and Heidegger was chummy with them and Carnap was a socialist and pacifist. So the university positions went to the Heidegger camp, the "proto-continentals", and not the Carnap camp, the "proto-analyticals". Eventually in 1935 Carnap figured staying might be bad for his health and went to America. Good call - his mentor, Schlick, was murdered just a year later. Anyway, "analytical philosophy" appeared in the English-speaking world in 1935. And not in Britain.
			
			Why it it associated with Britain? I would track it to Wittgenstein just appearing in Russel's room in Cambridge in 1911. But... Wittgenstein was Wittgenstein. That is, a very unique thinker who was opposed to no one or everyone including his own younger self, depending on how you want to take that. If we think of analyticals as a "school", and one that is explicitly opposed to continentals, that is 100% from Carnap.

		You jump from Hegel directly to post-war France in Sartre, Camus, Beauvoir. I mean ofc it is hard to explain fully in a short space ofc, but isn't there something you are missing inbetween, in the shape of a couple of angry bearded Germans maybe?
		
		I'd say the influence of Marxism and how it attempted to take this universal project to the material world explainable via social dynamics is quite important here. I'd even go as far as claiming the simplest way to explain poststructuralism would be "yes to social dynamics explaining stuff, no to universalism" (and a "maybe" to materialism? it really is hard to make concise lol) found in Marx. Taking it directly from Hegel might be confusing without that link.

			Definitely!  Marx is a huge part of this story. 
			
			I guess my defense for leaving him out would be that once you go from Marx to Gramsci and the reciprocal nature of base and superstructure, Marx‚Äôs critique of capital and the material relations of production are just taken as read, by this group of French philosophers, I wanted to get to.  So they just go back to discussing (in a Marxist framing) the superstructure.

			* üü¶ **[redwashing](https://www.reddit.com/user/redwashing)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2 _(2023-12-19 04:43:24)_

				That makes sense. Though I'd argue the poststructuralist tradition does not take Marx at his word there imo, especially Foucault is clear on not agreeing with what he considers a deterministic approach to base - superstructure relations (imo he argues against a strawman caricature of Marx but that's another story) and putting a more narrative based approach instead. That's why he was so popular in US while practically forgotten in Europe for a long time, he provided a way to be "critical and radical" to American academia without talking about production and distribution (and that was an academic caricature of Foucault but that's another story).
				
				The French are weird about the whole base - superstructure thing. Even Sartre, while theoretically agreeing with it, practically gets around it by getting around Stoff and Form relation.

		This is really strange, because what I have pieced together the opposite story, many PM ideas started with Hegel. One central characteristic is a very sceptical take on the existence of objective truth and knowledge. The first concept of truth in the traditional sense is that everything is identical with itself, "A is A". But Hegel said it is not that simple, the negative pole of a magnet is not conceptually or physically separable from the whole, so it is not identical with itself and itself only. It is also an inseparable part of a whole. Or when a teenager has an adult person as a role model, they both try to become someone like that person, and yet at the same time they stay themselves. This led to dialectics - that something can at the same time be something and not be it, a statement can be both true and false.
