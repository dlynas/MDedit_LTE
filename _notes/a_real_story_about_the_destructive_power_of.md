## A real story about the destructive power of ‚Äúself-help‚Äù

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IfBooksCouldKill/comments/1bogo8u/a_real_story_about_the_destructive_power_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IfBooksCouldKill/comments/1bogo8u/a_real_story_about_the_destructive_power_of/)

> I just discovered the podcast yesterday and love it. Currently listening to the episode on The Secret.
> 
> It‚Äôs funny, it‚Äôs right, but I had ADHD and mental health problems from childhood and these kinds of books were the only answer my mother had because there was and is not adequate mental health care in the U.K. 
> 
> My mother and I have spent thousands on books like this. I spent my lonely teens and twenties reading these books believing they had the knowledge and power to solve our money, relationship and mental health problems. These books likely got me out of my comfort zone a little, but I quickly flew back to the comfort zone of these books and their false promises when I couldn‚Äôt cope in the real world.
> 
> I haven‚Äôt read a self help book for ages now but my mother is still in to all of it. She went much further than me, ever since her mother died when I was 2 she looked for answers with psychics who I had no idea as a child were taking advantage of us. 
> 
> Not only did these books not help my mental health, they made them worse. I turned 40 last year and I am looking back and seeing just how damaging this magical thinking has been. I believed I created everything bad that happened to me and that anything I didn‚Äôt have was my fault. I‚Äôm struggling to stop believing these things. It‚Äôs like trying to quietly deprogram yourself from a cult while trying to appear normal.
> 
> Everything has been affected; my education, my relationships, my career and most importantly my health. I‚Äôm devastated.
> 
> And for my mother who is now nearly 70 years old I still see it affecting her. She doesn‚Äôt go to the doctor. She‚Äôs just spent a lot of money and time completing an energy healing course. And people can do what they want, but I‚Äôm just so sad for her. She‚Äôs even refusing to move house with my dad because she‚Äôs waiting for her ‚Äúdream house‚Äù that will never come. I‚Äôm scared she‚Äôll end up in a house too big for her that has depreciated and that she can‚Äôt manage well in as an older person.
> 
> Notable self help scammers who have ruined our lives:
> 
> - Paul McKenna
> - Michael Neill (seems like a nice guy which makes it worse imo)
> - Esther and Jerry ‚ÄúAbraham‚Äù Hicks

> As I write, I‚Äôm remembering more and more time I spent writing affirmations, sitting alone reading and just not knowing how to operate in the world.
> 
> My mother had a traumatic childhood of poverty, abuse and neglect and rejected Catholicism. These self-help assholes ruined my life just like a lying, controlling religion ruined hers. 
> 
> That‚Äôs the story and I have no idea how to heal. I don‚Äôt know if I can. In the end when you trust con artists you lose trust in yourself. I hope this helped give some perspective.

	Have you seen a therapist about this, because like you said, it's like leaving a cult.

			I‚Äôm a cult survivor and I relate to a lot of what you‚Äôre saying here. You might have a look at resources about healing from religious trauma to see if there are helpful pieces there for you. 
			
			I‚Äôm also in my early 40s, recently diagnosed with ADHD, and just now finding space to process a lot of this stuff. It‚Äôs a real mindf*ck, but life is getting so much gentler and more manageable as I find more realistic expectations for myself. 
			
			I hope your journey brings you peace and comfort. ‚ù§Ô∏è

			Don't just consider. Do not pass go. Do not collect $100. Go directly to [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists)\* or whatever resources you have available. You have a lot to unpack, and you can get a lot of help with a therapist. It's ok if the first therapist you try isn't a good fit. Same with the second. Just keep trying.
			
			I think I landed on a good (great!) therapist on my third try. That was probably seven or eight years ago, and it was the best thing I ever did for my mental health. I'll never not be in therapy ever again.\* I had well meaning and loving parents, but that doesn't mean that I don't have childhood/generational trauma that is still impacting my current life and relationships. However, I now have help navigating it all, and my life is so much the better for it.
			
			\*I'm not a therapist or a shill. I just really love how much calmer I feel now that I have someone to talk to about all this shit.

				Also want to add that as you look for a therapist, make sure they hold current understandings of ADHD.  Even among therapists you can encounter providers who are not currently informed and therefore may replicate some of the problematic perspectives that have already been unhelpful for you.   
				
				(FWIW, I am a therapist ‚Äî and I‚Äôm also a client! üòâ I have become something of a specialist in working with people with ADHD and pursued additional education about it. I‚Äôve also encountered professionals who don‚Äôt have a good understanding of it when trying to help my own kids w ADHD, and that was frustrating and upsetting.)

			There's a podcast called "Sounds Like a Cult" that covers everyday things that have cult-y vibes. Sometimes it's lighthearted and they cover Starbucks but other episodes like sororities and self-help are a bit more serious. Check out their episode on the cult of self-help, you might find something relatable in it.

				On a similar note, I thought of A Little Bit Culty (the hosts Sarah and Nippy are buds with Amanda Montell!) as being a good resource and refuge for OP. Similar topics but with a more serious, recovery-based angle. They compile resources for folks who are getting out of cults and high-control groups:

	Are you me? Grew up with undiagnosed autism (finally diagnosed as an adult) and believed that each self help book I read would bring me closer to being "perfect." I.e., calm, cool, collected, not having major meltdowns in class, or being bullied. I believed that these folks and their knowledge could cure me and if I wasn't getting better it was all my fault. 

	I don't think the mindset of "this will cure me, this will make me better" will really ever go away. Especially not in a society that punishes folks for being different in any way, from neurodivergency to the color of your skin. I figure that the best thing I can do is surround myself with people who are like me and, if all else fails, remind myself that my dog doesn't care if I can't survive a walk through a grocery store. So, why should I?

	Thanks for coming to my Ted talk, lol. Just want you to know that you aren't alone. Funny enough, my mother is still stuck in self-help culture too. That and religion.

		Thanks so much for answering with your experience. It‚Äôs really hard for people to understand when it‚Äôs in plain sight and it‚Äôs not physically harmful.

	* üü® **[Autesstic](https://www.reddit.com/user/Autesstic)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2 _(2024-03-26 21:30:00)_

		But you‚Äôre me! Same same, when IBCK came out I was both horrified and amused that the first two episodes were on books I had read in the hope of finding answers and ‚Äúfixing‚Äù myself.
		Turns out I was just autistic, found out a year ago at age 43. Late diagnosis sucks.

		'Calm, cool and collected' holy fuck memory unlocked. My mum used to recite those exact same words to my autistic ass back in the 90s.  I wonder what book it came from...

* üü© **[MythicalGirlCock](https://www.reddit.com/user/MythicalGirlCock)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 20 _(2024-03-26 16:16:57)_

	I'm in a similar boat, although I'm a bit younger. 

	I was undiagnosed autistic and ADHD and severely neglected as a kid. Although my parents didn't suggest these books a mentor of mine did. I was given so many books like "The Power of Focus" and "How to Win Friends and Influence People." Tim Ferris was the worst for my psyche. 

	At 35 I finally feel like I have shed a lot of the habits and destructive thinking that I thought was good for me at the time. The perpetual optimism and unending positivity did me a lot more harm then good. 

	There are lots of us out there and just want you to know you're not alone. üíú

	I just read a book called Help Me, in which a journalist attempts to follow a self help book to the letter each month and discovers that the root of most of her problems was feeling she needed to constantly be perfecting herself. You might find something in it, if you still love reading nonfiction. (To be clear, it's not a self help book, it's a memoir.)

	* üü® **[morelightthanheat_](https://www.reddit.com/user/morelightthanheat_)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2 _(2024-03-27 17:18:46)_

		I loved this book! I happened upon it when I was in a major self-help stage myself, and I loved her message that basically she didn‚Äôt need to look inward and make herself perfect, she needed to look outward and focus on her connections with her family and friends. It really changed my view on self-help. It was also just a really funny book in parts, while also being really impactful.

	A podcast I used to listen to had a host who got divorced and then got really into Abraham Hicks/Byron Katie/Eckhart Tolle. Her content got weirder and weirder and I stopped listening when she started claiming she didn‚Äôt need glasses anymore because she was healing her eyesight with her mind üò¨ This kind of stuff is dangerous and I‚Äôm really sorry you were exposed to it so young.

* üü© **[DatGouda](https://www.reddit.com/user/DatGouda)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 8 _(2024-03-26 18:32:56)_

	Thank you for sharing this! I had a similar upbringing: really bad anxiety and panic attacks as a kid, some of my folks kept treating me with works from similar authors. Byron Katie, the Hicks couple, Rhonda Byrne, Paulo Coelho (can't tell you how much I dislike The Alchemist), even older texts like Jane Roberts's Seth series made an appearance.

	As an adult, I'm still reluctant to ask certain family members for advice or commiseration for fear of evoking lectures from these books. I wish that the adults in my life had leveled with me and validated the uncertainty that exists in the world, instead of allowing these grifters to impose their visions on us. (Of course, I still love the fam. I know we're all searching for truth and end up running into hypocrisy. It's normal.)

	Anyway, thank you, OP! You've already begun to heal! Please give yourself some credit for the hard work you put in overcoming these limiting ways of thinking.

		Ah thanks! So sorry for what you went through. Our experiences do sound very similar. I get what you mean, after a very significant loss in my life I had to outright tell my mom I didn‚Äôt want any advice. She didn‚Äôt like that but she kind of listened. I‚Äôm just really sad I‚Äôve had to create an emotional distance between us where it feels like a full relationship should be.

	There is, ironically I guess, a really good self help book out there for ADHD people:

	[https://www.amazon.com/You-Mean-Lazy-Stupid-Crazy/dp/0743264487](https://www.amazon.com/You-Mean-Lazy-Stupid-Crazy/dp/0743264487)

	A lot of it is less "clean our room" type crap and more "hey, here are a bunch of case studies of different ways people have coped with undiagnosed ADHD" coupled with "all this time you probably thought you were all alone... well, guess what, you're not". It was really, really eye-opening for me.

	I went through a phase of reading Ram Dass, Wayne Dyer and Louise Hay and Shirley McClain and looking back I‚Äôm so mad. (Not sure about Ram Dass) but the others definitely had that thing about you get what you think about so bad things are because you aren‚Äôt being positive or some such crap.

	I‚Äôve found over the years that any kind of self-help that doesn‚Äôt center agency and instead centers on waiting for the universe to provide is detrimental.

	Like, vision boards are a neutral object. Making one can help people line out their thoughts and where they want to be. But then stashing it and waiting on the universe isn‚Äôt going to work. Looking at what you think you want and saying ‚Äúokay, what change do I make to get there‚Äù can be helpful.

	My story is very, very, very similar to yours.  You are not alone, and I believe you.

	I'd add Jen Sincero and Joe Dispenza to that list. My biological mother was really into "John of God" and it was very satisfying when he had a startling MeToo moment. (I also heartily encourage going no-contact; it was life-saving for me)

	I'd heartily encourage you to check out Nate Posthlthwait. His work on healing childhood trauma has been life-changing.

* üü© **[UnicornPenguinCat](https://www.reddit.com/user/UnicornPenguinCat)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2 _(2024-04-02 00:27:39)_

	I have a few stories to share about this sort of stuff too. As a kid I was constantly told I had things "wrong" with me, one of the major ones being that I apparently lacked confidence and self esteem (I mean, being told that repeatedly doesn't exactly help you build it).¬†

	At one point my mum borrowed Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway from the library to read for herself, and handed it to me when she thought it might help. I have to say that it actually did, because it was the first time I'd heard the message that lacking confidence doesn't actually have to hold you back from doing things you want to do, confidence is not a prerequisite for a satisfying life. It gave me the courage to try some things I was terrified to do but really wanted to try. That book is problematic in some other ways (By the Book did a good episode on it), but that part at least was helpful for me.¬†

	But my dad went through a self-help stage that seemed pretty destructive. He signed up to an MLM and it came with a whole lot of motivational tapes... which he then used as parenting advice throughout my childhood and into my early 20s. He didn't stick with the MLM for long luckily (realised pretty quickly his friends weren't going to buy much stuff from him) but if I ever went to him with a problem I'd get an answer that came from one of the tapes. E.g. if I was upset because someone was bullying me at primary school, it would be "well you know, no-one can make you feel inferior without your permission, you have the power to change your mindset". What I really needed as a little kid was someone to show me empathy, talk through my feelings with me, make sure I felt loved and safe at home and then some help with strategies for what to do if it happened again.

	Later in my 20s I had a friend who was deeply into the magical thinking side of self-help (even self-published a book). For a long time it wasn't a huge deal, I just accepted it as a difference in the way we saw the world. But at one point I was dating this guy who I really liked but who (in hindsight) was treating me awfully, and I was upset because it looked like the relationship was probably about to end. My friend gave me advice to continue to think positively and not let negative energy come in, because it would push him away, with the suggestion that if he broke up with me it would because of my negative energy.

	Not long after that I was hanging out with the same friend and some of her other acquaintances when one of them shared a story about not liking a certain cafe. She said she found it unwelcoming because she'd been in there by herself one day having coffee and reading, when another customer had wanted the table she was at. That person had aggressively asked her to move, and the owner of the cafe had seen it happen and not stepped in. She said "if they'd asked politely I would have happily moved, but after that I don't feel like going back there again". Instead of empathising with her, the people she was telling the story to started blaming her, saying "well you must have been putting out negative energy, which was probably why that guy was rude, you attracted that to yourself". It was just icky and I felt so bad for the poor woman :(¬† I had a big falling out with my friend not long after, and all the law of attraction stuff was a major reason why.¬†

	Anyway, I just wanted to share I guess. It's sad that this stuff happens.¬†

		Thanks so much for your story. I really think lost of people so this stuff with the best intentions, not knowing how harmful it can be. I guess your dad wanted to provide for his family, and the mlm self help stuff made him feel in control a bit more and I guess he thought it might help you? As you said, it‚Äôs not what you needed. Good luck to you x

	Curious. I have read a lot of these books and they changed by life for the immeasurable better. I always find it interesting how the way we‚Äôre raised can change how we take in information. I was raised in a Christian household and hold a lot of grievances towards the church but as I‚Äôve gotten older I‚Äôve seen people have profound religious experiences that I can‚Äôt deny even if I personally think the Christian religion is its own kind of crazy cult. I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs the info itself or just the way it‚Äôs presented (this applies to every idea or philosophy really).

		Yeah I have to agree and don‚Äôt consider several of these writers and thinkers as scammers.
		
		Byron Katie has essentially packaged the principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy into a self guided practice that she calls ‚Äúthe work‚Äù. But it‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôd be doing in CBT with a licensed therapist: identifying limiting beliefs, what purpose they serve, whether it‚Äôs knowable that they‚Äôre actually true, what it would mean for your mental and emotional wellbeing to know they aren‚Äôt true.
		
		Eckhart Tolle primarily espouses Buddhist principles like mindfulness and detachment in a way that‚Äôs accessible to western audiences.
		
		Obviously these types of books are not a panacea ~ the act of reading them doesn‚Äôt solve all your material problems. But I personally believe they provide actionable ideas that can change your mindset, which can change your life. It‚Äôs fair to say these thinkers are popular among a ‚Äúwoo-woo‚Äù, new age crowd but imo, these authors (as far as I know) are not espousing cultish beliefs such as ‚Äúmanifestation cured my adhd!‚Äù or ‚Äúa raw vegan diet cured my cancer!‚Äù It‚Äôs just that some of their ideas may appeal to a certain audience that‚Äôs susceptible to magical thinking.

		Maybe. I‚Äôd be interested to hear what improved for you and how, if you‚Äôd like to share.

			Well for me, I came to some of these books in a time when I really needed help to get out of my own head which was full of negative thoughts and feelings after years of not taking care of my mental health at all. To me being able to think positively was not even a thing. I was raised to be self-sacrificing and responsible. I put any independent thoughts or feelings in the back seat for the validation of others. So things like affirmations really got me out of a funk because it was the first time I realized I could give myself the encouragement and self love I needed instead of waiting in vain that one day someone would just do it for me or people in my life would change. Eventually, exploration of ‚Äúchoosing thoughts‚Äù led me to Buddhism , a philosophy (not really a religion imo) that completely changed my life. Most of these teachers basically teach a very very bastardized, westernized version of Buddhism that they‚Äôve twisted into ‚Äúa way to get stuff‚Äù. But the truth is a lot of wonderful people I‚Äôve met in the community of Buddhism over the years started out with this stuff. If raised very traditionally it‚Äôs the closest to those set of ideas you get. Mainstream culture is very antithetical to Buddhism and those books were a great first step for many if only for encouraging a meditation practice.
			
			The way you‚Äôve been taught is why, despite this material changing my life, I never joined any communities or been to any of these peoples seminars. Unfortunately I think that a lot of people take these beautiful teachings and use them to serve their own fantasies. Especially with Esther Hicks. I actually don‚Äôt mind her material anymore (though like most people I initially thought she was nuts. Still kinda is but I get what she‚Äôs talking about more now haha) but the law of attraction stuff makes a lot of people delusional. Now that I‚Äôm more mature (for lack of a better term) I can see how her words can help but I think a lot of her fanbase should hit up therapy rather than her seminars. The idea of choosing positive thoughts to me simply allows some pushback and distance from them in times when you feel swallowed up and attacked by negative ones. This neurotic thinking that you also choose your negative experience is true in a sense but what most people do is simply try to deny when they feel bad and shove it down. When they can‚Äôt, they feel guilty and it starts a whole cycle that results in you being worse off than when they started this whole mess in the first place haha. The key is guilt is never necessary. I don‚Äôt at all believe that you are ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù for every shitty thing that happened in your life. That‚Äôs fucking crazy talk and I know thats what some people in your list say and that‚Äôs a part that I very strongly disagree with. I do think you have a responsibility to yourself to try to look at the things that are beautiful and good about you. To savor a good day when you have them and stop to smell the roses if you ever feel the urge to. But when you feel bad, feel bad. You‚Äôre not ruining your life by feeling bad and thinking so only gets worse. I just think it‚Äôs a better life experience when you put even the smallest effort into finding things you can love about yourself and life rather than just wallowing like I was before.
			
			I also should stress that even with ALL the self-help I read (and it was a lot) it was only a positive supplement to the therapy I did for three years. It‚Äôs just that before reading those books I would‚Äôve never went to therapy in the first place! My family was very against the idea of therapy and until I was able to ‚Äúchoose my own thoughts‚Äù and look at other ways of seeing the world, I would‚Äôve died with the same beliefs they still have. 
			
			To be very clear, I wouldn‚Äôt suggest that you revisit any of those books to you right now. You‚Äôve grown up with a tainted view of that info and right now it wouldn‚Äôt do any good. I would highly recommend therapy. Your upbringing was emotionally abusive. Affirmations and positive vortexes and what not can be very helpful mindsets when you‚Äôre older, lonely and struggling with depression. If there‚Äôs no one to talk to but yourself it‚Äôs better to find ways to start thinking positively otherwise it‚Äôs a dark, dark path. A child however needs real, solid comfort and affirmations from their parents growing up. To tell a child to make themselves feel better and never think anything negative while you sit around waiting for Jesus to come (metaphorically) is crazy. That‚Äôs not really what a lot of these people teach and I don‚Äôt think most of them would support the way your mom raised you. However, after therapy if one of these books pops back into your life for whatever reason I‚Äôd encourage you to give them a chance. Just to see what you think about them without the bias of your upbringing. I know that I had that experience with the Bible in my older years. It‚Äôs a great spiritual book that is often taught by the cruelest and most manipulative people of our society. I would also encourage giving Eckhart Tolle specifically another chance. His stuff really has very little to do with law of attraction but he‚Äôs often just lumped in there since he‚Äôs also ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù and preaches staying in the moment. The other authors do as well but they add a lot of LOA stuff that he doesn‚Äôt even talk about or emphasize in his teachings.
