## In "The Evolution of Cooperation", why is the winner the one with the most points accumulated rather than the one that wins the most matches?

> I ran simulations of  the repeated prisoner's dilemma with several strategies, defining "winner" as the strategy that wins the most, not the strategy with the most points. The results are different in these two cases.
> 
> I'm wondering if this has been studied and what the interpretation of thus result is. 
> 
> As I see it, counting number of wins is a bit more meaningful, because it otherwise the "winning strategy" might lose all matches and still win the game.

	Points represent utility. Utility is a representation of a consumer's ordinal preferences over a set of choices. The prisoner's dilemma isn't a zero sum game. My gain of utility doesn't necessarily imply another's loss of utility in that scenario. In a scenario of repeating the prisoner's dilemma, a strategy that will never lose in 1v1 isn't necessarily preferable to a strategy that reciprocates overall.

		To put this another way for the OP, "winning" doesn't matter, all that matters is maximizing utility. This is completely unlike most sports where the points don't really matter as long as you win by scoring more than your opponent.
		
		You can model games where winning is what matters with game theory too, but then that's reflected in the utility. In that case, the utility wouldn't correspond to the points you scored, but rather to whether you won or lost, e.g. 1 for a win, -1 for a loss, and 0 for a tie.

	That’s the whole point of the “Don’t be envious” principle. Most of life is not a zero sum game, so you should maximize your overall value (utility) you generate across multiple interactions rather than the number of wins. For example, if you run a business, you would want to generate the highest profits overall for example by partnering with other businesses rather than to make more money than your partner in a specific joint venture. 

	In fact, Tit For Tat never wins in individual interactions by design, yet it won both tournaments overall. Counterintuitive but profound.
