Property dualism: the exemplification of two kinds of property by one kind of substance

**Property dualism** describes a category of positions in the [philosophy of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind "Philosophy of mind") which hold that, although the world is composed of just one kind of [substance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_theory "Substance theory")—[the physical kind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism "Materialism")—there exist two distinct kinds of properties: [physical properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_properties "Physical properties") and [mental properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_properties "Mental properties"). In other words, it is the view that at least some non-physical, mental properties (such as thoughts, imagination and memories) exist in, or naturally [supervene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervenience "Supervenience") upon, certain physical substances (namely [brains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Brain "Human Brain")).

[Substance dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism_(philosophy_of_mind) "Dualism (philosophy of mind)"), on the other hand, is the view that there exist in the universe two fundamentally different kinds of substance: physical ([matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter")) and non-physical ([mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind "Mind") or [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness")), and subsequently also two kinds of properties which inhere in those respective substances. Substance dualism is thus more susceptible to the [mind–body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem "Mind–body problem"). Both substance and property dualism are opposed to [reductive physicalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductive_physicalism "Reductive physicalism").

## Epiphenomenalism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Property_dualism&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Epiphenomenalism")\]

Epiphenomenalism is a doctrine about mental-physical causal relations which holds that one or more mental states and their properties are the by-products (or [epiphenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphenomena "Epiphenomena")) of the states of a closed physical system, and are not causally reducible to physical states (do not have any influence on physical states). According to this view, mental properties are as such real constituents of the world, but they are causally impotent; while physical causes give rise to mental properties like [sensations](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sensation "wikt:sensation"), [volition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volition_(psychology) "Volition (psychology)"), [ideas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea "Idea"), etc., such mental phenomena themselves cause nothing further - they are causal dead ends.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_dualism#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>

Huxley explained mental properties as like the steam on a locomotive.

The position is credited to English biologist [Thomas Huxley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Huxley "Thomas Huxley") (Huxley 1874), who analogised mental properties to the whistle on a steam locomotive. The position found a level of favor amongst some scientific [behaviorists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorists "Behaviorists") over the next few decades, which then dove in response to the [cognitive revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_revolution "Cognitive revolution") in the 1960s.

### Epiphenomenal qualia\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Property_dualism&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Epiphenomenal qualia")\]

In the paper "Epiphenomenal Qualia" and later "What Mary Didn't Know" [Frank Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Cameron_Jackson "Frank Cameron Jackson") made the so-called knowledge argument against physicalism. The [thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment "Thought experiment") was originally proposed by Jackson as follows:

> Mary is a brilliant scientist who is, for whatever reason, forced to investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and white television monitor. She specializes in the [neurophysiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurophysiology "Neurophysiology") of vision and acquires, let us suppose, all the physical information there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes, or the sky, and use terms like 'red', 'blue', and so on. She discovers, for example, just which wavelength combinations from the sky stimulate the retina, and exactly how this produces via the [central nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system "Central nervous system") the contraction of the vocal cords and expulsion of air from the lungs that results in the uttering of the sentence 'The sky is blue'. \[...\] What will happen when Mary is released from her black and white room or is given a [color television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_television "Color television") monitor? Will she learn anything or not?<sup id="cite_ref-p130_2-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_dualism#cite_note-p130-2">[2]</a></sup>

Jackson continued:

> It seems just obvious that she will learn something about the world and our visual experience of it. But then it is inescapable that her previous knowledge was incomplete. But she had all the physical information. Ergo, there is more to have than that, and Physicalism is false.<sup id="cite_ref-p130_2-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_dualism#cite_note-p130-2">[2]</a></sup>

## Panpsychist property dualism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Property_dualism&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Panpsychist property dualism")\]

Panpsychism is the view that all matter has a mental aspect, or, alternatively, all objects have a unified center of experience or point of view. Superficially, it seems to be a form of property dualism, since it regards everything as having both mental and physical properties. However, some panpsychists say that mechanical behaviour is derived from the primitive mentality of atoms and molecules — as are sophisticated mentality and organic behaviour, the difference being attributed to the presence or absence of [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity "Complexity") structure in a compound object. So long as the _reduction_ of non-mental properties to mental ones is in place, panpsychism is not strictly a form of property dualism; otherwise it is.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2019)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

[David Chalmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chalmers "David Chalmers") has expressed sympathy for panpsychism (or at least for a modified variant, called panprotopsychism) as a possible resolution to the [hard problem of consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness "Hard problem of consciousness"), though he regards the [combination problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_problem "Combination problem") as an important obstacle for the theory.<sup id="cite_ref-Chalmers-caipin_3-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_dualism#cite_note-Chalmers-caipin-3">[3]</a></sup> Other philosophers who have taken interest in the view include [Thomas Nagel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Nagel "Thomas Nagel"),<sup id="cite_ref-sep-panpsych_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_dualism#cite_note-sep-panpsych-4">[4]</a></sup> [Galen Strawson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen_Strawson "Galen Strawson"),<sup id="cite_ref-sep-panpsych_4-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_dualism#cite_note-sep-panpsych-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-strawson_5-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_dualism#cite_note-strawson-5">[5]</a></sup> [Timothy Sprigge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Sprigge "Timothy Sprigge"),<sup id="cite_ref-sep-panpsych_4-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_dualism#cite_note-sep-panpsych-4">[4]</a></sup> [William Seager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Seager_(philosopher) "William Seager (philosopher)"),<sup id="cite_ref-seager2006_6-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_dualism#cite_note-seager2006-6">[6]</a></sup> and [Philip Goff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Goff_(philosopher) "Philip Goff (philosopher)").<sup id="cite_ref-pn-goff_7-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_dualism#cite_note-pn-goff-7">[7]</a></sup>

## Subjective idealism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Property_dualism&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Subjective idealism")\]

[Subjective idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_idealism "Subjective idealism"), proposed in the eighteenth century by [George Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Berkeley "George Berkeley"), is an ontic doctrine that directly opposes [materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism "Materialism") or [physicalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism "Physicalism"). It does not admit ontic property dualism, but does admit epistemic property dualism. It is rarely advocated by philosophers nowadays.

## Other proponents\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Property_dualism&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Other proponents")\]

### Saul Kripke\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Property_dualism&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Saul Kripke")\]

Kripke has a well-known argument for some kind of property dualism. Using the concept of [rigid designators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_designator "Rigid designator"), he states that if dualism is [logically possible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_possibility "Logical possibility"), then it is the case.

> Let 'Descartes' be a name, or rigid designator, of a certain person, and let 'B' be a rigid designator of his body. Then if Descartes were indeed [identical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(philosophy) "Identity (philosophy)") to B, the supposed identity, being an identity between two rigid designators, would be [necessary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessary_(logic) "Necessary (logic)").
