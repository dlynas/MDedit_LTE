Thing is, people were told Biden is the lesser of two evils in 2020 and many voted for him only to get what they see as Genocide Joe. They are tired of playing this game. Why should they vote for those who only consider their voices meaningful 1 day every 4 years?

I’ve had the same conversations with all my Muslims friends and family members over Thanksgiving. Not a single one says they will vote for Biden again, having voted for him in 2020. Every single one says it’s because of Gaza. Dems need to understand that the anger is very real. x.com/shadihamid/sta…



Voters have a right to vote and not vote. Candidates have a responsibility to earn those votes. If Trump convinces more people to vote for him than Biden, that's on Biden. Putting that responsibility on the most marginalized communities just incentivizes shittier candidates.

People can vote for whoever they choose. Or not vote. But choices have consequences, and it's ok to talk about what those might be. What do you think would be happening now if Trump were president? He was Bibi's best pal.

I guess you guys can start planning your trips back to your former countries, Trump has plans for you.

Because the other alternative is much worse. Really can’t you just get that?

He is the lesser of two evils, and that’s the frightening part.

I’m sorry that you’re tired of “playing the game.” No worries, though, because Trump and the GOP will make sure you don’t get to play anymore.

100% understandable. Still gonna suck when Trump wins though.

If Biden loses the election, it will definitely be because of how his administration handled this massacre Israel is committing in Gaza. He has supported them in every way possible despite the massive civilian deaths especially of women & children (70%)

Simply put, their choices are bad but still must choose.

Okay I guess

Oh dear 

“People were told” . . . Nice use of the passive voice there.

I am glad this is not my issue to grapple with.

What choice do you really have when everyone is the same and have the same allegiances? Choice is an illusion.

Yep. Not a fucking chance I accept that devils bargain again.

It's not just Arabs and Muslims who will refuse to vote for Genocide Joe. There are hundreds of thousands of us married to Arabs, had a Muslim roommate, worked with Palestinians. We will never vote for that man.

America needs a third options
