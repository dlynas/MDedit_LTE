the gender critical movement has been very successful at taking trans inclusion out of a human rights framework and getting people to instead think of it as a matter of, like… metaphysics



they present trans people’s claim to full social and legal inclusion as depending on prior facts about what their gender REALLY is. It is not!

Quote

In Gender Wars Kathleen Stock says the intense controversy is ultimately whether trans women are women, and I do not think that’s true! It’s about 1) how trans people exist in society, 2) state regulation they’re subject to, and 3) how it is acceptable to treat them

The human right against discrimination gives people a claim against facially neutral policies and systems that nevertheless particularly disadvantage them in virtue of some personal status. You cannot avoid it by saying “it’s based on sex and humans can’t change sex.”

That would particularly disadvantage trans people! That means it’s only justified if there’s no viable non-discriminatory way to meet some legitimate aim! They cannot meet this standard at all

Average intuitions about social categories are inherently conservative, because most people ofc conceptualize a given social category according to its actual past and present mainstream regimentation

Society isn’t fully trans inclusive so it’s typical for people to understand “man” and “woman” in ways that are not fully trans inclusive. (Also not fully trans exclusionary—ex. early mass media coverage unhesitatingly describing people like Christine Jorgensen as women)

By framing trans people’s claim to full inclusion as contingent on prior facts about whether they are REALLY their lived gender, anti-trans campaigners can in effect reject full trans inclusion on the grounds that it doesn’t already exist, hidden by a lil trick of social terms.

Yet it seems to me that the metaphysical challenge can be met. There is an important metaphysical sense in which trans women are women and trans men are men.

Define trans inclusion in terms of human rights?

"like… metaphysics" Not quite. Trans movement is like cosplay.  Everyone is allowed to play it. Just keep your slang inside your game, don't use it in public places, don't ask the others to use your slang that redefines the meaning of words.

Totally agree it’s not about metaphysics. But “trans women are women” sounds a lot like metaphysics. Do you think in retrospect it was a mistake for the trans rights movement to go all in on that slogan? This tweet suggests you do but I may have misinterpreted.

working an article about this point now! think you said it much better then I’ll end up doing but oh well

Yeah it's a dehumanisation tactic.

It reminds me of the right's pushback to Jewish assertions that abortion restrictions violate their religious liberty: unless you're Orthodox (they say), you don't \*really\* have to follow the religious rules. ie: you can't have your rights violated, because you're not REAL Jews.

Yes, and this goes back to the '70s origins

1\. There's some inherent lack of clarity in '2nd wave', radical feminism, which prompts the issues with trans inclusion Germaine Greer's whole deal is that women are not allowed to be who they really are, but she doesn't describe what women \*really\* are, except separate from men

"Rights" kind of dives head-first into metaphysics anyway.

I wonder how many of the members of that movement would take issue with someone saying “First we need to determine whether an undocumented immigrant’s asylum claim is valid before we can say whether it’s bad to deny them medical care.”

I knew there was something about the whole gender critical thing that irked me (subordinate to the major thing that more than irks me) and I now realize it’s definitely that it’s not called like “persistent gender metaphysics” or something

Common dynamic with hate movements. Also Murray's shtick with respect to black people. Step one is "this theoretical issue has no bearing on ethical issues of treatment", step two is "however ethical treatment of this minority is irrational, given the theoretical issues raised"

They've made it all about bad faith thought experiments. Like using the trolley problem to close down the rail network.

Many gender conservatives are actually quite contemptuous of human rights, when they realize it implicates them as violators re: trans people. Gender is an element of expression/speech in addition to being explicitly recognised by the UN as a right.
