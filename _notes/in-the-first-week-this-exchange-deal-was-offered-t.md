## In the first week, this exchange deal was offered to Israel. Everyone for everyone. 7 weeks of carpet bombing and 15,000 Palestinians dead later, Israel finally agreed. No increase in their negotiating leverage and not a single hostage found - though 60 were killed in Israelâ€™s bombing. 

This exchange could have happened week 1. 
Moreover, without dismantling Zionist settler colonizarion, apartheid, and occupation, Israel can re arrest all of the released Palestinians ans more.

"How do you think these releases of prisoners
are being received by Palestinians?
I think as all Palestinians who are living under a captivity
because of an ongoing occupation for 56 years,
apartheid and 75 years of settler colonialism,
it's a bit of relief, but will not be lasting.
Despite the fact that they are released back into
Palestinian society because Israel remains
the single authority and sovereign
from the river to the sea
and rules by military dictate
and racist apartheid regime,
any of these Palestinians and much more
can be re-arrested for being on the wrong side of the street,
driving on a segregated road,
digging beneath the ground for water to deeply,
for going to pray in Jerusalem
without a military permit.
So all of this is within a context.
I also want to highlight because of context
to the audience that Israel could have achieved
this release, this exchange,
precise exchange in the first week of its onslaught
against the Palestinians besieged in the Gaza Strip,
it could have achieved it right before the ground invasion
on October 27th, it could have achieved it
before the gutting and the incursion of the Ashipa Hospital.
So as we continue to talk about these exchanges,
let's ask ourselves,
why aren't we insisting on political negotiations?
We know that a military solution is not possible
and we know that Israel's campaign against Palestinians,
that they say is targeting Hamas
but is actually collective punishment
is not enhancing their negotiating leverage
as this could have been achieved in the first week.
And so we must also remember that there needs to be
accountability at this point
and the fate of those Palestinians,
now some 15,000 who have been killed,
who can never be brought back to life
as a result of the lack of accountability
that Israel has been afforded."
