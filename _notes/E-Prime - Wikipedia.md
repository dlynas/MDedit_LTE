**E-Prime** (short for **English-Prime** or **English Prime**,<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> sometimes **É** or **E′**) denotes a [restricted form](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_writing "Constrained writing") of English in which authors avoid all forms of the verb _[to be](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(linguistics)#English "Copula (linguistics)")_.

E-Prime excludes forms such as _be_, _being_, _been_, [present tense forms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_tense "Present tense") (_am_, _is_, _are_), [past tense forms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_tense "Past tense") (_was_, _were_) along with their negative contractions (_isn't_, _aren't_, _wasn't_, _weren't_), and nonstandard contractions such as _ain't_. E-Prime also excludes [contractions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_(grammar) "Contraction (grammar)") such as _I'm_, _we're_, _you're_, _he's_, _she's_, _it's_, _they're_, _there's_, _here's_, _where's_, _when's_, _why's_, _how's_, _who's_, _what's_, and _that's_.

## History [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=E-Prime&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")

D. David Bourland Jr., who had studied under [Alfred Korzybski](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski "Alfred Korzybski"), devised E-Prime as an addition to Korzybski's [general semantics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_semantics "General semantics") in the late 1940s.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Bourland published the concept in a 1965 essay entitled "A Linguistic Note: Writing in E-Prime" (originally published in _General Semantics Bulletin_). The essay quickly generated controversy within the general semantics field,<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> partly because practitioners of general semantics sometimes saw Bourland as attacking the verb '_to be_' as such, and not just certain usages.

Bourland collected and published three volumes of essays in support of his innovation. The first (1991), co-edited by Paul Dennithorne Johnston, bore the title: _To Be or Not: An E-Prime Anthology_.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> For the second, _More E-Prime: To Be or Not II_, published in 1994, he added a third editor, Jeremy Klein. Bourland and Johnston then edited a third book, _E-Prime III: a third anthology_, published in 1997.

## Functions of "to be" [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=E-Prime&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Functions of "to be"")

In English, the verb 'to be' (also known as the _[copula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(linguistics) "Copula (linguistics)")_) has several distinct functions:

-   [identity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(philosophy) "Identity (philosophy)"): _noun-phrase copula definite-noun_
    -   _The cat is my only pet._
-   [class membership](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(philosophy) "Class (philosophy)"): _definite-noun copula noun-phrase_
    -   _Garfield is a cat._
-   [class inclusion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(philosophy) "Class (philosophy)"): _noun-phrase copula noun-phrase_
    -   _A cat is an animal._
-   [predication](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_(grammar) "Predicate (grammar)"): _noun-phrase copula adjective_
    -   _The cat is furry._
-   [ownership](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possessive "Possessive"): _noun-phrase copula possessive-noun_
    -   _The cat is theirs._
-   [auxiliary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_verb "Auxiliary verb"): _noun-phrase copula verb-phrase_
    -   _The cat is sleeping._ – with the copula being part of the [progressive aspect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_and_progressive_aspects "Continuous and progressive aspects") with the [present participle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participle#Forms "Participle")
    -   _The cat is being bitten by the dog._ – with the copula being part of the [passive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_passive_voice "English passive voice") with the [past participle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participle#Forms "Participle") of a [transitive verb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_verb "Transitive verb")
-   [existence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence "Existence"): _medial-proadverb-of-location copula noun-phrase_
    -   _There is a cat._
-   [location](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location_(geography) "Location (geography)"): _noun-phrase copula location-phrase_
    -   _The cat is nowhere to be found._

Bourland sees specifically the "identity" and "predication" functions as pernicious but advocates the exclusion of all forms for the sake of simplicity. In the case of the "existence" form or the "location" form, terms such as _exist_, _sit_ or _lie_ could substitute for the copula.

Some [ergative verbs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergative_verb "Ergative verb") may substitute the copula, including _taste_, _feel_, _smell_, _sound_, _grow_, _hinge_, _remain_, _rest_, _stay_, _reside_, and _turn_, among others.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

## Examples [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=E-Prime&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Examples")

| Colloquial English |      | E-Prime |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
---

 |
| The electron is a particle. |   | The electron functions as a particle. |
| The electron is a wave. |   | The electron functions as a wave. |

One could rewrite the functions of "to be" as follows:

-   "The cat is my only pet": "I have only a pet cat".
-   "The cat is Garfield": "I call my cat Garfield".
-   "Garfield is a cat": "Garfield belongs to the cat species".
-   "A cat is an animal": "'Cat' denotes an animal".
-   "The cat is furry": "The cat feels furry" / "The cat looks furry" / "The cat has fur".
-   "The cat is sleeping": "The cat sleeps".
-   "The dog is chasing the cat": "The dog chases the cat".
-   "There is a cat": "A cat exists there".
-   "The cat is on the mat": "The cat sits on the mat".
-   "The cat is here": anything context-specific: "I see/hear/smell/sense/suspect (the presence of) the cat here"

## Rationale [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=E-Prime&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Rationale")

Bourland and other advocates also suggest that use of E-Prime leads to a less [dogmatic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogma "Dogma") style of language that reduces the possibility of misunderstanding or conflict.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-SS1_10-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime#cite_note-SS1-10">[10]</a></sup>

Kellogg and Bourland describe misuse of the verb _to be_ as creating a "deity mode of speech", allowing "even the most ignorant to transform their opinions magically into god-like pronouncements on the nature of things".<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

## Psychological effects [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=E-Prime&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Psychological effects")

While teaching at the [University of Florida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Florida "University of Florida"), [Alfred Korzybski](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski "Alfred Korzybski") counseled his students to

> eliminate the infinitive and verb forms of "to be" from their vocabulary, whereas a second group continued to use "I am," "You are," "They are" statements as usual. For example, instead of saying, "I am depressed," a student was asked to eliminate that emotionally primed verb and to say something else, such as, "I feel depressed when ..." or "I tend to make myself depressed about ..."<sup id="cite_ref-Ellis_2010_12-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime#cite_note-Ellis_2010-12">[12]</a></sup>

Korzybski observed improvement "of one full letter grade" by "students who did not generalize by using that infinitive".<sup id="cite_ref-Ellis_2010_12-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime#cite_note-Ellis_2010-12">[12]</a></sup>

[Albert Ellis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Ellis "Albert Ellis") advocated the use of E-Prime when discussing psychological distress to encourage framing these experiences as temporary (see also [Solution focused brief therapy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_focused_brief_therapy "Solution focused brief therapy")) and to encourage a sense of agency by specifying the subject of statements.<sup id="cite_ref-EllisFeeling2_13-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime#cite_note-EllisFeeling2-13">[13]</a></sup> According to Ellis, [rational emotive behavior therapy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy "Rational emotive behavior therapy") "has favored E-Prime more than any other form of psychotherapy and I think it is still the only form of therapy that has some of its main books written in E-Prime".<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> However, Ellis did not always use E-Prime because he believed it interferes with readability.<sup id="cite_ref-EllisFeeling2_13-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime#cite_note-EllisFeeling2-13">[13]</a></sup>

## Criticisms [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=E-Prime&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Criticisms")

Many authors have questioned E-Prime's effectiveness at improving readability and reducing prejudice (Lakoff, 1992; Murphy, 1992; Parkinson, 1992; Kenyon, 1992; French, 1992, 1993; Lohrey, 1993). These authors observed that communication under the copula ban can remain obscure and imply prejudice, while losing important [speech patterns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_pattern "Speech pattern"), such as identities and identification. Further, prejudices and judgments may become more difficult to notice or refute.

Various arguments against E-Prime (in the context of general semantics) have been conjectured:<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

-   "Effective writing techniques" are not relevant to general semantics as a discipline, and therefore it should not be promoted as general semantics practice. E-Prime does not distinguish statements that disobey the principles of general semantics from statements that do not. It lacks consistency with the other tenets of general semantics and should not be included into the discipline.
-   The advocates of E-Prime have not proven that it is easier to exclude the verb _to be_ than to eliminate only the "is" of identity and the "is" of predication. It may well be easier to do the latter for many people. _To be_ statements convey not only identity but also asymmetrical relations ("X heights more than Y"); negation ("A differs from B"); location ("Another castle contains the princess"); auxiliary ("He goes to the store") etc., forms that would also have to be excluded.
-   The elimination of a whole class of sentences results in fewer alternatives and is likely to make writing less, rather than more, interesting. One can improve bad writing more by reducing use of the verb 'to be' than by excluding it.
-   The context often ameliorates the possible harmful effects from the use of the "is" of identity and the "is" of predication, so it is not necessary to eliminate all such sentences. For example, "He is a judge" in response to a question about what someone does for a living would not be questionable, although "He works as a judge" would be an equivalent E-Prime sentence.
-   Excluding _to be_ has little effect on eliminating identity. For example, a statement of apparently equal identification, "The silly ban on copula continues," can be made without the copula assuming an identity rather than asserting it, consequently hampering our awareness of it.
-   Identity-in-the-language is not the same as the far more important identity-in-reaction (identification). General semantics cuts the link between the two through the practice of silence on the objective levels, adopting a self-reflexive attitude, e.g., "as I see it" "it seems to me" etc., and by the use of quotation marks—without using E-Prime. One of the best languages for [time-binding](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_semantics#Important_premises_in_general_semantics_theory "General semantics") is mathematics, which relies heavily on the notion of equivalence and equality. For the purposes of time-binding, it may be better to cut the link between identity-in-the-language and identity-in-reaction.

According to an article (written in E-Prime and advocating a role for E-Prime in [ESL and EFL](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_as_a_foreign_or_second_language "English as a foreign or second language") programs) published by the Office of English Language Programs of the [Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Educational_and_Cultural_Affairs "Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs") in the [State Department](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State "United States Department of State") of the United States, "Requiring students to avoid the verb to be on every assignment would deter students from developing other fundamental skills of fluent writing."<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>
