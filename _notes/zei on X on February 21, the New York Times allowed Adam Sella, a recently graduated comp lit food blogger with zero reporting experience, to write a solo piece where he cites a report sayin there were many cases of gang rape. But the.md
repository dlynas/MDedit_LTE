on February 21, the New York Times allowed Adam Sella, a recently graduated comp lit food blogger with zero reporting experience, to write a solo piece where he cites a "report" sayin there were "many cases of gang rape". But the report only mentions 3 which were already debunked

I have a question for

and the New York Times. In what world are 3 instances of claimed gang rape, all three of which have been debunked and which reference Adam Sella himself, evidence of "many instances of gang rape"? What the fuck are you doing here, exactly?

another question for

and the NYT: What happened to Yoni Saadon and his "girl with the face of an angel" from the Sunday Times and J Chronicle published weeks before your regurgitation of the "mass rape" hoax? You realized he was a bullshit artist, so you left him out

[

so Yoni Saadon, a deranged fantasist who claimed he saw "a girl with the face of an angel" being gang raped and then beheaded, destroying his testimony because no such case exists, was left out of the NYT by Adam Sella, but then he re-includes it months later via this "report"

[

Yoni Saadon was such a deranged fantasist that Adam Sella and his avowed genocidal uncle's wife Anat Schwartz didn't include him in their hoax, which they admitted they intentionally set out to fabricate because "it's important for Israeli propaganda"

Replying to @TalulaSha

Ynet asks the photographer of "the woman in the black dress" how @nytimes reached her. She explains the rationale of the Israeli journalists Adam Sella & Anat Schwartz: "They called me again and again and explained how important it is to Israeli hasbara." ynet.co.il/laisha/article

but then months later, the New York Times lets Adam Sella write up his own solo piece where suddenly Yoni Saadon comes back to life, except now he launders it via this "Israeli Crisis-Rape Center" report. And he hoped no one would notice. I noticed, Adam. You fucked up. Again.

as for the other two "testimonies" Adam Sella absurdly turned into "many cases of gang rape", the first is from known proven liar grifter Raz Cohen, who refused to speak to Gettleman, Sella and Schwartz in their pathetic "follow-up" damage control piece:

the second is from "Sapir", also a proven liar as detailed here: [x.com/maxblumenthal/](https://x.com/MaxBlumenthal/status/1740647278455525377). Now there is an interesting scoop Sella, Schwartz and Gettleman had in their follow-up. They said "Israeli officials" told them they found 3 severed women's heads. Any updates on that?

Replying to @MaxBlumenthal

A 24-year-old accountant only identified as "Sapir" is described by the NY Times as "one of the Israeli policeâ€™s key witnesses." Yet one of Sapir's key claims undermines the rest of her unbelievably lurid testimony. According to the Times, "she saw three other women raped and

[

now, no media elsewhere has reported on any women's severed heads being found. This follow-up piece to their hoax where Sella, Schwartz and Gettleman desperately tried to do some damage-control, is the only place where it is published. In the New York Times. Any updates at all?

[





](https://x.com/zei_squirrel)

there aren't any updates, because it's fucking bullshit. They made it up. "Israeli officials" is Anat Schwartz and Adam Sella's handlers telling them "yeah just write up bullshit about 3 heads being found to keep the Sapir bullshit up, who cares, no one will check." I checked

[

so the NYT let Adam Sella fabricate its biggest hoax since Judith Miller with his genocidal uncle's wife Anat Schwartz and Jeffrey "I don't do evidence, I do stories" Gettleman, then allowed him to launder it via a "report" citing his own hoax. Insane

if I told you that the New York Times hired a recently graduated college student with only a couple prior articles written on the subject of food and cooking to be their lead on the ground "reporter" on the "mass rape" hoax they fabricated, would you believe it? That's Adam Sella

[





](https://x.com/zei_squirrel)

in their hoax, Sella, Schwartz and Gettleman used as their primary sources known, proven frauds like Cohen, Sapir, Mendes and Zaka, but Yoni Saadon and his "girl with the face of an angel" snuff fantasy went too far for even them. Then Sella cites him months later. Holy shit

[

they think no one will do basic checking of what they're doing. This is the so-called "paper of record", the highest journalistic standards, peak of Western Investigative Reporting. And this is what they do, let a food blogger try to the most pathetic scumfuckery imaginable

[





](https://x.com/zei_squirrel)

again I repeat: Minimal journalistic integrity and ethics demands of the NYT that it immediately fires Adam Sella, Anat Schwartz and Jeffrey Gettleman for fabricating its biggest hoax since Judith Miller, they retract the hoax, and they profusely apologize for what they did.
