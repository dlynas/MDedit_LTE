From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Not to be confused with the [Sokol affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokol_affair "Sokol affair") involving the company Berkshire Hathaway.

The **Sokal affair**, also called the **Sokal hoax**,<sup id="cite_ref-hoax_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-hoax-1">[1]</a></sup> was a demonstrative [scholarly hoax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarly_publishing_sting "Scholarly publishing sting") performed by [Alan Sokal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Sokal "Alan Sokal"), a [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") professor at [New York University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University "New York University") and [University College London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London "University College London"). In 1996, Sokal submitted an article to _[Social Text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Text "Social Text")_, an academic journal of [cultural studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_studies "Cultural studies"). The submission was an experiment to test the journal's [intellectual rigor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigour#Intellectual_rigour "Rigour"), specifically to investigate whether "a leading North American journal of cultural studies—whose editorial collective includes such luminaries as [Fredric Jameson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Jameson "Fredric Jameson") and [Andrew Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ross_(sociologist) "Andrew Ross (sociologist)")—\[would\] publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions."<sup id="cite_ref-experiments_2-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-experiments-2">[2]</a></sup>

The article, "**Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative [Hermeneutics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics "Hermeneutics") of Quantum Gravity**",<sup id="cite_ref-Sokal_1994_3-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-Sokal_1994-3">[3]</a></sup> was published in the journal's spring/summer 1996 "[Science Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Wars "Science Wars")" issue. It proposed that [quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity "Quantum gravity") is a social and linguistic construct. The journal did not practice [academic peer review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarly_peer_review "Scholarly peer review") and it did not submit the article for outside expert review by a physicist.<sup id="cite_ref-Sokal_1994_3-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-Sokal_1994-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-MST_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-MST-4">[4]</a></sup> Three weeks after its publication in May 1996, Sokal revealed in the magazine _[Lingua Franca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_Franca_(magazine) "Lingua Franca (magazine)")_ that the article was a hoax.<sup id="cite_ref-experiments_2-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-experiments-2">[2]</a></sup>

The hoax caused controversy about the scholarly merit of commentary on the physical sciences by those in the humanities; the influence of [postmodern philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodern_philosophy "Postmodern philosophy") on social disciplines in general; and academic ethics, including whether Sokal was wrong to deceive the editors or readers of _Social Text_; and whether _Social Text_ had abided by proper scientific ethics.

In 2008, Sokal published _[Beyond the Hoax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_the_Hoax "Beyond the Hoax")_, which revisited the history of the hoax and discussed its lasting implications.

## Background\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sokal_affair&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Background")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Alan_Sokal.jpg/170px-Alan_Sokal.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Alan_Sokal.jpg)

Sokal in 2011

In an interview on the U.S. radio program _[All Things Considered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Things_Considered "All Things Considered")_, Sokal said he was inspired to submit the bogus article after reading _[Higher Superstition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Superstition "Higher Superstition")_ (1994), in which authors [Paul R. Gross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_R._Gross "Paul R. Gross") and [Norman Levitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Levitt "Norman Levitt") claim that some humanities journals will publish anything as long as it has "the proper leftist thought" and quoted (or was written by) well-known leftist thinkers.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-6">[a]</a></sup>

Gross and Levitt had been defenders of the philosophy of [scientific realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_realist "Scientific realist"), opposing postmodernist academics who questioned [scientific objectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science) "Objectivity (science)"). They asserted that [anti-intellectual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-intellectual "Anti-intellectual") sentiment in [liberal arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts "Liberal arts") departments (especially English departments) caused the increase of [deconstructionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconstruction "Deconstruction") thought, which eventually resulted in a deconstructionist critique of science. They saw the critique as a "repertoire of rationalizations" for avoiding the study of science.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-7">[6]</a></sup>

## Article\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sokal_affair&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Article")\]

Sokal reasoned that if the presumption of editorial laziness was correct, the nonsensical content of his article would be irrelevant to whether the editors would publish it. What would matter would be ideological obsequiousness, fawning references to deconstructionist writers, and sufficient quantities of the appropriate jargon. After the article was published and the hoax revealed, he wrote:

> The results of my little experiment demonstrate, at the very least, that some fashionable sectors of the American academic Left have been getting intellectually lazy. The editors of _Social Text_ liked my article because they liked its conclusion: that "the content and methodology of postmodern science provide powerful intellectual support for the progressive political project" \[sec. 6\]. They apparently felt no need to analyze the quality of the evidence, the cogency of the arguments, or even the relevance of the arguments to the purported conclusion.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-8">[7]</a></sup>

### Content of the article\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sokal_affair&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Content of the article")\]

"Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity"<sup id="cite_ref-Sokal_1994_3-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-Sokal_1994-3">[3]</a></sup> proposed that [quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity "Quantum gravity") has [progressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism "Progressivism") political implications, and that the "[morphogenetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenetic_field_(Rupert_Sheldrake) "Morphogenetic field (Rupert Sheldrake)")" could be a valid theory of quantum gravity. (A morphogenetic field is a concept adapted by [Rupert Sheldrake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Sheldrake "Rupert Sheldrake") in a way that Sokal characterized in the affair's aftermath as "a bizarre [New Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age "New Age") idea.")<sup id="cite_ref-experiments_2-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-experiments-2">[2]</a></sup> Sokal wrote that the concept of "an external world whose properties are independent of any individual human being" was "dogma imposed by the long post-Enlightenment hegemony over the Western intellectual outlook."

After referring skeptically to the "so-called scientific method", the article declared that "it is becoming increasingly apparent that physical 'reality'" is fundamentally "a social and linguistic construct." It went on to state that because scientific research is "inherently theory-laden and self-referential", it "cannot assert a privileged epistemological status with respect to counterhegemonic narratives emanating from dissident or marginalized communities", and that therefore a "liberatory science" and an "emancipatory mathematics", spurning "the elite caste canon of 'high science'", needed to be established for a "postmodern science \[that\] provide\[s\] powerful intellectual support for the progressive political project."

Moreover, the article's footnotes conflate academic terms with [sociopolitical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociopolitical "Sociopolitical") rhetoric, e.g.:

> Just as [liberal feminists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_feminist "Liberal feminist") are frequently content with a minimal agenda of legal and social equality for women and "[pro-choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-choice_(term) "Pro-choice (term)")", so liberal (and even some [socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist "Socialist")) mathematicians are often content to work within the hegemonic [Zermelo–Fraenkel framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_framework "Zermelo–Fraenkel framework") (which, reflecting its nineteenth-century liberal origins, already incorporates the axiom of equality) supplemented only by the [axiom of choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice "Axiom of choice").

### Publication\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sokal_affair&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Publication")\]

Sokal submitted the article to _Social Text_, whose editors were collecting articles for the "Science Wars" issue. "Transgressing the Boundaries" was notable as an article by a natural scientist; biologist [Ruth Hubbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Hubbard "Ruth Hubbard") also had an article in the issue.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-9">[8]</a></sup> Later, after Sokal revealed the hoax in _Lingua Franca_, _Social Text_'s editors wrote that they had requested editorial changes that Sokal refused to make,<sup id="cite_ref-MST_4-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-MST-4">[4]</a></sup> and had had concerns about the quality of the writing: "We requested him (a) to excise a good deal of the philosophical speculation and (b) to excise most of his footnotes."<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-10">[9]</a></sup> Still, despite calling Sokal a "difficult, uncooperative author", and noting that such writers were "well known to journal editors", based on Sokal's credentials _Social Text_ published the article in the May 1996 Spring/Summer "Science Wars" issue.<sup id="cite_ref-MST_4-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-MST-4">[4]</a></sup> The editors did not seek [peer review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarly_peer_review "Scholarly peer review") of the article by physicists or otherwise; they later defended this decision on the basis that _Social Text_ was a journal of open intellectual inquiry and the article was not offered as a contribution to physics.<sup id="cite_ref-MST_4-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-MST-4">[4]</a></sup>

## Responses\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sokal_affair&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Responses")\]

### Follow-up between Sokal and the editors\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sokal_affair&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Follow-up between Sokal and the editors")\]

In the May 1996 issue of _Lingua Franca_, in the article "A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies", Sokal revealed that "Transgressing the Boundaries" was a hoax and concluded that _Social Text_ "felt comfortable publishing an article on quantum physics without bothering to consult anyone knowledgeable in the subject" because of its ideological proclivities and editorial bias.<sup id="cite_ref-experiments_2-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-experiments-2">[2]</a></sup>

In their defense, _Social Text_'s editors said they believed that Sokal's essay "was the earnest attempt of a professional scientist to seek some kind of affirmation from postmodern philosophy for developments in his field" and that "its status as parody does not alter, substantially, our interest in the piece, itself, as a symptomatic document."<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-11">[10]</a></sup> Besides criticizing his writing style, _Social Text_'s editors accused Sokal of behaving unethically in deceiving them.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-12">[11]</a></sup>

Sokal said the editors' response demonstrated the problem that he sought to identify. _Social Text_, as an academic journal, published the article not because it was faithful, true, and accurate to its subject, but because an "academic authority" had written it and because of the appearance of the obscure writing. The editors said they considered it poorly written but published it because they felt Sokal was an academic seeking their intellectual affirmation. Sokal remarked:

> My goal isn't to defend science from the barbarian hordes of [lit crit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_criticism "Literary criticism") (we'll survive just fine, thank you), but to defend the Left from a trendy segment of itself. ... There are hundreds of important political and economic issues surrounding science and technology. Sociology of science, at its best, has done much to clarify these issues. But sloppy sociology, like sloppy science, is useless, or even counterproductive.<sup id="cite_ref-MST_4-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-MST-4">[4]</a></sup>

_Social Text'_s response revealed that none of the editors had suspected Sokal's piece was a parody. Instead, they speculated Sokal's admission "represented a change of heart, or a folding of his intellectual resolve." Sokal found further humor in the idea that the article's absurdity was hard to spot:

> In the second paragraph I declare without the slightest evidence or argument, that "physical 'reality' (note the [scare quotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scare_quotes "Scare quotes")) \[...\] is at bottom a social and linguistic construct." Not our _theories_ of physical reality, mind you, but the reality itself. Fair enough. Anyone who believes that the laws of physics are mere social conventions is invited to try transgressing those conventions from the windows of my apartment. I live on the twenty-first floor.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-13">[12]</a></sup>

### Book by Sokal and Bricmont\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sokal_affair&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Book by Sokal and Bricmont")\]

In 1997, Sokal and [Jean Bricmont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Bricmont "Jean Bricmont") co-wrote _[Impostures intellectuelles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostures_intellectuelles "Impostures intellectuelles")_ (US: _Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science_; UK: _Intellectual Impostures_, 1998).<sup id="cite_ref-EnglishPreface_14-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-EnglishPreface-14">[13]</a></sup> The book featured analysis of extracts from established [intellectuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual "Intellectual")' writings that Sokal and Bricmont claimed misused scientific terminology.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-15">[14]</a></sup> It closed with a critical summary of [postmodernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism "Postmodernism") and criticism of the [strong programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_programme "Strong programme") of [social constructionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructionism "Social constructionism") in the [sociology of scientific knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology_of_scientific_knowledge "Sociology of scientific knowledge").<sup id="cite_ref-Epstein97_16-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-Epstein97-16">[15]</a></sup>

In 2008, Sokal published a followup book, _[Beyond the Hoax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_the_Hoax "Beyond the Hoax")_, which revisited the history of the hoax and discussed its lasting implications.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-17">[16]</a></sup>

### Jacques Derrida\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sokal_affair&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Jacques Derrida")\]

The French philosopher [Jacques Derrida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Derrida "Jacques Derrida"), whose 1966 statement about [Einstein's theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity") was quoted in Sokal's paper, was singled out for criticism, particularly in U.S. newspaper coverage of the hoax.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_18-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-:1-18">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Derrida97_19-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-Derrida97-19">[18]</a></sup> One weekly magazine used two images of him, a photo and a [caricature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caricature "Caricature"), to illustrate a "dossier" on Sokal's paper.<sup id="cite_ref-Derrida97_19-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-Derrida97-19">[18]</a></sup> Arkady Plotnitsky commented:<sup id="cite_ref-:1_18-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-:1-18">[17]</a></sup>

> Even given Derrida's status as an icon of intellectual controversy on the Anglo-American cultural scene, it is remarkable that out of thousands of pages of Derrida's published works, a single extemporaneous remark on relativity made in 1966 (before Derrida was "the Derrida" and, in a certain sense, even before "deconstruction") ... is made to stand for nearly all of deconstructive or even postmodernist (not a term easily, if at all, applicable to Derrida) treatments of science.

Derrida later responded to the hoax in "_Sokal et Bricmont ne sont pas sérieux_" ("Sokal and Bricmont Aren't Serious"), first published on 20 November 1997 in _[Le Monde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Monde "Le Monde")_. He called Sokal's action "sad" for having trivialized Sokal's mathematical work and "ruining the chance to carefully examine controversies" about [scientific objectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Objectivity "Scientific Objectivity").<sup id="cite_ref-Derrida97_19-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-Derrida97-19">[18]</a></sup> Derrida then faulted him and Bricmont for what he considered "an act of intellectual [bad faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith "Bad faith")" in their follow-up book, _[Impostures intellectuelles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostures_intellectuelles "Impostures intellectuelles")_: they had published two articles almost simultaneously, one in English in _[The Times Literary Supplement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_Literary_Supplement "The Times Literary Supplement")_ on 17 October 1997<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-20">[19]</a></sup> and one in French in _[Libération](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lib%C3%A9ration "Libération")_ on 18–19 October 1997,<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-21">[20]</a></sup> but while the two articles were almost identical, they differed in how they treated Derrida.

The English-language article had a list of French intellectuals who were not included in Sokal's and Bricmont's book: "Such well-known thinkers as [Althusser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Althusser "Louis Althusser"), [Barthes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Barthes "Roland Barthes"), and [Foucault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault "Michel Foucault")—who, as readers of the TLS will be well aware, have always had their supporters and detractors on both sides of the Channel—appear in our book only in a minor role, as cheerleaders for the texts we criticize." The French-language list, however, included Derrida: "_Des penseurs célèbres tels qu'Althusser, Barthes, Derrida et Foucault sont essentiellement absents de notre livre_" ("Famous thinkers such as Althusser, Barthes, Derrida and Foucault are essentially absent from our book").

According to Brian Reilly, Derrida may also have been sensitive to another difference between the French and English versions of _Impostures intellectuelles_. In the French, his citation from the original hoax article is said to be an "isolated" instance of abuse,<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-22">[21]</a></sup> whereas the English text adds a parenthetical remark that Derrida's work contained "no systematic misuse (or indeed attention to) science."<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-23">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-24">[23]</a></sup> Sokal and Bricmont insisted that the difference between the articles was "banal."<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-25">[24]</a></sup> Nevertheless, Derrida concluded that Sokal was not serious in his method, but had used the spectacle of a "quick practical joke" to displace the scholarship Derrida believed the public deserved.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-26">[25]</a></sup>

### \[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sokal_affair&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Criticism of social sciences")\]

Sociologist Stephen Hilgartner, chairman of [Cornell University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University "Cornell University")'s [science and technology studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_studies "Science and technology studies") department, wrote "The Sokal Affair in Context" (1997),<sup id="cite_ref-auto_27-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-auto-27">[26]</a></sup> comparing Sokal's hoax to "Confirmational Response: Bias Among Social Work Journals" (1990), an article by William M. Epstein published in _[Science, Technology, & Human Values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_Technology,_%26_Human_Values "Science, Technology, & Human Values")_.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-28">[27]</a></sup> Epstein used a similar method to Sokal's, submitting fictitious articles to real academic journals to measure their response. Though much more systematic than Sokal's work, it received scant media attention. Hilgartner argued that the "asymmetric" effect of the successful Sokal hoax compared with Epstein's experiment cannot be attributed to its quality, but that "\[t\]hrough a mechanism that resembles confirmatory bias, audiences may apply less stringent standards of evidence and ethics to attacks on targets that they are predisposed to regard unfavorably."<sup id="cite_ref-auto_27-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-auto-27">[26]</a></sup> As a result, according to Hilgartner, though competent in terms of method, Epstein's experiment was largely muted by the more socially accepted [social work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_work "Social work") discipline he critiqued, while Sokal's attack on [cultural studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_studies "Cultural studies"), despite lacking experimental rigor, was accepted. Hilgartner also argued that Sokal's hoax reinforced the views of well-known pundits such as [George Will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Will "George Will") and [Rush Limbaugh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Limbaugh "Rush Limbaugh"), so that his opinions were amplified by media outlets predisposed to agree with his argument.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-29">[28]</a></sup>

The Sokal Affair extended from academia to the public press. [Anthropologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology "Anthropology") [Bruno Latour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Latour "Bruno Latour"), who was criticized in _Fashionable Nonsense_, described the scandal as a "tempest in a teacup." Retired [Northeastern University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_University "Northeastern University") [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician")\-turned social scientist Gabriel Stolzenberg wrote essays criticizing the statements of Sokal and his allies,<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-30">[29]</a></sup> arguing that they insufficiently grasped the philosophy they criticized, rendering their criticism meaningless. In _[Social Studies of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Studies_of_Science "Social Studies of Science")_, Bricmont and Sokal responded to Stolzenberg,<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-31">[30]</a></sup> denouncing his representations of their work and criticizing his commentary about the "[strong programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_programme "Strong programme")" of the sociology of science. Stolzenberg replied in the same issue that their critique and allegations of misrepresentation were based on misreadings. He advised readers to slowly and skeptically examine the arguments of each party, bearing in mind that "the obvious is sometimes the enemy of the true."<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-32">[31]</a></sup>

## Influence\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sokal_affair&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Influence")\]

### Sociological follow-up study\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sokal_affair&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Sociological follow-up study")\]

In 2009, Cornell sociologist [Robb Willer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robb_Willer "Robb Willer") performed an experiment in which undergraduate students read Sokal's paper and were told either that it was written by another student or that it was by a famous academic. He found that students who believed the paper's author was a high-status intellectual rated it better in quality and intelligibility.<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-33">[32]</a></sup>

### Sokal III\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sokal_affair&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Sokal III")\]

In October 2021, the scholarly journal _Higher Education Quarterly_ published a bogus article "authored" by "Sage Owens" and "Kal Avers-Lynde III". The initials stand for "Sokal III".<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-34">[33]</a></sup> The _Quarterly_ retracted the article.<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_note-35">[34]</a></sup>

1.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#cite_ref-6 "Jump up")** Sokal got the idea for his "experiment" after reading Paul R. Gross and Norman Levitt's _[Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#CITEREFGrossLevitt1994)_ (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994). Gross and Levitt argued that the success of getting published in postmodern journals was based not on the quality of the work but rather on its "academic leanings—papers displaying the proper leftist thought, especially if written by or quoting well known authors, were being published in spite of their low quality ([Demers 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair#CITEREFDemers2011), p. 15).
