	Marx also bunched land and capital into one category while not realizing that the (productive) capital is what brought us this quality of life while land is nothing but a leach to the economy. The negative effects of bad  land use are what he criticizes in this bundle while most socialistic countries fought capital and threw themselves into a downward spiral back to feudalism by that

The man who starts a business also created opportunity for other people, as shown by whole towns becoming poor if a factory moves away after employing half the town for decades.

			It absolutely does. Marx contradicts himself over and over and over throughout his works. Part of it is the fact that he changed and matured over his intellectual life. But part of it is that his theories of value were ultimately incoherent nonsense, albeit kind of intuitive if you didn’t have the hindsight of the concepts of marginal value.

	He’s literally not wrong, rent does fall as a share of gross income. It used to be easy for an American couple to retire on a single rental property. This was a major factor in the economy since many localities could be self-sustaining as a result. Increased value of tech and labor across society reduces the relative value of rent, which seems to rise in comparison to the bottom income brackets, consumer goods, etc, but falls in relation to the *income of the owners,* as Marx here notes, making rental ownership less and less lucrative over time. Self sustaining ruralities across the nation have been destroyed by AirBnB’s, since the cycle of renting until you can buy and mortgaging until you can afford a rental to retire on, has failed them en masse. Similarly, the constantly expanding suburbs are having large chunks constantly bought up by investment firms, which blindly treat land as a speculative commodity and subject it to all the value fluctuations that any other Capital may be subject to.(remember 08?) This does not rob land of its unique character, but rather implies that land isn’t unique in its uniqueness. All forms of capital have unique functions, that’s what differentiates them as forms. 

	You are ignoring the entire basis for Marx’s understanding of rent. He details his theory of rent in Volume 3 of capital. He doesn’t pose it as an eternal category. Rent is derived historically, as a differential form. Rent, as a surcharge for the land, rather than a general tribute, ie feudal tithes, is derived from certain land being more productively capable than other land, and in the first instance as a productive expense. It was not until large amounts of workers had no land to themselves that absolute rent could form as a minimum barrier to housing in the urban centers. How did they get there? Because as producers owning their own land, they could not hope to compete with the large farming firms being formed, so they sell to these companies, who then charge a differential rent to operate the farm as a waged manager of day laborers. This is only how he tracks the conversion from feudal land tax to differential rent in England, but the trends are demonstrative of how capital anywhere in the world functions *through* land in the face of farmers being priced out of production en masse. They are priced out as producers first, then large firms buy the land to rent out.

			You misunderstood my comment. The pdf’s of capital volume 3 are free online if you want to read his theory of differential rent. It probably won’t be easy to follow if you don’t read his work from LTV up to average profits and so on, but the theory speaks for itself.
			
			Can $4500 a month in San Fransisco cover the monthly expenses of a single property landlord? Or are the incomes which these rentals generate far more dominated by large investment firms? Obviously it is the latter, and this indicates a falling in value of the land, relative to the gross income of society, as the middle strata is forced to find other sources of income than rentals and themselves pay more and longer for personal rentals, although this increased payment does not offset the fall in value. It cannot offset the fall in value because this fall must coincide with, or rather *is,* a compensatory search for new revenue over and above what is increasingly lost through rent, etc.

					Exactly! Except it would be ludicrous to assume individuals from Ohio are buying single units to rent. They are investing in the firms which own the properties.
					
					I definitely worded that previously comment poorly, it isn’t strictly a dichotomy between single property landlords and big firms, but these terms are demonstrative of the trends with time.

								It's not a low bar at all. 40% single family homes in an area means a huge reduction in housing supply. Apartments are like at least 10x as dense. 40% of land being used for single family homes means a huge reduction in number of homes. If the homes were replaced with homes 10x as dense there'd be more than 50% more homes in total and 900% more on the previously single family zoned land.

In country villas, in the neighbourhood of some great town, it is sometimes a good deal higher, and the peculiar conveniency, or beauty of situation, is there frequently very highly paid for. Ground rents are generally highest in the capital, and in those particular parts of it, where there happens to be the greatest demand for houses, whatever be the reason for that demand, whether for trade and business, for pleasure and society, or for mere vanity and fashion.**” A tax on the rent of houses may either fall on the occupier, on the ground landlord, or on the building landlord.

			If I’m wrong, then interact with the point instead of dodging it. You’re just looking at the price of land, not it’s value or it’s proportion of net income. If the value of land relatively decreases, then increased homeownership supports my thesis, but that doesn’t mean speculative investors don’t drive up prices. Have you ever been on the market for a home?
			
			It’s not conspiratorial, the numbers you showed say that investor ownership of homes is a major factor, just not to the point of a literal monopoly. Your numbers also only look at single family homes.

					Again, you’re ignoring the argument of land value and focusing on housing prices. Idk how many times I have to say it. If you build more and better apartments, then housing value goes up, but the land is still land, and the value of all land put together is now less valuable in comparison to the value of all the buildings put together, which are both owned by people in different ways and paid for at different rates.

						Ok so you admit you literally don't get the thesis of Henry George which is that progress increases land value. What we see is valuable land gets more dense and there's a limit to density.

							I understand it, but it’s flawed, and I’m explaining why. Value is an abstraction that only has meaning in a subjective sense unless it’s tied to a determinate fact, immanent to its identity. This idea that value is immanent to land, having density and limit without defining the scale of their measurement, is meaningless. If you acknowledge labor to be the source of value, you understand the increase in home prices comes from the increasing accumulation of dead labor in the form of increasingly advanced technologies used in production and, more importantly, increasingly varied interactions and combinations of labor on the world market. Of this, ground rent forms a necessary constituent moment, but not the entirety of the determination. This moment can be logically traced. The opportunities of production, quality of housing and urban amenities, population density, etc, all have influence on rental price, but my explanation is that when an apartment building is built or a city has desirable traits for living or production, this is an empirical, social fact, not representative of greater “density” of the land. LA has higher rents for a whole complex of reasons, but value of land in the abstract stays the same, which means the value of technical means of production outpace it drastically, and even determine it in large part.

	I think Marx really only explains industrialisation when you read him. His "means of production" focal point ignores the fact that wealth throughout history was mostly concentrated on land ownership. Those who control the land in history controlled the wealth.

		Eh Marx definitely does touch on this. His interpretation of the rise of capitalism was the result of class struggle between the bourgeois (with the help of the proletariat actually) and the older noble/aristocratic land owning classes. Where he differed from George is that he thought that the economy was in the process of moving on from land, and that land was no longer the most relevant mean of production *in class struggle.* The working class has little control over land, but they do have control over their own labor. Likewise, the merchant classes accumulation of capital also granted them some access to land as well as enabling other means of production. 
		
		That's why he thought America was uniquely well suited for a communist revolution (which didn't age particularly well), since they skipped the feudal stage and went straight to a bourgeois state, and the closest thing they had (the slave plantations) were recently crushed in the civil war, so America was the most captalist at the time. In Marx's works, proletariat revolution was only possible in a bourgeois state, as in a feudal state the proletariat's class interest is actually in helping the bourgeois (though this line of thought was dropped by Lenin.)

	this is like saying his prediction about falling wages was wrong. doesnt matter very much for his critiques or the labor theory of value

	Like many market economists Marx completely missed the dependency of free markets on free speech -- why he botched the value of labor and came up with delusional theories.

	Employment at will is for most people their most important free market free trade.

	It requires free speech on economic issues.
