> You don't need any scientific theory to feel moral outrage at the consequences of capitalism. Socialists were doing that long before Marx and concocting morally ideal societies in response. But they didn't have an adequate scientific theory that explained why capitalism produces those consequences and its place in the historical development of society. The distinction between utopian and scientific socialism is analogous to pre-scientific and scientific medicine. Before the advent of scientific medicine, people's methods of removing ailments were ineffective. Similarly, successfully moving past capitalism requires understanding capitalism and such an understanding is provided by Marx. If Marx's critics are right, then his failure to solve the transformation problem crumbles the foundation of scientific socialism.

	* 🟨 **[MasCapital](https://www.reddit.com/user/MasCapital) (OP)** ⬆️ 8 _(2014-08-31 15:50:20)_

		There are a few different versions of the SSI. One of the most famous is Andrew Kliman and Alan Freeman's ["Temporal Single System Interpretation"](http://ge.tt/5fiCPus1/v/0?c) and in fact most objections to SSI focus on this particular version of it (Mohun, Mongiovi, Veneziani, Laibman all object to the TSSI). [Objections to this particular version](http://ge.tt/2QHXTus1/v/0) of SSI need not apply to other versions of SSI (also see Laibman's "Rhetoric and Substance in Value Theory: An Appraisal of the New Orthodox Marxism" which is a chapter of [this](http://ge.tt/2bo8vus1/v/0) book and contains a response by Kliman as well as many other great chapters). 
		
		All versions of SSI have in common that the inputs do not need to be transformed because the value of constant and variable capital is the value of a sum of money rather than the value of the means of production and labor-power bought with that sum. Objections to this particular claim can be separated into two kinds which I will call "interpretive" and "substantive". Interpretive objections have to do with whether or not Marx himself believed the central claim of the single system interpretation. These objections dispute whether the SSI is a correct interpretation *of Marx*. These objections point to passages of Marx where he seems to be saying that constant and variable capital are the values of means of production and labor power, even after dropping the assumption that all commodities exchange at their values. Substantive objections deal with the SSI on its own terms regardless of whether or not it is a correct interpretation of Marx. The main substantive objection that I've encountered is that there is a circularity in SSI. I bring it up in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/2degs1/question_about_a_potential_circularity_in_marxian/) post. I ultimately think the circularity is benign, the kind of circular causation that occurs in many places in nature. And as Moseley says, what is taken as given in the determination of the rate of profit is the *total* initial capital, not any individual prices of production which are determined by the rate of profit.

	>Since the amount of aggregate profit is equal to the amount of aggregate surplus value, these individual deviations of price of production from value cancel each other out. The total surplus value, which is completely determined by surplus labor, is simply redistributed so that each capitalist receives an amount of surplus value determined by the average rate of profit, rather than the actual amount of surplus value his own workers produced. ... You can see how the same amount of surplus value that goes unreceived by capitals of less-than-average organic composition (c/v) is received by capitals of greater-than-average organic composition. 

	Sooooo to simplify this to a ridiculous degree (I'm still a Marx noob), an example of this would be if, say, computers are overvalued, so a capitalist in a different industry, whose production process obviously involves computers, will see his profits fall below the general rate because he's paying so much for computers. But the computer capitalist will capture a profit that's greater than the general rate by the same amount (for obvious reasons). Am I getting that about right?

	And in the long run, won't the higher profits in computers lead to increased investment in computers, which will bring the rate of profit down, leading the other capitalist above to see his profits rise *back* to the general rate of profit since he can now buy cheaper computers?

	So in addition to deviations in rates of profits cancelling each other out in the immediate term, don't they also flatten out in the long run due to transfers of capital between industries? In other words aren't such deviations inherently temporary anyway?

		It sounds like you're (correctly!) describing the way the general rate of profit, and therefore prices of production, are formed. Assuming the free mobility of capital, if an industry is making more than the average rate (i.e. their sale price is greater than the average price of production), capital from other industries will flow there until the rate reduces to the average. The reverse happens in industries making less than the average rate - capital flows *out* of these industries into ones with a higher rate. Although industry rates are constantly fluctuating due *intra*industry competition, *inter*industry competition acts bring these rates back to their average. Marx discusses the different effects of these different forms of competition in a few places, e.g. in [*Theories of Surplus Value*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1863/theories-surplus-value/ch10.htm#sa5b):
		
		>What competition within the same sphere of production brings about, is the determination of the value of the commodity in a given sphere by the average labour-time required in it, i.e., the creation of the market-value.  What competition between the different spheres of production brings about is the creation of the same general rate of profit in the different spheres through the levelling out of the different market-values into market prices, which are [prices of production] that are different from the actual market-values.  Competition in this second instance by no means tends to assimilate the prices of the commodities to their values, but on the contrary, to reduce their values to [prices of production] that differ from these values, to abolish the differences between their values and [prices of production].

		>In other words aren't such deviations inherently temporary anyway?
		
		Yes, deviation in the general rate of profit are always temporary assuming free competition. Barriers to free competition like monopoly create more permanent deviations, although those companies *other* than the monopoly are still competing so *their* rates of profit are still constantly being equalized. But deviations of prices of production from values are a permanent feature of capitalism, inherent in its competition.

		[Fred Moseley](http://www.mtholyoke.edu/~fmoseley/Working_Papers_PDF/melt.pdf) has shown that the MELT in today's inconvertible credit money economy is quantitatively identical to Marx's own determination of the MELT in his inconvertible fiat money economy, namely MV/L, where M = the quantity of paper money forced into circulation, V = the velocity of money, and L = the total socially necessary labor time. In other words, the ratio of total money price of output to the total labor value of output. This is also the MELT used by many other SSI theorists like Kliman and Freeman.

		>My apologies if this comes off as stupid
		
		It's a great question! The most important conclusion to be drawn from Marx's solution to the transformation problem is that *all* price systems (other than value-equivalent prices, which don't exist under capitalism) are merely systems of surplus labor transfer. This opens up the possibility of an analysis of *global surplus value transfer*. People like Arghiri Emmanuel and Samir Amin have done a lot of interesting work here and the idea of global surplus value transfer is at the heart of Maoism-Third Worldism.

	This has improved my understanding of the transformation problem. Thankou. I summarised what I know about the transformation problem in the Communpedia article `[Transformation problem](http://en.communpedia.org/Transformation_problem)' a few months ago. There's nothing there about the single-system interpretation, but I did get in the Bortkiewicz-Sweezy solution, and some other stuff, and there are links there which people who are interested in this problem might find useful. Myself, I kind of like the solution by the Japanese Uno-school Marxist economist Makoto Itoh. I summarised it at the end of the Communpedia article. Thanks again for this post.

		That's called a rising organic composition of capital (OCC = c/v). Since there is less surplus labor/value to distribute, the rate of profit falls, which usually results in crises.
