## Seeing the cover of this, my first book, What It Takes To Heal, for the first time left me without the ‘right’ words to describe how I felt.  For so long it was a little secret, this thing I created in quiet rooms and corners of spaces that felt safe enough to unlock stories that until recently I hadn’t wanted to revisit.  In preparing to share this work, I’ve struggled to articulate my feelings. wondered ‘Is it good enough?’ ‘Is it what people need at this moment?’ Starting out I said that I wanted people to use the book as a resource as they identify their ‘healing home.’ But what I didn’t expect is that writing this book would help me move deeper into mine. 

There’s something spiritual, revelatory, and terrifying about feeling, especially when those feelings are tethered to dreams that have become reality. I have always wanted to write a book.  As a therapist and movement worker, books aid me in helping people unlock their emotions and access the types of healing that are necessary for them.  I beat back my own fear and endeavored to write this book because I believe nothing is more courageous than feeling. 

We’ve collectively lost so much and have experienced tremendous grief these past few years. But we’ve also dug deep, built new things, and transformed old things. We’ve found joy, strength, and curiosity during these, some of our hardest days. And it is my deepest hope that this book can be an accompaniment to those who are doing the work of shifting their internal conditions and the conditions of their communities to move closer to the healing, freedom, and safety we all deserve. 

What It Takes To Heal is now available for pre-order, and will be out officially on June 4, 2024. Thank you to my family and everyone who has supported me on this journey, including my agent, editors at @penguinrandomhouse, and my staff. I’m beyond grateful to my team at @TheEmbodimentInstitute. And to my comrades, to everyone who is and has been a part of removing the stigma from feeling–making it something that is to be honored and not avoided— I say thank you.

I can’t wait to experience this next season of my work with you all.
