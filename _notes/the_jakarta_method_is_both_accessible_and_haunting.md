## The Jakarta Method is both Accessible and Haunting

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m0lec1/the_jakarta_method_is_both_accessible_and_haunting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m0lec1/the_jakarta_method_is_both_accessible_and_haunting/)

> This is the most clear, easy-to-understand book I've read yet about the awful behaviors that the US had in the third world during the Cold War. The book starts off very basic, but as one progresses, the sheer amount of detail presented about everything from our destabilization of Latin American countries to our blatant support of mass killings in Indonesia is remarkably well organized.
> 
> It's a rather new release, coming out only last year. but Vincent Bevins has worked as a journalist in southeast Asia and Brazil and has had first-hand interviews with some of the victims of various left-leaning purges. He's able to pull off much of the shame that lingers in elderly victims of these horrific events as they reaccount their experiences navigating the deep anticommunist influence of the US and UK, from the effects of Americanized globalization to brutal physical and sexual assaults carried out by men during the harshest part of Brazil and Indonesia's military dictatorships. 
> 
> Gosh, this is a must read. I don't think I've read a non-fiction title this gripping since Rosling's Factfulness.

		This book is on deck for me after I'm finished with my current one! Glad to see a rec for it out in the wild.

			I just finished Divide and am now on chapter 3 of Jakarta. Wow. These books!!!! 
			I could NOT put Divide down. Hope you like it!

			* 🟦 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 5 _(2021-03-11 14:43:08)_

				Ha, I'm on chapter 3 of The Divide.
				
				If you're looking for other similarly themed books, I can recommend pretty much anything by Stephen Kinzer, Michael Parenti, Mike Davis, Vijay Prashad and Walter Rodney.
				
				Happy to go into more detail about anything. Happy reading!

					I’m always looking for similarly themed books hah. And details/specific books are always welcomed, otherwise I’ll just check out whichever books the library has by these authors. 
					Thanks!

	I've watched like 12 interviews with Vincent Bevins talking about the book, he usually tells the same story but it never files to rile me up. Haven't actually read it yet though

	Thanks for the recommendation. As an Indonesian, this seems very relevant book to me. I've added this one to my TBR.

	I've read the intro to the book (Google Play sample) and the "Crush the communist" cry is definitely very Indonesian. Basically everything *they* (who?) don't like is labeled as "communist" even if it doesn't make sense.

	There's an excellent interview with the author on the podcast TrueAnon!

	I haven't finished it yet, but I thought the part about how they made a porno film with a fake Indonesian President (they used a hispanic stand in iirc) was hilarious.

		Sukarno's real life dalliances make using a fake Indonesian leader superfluous.

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 7 _(2021-03-08 19:06:22)_

	This is one of my favorite reads in 2020 (and I read 70 books).

	Highly recommended for all the reasons OP lists. It's extremely accessible for the beginner on the subject of US imperialism and anti-Communism, while also providing a fresh look at some of its sins even for those who are well-studied on the topic.

	Bevins just began writing a second book iirc from his social media.

* 🟩 **[rendyanthony](https://www.reddit.com/user/rendyanthony)** ⬆️ 6 _(2021-03-30 05:29:28)_

	I finished the book last week. Thank you so much for recommending this book. As someone who grew up in Jakarta, it's really interesting to read Indonesian history from a global perspective. It nicely fills in the what's missing from learning Indonesian history in school.

		Aaah, I'm so glad to hear that!

	He's great. I have Matt Karp's This Vast Southern Empire on my reading list to get more on Latin America.

		Oh? I’ve never heard of it. Does it focus on a specific Latin American country, or as a whole?
