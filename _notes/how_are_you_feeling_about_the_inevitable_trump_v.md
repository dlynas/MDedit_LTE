	Annoyed. As someone recently said for my Gen X generation... in the 90s the presidents were our parents age.

	And ever since then the presidents are *still* our parents age.

	The boomer generation really needs to give up the reign they hold so tightly.

	Edit: yes Biden is from the Silent Generation, but that's not the point. The point is the parents of Gen X have held power for over 30 years. Time for a serious change. We need term limits and age limits and the young to vote!

				Millennials outnumber Boomers and the gap grows every day as Boomers die off. The trick is to get them to vote in large numbers.

			It's with noting that Presidents get the best healthcare available, so accidents or diseases that might kill an average person won't necessarily pose much of a threat to the President. Not because they're superhuman or anything, just because everyone involved recognizes that their health is a national security concern.

				Bill Clinton’s impeachment showed us that the Commander in Chief of the US military is not, in fact, a member of the military themself. When Clinton was impeached, his marital infidelity was brought up by people wanting him gone since marital infidelity is an actual crime for people in the military. He successfully argued those laws didn’t apply to him and that he was not a member of the military.

If the people want a candidate to be in office, then they should be in office. That should be how it works. Competent and qualified people should be in charge and there shouldn't be arbitrary restrictions stopping them.
					
					AND YET, we're so so often seeing cases where people to absolutely are not in the slightest bit competent or qualified to be in office and yet people keep voting for them anyway because..........they sound good on TV I guess? I don't know. I hate it here. I want off this ride.

				it depends on exactly when. if one of them died now (let’s say trump), it would most likely be nikki haley (or less likely, vivek). there would definitely be a new primary since it was just last night. 
				
				if it was biden, it would most likely be kamala, but the primaries would most likely be redone. if it was RIGHT BEFORE the election, it would be the VPs.
				
				if it was AFTER the election, it would then be the VP and then the new president would choose the new VP.

		The United States was not built to have one, and it wasn't supposed to have one.  Its governmental efficacy essentially hinges on a lack of a party system, and the founders cautioned against it strongly.  It took over a century and a half to put into law that you should really only get to be president twice, because before, that's just the moral precedent Washington set and everyone was cool with it.  After the civil war, there really should have been a party-related amendment that functioned in some form of the same way.  It is now almost certainly too late for that.

				An acquaintance of mine is a State Senator who cosponsored an analogous statewide bill early on. He's a staunch Dem, party faithful. He's all about it though, because as he puts it, "the two party system naturally results in extremists, and we need reasonable people who can find compromises."

	It's like you've already seen the ending of Game of Thrones and hated it but someone strapped you to a chair with your eyelids taped back making you watch it again

* 🟩 **[FlimsyComment8781](https://www.reddit.com/user/FlimsyComment8781)** ⬆️ 214 _(2024-03-06 07:28:51)_

	Social media broke America.

* 🟩 **[saberwielders](https://www.reddit.com/user/saberwielders)** ⬆️ 281 _(2024-03-05 23:30:22)_

	330 million people in this country and we narrowed it down to these two?

* 🟩 **[Heatherina134](https://www.reddit.com/user/Heatherina134)** ⬆️ 292 _(2024-03-05 22:42:19)_

	Already tired and afraid.

	Can’t believe those two are the best America has to offer. WTF. Shit needs to change.

		Nah the best America has to offer stay out of politics because they know how vile it is

			This exactly. No sane qualified person would ever want to be in public office because of the giant magnifying glass this country jams up their ass as soon as we learn their names.
			
			Anyone who actually wants that kind of role is most likely the kind of person that should never have it.

				Seems an appropriate place for the Douglas Adams quote:  
				
				
				"It is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it... anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job."

		I think the same thing all the time. Out of all the people in America we can't find someone under the age of 75 that is well educated and well rounded? This country is fucking huge and full of potential. It blows my mind.

			It is not about personality or competence. It is about who you know and your position in the game that is politics.

	One star- does not recommend.

* 🟩 **[VLC31](https://www.reddit.com/user/VLC31)** ⬆️ 175 _(2024-03-06 01:36:06)_

	For the life of me I can’t understand why the Democrats didn’t start bringing along someone younger, as soon as they won the last election. They had to know age was going to be an issue.

* 🟩 **[Jimmybelltown](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jimmybelltown)** ⬆️ 706 _(2024-03-05 23:19:20)_

	Over it. I want a Gen X president.

		Hell, millennials are eligible for presidency now.

	This is the Godfather Part III of elections. Hoping once again for a giant meteor.

	I don't vote for people, I vote for policies ...and none of the policies I vote for involve being a dictator.

		It's funny how often people talk about being a single issue voter, because I can't really imagine anything being more important than this.
