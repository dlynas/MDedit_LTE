## James Baldwin, in the 80s, on incrementalism: «I was born here almost 60 years ago. I'm not going to live another 60 years. You always told me that it takes time: it has taken my father's time, my mother's time, my uncle's time [...] How much time do you want for your progress?»

	Full transcription of the fragment:

	>What is you want me to reconcile myself to? I was born here almost 60 years ago. I'm not going to live another 60 years. You always told me that it takes time: it has taken my father's time, my mother's time, my uncle's time, my brother's and my sister's time, my niece's and nephew's time. How much time do you want for your progress?

	The video is part of the 1989 American Masters documentary, "James Baldwin: The Price of the Ticket".

	Also, in case it comes handy for someone, here is an [image quote](https://i.redd.it/nqec37t3mge31.png) of this fragment ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuotesPorn/comments/clyc2a/what_is_it_you_want_me_to_reconcile_myself_to_i/)).

			"From Aug. 11 to 16, blacks long frustrated by their lot and angered by a controversial **police arrest** wreaked havoc on their community."  This riot had a different catalyst compared to the riot posted by cyberstorm

	* 🟨 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 2 _(2020-06-20 19:05:24)_

		The recommendations in that report are awful

	* 🟨 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 5 _(2020-06-20 14:55:55)_

		Genuine question.  When was the most recent race riot in the US?  Not a riot about excessive police force, but a riot fueled entirely on civilian race relations

			Do you have a point to make about police and race? Or do you just want to co-opt this thread by distracting everyone from Baldwin's point?

			* 🟦 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 0 _(2020-06-22 19:01:40)_

				Are you distracted?  Understand what you’re talking about first, before making blind comparisons to the type of progress Baldwin is referring to- would be my point

				* 🟪 **[Opening_Doors](https://www.reddit.com/user/Opening_Doors)** ⬆️ 0 _(2020-06-23 17:17:28)_

					So, no, you don't have a point to make. Trolling isn't an argument.

					* 🟥 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 0 _(2020-06-23 20:01:20)_

						understanding what your writing about, and why your writing it, is pretty important.  Especially when you're dealing with a topic like this.  I'm not trying to argue, people asked questions and I answered

		* 🟧 **[cyberst0rm](https://www.reddit.com/user/cyberst0rm)** ⬆️ 11 _(2020-06-20 16:16:37)_

			That was Minneapolis.
			
			Are you confused?

			* 🟦 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 4 _(2020-06-20 16:26:42)_

				Minneapolis riots were instigated by police brutality from the MPD.  The riot you cited earlier was civilian based.  Are you confused?  Genuine question

				* 🟪 **[anxiousrobocop](https://www.reddit.com/user/anxiousrobocop)** ⬆️ 24 _(2020-06-20 16:29:31)_

					I think the confusion comes from the fact that the only race riots that weren't caused by police were ones where white women accused black men of rape and white people rioted.

					* 🟥 **[ArrogantWorlock](https://www.reddit.com/user/ArrogantWorlock)** ⬆️ 7 _(2020-06-20 19:03:46)_

						The 1919 race riot mentioned in this comment thread wasn't because of that but because white mobs drowned a black teenager who accidentally crossed the invisible line to the "white beach".

					* 🟥 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 2 _(2020-06-20 16:56:30)_

						is that different from today's riots?

					* 🟥 **[cyberst0rm](https://www.reddit.com/user/cyberst0rm)** ⬆️ 5 _(2020-06-20 16:33:12)_

						Why do you think a police officer is not a civilian?

						* 🟫 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 13 _(2020-06-20 16:47:26)_

							2 reasons:
							
							1)From Wikipedia, In general, a **civilian** is "a person who is **not** a member of the [**police**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police), the [armed forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military), or a [fire department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_department)".
							
							2)By "civilian" I mean "non cop."  the riots you posted were instigated by people who were not police.  the riots in minneapolis were started **because** of the police.
							
							lets not get into semantics, they're just a distraction from the real conversation.  unless you genuinely are confused

						* 🟫 **[iamsomelurker](https://www.reddit.com/user/iamsomelurker)** ⬆️ 12 _(2020-06-20 16:47:34)_

							Because being a police officer is a class in itself. Police officers in a capitalist society definitely aren't viewed as civilians.

			I think the 1967 Detroit riot.

				* 🟪 **[AeonsOfStrife](https://www.reddit.com/user/AeonsOfStrife)** ⬆️ 3 _(2020-06-20 16:15:29)_

					But it was not itself a response to police brutality, I think is what they were asking.

		* 🟧 **[details_matter](https://www.reddit.com/user/details_matter)** ⬆️ 0 _(2020-06-20 23:05:36)_

			Strictly speaking, police are civilians. They are not military units, but rather (at least nominally) public servants. So that would be whatever the most recent incendiary high profile police brutality story is agitating at this moment. I've lost track. There are so many.

		Their vision of progress is a like logarithmic function - it always looks like it's going toward something you want, but it will never get there.

* 🟩 **[rillip](https://www.reddit.com/user/rillip)** ⬆️ 28 _(2020-06-20 16:55:57)_

	The thing about incrementalism is it tries to take credit for something that occurs naturally and in doing so, either intentionally or unintentionally, actually stifles that process. In western culture we have had positive incremental change for centuries now. That is very true. But there were many key moments of great upheaval and individual strife that contributed to that. Incrementalists want us to ignore those moments. They want us to see those moments as not instrumental. As problematic aberrations, rather than the breaking points they are.

	Malcolm X was right imo.

	* 🟨 **[SirSaltie](https://www.reddit.com/user/SirSaltie)** ⬆️ 21 _(2020-06-20 16:25:23)_

		Late Malcolm was basically a Marxist. It should come as no surprise that his teachings ring so powerfully with socialists.

	I dont usually share my writing.  I have not been met with like-minded people very often. But this is a very simple poem written some time ago. Jotted into a journal.  I share it now.  Its nothing fancy. ... here goes..

	I always loved having a chance

	To read your words 

	Little southern "white" girl

	Little school. 

	Little  country dot on the map.

	I didn't care for Robert Frost

	Or Dickenson.

	I had read that

	I was not drawn into that

	At all.

	I remember seeing your face

	And those eyes 

	Not a stoic face

	But as serious as you looked, 

	I felt you would accept 

	Arms

	Around you

	In thanks

	For a genuine voice.

	For realism 

	And the natural discourse 

	And disclosures. 

	Finding your words 

	on my own

	so young

	and sitting in fascination 

	and knowing 

	that all those words

	  came from your eyes.

	And the eyes are portals into the soul.

	Soul....

	Soul...

	Soul?

	Soul music?

	My mother loved soul music.

	She was better then.

	Tiny kitchen. 

	Her pots and pans.

	Her magic.

	And her modest little place in life.

	Baldwin.

	If I ever grow up

	to be somebody, 

	the little girl still asks, 

	"Can I really be?

	Somebody?"

	...

	.

	..
