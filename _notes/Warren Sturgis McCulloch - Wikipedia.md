**Warren Sturgis McCulloch** (November 16, 1898 – September 24, 1969) was an American neurophysiologist and cybernetician, known for his work on the foundation for certain brain theories and his contribution to the [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics "Cybernetics") movement.<sup id="cite_ref-KA04_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch#cite_note-KA04-1">[1]</a></sup> Along with [Walter Pitts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Pitts "Walter Pitts"), McCulloch created computational models based on [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms "Algorithms") called [threshold logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neuron#History "Artificial neuron") which split the inquiry into two distinct approaches, one approach focused on biological processes in the brain and the other focused on the application of [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network "Artificial neural network") to [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence").<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>

## Biography\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Biography")\]

Warren Sturgis McCulloch was born in [Orange, New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange,_New_Jersey "Orange, New Jersey"), in 1898. His brother was a [chemical engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_engineer "Chemical engineer") and Warren was originally planning to join the [Christian ministry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_ministry "Christian ministry"). As a teenager he was associated with the theologians [Henry Sloane Coffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Sloane_Coffin "Henry Sloane Coffin"), [Harry Emerson Fosdick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Emerson_Fosdick "Harry Emerson Fosdick"), [Herman Karl Wilhelm Kumm](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herman_Karl_Wilhelm_Kumm&action=edit&redlink=1 "Herman Karl Wilhelm Kumm (page does not exist)") and [Julian F. Hecker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_F._Hecker "Julian F. Hecker"). He was also mentored by the [Quaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaker "Quaker"), [Rufus Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufus_Jones_(writer) "Rufus Jones (writer)").<sup id="cite_ref-number_3-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch#cite_note-number-3">[3]</a></sup> He attended [Haverford College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haverford_College "Haverford College") and studied philosophy and psychology at [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University "Yale University"), where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1921. He continued to study psychology at [Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University "Columbia University") and received a Master of Arts degree in 1923. Receiving his MD in 1927 from the [Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University_College_of_Physicians_and_Surgeons "Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons") in New York, he undertook an internship at [Bellevue Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue_Hospital "Bellevue Hospital"), New York. Then he worked under [Eilhard von Domarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eilhard_von_Domarus "Eilhard von Domarus") at the [Rockland State Hospital for the Insane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockland_Psychiatric_Center "Rockland Psychiatric Center").<sup id="cite_ref-Abraham_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch#cite_note-Abraham-4">[4]</a></sup> He returned to academia in 1934. He worked at the Laboratory for Neurophysiology at Yale University from 1934 to 1941.

In 1941 he moved to Chicago and joined the Department of Psychiatry at the [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Illinois_at_Chicago "University of Illinois at Chicago"), where he was a professor of psychiatry, as well as the director of the Illinois Neuropsychiatric Institute until 1951.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> From 1952 he worked at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology") in [Cambridge, Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts "Cambridge, Massachusetts") with [Norbert Wiener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener "Norbert Wiener"). He was a founding member of the [American Society for Cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_for_Cybernetics "American Society for Cybernetics") and its second president during 1967–1968. He was a mentor to the British [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research "Operations research") pioneer [Stafford Beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer "Stafford Beer").

McCulloch had a range of interests and talents. In addition to his scientific contributions he wrote poetry ([sonnets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnet "Sonnet")), and he designed and engineered buildings and a dam at his farm in [Old Lyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Lyme "Old Lyme"), Connecticut.

McCulloch married Ruth Metzger, known as 'Rook', in 1924 and they had three children.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> He died in [Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts "Cambridge, Massachusetts") in 1969.

## Work\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Work")\]

He is remembered for his work with Joannes Gregorius Dusser de Barenne from Yale<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> and later with [Walter Pitts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Pitts "Walter Pitts") from the [University of Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago "University of Chicago"). He provided the foundation for certain brain theories in a number of classic papers, including "A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity" (1943) and "How We Know Universals: The Perception of Auditory and Visual Forms" (1947), both published in the _Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics_. The former is "widely credited with being a seminal contribution to neural network theory, the theory of automata, the theory of computation, and cybernetics".<sup id="cite_ref-KA04_1-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch#cite_note-KA04-1">[1]</a></sup>

McCulloch was the chair of the set of [Macy conferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences "Macy conferences") dedicated to Cybernetics. These, greatly due to the diversity of the backgrounds of the participants McCulloch brought in, became the foundation for the field.

### Neural network modelling\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Neural network modelling")\]

In the 1943 paper McCulloch and Pitts attempted to demonstrate that a [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine "Turing machine") program could be implemented in a finite network of _formal_ [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron "Neuron") (in the event, the Turing Machine contains their model of the brain, but the converse is not true<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>), that the neuron was the base logic unit of the brain. In the 1947 paper they offered approaches to designing "nervous nets" to recognize visual inputs despite changes in orientation or size.

From 1952 McCulloch worked at the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT, working primarily on [neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(biology) "Neural network (biology)") modelling. His team examined the visual system of the [frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog "Frog") in consideration of McCulloch's 1947 paper, discovering that the eye provides the brain with information that is already, to a degree, organized and interpreted, instead of simply transmitting an image.

### Reticular formation\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Reticular formation")\]

McCulloch also posited the concept of "poker chip" [reticular formations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticular_formation "Reticular formation") as to how the brain deals with contradictory information in a democratic, somatotopical neural network. His principle of "Redundancy of Potential Command"<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> was developed by [von Foerster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_von_Foerster "Heinz von Foerster") and [Pask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Pask "Gordon Pask") in their study of [self-organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization "Self-organization")<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> and by Pask in his [Conversation Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_Theory "Conversation Theory") and [Interactions of Actors Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Pask#Interactions_of_Actors_Theory "Gordon Pask").<sup id="cite_ref-Pask_1996_11-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch#cite_note-Pask_1996-11">[11]</a></sup>
