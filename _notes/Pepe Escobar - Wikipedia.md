Pepe Escobar on RT America in 2012

Escobar's concept of "Pipelineistan" refers to the network of oil and gas pipelines in crucial geopolitical regions, especially Central Asia. He suggests that Western actions in these areas are largely driven by a desire to reduce dependence on Russian energy and [OPEC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC "OPEC"). This theory has faced criticism, particularly regarding its application to conflicts like the [Syrian Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War "Syrian Civil War"). Escobar's work has been scrutinized for its appearance in outlets identified by the [U.S. State Department](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._State_Department "U.S. State Department") as part of Russia's disinformation network, such as [RT](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network) "RT (TV network)") and [Sputnik News](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_News "Sputnik News"), raising questions about the potential propagation of [Russian propaganda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_propaganda "Russian propaganda").

Pipelines carrying Russian gas to Europe. According to Escobar, a desire for energy independence from Russia motivates many Western actions in Eurasia.

"Pipelineistan" is a term coined by Escobar to describe "the vast network of oil and gas pipelines that crisscross the potential imperial battlefields of the planet," particularly in Central Asia.<sup id="cite_ref-2009BDP_16-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_Escobar#cite_note-2009BDP-16">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2015OpenDemoc_17-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_Escobar#cite_note-2015OpenDemoc-17">[17]</a></sup> Articles by Escobar about his "Pipelineistan" theory, many first published in [TomDispatch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TomDispatch "TomDispatch"), were re-published in _[Al Jazeera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera_Media_Network "Al Jazeera Media Network")_,<sup id="cite_ref-2012AJpipe_18-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_Escobar#cite_note-2012AJpipe-18">[18]</a></sup> _[Grist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grist_(magazine) "Grist (magazine)")_,<sup id="cite_ref-GristPipe_19-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_Escobar#cite_note-GristPipe-19">[19]</a></sup> _[Mother Jones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Jones_(magazine) "Mother Jones (magazine)")_,<sup id="cite_ref-2009MoJo_20-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_Escobar#cite_note-2009MoJo-20">[20]</a></sup> and _[The Nation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nation "The Nation")_.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_Escobar#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_Escobar#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

Escobar argued in a 2009 article published by _[CBS News](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News "CBS News")_ that running energy pipelines from the energy-rich nations near the [Caspian Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea "Caspian Sea") would let Europe be less dependent on the natural gas that it currently gets from Russia, and would potentially help the West rely less on [OPEC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC "OPEC"). This situation results in an international conflict of interest over the region. Escobar wrote that the "The New [Great Game](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Game "Great Game") of the twenty-first century is always over energy and it's taking place on an immense chessboard called Eurasia".<sup id="cite_ref-CBS2009_23-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_Escobar#cite_note-CBS2009-23">[23]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-NTH2015_24-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_Escobar#cite_note-NTH2015-24">[24]</a></sup>

In 2018, [Paul Cochrane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Cochrane&action=edit&redlink=1 "Paul Cochrane (page does not exist)") in [Middle East Eye](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_Eye "Middle East Eye") dismissed the "Pipelineistan" theory put forward in Escobar's Al-Jazaeera piece, "that the [bloodshed in Syria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War "Syrian Civil War") is simply another war over Middle Eastern energy resources". Cochrane wrote that covert action by the US against Syria started in 2005, which was before any plan was put forward to run a gas pipeline from Qatar to Syria. [Robin Yassin-Kassab](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robin_Yassin-Kassab&action=edit&redlink=1 "Robin Yassin-Kassab (page does not exist)") called it a "[conspiracy theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory "Conspiracy theory")". [Naser Tamimi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Naser_Tamimi&action=edit&redlink=1 "Naser Tamimi (page does not exist)") said "If Syria and Iraq stabilise, and political relations with Saudi Arabia and Iraq improve ... after all of that, then you could think of a pipeline.

## Libya [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pepe_Escobar&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Libya")

According to [Arnaud De Borchgrave](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnaud_De_Borchgrave "Arnaud De Borchgrave"), during the [2011 Libyan Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Libyan_Civil_War "First Libyan Civil War") Escobar wrote a piece "uncovering" the background of [Abdelhakim Belhaj](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdelhakim_Belhaj "Abdelhakim Belhaj"), whose military leadership against [Gaddafi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi "Muammar Gaddafi") was being aided by [NATO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO "NATO"), had trained with [al-Qaeda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda "Al-Qaeda") in Afghanistan.<sup id="cite_ref-AdeB2011_4-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_Escobar#cite_note-AdeB2011-4">[4]</a></sup> According to Escobar's story, published by _Asia Times_ on August 30, 2011, Belhaj's background was well-known to Western intelligence.<sup id="cite_ref-Tripoli2011_27-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_Escobar#cite_note-Tripoli2011-27">[27]</a></sup>

Interviewed about his story by [Radio New Zealand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_New_Zealand "Radio New Zealand"), Escobar said that Belhaj and his close associates were fundamentalists whose goal was to impose Islamic law once they defeated Gaddafi, and that Libya would slide into a civil war between Gaddafi loyalists and “Jihadist fundamentalists”.<sup id="cite_ref-Auckland2011_28-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_Escobar#cite_note-Auckland2011-28">[28]</a></sup> Escobar's story was commented on by [Muhammad Sahimi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Sahimi "Muhammad Sahimi") for [PBS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS "PBS").<sup id="cite_ref-PBS2011_29-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_Escobar#cite_note-PBS2011-29">[29]</a></sup>

According to the [United States State Department](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State "United States Department of State")'s [Global Engagement Center](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Engagement_Center "Global Engagement Center") (GEC) several outlets that publish or republish work by Escobar are used by Russia for propaganda and disinformation.<sup id="cite_ref-2020State_30-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_Escobar#cite_note-2020State-30">[30]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2022State_31-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_Escobar#cite_note-2022State-31">[31]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary,_secondary_and_tertiary_sources" title="Wikipedia:No original research"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable secondary sources.

Escobar has also been a commentator for [RT](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network) "RT (TV network)") and [Sputnik News](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_News "Sputnik News").

In 2012, Jesse Zwick at _[The New Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Republic "The New Republic")_ asked Escobar why he was willing to work with _RT_; Escobar replied, "I knew the Kremlin involvement, but I said, why not use it? After a few months, I was very impressed by the American audience. There are dozens of thousands of viewers. A very simple story can get 20,000 hits on YouTube. The feedback was huge.”<sup id="cite_ref-NR2012_34-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_Escobar#cite_note-NR2012-34">[34]</a></sup>

During the [2017 Catalan independence crisis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017%E2%80%932018_Spanish_constitutional_crisis "2017–2018 Spanish constitutional crisis"), Escobar wrote that Spain lived in a state of permanent fascism. In 2022, Escobar said that US president Biden was a puppet of [Hillary Clinton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton "Hillary Clinton") and the US establishment, who are motivated by [Russophobia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russophobia "Russophobia") and aim to sever the link between Russia and the European economy. The Spanish newspaper _[ABC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(newspaper) "ABC (newspaper)")_ wrote that some of Escobar's writings were "the usual ones of Russian disinformation: ['Yankee' imperialism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_imperialism "Yankee imperialism"), NATO excesses, Russian victimization".<sup id="cite_ref-2022ABC_35-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_Escobar#cite_note-2022ABC-35">[35]</a></sup>
