So Joe Biden is using the full weight of his office as POTUS - not to give healthcare to every American, not to end homelessness - but to persuade the ICC behind the scenes not to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu for actual war crimes. What a complete and utter living POS.



The US isn’t even a member of the ICC.

We know. What's your point?

Nobody likes you, Anthony

The full weight of his office? What does that mean? It sounds like he's just wagging his finger at the ICC.

So you're okay with Biden interfering with the work of the ICC and trying to get them not to issue an arrest warranton for Netanyahu and his government over the war crimes they committed against the Palestinian people. Good to know.

You’re a professor? You should be fired.

Because I think differently than you? Okay, fascist.

its worse than that they are threatening them

"Hey, I wagged my finger at him Hasn't he suffered enough?"

I’m just looking for when Donald Trump ended homelessness and gave healthcare to everyone. It’s weird I can’t find it. When was that?

If the ICC issues that arrest warrant for war crimes, by law all US arms deliveries to Israel have to stop.
