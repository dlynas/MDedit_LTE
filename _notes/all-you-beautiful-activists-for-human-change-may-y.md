## All you beautiful activists for human change; may your holy devotions include the Good Earth and the many beings. May the Earth and waters hold you and may you consciously feel that love.

All you working for the vision of an Earth with humans living well with the others; remember that human supremacies (which are often rooted in ancestral confusion that became systemic), these places of human superiority and arrogance are often the biggest blocks to change. Don't underestimate how deep and tangled those roots can get.

May our psyches and hearts be big enough to hold it all and to be kind and tender with ourselves throughout. 

Our lives matter. Our choices matter today. Your choices matter. You matter.

Bearing witness also means hanging in for the healing outcome, even if we don't see that in our lifetimes.

If this terrain has interest and you vibe with my approach, I taught a course on this in 2022 that's now available in self-paced form. It's called Inhabiting the Times: Six Keys to Recognize and Transform Supremacy (link in bio).
