## What is something, as of yet, science has no explanation for?

	The [axis of evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_evil_\(cosmology\)) in cosmology, and in general the presence of galaxy superclusters larger than the maximum size predicted by the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) model. One half of the sky is slightly warmer than another. There are no known physics that could cause this. The BAO model predicts that the largest structures in the universe should have a maximum size, because they formed from acoustic oscillations in primordial plasma, which was frozen in place by the expansion of the universe. This scale is ca. 500 million light-years. And yet there are lots of structures larger than this, including the entire sky itself.

			Imagine pouring water out on the ground. It will splash and move around. But then it gets cold. The water stops moving around and freezes in place. Based on how long it took to freeze, and how much water you started with, you can figure out how big the puddle should be. But what if the puddle should be half a meter at best, but you look around and see puddles that are ten meters wide? That would be curious! And if the whole ground outside is cold, but all you've ever seen is puddles of water, then what is the ground made of? Maybe more water? Maybe dirt? We should keep looking!

		Aren't some of these observations (e.g., anisotropy in the CMB relative to the plane of our solar system) argued to be statistically insignificant? I'm a layman in cosmology, but I've tried wrapping my head around several of the more interesting topics.

			Yes and no. Accounting for Doppler shift still results in temperature structures in the CMB larger than causality at the time of recombination would technically allow. The current explanation posited (iirc from my cosmology course) is these larger structures are as a result of quantum fluctuations during the inflationary period of the universe causing small changes in the mass density distribution of the very early universe. These mass density fluctuations do not need to be causally connected at all points and cause the light from the CMB emission to be at in local minima or maxima gravitational potential areas, causing small red or blue shifting effects on larger scales than acoustic oscillations.
