By Israel’s own estimates, 94% of the deaths have been civilian casualties. If you’re killing 94% civilians you can’t claim collateral damage If you’re killing 6x more children than Hamas you can’t claim collateral damage It’s intentional

This is insane: we've destroyed half of Gaza, displaced over 1.5 million people from their homes, murdered at least 6,000 children & were only able to kill 1,000-2,000 Hamas militants? theguardian.com/world/2023/nov

By those numbers, it is the civilians who are the real targets and Hamas deaths are incidental/accidental/collateral.

We had to burn down the haystack because we were sure there was a needle somewhere in there. Even though it was full of sleeping people and strangely we didn't find the needle. So we just gotta keep on burning.

Zionism is a product of secularizing modernity, a loss of faith, and this inward loss is compensated by an excessive worldliness. What the Zionist mentality cannot comprehend is that a people will incur so much worldly loss and human suffering, but will not even consider it an

The world wide average of combatant vs civilian deaths is 1:9. Israel is well below the average. Having said that every innocent live lost is tragic.

You are using Israel's numbers for Hamas but Hamas numbers for the number of casualties. Apples and oranges.

This should help explain it.

Not true. Ive read reports that up to 10k hamas members were killed. And the rest...some could be from their own rockets misfiring as we've seen. Some from tunnels collapsing after they're targeted and taking down houses with them. Others...yes collateral damage. It's war.

IDF said they killed ~1000-2000 while taking back southern Israel in wake of Oct. 7th. Where’s the Guardian getting these numbers? IDF seems only to be releasing senior officials/commanders  not actual fighters.

I keep adding this to that equation:

That is also probably only the guerillas that went into "ISrael proper" on Oct 7. Ie the bombardment of Gaza, the genocide didn't harm Al Qassam (hamas military wing)

You are basing your claims on wrong information, 1,500 Hamas fighters were killed during the \*7 October massacre alone\*.

The one thing is that if Israel were to only use ground forces, the losses from their side would be much higher. Which is also unfair in that they never wanted this war and Israeli soldiers' lives also matter

I'd be ashamed, but the piggies are proud of it.

Can you provide a clear source for this 94% number? I can’t find it.

The inflation of numbers is out of control! You seriously need to be a bit more critical of everything that comes from Hamas. If you expect Israel to provide evidence, proof and verification, perhaps it would be well served to demand the same of Hamas??
