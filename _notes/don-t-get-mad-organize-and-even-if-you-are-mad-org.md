## DON'T GET MAD, ORGANIZE. AND EVEN IF YOU ARE MAD, ORGANIZE.

![[3319501799391531583.mp4]]
"Don't get mad, organize.
And even if you are mad, organize.
Power concedes nothing.
So we must build our own independent political power
outside the Democratic Party.
Now imagine with me, a future with Trump defeated again,
the MAGA movement rejected firmly,
the Senate is free of Joe Manchin and Kiersten Sinema,
imagine a house led by a growing working family's party block.
This is a scenario that opens the door to progress.
We can win abortion protections across the country with that.
We can make the minimum wage a living wage with that.
We can make childcare available and affordable for everybody
and elder care and income home care too.
With that, we can build housing that people can afford
and protect tenants from spiking rents with that.
We can protect workers from retaliation for speaking out
and organizing a company like Starbucks and Amazon with that.
We can protect the right to vote in gerrymandering
and push big money out of politics with that.
And we have far, far, far more power to advance a humanitarian
pro-peace agenda with that.
More than we do in a world where the MAGA movement is calling the shots.
Look a little farther ahead, if you will.
We will fight for the guarantee of a good job for everyone
who wants work, for health care, for all, and more.
Those billionaires that seek to divide us,
they can see that future coming and they want to stop it.
Republican billionaires like Paul Singer and Bernie Marcus,
who fund groups like APAC, are right now amassing vast resources
to challenge champions of the working class.
We've got to defend my sister, Summer Lee, my brother Jamal Bowman,
Pastor Cory Bush, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Taleeb,
and all our working families, party champions from these attacks
and elect new leaders to join them in the Congress.
We also must build power locally.
WFP Elected's from New York to New Mexico,
are winning policies that lift up working people. "
