BREAKING: The New York Times is reportedly going to fire Anat Schwartz, one of the lead "reporters" on not just their main "mass rape" atrocity propaganda hoax, but also sole author of several other NYT pieces regurgitating it, in a desperate attempt to salvage their reputation

Quote

Multiple NYT sources tell me that the paper is now cutting ties with Anat Schwarz after her social media history — “turn Gaza into a slaughterhouse” — was exposed. Her explosive article shaped public understanding of 10/7 yet the team at The Daily has still been unable to produce x.com/ryangrim/statu…

this is crucial: The NYT is trying to scapegoat Anat Schwartz so they can keep protecting Jeffrey Gettleman and Adam Sella, the two other authors of the "mass rape" atrocity propaganda hoax, as well as their own reputation. But look at all the pieces they let her write for them:

literally their entire "reporting" on the "mass rape" atrocity propaganda hoax was written by Anat Schwartz, who they are reportedly going to fire. You can't just get away with that. She's your lead "reporter" on this subject, you gave her free reign. You staked your name on hers

Anat Schwartz as a person is totally irrelevant, but the NYT wants to make it about her, and specifically about her breaking their "social media etiquette". No, it's about what you allowed her to do, by herself, and together with Jeffrey Gettleman and Adam Sella. That's the issue

you can't fire her and let her "reporting" stand, the widely debunked depraved atrocity propaganda hoax, written by a genocidal racist maniac. Retract those pieces immediately, and fire Jeffrey Gettleman and Adam Sella, who worked with her to fabricate it. That's the bare minimum

so just to recap, Anat Schwartz was exposed to be a genocidal racist maniac, who explicitly expressed she wanted to fabricate propaganda about "Hamas being ISIS" for Western audiences, and her nephew Adam Sella at the NYT worked with her to do exactly that

oh my god. One of the three authors of the New York Times' "mass rape" atrocity propaganda hoax is Anat Schwartz. She liked posts calling for Gaza to be turned into a "slaughterhouse". This the person the NYT hired to write about Palestinians and frame them as sub-human monsters

Anat Schwartz has zero journalistic experience, but together with her nephew Adam Sella, she led the "on the ground reporting" for the NYT's entire "mass rape" atrocity propaganda coverage. Jeffrey Gettleman relied on their materials. That's it. It's over

BREAKING: Anat Schwartz, one of the principal authors of the NYT "mass rape" atrocity propaganda hoax, not only expressed support for genocidal mass murder of Palestinians right before they gave her that job, but also served in the Israeli military's intelligence service

there is nothing to salvage, no matter how desperately the NYT is trying to do damage control by scapegoating her. No, you hired her. You hired Adam Sella. You hired Jeffrey Gettleman. You gave them free reign. Her "reporting", alone and with them, is still on your site right now

not only is it still on the NYT's site, it is still being used by the Israeli regime as its main source to launder its genocide of Gaza, exactly what Anat Schwartz and Adam Sella said was their aim, "it's important for Israeli hasbara \[propaganda\]."

firing Anat Schwartz while keeping up her "reporting", along with Adam Sella and Jeffrey Gettleman who relied on it and worked with her to fabricate it, is meant to protect the reputation of the New York Times, as well as Gettleman and Sella. It's depraved and grotesque

[

no, it's over. The only way the New York Times can adhere to minimal, basic journalistic and ethical standards, is if they immediately fire all three of these propagandists who collaborated with one another to concoct the greatest hoax in NYT history since Judith Miller
