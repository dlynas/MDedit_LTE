Libya has been inhabited by [Berbers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_people "Berber people") since the late [Bronze Age](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age "Bronze Age") as descendants from [Iberomaurusian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberomaurusian "Iberomaurusian") and [Capsian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsian "Capsian") cultures.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-21">[18]</a></sup> In classical antiquity, the [Phoenicians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenicia "Phoenicia") established city-states and trading posts in western Libya, while several [Greek cities](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaica "Cyrenaica") were established in the East. Parts of Libya were variously ruled by [Carthaginians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Carthage "Ancient Carthage"), [Numidians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numidia "Numidia"), [Persians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire "Achaemenid Empire"), and [Greeks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_Kingdom "Ptolemaic Kingdom") before the entire region becoming a part of the [Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire"). Libya was an [early center of Christianity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_centers_of_Christianity "Early centers of Christianity"). After the [fall of the Western Roman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire "Fall of the Western Roman Empire"), the area of Libya was mostly occupied by the [Vandals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandal_Kingdom "Vandal Kingdom") until the 7th century when [invasions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_the_Maghreb "Muslim conquest of the Maghreb") brought [Islam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam "Islam") to the region. From then on, centuries of [Arab migration to the Maghreb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_migration_to_the_Maghreb "Arab migration to the Maghreb") shifted the demographic scope of Libya in favor of [Arabs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs "Arabs"). In the 16th century, the [Spanish Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire "Spanish Empire") and the [Knights of St John](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_of_St_John "Knights of St John") occupied [Tripoli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripoli,_Libya "Tripoli, Libya") until [Ottoman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") rule [began in 1551](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Tripolitania "Ottoman Tripolitania"). Libya was involved in the [Barbary Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_Wars "Barbary Wars") of the 18th and 19th centuries. Ottoman rule continued until the [Italo-Turkish War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italo-Turkish_War "Italo-Turkish War"), which resulted in the [Italian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy "Kingdom of Italy") occupation of Libya and the establishment of two colonies, [Italian Tripolitania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Tripolitania "Italian Tripolitania") and [Italian Cyrenaica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Cyrenaica "Italian Cyrenaica") (1911–1934), later unified in the [Italian Libya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Libya "Italian Libya") colony from 1934 to 1943.

During the [Second World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War"), Libya was an area of warfare in the [North African Campaign](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_African_Campaign "North African Campaign"). The [Italian population](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_settlers_in_Libya "Italian settlers in Libya") then went into decline. Libya became independent as a [kingdom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Libya "Kingdom of Libya") in 1951. A [bloodless](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_revolution "Nonviolent revolution") [military coup in 1969](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_Libyan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat "1969 Libyan coup d'état"), initiated by a coalition led by Colonel [Muammar Gaddafi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi "Muammar Gaddafi"), overthrew [King Idris I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_of_Libya "Idris of Libya") and created a [republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic "Republic").<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-22">[19]</a></sup> Gaddafi was often described by critics as a [dictator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator "Dictator"), and was one of the world's longest serving non-royal leaders, ruling for 42 years.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-23">[20]</a></sup> He [ruled](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Libya_under_Muammar_Gaddafi "History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi") until being overthrown and [killed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Muammar_Gaddafi "Death of Muammar Gaddafi") during the [2011 Libyan Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Libyan_Civil_War "First Libyan Civil War"), which was part of the wider [Arab Spring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring "Arab Spring"), with authority transferred to the [National Transitional Council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transitional_Council "National Transitional Council") then to the elected [General National Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_National_Congress "General National Congress").

Archaeological site of [Sabratha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabratha "Sabratha"), Libya

The origin of the name "Libya" first appeared in an inscription of [Ramesses II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_II "Ramesses II"), written as _[rbw](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rbw "wikt:rbw")_ in hieroglyphic. The name derives from a generalized identity given to a large confederacy of ancient east "Libyan" [berbers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers "Berbers"), [African](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/African "wikt:African") people(s) and tribes who lived around the lush regions of [Cyrenaica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaica "Cyrenaica") and [Marmarica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmarica "Marmarica"). An army of 40,000 men<sup id="cite_ref-3.8_MERENPTAH_(1236-1230_BC)_31-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-3.8_MERENPTAH_(1236-1230_BC)-31">[28]</a></sup> and a confederacy of tribes known as "Great Chiefs of the [Libu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libu "Libu")" were led by King [Meryey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meryey "Meryey") who fought a war against [pharaoh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh "Pharaoh") [Merneptah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merneptah "Merneptah") in year 5 (1208 BCE). This conflict was mentioned in the [Great Karnak Inscription](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Karnak_Inscription "Great Karnak Inscription") in the western delta during the 5th and 6th years of his reign and resulted in a defeat for Meryey. According to the [Great Karnak Inscription](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Karnak_Inscription "Great Karnak Inscription"), the military alliance comprised the [Meshwesh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meshwesh "Meshwesh"), the [Lukka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lukka "Lukka"), and the "Sea Peoples" known as the [Ekwesh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekwesh "Ekwesh"), [Teresh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Peoples "Sea Peoples"), [Shekelesh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shekelesh "Shekelesh"), and the [Sherden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherden "Sherden").

The Great karnak inscription reads:

_

> "... the third season, saying: 'The wretched, fallen chief of Libya, Meryey, son of Ded, has fallen upon the country of Tehenu with his bowmen — Sherden, Shekelesh, Ekwesh, Lukka, Teresh. Taking the best of every warrior and every man of war of his country. He has brought his wife and his children — leaders of the camp, and he has reached the western boundary in the fields of Perire."

_

The modern name of "Libya" is an evolution of the "_Libu_" or "_Libúē_" name (from Greek _Λιβύη, Libyē_), generally encompassing the people of [Cyrenaica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaica "Cyrenaica") and [Marmarica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmarica "Marmarica"). The _"Libúē"_ or _"libu"_ name likely came to be used in the classical world as an identity for the natives of the North African region, and it possibly derives from [Proto-Afroasiatic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Afroasiatic "Proto-Afroasiatic") _[labiʔ-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Semitic/labi%CA%94-#Etymology "wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Semitic/labiʔ-")_ (lion), compare [Somali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somali_language "Somali language") _[libaax](https://translate.google.com/?sl=so&tl=en&text=libaax&op=translate)_. The name was revived in 1934 for [Italian Libya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Libya "Italian Libya") from the [ancient Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") Λιβύη (__Libúē__).<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-32">[29]</a></sup> It was intended to supplant terms applied to [Ottoman Tripolitania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Tripolitania "Ottoman Tripolitania"), the coastal region of what is today Libya, having been ruled by the Ottoman Empire from 1551 to 1911 as the Eyalet of Tripolitania.

## History [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Libya&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: History")

### Ancient Libya [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Libya&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Ancient Libya")

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Leptis_Magna_Arch_of_Septimius_Severus.jpg)

[Leptis Magna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptis_Magna "Leptis Magna")

The coastal plain of Libya was inhabited by [Neolithic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic "Neolithic") peoples from as early as 8000 BC. The [Afroasiatic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afroasiatic_languages "Afroasiatic languages") ancestors of the [Berber people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_people "Berber people") are assumed to have spread into the area by the [Late Bronze Age](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age "Late Bronze Age"). The earliest known name of such a tribe was the [Garamantes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garamantes "Garamantes"), based in [Germa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germa "Germa"). The [Phoenicians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenicia "Phoenicia") were the first to establish trading posts in Libya.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-40">[37]</a></sup> By the 5th century BC, the greatest of the Phoenician colonies, [Carthage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthage "Carthage"), had extended its [hegemony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony "Hegemony") across much of North Africa, where a distinctive civilization, known as [Punic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punic "Punic"), came into being.

In 630 BC, the [ancient Greeks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") colonized the area around [Barca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barca_(ancient_city) "Barca (ancient city)") in Eastern Libya and founded the city of [Cyrene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrene,_Libya "Cyrene, Libya").<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-41">[38]</a></sup> Within 200 years, four more important Greek cities were established in the area that became known as [Cyrenaica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaica "Cyrenaica").<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-42">[39]</a></sup> The area was home to the renowned philosophy school of the [Cyrenaics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaics "Cyrenaics"). In 525 BC the [Persian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_people "Persian people") army of [Cambyses II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambyses_II "Cambyses II") overran Cyrenaica, which for the next two centuries remained under Persian or Egyptian rule. [Alexander the Great](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great "Alexander the Great") ended Persian rule in 331 BC and received tribute from Cyrenaica. Eastern Libya again fell under the control of the Greeks, this time as part of the [Ptolemaic Kingdom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_Kingdom "Ptolemaic Kingdom").

After the fall of [Carthage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthage "Carthage") the Romans did not immediately occupy [Tripolitania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripolitania "Tripolitania") (the region around Tripoli), but left it instead under control of the kings of [Numidia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numidia "Numidia"), until the coastal cities asked and obtained its protection.<sup id="cite_ref-be202_43-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be202-43">[40]</a></sup> [Ptolemy Apion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_Apion "Ptolemy Apion"), the last Greek ruler, bequeathed Cyrenaica to Rome, which formally annexed the region in 74 BC and joined it to Crete as [a Roman province](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creta_et_Cyrenaica "Creta et Cyrenaica"). As part of the [Africa Nova](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa_Nova "Africa Nova") province, Tripolitania was prosperous,<sup id="cite_ref-be202_43-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be202-43">[40]</a></sup> and reached a golden age in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, when the city of [Leptis Magna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptis_Magna "Leptis Magna"), home to the [Severan dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severan_dynasty "Severan dynasty"), was at its height.<sup id="cite_ref-be202_43-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be202-43">[40]</a></sup>

On the Eastern side, Cyrenaica's first Christian communities were established by the time of the Emperor [Claudius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius "Claudius").<sup id="cite_ref-be417_44-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be417-44">[41]</a></sup> It was heavily devastated during the [Kitos War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitos_War "Kitos War")<sup id="cite_ref-ro364_45-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-ro364-45">[42]</a></sup> and almost depopulated of Greeks and Jews alike.<sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-46">[43]</a></sup> Although repopulated by [Trajan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan "Trajan") with military colonies,<sup id="cite_ref-ro364_45-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-ro364-45">[42]</a></sup> from then started its decline.<sup id="cite_ref-be417_44-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be417-44">[41]</a></sup> Libya was early to convert to [Nicene Christianity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Christianity "Nicene Christianity") and was the home of [Pope Victor I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Victor_I "Pope Victor I"); however, Libya was also home to many non-Nicene varieties of early Christianity, such as [Arianism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism "Arianism") and [Donatism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donatism "Donatism").

### Islamic Libya [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Libya&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Islamic Libya")

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Awjila_(Libia)_-_The_Mosque_of_Atiq.jpg)

The [Atiq Mosque](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atiq_Mosque,_Awjila "Atiq Mosque, Awjila") in [Awjila](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awjila "Awjila") is the oldest mosque in the [Sahara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara "Sahara").

Under the command of [Amr ibn al-As](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amr_ibn_al-As "Amr ibn al-As"), the [Rashidun army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashidun_army "Rashidun army") conquered [Cyrenaica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaica "Cyrenaica").<sup id="cite_ref-be278_47-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be278-47">[44]</a></sup> In 647 an army led by [Abdullah ibn Saad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_ibn_Saad "Abdullah ibn Saad") took Tripoli from the Byzantines definitively.<sup id="cite_ref-be278_47-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be278-47">[44]</a></sup> The [Fezzan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fezzan "Fezzan") was conquered by [Uqba ibn Nafi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uqba_ibn_Nafi "Uqba ibn Nafi") in 663. The Berber tribes of the hinterland accepted Islam, however they resisted Arab political rule.<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-48">[45]</a></sup>

For the next several decades, Libya was under the purview of the [Umayyad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_Caliphate "Umayyad Caliphate") [Caliph of Damascus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliph_of_Damascus "Caliph of Damascus") until the [Abbasids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate "Abbasid Caliphate") overthrew the Umayyads in 750, and Libya came under the rule of Baghdad. When Caliph [Harun al-Rashid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harun_al-Rashid "Harun al-Rashid") appointed [Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrahim_I_ibn_al-Aghlab "Ibrahim I ibn al-Aghlab") as his governor of [Ifriqiya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifriqiya "Ifriqiya") in 800, Libya enjoyed considerable local autonomy under the [Aghlabid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aghlabid "Aghlabid") dynasty. By the 10th century, the Shiite [Fatimids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatimids "Fatimids") controlled Western Libya, and ruled the entire region in 972 and appointed [Bologhine ibn Ziri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologhine_ibn_Ziri "Bologhine ibn Ziri") as governor.<sup id="cite_ref-be202_43-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be202-43">[40]</a></sup>

Ibn Ziri's Berber [Zirid dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zirid_dynasty "Zirid dynasty") ultimately broke away from the Shiite Fatimids, and recognised the Sunni Abbasids of Baghdad as rightful Caliphs. In retaliation, the Fatimids brought about the migration of thousands from mainly two Arab Qaisi tribes, the [Banu Sulaym](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Sulaym "Banu Sulaym") and [Banu Hilal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Hilal "Banu Hilal") to North Africa. This act drastically altered the fabric of the Libyan countryside, and cemented the cultural and linguistic Arabisation of the region.<sup id="cite_ref-be202_43-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be202-43">[40]</a></sup>

Zirid rule in Tripolitania was short-lived though, and already in 1001 the Berbers of the [Banu Khazrun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Khazrun "Banu Khazrun") broke away. Tripolitania remained under their control until 1146, when the region was overtaken by the [Normans of Sicily](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normans_of_Sicily "Normans of Sicily").<sup id="cite_ref-be203_49-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be203-49">[46]</a></sup> For the next 50 years, Tripolitania was the scene of numerous battles among [Ayyubids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayyubids "Ayyubids"), the Almohad rulers and insurgents of the [Banu Ghaniya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Ghaniya "Banu Ghaniya"). Later, a general of the [Almohads](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almohad_Caliphate "Almohad Caliphate"), Muhammad ibn Abu Hafs, ruled Libya from 1207 to 1221 before the later establishment of a Tunisian [Hafsid dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafsid_dynasty "Hafsid dynasty")<sup id="cite_ref-be203_49-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be203-49">[46]</a></sup> independent from the Almohads. The Hafsids ruled Tripolitania for nearly 300 years. By the 16th century the Hafsids became increasingly caught up in the power struggle between Spain and the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire").

After weakening control of Abbasids, Cyrenaica was under Egypt based states such as [Tulunids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulunids "Tulunids"), [Ikhshidids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikhshidids "Ikhshidids"), [Ayyubids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayyubids "Ayyubids") and [Mamluks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamluks "Mamluks") before Ottoman conquest in 1517. Finally [Fezzan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fezzan "Fezzan") acquired independence under Awlad Muhammad dynasty after [Kanem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanem_Empire "Kanem Empire") rule. Ottomans finally conquered Fezzan between 1556 and 1577.

### Ottoman Tripolitania [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Libya&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Ottoman Tripolitania")

The [siege of Tripoli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tripoli_(1551) "Siege of Tripoli (1551)") in 1551 allowed the [Ottomans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Navy "Ottoman Navy") to capture the city from the [Knights of St. John](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Hospitaller "Knights Hospitaller").

By 1565, administrative authority as regent in Tripoli was vested in a _[pasha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasha "Pasha")_ appointed directly by the _[sultan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan "Sultan")_ in [Constantinople](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople "Constantinople")/[Istanbul](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul "Istanbul"). In the 1580s, the rulers of [Fezzan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fezzan "Fezzan") gave their allegiance to the sultan, and although Ottoman authority was absent in [Cyrenaica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaica "Cyrenaica"), a _bey_ was stationed in Benghazi late in the next century to act as agent of the government in Tripoli.<sup id="cite_ref-be417_44-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be417-44">[41]</a></sup> European [slaves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_slave_trade "Barbary slave trade") and large numbers of enslaved Blacks transported from Sudan were also a feature of everyday life in Tripoli. In 1551, [Turgut Reis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turgut_Reis "Turgut Reis") enslaved almost the entire population of the Maltese island of [Gozo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gozo "Gozo"), some 5,000 people, sending them to Libya.<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-50">[47]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-51">[48]</a></sup>

In time, real power came to rest with the pasha's corps of [janissaries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janissaries "Janissaries").<sup id="cite_ref-be203_49-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be203-49">[46]</a></sup> In 1611 the _[deys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dey "Dey")_ staged a coup against the pasha, and Dey Sulayman Safar was appointed as head of government.

Lacking direction from the Ottoman government, Tripoli lapsed into a period of military anarchy during which coup followed coup and few deys survived in office more than a year. One such coup was led by Turkish officer [Ahmed Karamanli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Karamanli "Ahmed Karamanli").<sup id="cite_ref-be204_52-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-be204-52">[49]</a></sup> The [Karamanlis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karamanli_dynasty "Karamanli dynasty") ruled from 1711 until 1835 mainly in Tripolitania, and had influence in Cyrenaica and Fezzan as well by the mid-18th century. Ahmed's successors proved to be less capable than himself, however, the region's delicate balance of power allowed the Karamanli. The [1793–95 Tripolitanian civil war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1793%E2%80%9395_Tripolitanian_civil_war "1793–95 Tripolitanian civil war") occurred in those years. In 1793, Turkish officer [Ali Pasha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabluslu_Ali_Pasha "Trabluslu Ali Pasha") deposed Hamet Karamanli and briefly restored Tripolitania to Ottoman rule. Hamet's brother [Yusuf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusuf_Karamanli "Yusuf Karamanli") (r. 1795–1832) re-established Tripolitania's independence.

In the early 19th century war broke out between the United States and Tripolitania, and a series of battles ensued in what came to be known as the [First Barbary War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Barbary_War "First Barbary War") and the [Second Barbary War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Barbary_War "Second Barbary War"). By 1819, the various treaties of the [Napoleonic Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars "Napoleonic Wars") had forced the Barbary states to give up piracy almost entirely, and Tripolitania's economy began to crumble.

### Italian colonization and Allied occupation [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Libya&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Italian colonization and Allied occupation")

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Omar_Mukhtar_13.jpg)

[Omar Mukhtar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Mukhtar "Omar Mukhtar") was a prominent leader of Libyan resistance in Cyrenaica against Italian colonization.

After the [Italo-Turkish War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italo-Turkish_War "Italo-Turkish War") (1911–1912), Italy simultaneously turned the three regions into colonies.<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-54">[51]</a></sup> From 1912 to 1927, the territory of Libya was known as [Italian North Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_North_Africa "Italian North Africa"). From 1927 to 1934, the territory was split into two colonies, [Italian Cyrenaica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Cyrenaica "Italian Cyrenaica") and [Italian Tripolitania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Tripolitania "Italian Tripolitania"), run by Italian governors. Some 150,000 Italians settled in Libya, constituting roughly 20% of the total population.<sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-55">[52]</a></sup>

[Omar Mukhtar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Mukhtar "Omar Mukhtar") rose to prominence as a [resistance leader](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_resistance_movement "Libyan resistance movement") against Italian colonization and became a national hero despite his capture and execution on 16 September 1931.<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-56">[53]</a></sup> His face is currently printed on the Libyan ten dinar note in memory and recognition of his patriotism. Another prominent resistance leader, Idris al-Mahdi as-Senussi (later [King Idris I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_of_Libya "Idris of Libya")), Emir of Cyrenaica, continued to lead the Libyan resistance until the outbreak of the [Second World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II").

The so-called "[pacification of Libya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacification_of_Libya "Pacification of Libya")" by the Italians resulted in mass deaths of the indigenous people in Cyrenaica, killing approximately one quarter of Cyrenaica's population of 225,000.<sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-57">[54]</a></sup> [Ilan Pappé](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilan_Papp%C3%A9 "Ilan Pappé") estimates that between 1928 and 1932 the Italian military "killed half the Bedouin population (directly or through disease and starvation in [Italian concentration camps in Libya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_concentration_camps_in_Libya "Italian concentration camps in Libya"))."<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-58">[55]</a></sup>

In 1934, Italy combined [Cyrenaica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaica "Cyrenaica"), [Tripolitania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripolitania "Tripolitania") and [Fezzan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fezzan "Fezzan") and adopted the name "Libya" (used by the Ancient Greeks for all of North Africa except Egypt) for the unified colony, with Tripoli as its capital.<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-59">[56]</a></sup> The Italians emphasized infrastructure improvements and public works. In particular, they greatly expanded Libyan railway and road networks from 1934 to 1940, building hundreds of kilometers of new roads and railways and encouraging the establishment of new industries and dozens of new agricultural villages.

In June 1940, [Italy entered World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history_of_Italy_during_World_War_II "Military history of Italy during World War II"). Libya became the setting for the hard-fought [North African Campaign](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_African_Campaign "North African Campaign") that ultimately ended in defeat for Italy and its [German ally](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrika_Korps "Afrika Korps") in 1943.

From 1943 to 1951, Libya was under [Allied occupation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_occupation_of_Libya "Allied occupation of Libya"). The British military [administered](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Military_Administration_(Libya) "British Military Administration (Libya)") the two former Italian Libyan provinces of Tripolitana and Cyrenaïca, while the French [administered](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Fezzan "French Fezzan") the province of Fezzan. In 1944, Idris returned from exile in [Cairo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo "Cairo") but declined to resume permanent residence in Cyrenaica until the removal of some aspects of foreign control in 1947. Under the terms of the [1947 peace treaty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Peace_with_Italy,_1947 "Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947") with the [Allies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II "Allies of World War II"), Italy relinquished all claims to Libya.<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-60">[57]</a></sup>

[Muammar al-Gaddafi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_al-Gadaffi "Muammar al-Gadaffi"), leader of Libya (1969–2011)

On 1 September 1969, a group of rebel military officers led by [Muammar Gaddafi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi "Muammar Gaddafi") launched a [coup d'état against King Idris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_Libyan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat "1969 Libyan coup d'état"), which became known as the Al Fateh Revolution.<sup id="cite_ref-SalakLibya_63-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-SalakLibya-63">[60]</a></sup> Gaddafi was referred to as the "[Brother Leader and Guide of the Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotherly_Leader_and_Guide_of_the_Revolution "Brotherly Leader and Guide of the Revolution")" in government statements and the official Libyan press.<sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-64">[61]</a></sup> Moving to reduce Italian influence, in October 1970 all Italian-owned assets were expropriated and the 12,000-strong [Italian community](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_settlers_in_Libya "Italian settlers in Libya") was expelled from Libya alongside the smaller community of [Libyan Jews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Libya "History of the Jews in Libya"). The day became a [national holiday](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holiday "Public holiday") known as "Vengeance Day".<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-65">[62]</a></sup> Libya's increase in prosperity was accompanied by increased internal political repression, and political dissent was made illegal under Law 75 of 1973. Widespread surveillance of the population was carried out through Gaddafi's Revolutionary Committees.<sup id="cite_ref-Gaddafiunrepentant_66-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Gaddafiunrepentant-66">[63]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-GlobalEdge_67-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-GlobalEdge-67">[64]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-68"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-68">[65]</a></sup>

Gaddafi also wanted to ease the strict social restrictions imposed on women by the previous regime, establishing the [Revolutionary Women's Formation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Women%27s_Formation "Revolutionary Women's Formation") to encourage reform. In 1970, a law was introduced affirming equality of the sexes and wage parity. In 1971, Gaddafi sponsored the creation of a Libyan General Women's Federation. In 1972, a law was passed criminalizing the marriage of girls under the age of sixteen and making the woman's consent a necessary prerequisite for a marriage.<sup id="cite_ref-69"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-69">[66]</a></sup>

On 25 October 1975, a coup attempt was launched by a group of 20 military officers, mostly from the city of [Misrata](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misrata "Misrata").<sup id="cite_ref-70"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-70">[67]</a></sup> This resulted in the arrest and executions of the coup plotters.<sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-71">[68]</a></sup> In March of 1977, Libya officially became the "Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya". Gaddafi officially passed power to the [General People's Committees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_People%27s_Committee "General People's Committee") and henceforth claimed to be no more than a symbolic figurehead.<sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-72">[69]</a></sup> The new _jamahiriya_ (Arab for "republic") governance structure he established was officially referred to as "[direct democracy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy "Direct democracy")".<sup id="cite_ref-73"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-73">[70]</a></sup> Gaddafi, in his vision of democratic government and [political philosophy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_philosophy "Political philosophy"), published _[The Green Book](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Green_Book_(Gaddafi) "The Green Book (Gaddafi)")_ in 1975. His short book inscribed a representative mix of utopian socialism and Arab nationalism with a streak of [Bedouin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin "Bedouin") supremacy.

In February 1977, Libya started delivering military supplies to [Goukouni Oueddei](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goukouni_Oueddei "Goukouni Oueddei") and the [People's Armed Forces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Armed_Forces "People's Armed Forces") in Chad. The [Chadian–Libyan War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chadian%E2%80%93Libyan_War "Chadian–Libyan War") began in earnest when Libya's support of rebel forces in northern Chad escalated into an [invasion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_war "Toyota war"). Later that same year, Libya and [Egypt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt "Egypt") fought a four-day border war that came to be known as the [Egyptian–Libyan War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian%E2%80%93Libyan_War "Egyptian–Libyan War"). Both nations agreed to a [ceasefire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire "Ceasefire") under the mediation of the Algerian president [Houari Boumédiène](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houari_Boum%C3%A9di%C3%A8ne "Houari Boumédiène").<sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-74">[71]</a></sup> Hundreds of Libyans lost their lives in the country's support for [Idi Amin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idi_Amin "Idi Amin")'s [Uganda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda "Uganda") in its [war against Tanzania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda%E2%80%93Tanzania_War "Uganda–Tanzania War").

### First Libyan Civil War [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Libya&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: First Libyan Civil War")

The first civil war came during the [Arab Spring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring "Arab Spring") movements which overturned the rulers of [Tunisia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia "Tunisia") and [Egypt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt "Egypt"). Libya first experienced protests against Gaddafi's regime on 15 February 2011, with a full-scale revolt beginning on [17 February](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_Day "Revolution Day").<sup id="cite_ref-84"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-84">[81]</a></sup> Libya's authoritarian regime led by Muammar Gaddafi put up much more of a resistance compared to the regimes in Egypt and Tunisia. While overthrowing the regimes in Egypt and Tunisia was a relatively quick process, Gaddafi's campaign posed significant stalls on the uprising in Libya.<sup id="cite_ref-:15_85-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:15-85">[82]</a></sup> The first announcement of a competing political authority appeared online and declared the [Interim Transitional National Council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interim_Transitional_National_Council "Interim Transitional National Council") as an alternative government.

Pro-Gaddafi forces were able to respond militarily to rebel pushes in [Western Libya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripolitania "Tripolitania") and launched a counterattack along the coast toward Benghazi, the _de facto_ centre of the uprising.<sup id="cite_ref-89"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-89">[86]</a></sup> The town of [Zawiya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zawiya,_Libya "Zawiya, Libya"), 48 kilometres (30 mi) from Tripoli, was bombarded by [air force planes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Air_Force_(1951%E2%80%932011) "Libyan Air Force (1951–2011)") and army tanks and seized by [Jamahiriya troops](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_the_Libyan_Arab_Jamahiriya "Armed Forces of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya"), "exercising a level of brutality not yet seen in the conflict."<sup id="cite_ref-90"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-90">[87]</a></sup> Organizations of the United Nations, including [United Nations Secretary General](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Secretary_General "United Nations Secretary General") [Ban Ki-moon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon "Ban Ki-moon")<sup id="cite_ref-91"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-91">[88]</a></sup> and the [United Nations Human Rights Council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council "United Nations Human Rights Council"), condemned the crackdown as violating international law, with the latter body expelling Libya outright in an unprecedented action.<sup id="cite_ref-92"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-92">[89]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-93"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-93">[90]</a></sup> On 17 March 2011 the UN Security Council passed [Resolution 1973](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1973 "United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973"),<sup id="cite_ref-94"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-94">[91]</a></sup> with a 10–0 vote and five abstentions including Russia, China, India, Brazil and Germany.

Following the defeat of loyalist forces, Libya was torn among numerous rival, armed militias affiliated with distinct regions, cities and tribes, while the central government had been weak and unable to effectively exert its authority over the country. Competing militias pitted themselves against each other in a political struggle between Islamist politicians and their opponents.<sup id="cite_ref-103"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-103">[100]</a></sup> On 7 July 2012, Libyans held their first parliamentary elections since the end of the former regime.

In June 2014, [elections were held](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Libyan_parliamentary_election "2014 Libyan parliamentary election") to the [House of Representatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_(Libya) "House of Representatives (Libya)"), a new legislative body intended to take over from the [General National Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_National_Congress "General National Congress").

[Field Marshal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_Marshal "Field Marshal") [Khalifa Haftar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalifa_Haftar "Khalifa Haftar"), the head of the [Libyan National Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_National_Army "Libyan National Army"), one of the main factions in the [2014 civil war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Civil_War_(2014%E2%80%93present) "Libyan Civil War (2014–present)")

In January 2015, meetings were held with the aim to find a peaceful agreement between the rival parties in Libya. The so-called Geneva-Ghadames talks were supposed to bring the GNC and the Tobruk government together at one table to find a solution of the internal conflict. However, the GNC actually never participated, a sign that internal division not only affected the "Tobruk Camp", but also the "Tripoli Camp". Meanwhile, terrorism within Libya steadily increased, also affecting neighbouring countries. The [terrorist attack against the Bardo Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardo_National_Museum_attack "Bardo National Museum attack") in [Tunisia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia "Tunisia") on 18 March 2015 was reportedly carried out by two Libyan-trained militants.<sup id="cite_ref-125"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-125">[122]</a></sup>

During 2015 an extended series of diplomatic meetings and peace negotiations were supported by the United Nations, as conducted by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG), Spanish diplomat [Bernardino León](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardino_Le%C3%B3n "Bernardino León").<sup id="cite_ref-126"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-126">[123]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-127"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-127">[124]</a></sup> UN support for the SRSG-led process of dialogue carried on in addition to the usual work of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL).<sup id="cite_ref-128"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-128">[125]</a></sup>

In July 2015 SRSG Leon reported to the UN Security Council on the progress of the negotiations, which at that point had just achieved a political agreement on 11 July setting out "a comprehensive framework... includ\[ing\] guiding principles... institutions and decision-making mechanisms to guide the transition until the adoption of a permanent constitution." The stated purpose of that process was "...intended to culminate in the creation of a modern, democratic state based on the principle of inclusion, the rule of law, separation of powers and respect for human rights." The SRSG praised the participants for achieving agreement, stating that "The Libyan people have unequivocally expressed themselves in favour of peace." The SRSG then informed the Security Council that "Libya is at a critical stage" and urging "all parties in Libya to continue to engage constructively in the dialogue process", stating that "only through dialogue and political compromise, can a peaceful resolution of the conflict be achieved. A peaceful transition will only succeed in Libya through a significant and coordinated effort in supporting a future Government of National Accord...". Talks, negotiations and dialogue continued on during mid-2015 at various international locations, culminating at Skhirat in Morocco in early September.<sup id="cite_ref-129"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-129">[126]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-130"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-130">[127]</a></sup>

Libya is bounded to the north by the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea"), the west by [Tunisia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia "Tunisia") and [Algeria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria "Algeria"), the southwest by [Niger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger "Niger"), the south by [Chad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad "Chad"), the southeast by [Sudan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan "Sudan"), and the east by [Egypt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt "Egypt"). Libya lies between latitudes [19°](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/19th_parallel_north "19th parallel north") and [34°N](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/34th_parallel_north "34th parallel north"), and longitudes [9°](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/9th_meridian_east "9th meridian east") and [26°E](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/26th_meridian_east "26th meridian east").

At 1,770 kilometres (1,100 mi), Libya's coastline is the longest of any African country bordering the Mediterranean.<sup id="cite_ref-147"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-147">[144]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-148"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-148">[145]</a></sup> The portion of the Mediterranean Sea north of Libya is often called the [Libyan Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Sea "Libyan Sea"). The climate is mostly extremely dry and desertlike in nature. However, the northern regions enjoy a milder [Mediterranean climate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_climate "Mediterranean climate").<sup id="cite_ref-149"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-149">[146]</a></sup>

Six ecoregions lie within Libya's borders: [Saharan halophytics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saharan_halophytics "Saharan halophytics"), [Mediterranean dry woodlands and steppe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_dry_woodlands_and_steppe "Mediterranean dry woodlands and steppe"), [Mediterranean woodlands and forests](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_woodlands_and_forests "Mediterranean woodlands and forests"), [North Saharan steppe and woodlands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Saharan_steppe_and_woodlands "North Saharan steppe and woodlands"), [Tibesti-Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibesti-Jebel_Uweinat_montane_xeric_woodlands "Tibesti-Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands"), and [West Saharan montane xeric woodlands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Saharan_montane_xeric_woodlands "West Saharan montane xeric woodlands").<sup id="cite_ref-DinersteinOlson2017_150-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-DinersteinOlson2017-150">[147]</a></sup>

Natural hazards come in the form of hot, dry, dust-laden [sirocco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirocco "Sirocco") (known in Libya as the _gibli_). This is a southern wind blowing from one to four days in spring and autumn. There are also [dust storms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_storm "Dust storm") and [sandstorms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_storm "Dust storm"). [Oases](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oasis "Oasis") can also be found scattered throughout Libya, the most important of which are [Ghadames](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghadames "Ghadames") and [Kufra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kufra "Kufra").<sup id="cite_ref-WorldCulturalHeritage_151-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-WorldCulturalHeritage-151">[148]</a></sup> Libya is one of the sunniest and driest countries in the world due to prevailing presence of desert environment.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Libya was a pioneer state in North Africa in species protection, with the creation in 1975 of the El Kouf protected area. The fall of Muammar Gaddafi's regime favoured intense [poaching](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaching "Poaching"): "Before the fall of Gaddafi even hunting rifles were forbidden. But since 2011, poaching has been carried out with weapons of war and sophisticated vehicles in which one can find up to 200 gazelle heads killed by militiamen who hunt to pass the time. We are also witnessing the emergence of hunters with no connection to the tribes that traditionally practice hunting. They shoot everything they find, even during the breeding season. More than 500,000 birds are killed in this way each year, when protected areas have been seized by tribal chiefs who have appropriated them. The animals that used to live there have all disappeared, hunted when they are edible or released when they are not," explains zoologist Khaled Ettaieb.<sup id="cite_ref-152"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-152">[149]</a></sup>

### Libyan Desert [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Libya&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Libyan Desert")

Libya is a predominantly desert country. Over 95% of the land area is covered in desert.<sup id="cite_ref-153"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-153">[150]</a></sup>

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Water_Stress,_Top_Countries_(2020).svg)

Libya is the fourth-most water-stressed country in the world.

The [Libyan Desert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Desert "Libyan Desert"), which covers most of Libya, is one of the most arid and sun-baked places on earth.<sup id="cite_ref-SalakLibya_63-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-SalakLibya-63">[60]</a></sup> In places, decades may pass without seeing any rainfall at all, and even in the [highlands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_(geography) "Highland (geography)") rainfall seldom happens, once every 5–10 years. At [Uweinat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jebel_Uweinat "Jebel Uweinat"), as of 2006 the last recorded rainfall was in September 1998.<sup id="cite_ref-Libdesert_154-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Libdesert-154">[151]</a></sup>

Likewise, the temperature in the Libyan Desert can be extreme; on 13 September 1922, the town of ['Aziziya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Aziziya "'Aziziya"), which is located southwest of [Tripoli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripoli,_Libya "Tripoli, Libya"), recorded an air temperature of 58 °C (136.4 °F), considered to be a world record.<sup id="cite_ref-155"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-155">[152]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Death_Valley_156-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Death_Valley-156">[153]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-El_Azizia_157-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-El_Azizia-157">[154]</a></sup> In September 2012, however, the world record figure of 58 °C was determined to be invalid by the [World Meteorological Organization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization "World Meteorological Organization").<sup id="cite_ref-Death_Valley_156-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Death_Valley-156">[153]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-El_Azizia_157-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-El_Azizia-157">[154]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-158"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-158">[155]</a></sup>

There are a few scattered uninhabited small oases, usually linked to the major depressions, where water can be found by digging to a few feet in depth. In the west there is a widely dispersed group of oases in unconnected shallow depressions, the Kufra group, consisting of Tazerbo, Rebianae and [Kufra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kufra "Kufra").<sup id="cite_ref-Libdesert_154-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Libdesert-154">[151]</a></sup> Aside from the scarps, the general flatness is only interrupted by a series of [plateaus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau "Plateau") and massifs near the centre of the Libyan Desert, around the convergence of the Egyptian-Sudanese-Libyan borders.

Slightly further to the south are the [massifs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massif "Massif") of Arkenu, Uweinat, and Kissu. These [granite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granite "Granite") mountains are ancient, having formed long before the sandstones surrounding them. Arkenu and Western Uweinat are ring complexes very similar to those in the [Aïr Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%AFr_Mountains "Aïr Mountains"). Eastern Uweinat (the highest point in the Libyan Desert) is a raised sandstone plateau adjacent to the granite part further west.<sup id="cite_ref-Libdesert_154-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Libdesert-154">[151]</a></sup>

The plain to the north of Uweinat is dotted with eroded volcanic features. With the discovery of oil in the 1950s also came the discovery of a massive [aquifer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquifer "Aquifer") underneath much of Libya. The water in the [Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nubian_Sandstone_Aquifer_System "Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System") pre-dates the last [Ice ages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age "Ice age") and the Sahara Desert itself.<sup id="cite_ref-159"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-159">[156]</a></sup> This area also contains the [Arkenu structures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkenu_structures "Arkenu structures"), which were once thought to be two impact craters.<sup id="cite_ref-CigoliniOthers2012a_160-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-CigoliniOthers2012a-160">[157]</a></sup>

Districts of Libya since 2007

Historically, the area of Libya was considered three provinces (or states), [Tripolitania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripolitania "Tripolitania") in the northwest, [Barka (Cyrenaica)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaica "Cyrenaica") in the east, and [Fezzan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fezzan "Fezzan") in the southwest.

Libya is a large country with a relatively small population concentrated very narrowly along the coast.<sup id="cite_ref-249"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-249">[246]</a></sup> Its population density is about 50 inhabitants per square kilometre (130/sq mi) in the two northern regions of [Tripolitania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripolitania "Tripolitania") and [Cyrenaica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaica "Cyrenaica"), but falls to less than 1 inhabitant per square kilometre (2.6/sq mi) elsewhere. Ninety percent of the people live along the coast in less than 10% of the area.

About 88% of the population is urban, mostly concentrated in the three largest cities, [Tripoli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripoli,_Libya "Tripoli, Libya"), [Benghazi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benghazi "Benghazi") and [Misrata](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misrata "Misrata").

The population of Libya is primarily of [Arab](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs "Arabs") ancestry.<sup id="cite_ref-253"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-253">[250]</a></sup> Arabs comprise 92% of the population, while [Berbers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers "Berbers") comprise 5%.<sup id="cite_ref-254"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-254">[251]</a></sup> Unofficial estimates put the number of Berbers in Libya at around 600,000, about 10% of the population of Libya.<sup id="cite_ref-255"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-255">[252]</a></sup> Among the Berber groups are the minority Berber populations of [Zuwarah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuwarah "Zuwarah") and the [Nafusa Mountains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nafusa_Mountains "Nafusa Mountains"). Southern Libya, primarily [Sebha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebha "Sebha"), [Kufra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kufra "Kufra"), [Ghat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghat,_Libya "Ghat, Libya"), [Ghadamis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghadamis "Ghadamis") and [Murzuk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murzuk "Murzuk"), is also inhabited by two other ethnic groups; the [Tuareg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuareg_people "Tuareg people") and [Toubou](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toubou_people "Toubou people"). Libya is one of the world's most [tribal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribalism "Tribalism") countries. There are about 140 tribes and [clans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan "Clan") in Libya.<sup id="cite_ref-256"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-256">[253]</a></sup> Additionally, there are an estimated 750,000 [Egyptian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptians "Egyptians") workers residing in Libya, which had declined from the 2 million Egyptians in Libya prior to the [2011 Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Libyan_Civil_War "First Libyan Civil War") that led to the overthrow of Libyan leader [Muammar Gaddafi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi "Muammar Gaddafi").<sup id="cite_ref-257"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-257">[254]</a></sup>

Family life is important for Libyan families, the majority of whom live in [apartment blocks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_block "Tower block") and other independent housing units, with modes of housing depending on their income and wealth. Although the Arab Libyans traditionally lived nomadic [Bedouin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin "Bedouin") lifestyles in tents, they have predominately settled in towns and cities.<sup id="cite_ref-258"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-258">[255]</a></sup>

Because of this, their old ways of life are gradually fading out. An unknown small number of Libyans still live in the desert as their families have done for centuries. Most of the population has occupations in industry and [services](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy "Tertiary sector of the economy"), and a small percentage is in agriculture.

According to the UNHCR, there were around 8,000 registered refugees, 5,500 unregistered refugees, and 7,000 asylum seekers of various origins in Libya in January 2013. Additionally, 47,000 Libyan nationals were internally displaced and 46,570 were internally displaced returnees.<sup id="cite_ref-259"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-259">[256]</a></sup>

A unique health number allotted to each citizen will facilitate access to medical records. Before Storm Daniel, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that around 60,000 people were in need of humanitarian aid in Derna and environs. Since the storm many of the hospitals and primary health facilities in Derna and eastern Libya have been rendered partially or completely nonfunctional.<sup id="cite_ref-262"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-262">[259]</a></sup>

### Ethnicity [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Libya&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Ethnicity")

The original inhabitants of Libya belonged predominantly to [Berber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_people "Berber people") ethnic groups; however, the long series of foreign invasions and migrations – particularly by [Arabs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs "Arabs") – had a profound and lasting ethnic, linguistic, and cultural influence on Libyan demographics. Centuries of large-scale [Arab migration to the Maghreb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_migration_to_the_Maghreb "Arab migration to the Maghreb") since the 7th century shifted the demographics of Libya in favor of Arabs. Some [Turks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_people "Turkish people") settled in Libya during the rule of the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire").

Most of Libya's inhabitants are [Arab](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs "Arabs"),<sup id="cite_ref-:2_19-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-:2-19">[16]</a></sup> with many tracing their ancestry to Bedouin Arab tribes like [Banu Sulaym](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Sulaym "Banu Sulaym") and [Banu Hilal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Hilal "Banu Hilal"), plus Turkish and Berber minorities. The [Turkish minority](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turks_in_Libya "Turks in Libya") are often called "[Kouloughlis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kouloughlis "Kouloughlis")" and are concentrated in and around villages and towns.<sup id="cite_ref-268"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-268">[265]</a></sup> There are some ethnic minorities, such as the Berber [Tuareg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuareg_people "Tuareg people") and the Black African [Tebou](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toubou_people "Toubou people").<sup id="cite_ref-Dupree_1958_loc=33-44_269-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Dupree_1958_loc=33-44-269">[266]</a></sup>

Most [Italian settlers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_settlers_in_Libya "Italian settlers in Libya"), at their height numbering over half a million, left after Italian Libya's independence in 1947. More repatriated in 1970 after the accession of Muammar Gaddafi, but a few hundred returned in the 2000s.<sup id="cite_ref-270"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-270">[267]</a></sup>

### Foreign Labour [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Libya&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Foreign Labour")

As of 2023 the IOM estimates that approximately 10% of Libya's population (upwards of 700,000 people) constituted foreign labour.<sup id="cite_ref-271"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-271">[268]</a></sup> Prior to the 2011 revolution, official and unofficial figures of migrant labour ranged from 25% to 40% of the population (between 1.5 and 2.4 million people). Historically, Libya hosted millions of low- and high-skilled Egyptian migrants, in particular.<sup id="cite_ref-272"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-272">[269]</a></sup>

It is difficult to estimate the total number of immigrants in Libya because the census figures, official counts and typically more accurate unofficial estimates all differ. In the 2006 census, around 359,540 foreign nationals were resident in Libya out of a population of over 5.5 million (6.35% of the population). Almost half of these were Egyptians, followed by Sudanese and Palestinian immigrants.<sup id="cite_ref-EU_migrant_policy_Centre_273-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-EU_migrant_policy_Centre-273">[270]</a></sup> During the 2011 revolution, 768,362 immigrants fled Libya as calculated by the [IOM](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Migration "International Organization for Migration"), around 13% of the population at the time, although many more stayed on in the country.<sup id="cite_ref-EU_migrant_policy_Centre_273-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-EU_migrant_policy_Centre-273">[270]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-274"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-274">[271]</a></sup>

If consular records prior to the revolution are used to estimate the immigrant population, as many as 2 million Egyptian migrants were recorded by the Egyptian embassy in Tripoli in 2009, followed by 87,200 Tunisians, and 68,200 Moroccans by their respective embassies. Turkey recorded the evacuation of 25,000 workers during the 2011 uprising.<sup id="cite_ref-275"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-275">[272]</a></sup> The number of Asian migrants before the revolution were just over 100,000 (60,000 Bangladeshis, 20,000 Filipinos, 18,000 Indians, 10,000 Pakistanis, as well as Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai and other workers).<sup id="cite_ref-276"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-276">[273]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-277"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-277">[274]</a></sup> This would put the immigrant population at almost 40% before the revolution and is a figure more consistent with government estimates in 2004 which put the regular and irregular migrant numbers at 1.35 to 1.8 million (25–33% of the population at the time).<sup id="cite_ref-EU_migrant_policy_Centre_273-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-EU_migrant_policy_Centre-273">[270]</a></sup>

Libya's native population of Arabs-Berbers as well as Arab migrants of various nationalities collectively make up 97% of the population as of 2014.

### Languages [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Libya&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Languages")

According to the [CIA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA "CIA"), the official language of Libya is Arabic.<sup id="cite_ref-Cfbly_278-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Cfbly-278">[275]</a></sup> The local [Libyan Arabic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Arabic "Libyan Arabic") variety is spoken alongside [Modern Standard Arabic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Standard_Arabic "Modern Standard Arabic").

About 97% of the population in Libya are [Muslims](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims "Muslims"), most of whom belong to the [Sunni branch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam "Sunni Islam").<sup id="cite_ref-spooks_235-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-spooks-235">[232]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Chivvis-2014_281-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Chivvis-2014-281">[278]</a></sup> Small numbers of [Ibadi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibadi "Ibadi") Muslims live in the country.<sup id="cite_ref-282"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-282">[279]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-283"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-283">[280]</a></sup>

Before the 1930s, the [Senussi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senussi "Senussi") Sunni Sufi movement was the primary Islamic movement in Libya. This was a religious revival adapted to desert life. Its _zawaaya_ (lodges) were found in [Tripolitania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripolitania "Tripolitania") and [Fezzan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fezzan "Fezzan"), but Senussi influence was strongest in [Cyrenaica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaica "Cyrenaica"). Rescuing the region from unrest and anarchy, the Senussi movement gave the Cyrenaican tribal people a religious attachment and feelings of unity and purpose.<sup id="cite_ref-senussi_284-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-senussi-284">[281]</a></sup> This Islamic movement was eventually destroyed by the [Italian invasion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italo-Turkish_War "Italo-Turkish War"). Gaddafi asserted that he was a devout Muslim, and his government was taking a role in supporting Islamic institutions and in worldwide proselytising on behalf of Islam.<sup id="cite_ref-285"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-285">[282]</a></sup>

The [International Religious Freedom Report](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Religious_Freedom_Report "International Religious Freedom Report") 2004 noted that "bishops, priests and nuns wear religious dress freely in public and report virtually no discrimination," while also "enjoying good relations with the Government". The report also indicated that members of minority religions said "they do not face harassment by authorities or the Muslim majority on the basis of their religious practices". The [International Christian Concern](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Christian_Concern "International Christian Concern") does not list Libya as a country where there is "persecution or severe discrimination against Christians".<sup id="cite_ref-286"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-286">[283]</a></sup>

Since the [fall of Gaddafi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Libyan_Civil_War "First Libyan Civil War"), ultra-conservative strains of Islam have reasserted themselves in places. [Derna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derna,_Libya "Derna, Libya") in eastern Libya, historically a hotbed of [jihadist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihad "Jihad") thought, came under the control of militants aligned with the [Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant "Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant") in 2014.<sup id="cite_ref-287"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-287">[284]</a></sup> Jihadist elements have also spread to [Sirte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirte "Sirte") and [Benghazi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benghazi "Benghazi"), among other areas, as a result of the [Second Libyan Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Libyan_Civil_War_(2014%E2%80%93present) "Second Libyan Civil War (2014–present)").<sup id="cite_ref-288"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-288">[285]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-289"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-289">[286]</a></sup>

Prior to independence, Libya was home to more than 140,000 Christians (mostly of [Italian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_settlers_in_Libya "Italian settlers in Libya") and Maltese ancestry). Many Christian settlers left to Italy or Malta after the independence.<sup id="cite_ref-290"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-290">[287]</a></sup> Small foreign communities of Christians remained. [Coptic Orthodox Christianity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_Orthodox_Church "Coptic Orthodox Church"), the predominant Christian church of Egypt, is the [largest and most historic Christian denomination in Libya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_Orthodox_Church_in_Africa#Libya,_Tunisia,_Algeria_and_Morocco "Coptic Orthodox Church in Africa"). There are about 60,000 Egyptian [Copts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copt "Copt") in Libya.<sup id="cite_ref-291"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-291">[288]</a></sup> There are three Coptic Churches in Libya, one in Tripoli, one in Benghazi, and one in Misurata.

The Coptic Church has grown in recent years in Libya, due to the growing immigration of Egyptian Copts to Libya. There are an estimated 40,000 [Roman Catholics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") in Libya who are served by two bishops, one in Tripoli (serving the Italian community) and one in [Benghazi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benghazi "Benghazi") (serving the [Maltese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltese_people "Maltese people") community). There is also a small [Anglican](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican "Anglican") community, made up mostly of African immigrant workers in Tripoli which is part of the [Anglican Diocese of Egypt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican_Diocese_of_Egypt "Anglican Diocese of Egypt"). People have been arrested on suspicion of being [Christian missionaries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_missionaries "Christian missionaries"), as proselytising is illegal.<sup id="cite_ref-292"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-292">[289]</a></sup> Christians have also faced the threat of violence from radical Islamists in some parts of the country, with a well-publicised video released by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in February 2015 depicting the mass beheading of Christian Copts.<sup id="cite_ref-293"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-293">[290]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-294"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-294">[291]</a></sup> Libya was ranked fourth on [Open Doors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Doors "Open Doors")' 2022 World Watch List, an annual ranking of the 50 countries where Christians face the most extreme persecution.<sup id="cite_ref-295"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-295">[292]</a></sup>

Libya was once the home of one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world, dating back to at least 300 BC.<sup id="cite_ref-296"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-296">[293]</a></sup> In 1942, the Italian Fascist authorities set up forced labor camps south of Tripoli for the Jews, including Giado (about 3,000 Jews), Gharyan, Jeren, and Tigrinna. In Giado some 500 Jews died of weakness, hunger, and disease. In 1942, Jews who were not in the concentration camps were heavily restricted in their economic activity and all men between 18 and 45 years were drafted for forced labor. In August 1942, Jews from Tripolitania were interned in a concentration camp at Sidi Azaz. In the three years after November 1945, more than 140 Jews were murdered, and hundreds more wounded, in a series of [pogroms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom "Pogrom").<sup id="cite_ref-harris_297-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-harris-297">[294]</a></sup> By 1948, about 38,000 Jews remained in the country. Upon Libyan independence in 1951, most of the Jewish community emigrated.

Many Arabic speaking Libyans consider themselves as part of a wider Arab community. This was strengthened by the spread of Pan-Arabism in the mid-20th century, and their reach to power in Libya where they instituted Arabic as the only official language of the state. Under Gaddafi's rule, the teaching and even use of indigenous [Berber language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_language "Berber language") was strictly forbidden.<sup id="cite_ref-298"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-298">[295]</a></sup> In addition to banning foreign languages previously taught in academic institutions, leaving entire generations of Libyans with limitations in their comprehension of the English language. Both the spoken Arabic dialects and Berber, still retain words from Italian, that were acquired before and during the _[Libia Italiana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Libya "Italian Libya")_ period.

Libyans have a heritage in the traditions of the previously nomadic [Bedouin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin "Bedouin") Arabic speakers and sedentary [Berber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers "Berbers") tribes. Most Libyans associate themselves with a particular family name originating from tribal or conquest based heritage.

Reflecting the "nature of giving" ([Arabic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): الاحسان __Ihsan__, [Berber languages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_languages "Berber languages"): ⴰⵏⴰⴽⴽⴰⴼ Anakkaf ), amongst the Libyan people as well as the sense of hospitality, recently the state of Libya made it to the top 20 on the world giving index in 2013.<sup id="cite_ref-299"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-299">[296]</a></sup> According to CAF, in a typical month, almost three-quarters (72%) of all Libyans helped somebody they did not know – the third highest level across all 135 countries surveyed.

There are few theaters or art galleries due to the decades of cultural repression under the Qaddafi regime and lack of infrastructure development under the regime of dictatorship.<sup id="cite_ref-300"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-300">[297]</a></sup> For many years there have been no public theaters, and only very few cinemas showing foreign films. The tradition of [folk culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_culture "Folk culture") is still alive and well, with troupes performing music and dance at frequent festivals, both in Libya and abroad.<sup id="cite_ref-301"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-301">[298]</a></sup>

A large number of [Libyan television](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_in_Libya "Television in Libya") stations are devoted to political review, Islamic topics and cultural phenomena. A number of TV stations air various styles of traditional Libyan music.<sup>[<i>? <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="The text near this tag may need clarification or removal of jargon. (August 2012)">clarification needed</span></a></i>]</sup> [Tuareg music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuareg_music "Tuareg music") and dance are popular in [Ghadames](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghadames "Ghadames") and the south. Libyan television broadcasts air programs mostly in Arabic though usually have time slots for English and French programs.<sup>[<i>? <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="The text near this tag may need clarification or removal of jargon. (August 2012)">clarification needed</span></a></i>]</sup> A 1996 analysis by the [Committee to Protect Journalists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_to_Protect_Journalists "Committee to Protect Journalists") found Libya's media was the most tightly controlled in the Arab world during the country's dictatorship.<sup id="cite_ref-mediacont_302-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-mediacont-302">[299]</a></sup> As of 2012 hundreds of TV stations have begun to air due to the collapse of censorship from the old regime and the initiation of "free media".

Many Libyans frequent the country's beach and they also visit Libya's archaeological sites—especially [Leptis Magna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptis_Magna "Leptis Magna"), which is widely considered to be one of the best preserved Roman archaeological sites in the world.<sup id="cite_ref-303"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-303">[300]</a></sup> The most common form of public transport between cities is the bus, though many people travel by automobile. There are no railway services in Libya, but these are planned for construction in the near future (see [rail transport in Libya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport_in_Libya "Rail transport in Libya")).<sup id="cite_ref-304"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-304">[301]</a></sup>

Libya's capital, [Tripoli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripoli,_Libya "Tripoli, Libya"), has many museums and archives. These include the Government Library, the Ethnographic Museum, the Archaeological Museum, the National Archives, the Epigraphy Museum and the Islamic Museum. The [Red Castle Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Castle_Museum "Red Castle Museum") located in the capital near the coast and right in the city center, built in consultation with [UNESCO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO "UNESCO"), may be the country's most famous.<sup id="cite_ref-305"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-305">[302]</a></sup>

### Cuisine [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Libya&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Cuisine")

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bazin.jpg)

[Bazeen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bazin_(bread) "Bazin (bread)"), a communal bread dish

Libyan cuisine is a mixture of the different [Italian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_cuisine "Italian cuisine"), Bedouin and traditional Arab culinary influences.<sup id="cite_ref-306"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-306">[303]</a></sup> Pasta is the staple food in the Western side of Libya, whereas rice is generally the staple food in the east.

Common Libyan foods include several variations of red (tomato) sauce based pasta dishes (similar to the Italian [Sugo all'arrabbiata](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrabbiata_sauce "Arrabbiata sauce") dish); rice, usually served with lamb or chicken (typically stewed, fried, grilled, or boiled in-sauce); and [couscous](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couscous "Couscous"), which is steam cooked whilst held over boiling red (tomato) sauce and meat (sometimes also containing courgettes/zucchini and chickpeas), which is typically served along with cucumber slices, lettuce and olives.

[Bazeen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bazeen "Bazeen"), a dish made from barley flour and served with red tomato sauce, is customarily eaten communally, with several people sharing the same dish, usually by hand. This dish is commonly served at traditional weddings or festivities. [Asida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asida "Asida") is a sweet version of Bazeen, made from white flour and served with a mix of honey, ghee or butter. Another favorite way to serve Asida is with [rub](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rub_(syrup) "Rub (syrup)") (fresh date syrup) and olive oil. [Usban](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usban "Usban") is animal tripe stitched and stuffed with rice and vegetables cooked in tomato based soup or steamed. [Shurba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorba "Chorba") is a red tomato sauce-based soup, usually served with small grains of pasta.<sup id="cite_ref-307"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-307">[304]</a></sup>

A very common snack eaten by Libyans is known as _khubs bi' tun_, literally meaning "bread with tuna fish", usually served as a baked baguette or pita bread stuffed with tuna fish that has been mixed with [harissa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harissa "Harissa") (chili sauce) and olive oil. Many snack vendors prepare these sandwiches and they can be found all over Libya. Libyan restaurants may serve international cuisine, or may serve simpler fare such as lamb, chicken, vegetable stew, potatoes and [macaroni](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaroni "Macaroni").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (June 2019)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Due to severe lack of infrastructure, many under-developed areas and small towns do not have restaurants and instead food stores may be the only source to obtain food products. Alcohol consumption is illegal in the entire country.<sup id="cite_ref-308"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-308">[305]</a></sup>

There are four main ingredients of traditional Libyan food: [olives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive "Olive") (and [olive oil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_oil "Olive oil")), [dates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_palm "Date palm"), grains and milk.<sup id="cite_ref-Libyan_Food_309-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Libyan_Food-309">[306]</a></sup> Grains are roasted, ground, sieved and used for making bread, cakes, soups and bazeen. Dates are harvested, dried and can be eaten as they are, made into syrup or slightly fried and eaten with [bsisa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bsisa "Bsisa") and milk. After eating, Libyans often drink black tea. This is normally repeated a second time (for the second glass of tea), and in the third round of tea, it is served with roasted peanuts or roasted [almonds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almond "Almond") known as _shay bi'l-luz_ (mixed with the tea in the same glass).<sup id="cite_ref-Libyan_Food_309-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-Libyan_Food-309">[306]</a></sup>

### Sport [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Libya&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Sport")

[Football](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football "Association football") is the most popular sport in Libya. The country hosted the [1982 African Cup of Nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_African_Cup_of_Nations "1982 African Cup of Nations") and almost qualified for the [1986 FIFA World Cup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_FIFA_World_Cup "1986 FIFA World Cup"). The [national team](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya_national_football_team "Libya national football team") almost won the 1982 AFCON; they lost to [Ghana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana_national_football_team "Ghana national football team") on penalties 7–6. In 2014, Libya won the African Nations Championship after beating Ghana in the finals. Although the national team has never won a major competition or qualified for a World Cup, there is still lots of passion for the sport and the quality of football is improving.<sup id="cite_ref-310"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-310">[307]</a></sup> It also participated in many Summer Olympics, such as the [2016 Summer Olympics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Summer_Olympics "2016 Summer Olympics"), the [2008 Summer Olympics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics "2008 Summer Olympics") and more.

Horse racing is also a popular sport in Libya. It is a tradition of many special occasions and holidays.<sup id="cite_ref-311"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#cite_note-311">[308]</a></sup>
