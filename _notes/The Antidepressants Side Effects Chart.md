## Antidepressants Side Effects Chart

Antidepressants have transformed the field of mental health treatment, offering relief to millions of individuals struggling with **[depression](https://www.whatmedicine.org/2023/08/step-by-step-how-to-combat-depression.html)**. However, like any medication, they can come with potential side effects that need to be carefully considered. 

To help users better navigate the difficult landscape of antidepressant side effects, **[WhatMedicine](https://www.whatmedicine.org/)** presents a notable resource; an extensive chart that compares the likelihood of various side effects based on different antidepressant medications. The chart serves to easily visualize the comparison between the antidepressant's side effects. 

Moreover, it's not just an SSRI side effects chart, but it compares a wide variety of antidepressants from different pharmacological groups. The main supporting reference used to compile this chart is [**UpToDate**](http://www.uptodate.com/), a trusted evidence-based clinical decision support resource.

## Antidepressants Side Effects Chart

The antidepressants side effects chart offers a concise yet comprehensive overview of the most common side effects associated with various antidepressant medications. Whether you are about to start a new antidepressant or are curious about potential alternatives, this chart may serve as an invaluable resource.

Antidepressant drugs are prescribed [**more than ever**](https://www.whatmedicine.org/2023/08/increased-use-of-antidepressants-Canada.html) before and their use in medicine extends beyond psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. They may be used to treat insomnia, premature ejaculation, neuropathic pain, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and much more.

The chart categorizes the side effects based on their likelihood and compares them across different antidepressant drugs. This way, users can easily identify which side effects are more prevalent with specific medications, allowing for a more informed decision-making process.

## Individual Variability

Antidepressants are widely prescribed for depressive disorders, but it's important to acknowledge that these medications can affect individuals in vastly different ways. Some users may experience minor side effects, while others may encounter more significant problems.  
  
The antidepressant side effects chart lists the most frequent side effects from the most **[commonly prescribed](https://www.whatmedicine.org/2023/10/the-most-common-antidepressants.html)** medications for major depressive disorder.

Not all clinically important side effects are listed in this chart, even common side effects that may occur in most antidepressants, such as hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), dry mouth, headaches, **[skin reactions](https://www.whatmedicine.org/2023/09/your-skin-on-zoloft.html)**, and more.

### **General Guidance, Not Individual Truth**

****By providing a comprehensive chart comparing different antidepressant side effects, we aim to empower individuals to understand the potential risks associated with their chosen medication.  
****  
Keep in mind that a number '4' in the chart doesn't equal guaranteed side effects in a particular individual from a certain drug, nor does a '0' exclude the possibility that a patient may experience the corresponding side effect.

Additionally, the whole topic surrounding side effects is complex and there is room for interpretation. For example, Escitalopram is listed as a '0' for drowsiness, however, one of the more commonly reported side effects is fatigue and somnolence. 

  

### Explanation of Side Effects

Below is a brief explanation of each side effect brought out in the chart above.

#### 1\. Sexual Dysfunction

Antidepressants can lead to sexual dysfunction, including reduced libido, difficulty achieving or maintaining erections (erectile dysfunction), and problems with orgasm in both men and women. This occurs due to the impact of certain antidepressants on neurotransmitters and hormones that regulate sexual function.

#### 2\. Gastrointestinal Discomfort

It's quite common to experience gastrointestinal side effects when starting new antidepressants. These side effects include such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or stomach upset. They may arise from the effect of antidepressants on certain receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, which can disrupt normal digestive processes. Commonly, these unwanted effects subside after 1 or 2 weeks of taking the medication.

#### 3\. Weight Gain

Unfortunately, certain antidepressants are associated with weight gain, most likely due to their impact on appetite regulation. This side effect can be concerning, as it may contribute to further emotional distress for individuals already dealing with depressive symptoms. In a few cases, as with underweight patients, these can be a wanted side effect of the medication.

#### 4\. QTc Prolongation

QTc prolongation is a cardiac side effect where the interval between certain points in the heart's electrical cycle becomes extended. Some antidepressants can affect the heart's electrical activity, potentially leading to irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias). This is particularly important to keep in mind for individuals with preexisting heart conditions. 

#### 5\. Hypotension

Hypotension, or low blood pressure, can occur as a side effect of certain antidepressants. This can lead to dizziness, lightheadedness, and even fainting when standing up quickly. It's recommended to monitor blood pressure regularly during the initial stages of taking a new medication. Some antidepressants may also cause [**high blood pressure**](https://www.whatmedicine.org/2024/02/antidepressant-choice-high-blood-pressure.html), but these are not noted in this chart.

#### 6\. Insomnia

Insomnia is originally a Latin word, and it means difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. Insomnia can be triggered or exacerbated by some antidepressants. Adjusting the timing of medication intake or using adjunctive sleep aids may help manage said side effects.

#### 7\. Drowsiness

Drowsiness or tiredness is a common side effect of many antidepressants, especially those that have a sedative effect on the central nervous system. In some cases, it can be considered a wanted side effect, as with individuals struggling with insomnia. That said, excessive drowsiness during the day can impair daily functioning and increase the risk of falls, especially in the elderly.

  
  

## The Effects on Liver & Kidneys

Antidepressants, across the board, carry the rare risk of causing **[hepatotoxicity](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13050709#:~:text=All%20antidepressants%20can%20induce%20hepatotoxicity,generally%20unrelated%20to%20drug%20dosage.)**, particularly in elderly individuals and those taking multiple medications. The occurrence of liver damage is often unpredictable, with no consistent correlation to drug dosage. 

As for the kidneys, Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are generally not recommended for individuals with kidney failure. However, among the more commonly prescribed antidepressants, several are considered [**safe for the kidneys**](https://www.whatmedicine.org/2023/09/safe-antidepressants-for-kidneys-GFR.html).

Certain medications necessitate dose adjustments based on renal function, as is the case with Venlafaxine. In contrast, others, such as Paroxetine, can typically be administered at standard doses without the need for lowering the dosage.

## Find An Antidepressant That May Suit You

Every individual's journey with antidepressant treatment is unique, and the ability to explore and compare side effects can greatly enhance the overall treatment experience. In addition, not all antidepressants are equal. Their mechanism of action varies a lot between the aforementioned drugs. For instance, Venlafaxine, found in Effexor, acts as a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), whereas the most commonly prescribed antidepressants belong to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) group. Then there are 'atypical antidepressants' with various mechanisms of action, such as Mirtazapine, Bupropion, and Trazodone.

Understanding these pharmacological differences is important as it sheds light on why certain side effects may be more prevalent with specific medications.

  
Take our **[antidepressant quiz](https://www.whatmedicine.org/p/antidepressant-quiz.html)** which consists of 20 questions. It may help you find a potentially suitable antidepressant for you, which you can further discuss with your psychiatrist.

### Consult With Your Psychiatrist

Whether you explore the chart or take our quiz, it is important to always consult a healthcare specialist, such as a psychiatrist, who can provide personalized guidance and address any concerns or specific considerations.   
Moreover, the listed side effects are not absolute guarantees, yet it's essential to be adequately informed about them. Each individual's response to antidepressants may vary**,** thus the chart serves as a general guide based on available clinical data.  
We'd like to emphasize that clear communication between the prescribing healthcare provider and patient about potential side effects is key in building rapport and increasing treatment adherence, as **[up to 33%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181894/)** of all patients chose to discontinue their prescribed antidepressant due to intolerable side effects.    

## Key Data & Clinical Pearls  

The antidepressants side effects graph only provides general guidance on the risk of encountering different side effects (gastrointestinal discomfort, sexual dysfunction, weight gain, QTc prolongation, hypotension, insomnia, drowsiness). Below, we present key data for each antidepressant, including its brand name and other clinically significant side effects or information associated with the medication. Note that this is not an exhaustive list of side effects for each medication.
