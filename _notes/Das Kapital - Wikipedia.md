_**Capital: A Critique of Political Economy**_ (German: _**Das Kapital. Kritik der politischen Ökonomie**_), also known as _**Capital**_, is a foundational theoretical text in [materialist philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_materialism "Historical materialism") and [critique of political economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critique_of_political_economy "Critique of political economy") written by [Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx "Karl Marx"), published as three volumes in 1867, 1885, and 1894. The culmination of his life's work, the text contains Marx's analysis of [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism"), to which he sought to apply his theory of historical materialism "to lay bare the economic law of motion of modern society", following from [classical political economists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_economics "Classical economics") such as [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith "Adam Smith") and [David Ricardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo "David Ricardo"). The text's second and third volumes were completed from Marx's notes after his death and published by his colleague [Friedrich Engels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Engels "Friedrich Engels"). _Das Kapital_ is the most cited book in the social sciences published before 1950.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>

Marx's theory of historical materialism posits that the [economic structure of society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_and_superstructure "Base and superstructure") – in particular, the [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productive_forces "Productive forces") and [relations of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relations_of_production "Relations of production") – are the crucial factors in shaping its nature. Rather than a simple description of capitalism as an [economic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_model "Economic model"), _Das Kapital_ instead examines capitalism as a historical epoch and a [mode of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_of_production "Mode of production"), and seeks to trace its origins, development, and decline. Marx argues that capitalism is a form of economic organization which has arisen and developed in a specific historical context, and which contains tendencies and contradictions which will inevitably lead to its decline and collapse. Marx considered _Das Kapital_ a [scientific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_socialism "Scientific socialism") work, and in it critiqued both the system and [bourgeois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie "Bourgeoisie") political economists who argue that it is efficient and stable.

## Themes\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Das_Kapital&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Themes")\]

In _Das Kapital_ (1867), Marx proposes that the motivating force of [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism") is in the [exploitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation_of_labour "Exploitation of labour") of [labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_(economics) "Labour (economics)"), whose unpaid work is the ultimate source of [surplus value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surplus_value "Surplus value"). The [owner of the means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employer "Employer") is able to claim the right to this surplus value because they are legally protected by the [ruling regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_state "Capitalist state") through [property rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_rights "Property rights") and the legally established distribution of [shares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_(finance) "Share (finance)") which are by law distributed only to company owners and their board members. The historical section shows how these rights were acquired in the first place chiefly through plunder and conquest and the activity of the merchant and "middle-man". In producing [capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(economics) "Capital (economics)"), the workers continually reproduce the economic conditions by which they labour. _Das Kapital_ proposes an explanation of the "laws of motion" of the capitalist economic system from its origins to its future by describing the dynamics of the accumulation of capital, the growth of [wage labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_labour "Wage labour"), the transformation of the workplace, the concentration of capital, commercial competition, the [banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banking "Banking") system, the [decline of the profit rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendency_of_the_rate_of_profit_to_fall "Tendency of the rate of profit to fall"), land-rents, _et cetera_. The critique of the political economy of capitalism proposes:

-   Wage-labour is the basic "cell-form" (trade unit) of a capitalist society. Moreover, because commerce as a human activity implied no [morality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics "Ethics") beyond that required to buy and sell goods and services, the growth of the market system made discrete entities of the economic, the moral, and the legal spheres of human activity in society; hence, subjective [moral value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_value "Moral value") is separate from objective economic value. Subsequently, [political economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_economy "Political economy") (the just [distribution of wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth "Distribution of wealth")) and "political arithmetic" (about taxes) were reorganized into three discrete fields of human activity, namely [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"), [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law "Law") and [ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics "Ethics")—politics and economics were divorced.
-   "The economic formation of society \[is\] a process of natural history". Thus, it is possible for a [political economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_economy "Political economy") to objectively study the scientific laws of capitalism, given that its expansion of the market system of commerce had [objectified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectification "Objectification") human economic relations. The use of [money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money "Money") (cash nexus) voided religious and political illusions about its [economic value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_value_(economics) "Theory of value (economics)") and replaced them with [commodity fetishism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_fetishism "Commodity fetishism"), the belief that an object (commodity) has inherent economic value. Because societal economic formation is a historical process, no one person could control or direct it, thereby creating a global complex of social connections among capitalists. The economic formation (individual commerce) of a society thus precedes the human administration of an economy (organised commerce).
-   The structural contradictions of a capitalist economy (German: _gegensätzliche Bewegung)_ describe the contradictory movement originating from the two-fold character of labour and so the [class struggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_struggle "Class struggle") between [labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_(economics) "Labour (economics)") and [capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism"), the [wage labourer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_labour "Wage labour") and the [owner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie "Bourgeoisie") of the [means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production "Means of production"). These capitalist economic contradictions operate "behind the backs" of the capitalists and the workers as a result of their activities and yet remain beyond their immediate [perceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception "Perception") as men and women and as [social classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class "Social class").<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
-   The economic crises ([recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession "Recession"), [depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(economics) "Depression (economics)"), _et cetera_) that are rooted in the contradictory character of the economic value of the commodity (cell-unit) of a capitalist society are the conditions that lead to [proletarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat "Proletariat") [revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution "Revolution")—which _[The Communist Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Communist_Manifesto "The Communist Manifesto")_ (1848) collectively identified as a weapon forged by the capitalists which the working class "turned against the [bourgeoisie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie "Bourgeoisie") itself".
-   In a capitalist economy, [technological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology") improvement and its consequent increased production augment the amount of [material wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth "Wealth") ([use value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_value "Use value")) in society while simultaneously diminishing the [economic value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(economics) "Value (economics)") of the same wealth, thereby [diminishing the rate of profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendency_of_the_rate_of_profit_to_fall "Tendency of the rate of profit to fall")—a [paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox "Paradox") characteristic of economic crisis in a capitalist economy. "Poverty in the midst of plenty" consequent to over-production and under-consumption.

After two decades of economic study and preparatory work (especially regarding the theory of [surplus value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surplus_value "Surplus value")), the first volume appeared in 1867 as _The Production Process of Capital_. After Marx's death in 1883, Engels introduced Volume II: _The Circulation Process of Capital_ in 1885; and Volume III: _The Overall Process of Capitalist Production_ in 1894 from manuscripts and the first volume. These three volumes are collectively known as _Das Kapital_.

## Synopsis\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Das_Kapital&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Synopsis")\]

### _Capital, Volume I_\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Das_Kapital&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Capital, Volume I")\]

_[Das Kapital, Volume I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital,_Volume_I "Das Kapital, Volume I")_ (1867) is a critical analysis of political economy, meant to reveal the contradictions of the [capitalist mode of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_mode_of_production_(Marxist_theory) "Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)"), how it was the precursor of the [socialist mode of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_mode_of_production "Socialist mode of production") and of the [class struggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_struggle "Class struggle") rooted in the capitalist social relations of production. The first of three volumes of _Das Kapital_ was published on 14 September 1867, dedicated to [Wilhelm Wolff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Wolff "Wilhelm Wolff") and was the sole volume published in Marx's lifetime.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

### _Capital, Volume II_\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Das_Kapital&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Capital, Volume II")\]

_[Das Kapital, Volume II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital,_Volume_II "Das Kapital, Volume II")_, subtitled _The Process of Circulation of Capital_, was prepared by Engels from notes left by Marx and published in 1885. It is divided into three parts:

1.  The Metamorphoses of Capital and Their Circuits
2.  The Turnover of Capital
3.  The [Reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction_(economics) "Reproduction (economics)") and Circulation of the Aggregate Social Capital.

In _Volume II_, the main ideas behind the marketplace are to be found, namely how value and surplus-value are realized. Its focuses aren't so much the worker and the industrialist (as in Volume I), but rather the money owner and money lender, the wholesale merchant, the trader and the entrepreneur or functioning capitalist. Moreover, workers appear in Volume II essentially as buyers of consumer goods and therefore as sellers of the [commodity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_(Marxism) "Commodity (Marxism)") [labour power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_power "Labour power"), rather than producers of value and [surplus-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surplus-value "Surplus-value"), although this latter quality established in Volume I remains the solid foundation on which the whole of the unfolding analysis is based.

Marx wrote in a letter sent to Engels on 30 April 1868: "In Book 1 \[...\] we content ourselves with the assumption that if in the self-expansion process £100 becomes £110, the latter will find _already in existence in the market_ the elements into which it will change once more. But now we investigate the conditions under which these elements are found at hand, namely the social intertwining of the different capitals, of the component parts of capital and of revenue (= s)".<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> This intertwining, conceived as a movement of commodities and of money, enabled Marx to work out at least the essential elements, if not the definitive form of a coherent theory of the trade cycle, based upon the inevitability of periodic disequilibrium between supply and demand under the [capitalist mode of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_mode_of_production_(Marxist_theory) "Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)") ([Ernest Mandel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Mandel "Ernest Mandel"), Intro to Volume II of _Capital_, 1978). Part 3 is the point of departure for the topic of [capital accumulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_accumulation "Capital accumulation") which was given its Marxist treatment later in detail by [Rosa Luxemburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Luxemburg "Rosa Luxemburg"), among others.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

### _Capital, Volume III_\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Das_Kapital&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Capital, Volume III")\]

_[Das Kapital, Volume III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital,_Volume_III "Das Kapital, Volume III")_, subtitled _The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole_, was prepared by Engels from notes left by Marx and published in 1894. It is divided into seven parts:

1.  The conversion of Surplus Value into [Profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_(economics) "Profit (economics)") and the rate of Surplus Value into the rate of Profit
2.  Conversion of Profit into Average Profit
3.  The Law of the [Tendency of the Rate of Profit to Fall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendency_of_the_rate_of_profit_to_fall "Tendency of the rate of profit to fall")
4.  Conversion of Commodity Capital and Money Capital into Commercial Capital and Money-Dealing Capital (Merchant's Capital)
5.  Division of Profit Into Interest and Profit of Enterprise, Interest Bearing Capital.
6.  Transformation of Surplus-Profit into Ground [Rent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_rent "Economic rent").
7.  Revenues and Their Sources

The work is best known today<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> for Part 3 which in summary says that as the organic fixed capital requirements of production rise as a result of advancements in production generally, the [rate of profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_profit "Rate of profit") [tends to fall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendency_of_the_rate_of_profit_to_fall "Tendency of the rate of profit to fall"). This result which [orthodox Marxists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Marxism "Orthodox Marxism") believe is a principal contradictory characteristic leading to an inevitable collapse of the capitalist order was held by Marx and Engels to—as a result of various contradictions in the capitalist [mode of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_of_production "Mode of production")—result in [crises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_theory "Crisis theory") whose resolution necessitates the emergence of an entirely new mode of production as the culmination of the same historical dialectic that led to the emergence of capitalism from prior forms.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

The third volume is highly controversial, peculiarly the tenth chapter, as some economists feel like Marx contradicted himself with the [Marxian fundamental value theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value "Labor theory of value") while trying to tackle the [transformation problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_problem "Transformation problem").<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

## Intellectual influences\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Das_Kapital&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Intellectual influences")\]

The purpose of _Das Kapital_ (1867) was a scientific foundation for the politics of the modern [labour movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_movement "Labour movement"). The analyses were meant "to bring a [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_economy "Political economy"), by criticism, to the point where it can be [dialectically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectics "Dialectics") represented" and so "reveal the law of motion of modern society"<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (August 2016)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> to describe how the [capitalist mode of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_mode_of_production_(Marxist_theory) "Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)") was the precursor of the [socialist mode of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_mode_of_production "Socialist mode of production"). The argument is an analysis of the [classical economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_economics "Classical economics") of [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith "Adam Smith"), [David Ricardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo "David Ricardo"), [John Stuart Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill "John Stuart Mill") and [Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin "Benjamin Franklin"), drawing on the [dialectical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic "Dialectic") method that [G. W. F. Hegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel "Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel") developed in _[Science of Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_of_Logic "Science of Logic")_ and _[The Phenomenology of Spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phenomenology_of_Spirit "The Phenomenology of Spirit")_. Other intellectual influences on _Capital_ were the French socialists [Charles Fourier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Fourier "Charles Fourier"), [Henri de Saint-Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_de_Saint-Simon "Henri de Saint-Simon"), [Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Charles_L%C3%A9onard_de_Sismondi "Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi") and [Pierre-Joseph Proudhon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon "Pierre-Joseph Proudhon").

At university, Marx wrote a dissertation comparing the [philosophy of nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_nature "Philosophy of nature") in the works of the philosophers [Democritus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus "Democritus") (circa 460–370 BC) and [Epicurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus "Epicurus") (341–270 BC). The logical architecture of _Das Kapital_ is derived in part from the _[Politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_(Aristotle) "Politics (Aristotle)")_ and the _[Nicomachean Ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachean_Ethics "Nicomachean Ethics")_ by Aristotle, including the fundamental distinction between [use value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_value "Use value") and [exchange value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_value "Exchange value"),<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> the [syllogisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogisms "Syllogisms") ([C-M-C'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-M-C%27 "C-M-C'") and [M-C-M'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-C-M%27 "M-C-M'")) for simple commodity circulation and the circulation of [value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(economics) "Value (economics)") as [capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(economics) "Capital (economics)").<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> Moreover, the description of [machinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinery "Machinery") under capitalist relations of production as "self-acting [automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata "Automata")" derives from Aristotle's speculations about inanimate instruments capable of obeying commands as the condition for the abolition of [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery "Slavery"). In the 19th century, Marx's research of the available politico-economic literature required twelve years, usually in the [British Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Library "British Library") in London.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

At the time of his death (1883), Marx had prepared the manuscript for _Das Kapital, Volume IV_, a critical history of theories of [surplus value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surplus_value "Surplus value") of his time, the 19th century, based on the earlier manuscript _[Theories of Surplus Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theories_of_Surplus_Value "Theories of Surplus Value")_ (1862–63). The philosopher [Karl Kautsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Kautsky "Karl Kautsky") (1854–1938) published a partial edition of Marx's surplus-value critique and later published a full, three-volume edition as _Theorien über den Mehrwert_ (_[Theories of Surplus Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theories_of_Surplus_Value "Theories of Surplus Value")_, 1905–1910).

## Translations\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Das_Kapital&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Translations")\]

The first translated publication of _Das Kapital_ was in the [Russian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire") in March 1872. It was the first foreign publication and the English edition appeared in 1887.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> Despite [Russian censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_the_Russian_Empire "Censorship in the Russian Empire") proscribing "the harmful doctrines of [socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism "Socialism") and [communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism "Communism")", the Russian censors considered _Das Kapital_ as a "strictly scientific work" of [political economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_economy "Political economy"), the content of which did not apply to [monarchic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy "Absolute monarchy") Russia, where "capitalist [exploitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation_of_labour "Exploitation of labour")" had never occurred and was officially dismissed, given "that very few people in [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_history,_1892%E2%80%931917 "Russian history, 1892–1917") will read it, and even fewer will understand it". Nonetheless, Marx acknowledged that Russia was the country where _Das Kapital_ "was read and valued more than anywhere". For instance, the Russian edition was the fastest selling as 3,000 copies were sold in one year while the German edition took five years to sell 1,000, therefore the Russian translation sold fifteen times faster than the German original.<sup id="cite_ref-A_People's_Tragedy_1996_pg._139_14-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-A_People's_Tragedy_1996_pg._139-14">[14]</a></sup>

The foreign editions of _Capital. Critique of Political Economy_ (1867) by [Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx "Karl Marx") include a Russian translation by the [revolutionary socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_socialism "Revolutionary socialism") [Mikhail Bakunin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bakunin "Mikhail Bakunin") (1814–1876). Marx revised, rewrote, and monitored a French translation, published in 44 installments from August 1872 through May 1875, and then as a single work with a printing of ten thousand copies, the largest up until then.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> Eventually, Marx's work was translated into all major languages. The definitive critical edition of Marx's works, known as MEGA II (_[Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe "Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe")_), <sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> includes _Das Kapital_ in German (only the first volume is in French) and shows all the versions and alterations made to the text as well as a very extensive apparatus of footnotes and cross-references.

The first unabridged translation of Das Kapital to Bengali was done by professor [Piyush Dasgupta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyush_Dasgupta "Piyush Dasgupta"). It was published in six volumes by Baniprakash, Kolkata, India between 1974 and 1983.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>

### English Translations\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Das_Kapital&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: English Translations")\]

The English translation of volume 1 by [Samuel Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Moore_(translator_of_Das_Kapital) "Samuel Moore (translator of Das Kapital)") and [Eleanor Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Marx "Eleanor Marx")'s partner [Edward Aveling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Aveling "Edward Aveling"), overseen by Engels, was published in 1887 as _Capital: A Critical Analysis of Capitalist Production_ by [Swan Sonnenschein, Lowrey, & Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Swan_Sonnenschein "William Swan Sonnenschein")<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> This was reissued in the 1970s by [Progress Publishers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_Publishers "Progress Publishers") in Moscow, while a more recent English translation was made by Ben Fowkes and David Fernbach (the Penguin edition).

## Reviews\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Das_Kapital&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Reviews")\]

In 2017, the historian [Gareth Stedman Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Stedman_Jones "Gareth Stedman Jones") wrote in the Books and Arts section of the scientific journal _[Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal) "Nature (journal)")_:<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

> What is extraordinary about _Das Kapital_ is that it offers a still-unrivalled picture of the dynamism of capitalism and its transformation of societies on a global scale. It firmly embedded concepts such as commodity and capital in the lexicon. And it highlights some of the vulnerabilities of capitalism, including its unsettling disruption of states and political systems. \[...\] If _Das Kapital_ has now emerged as one of the great landmarks of nineteenth-century thought, it is \[because it connects\] critical analysis of the economy of his time with its historical roots. In doing so, he inaugurated a debate about how best to reform or transform politics and social relations, which has gone on ever since.

Positive reception also cited the soundness of the methodology used in producing the book, which is called immanent critique. This approach, which starts from simple category and gradually unfolds into complex categories, employed "internal" criticism that finds contradiction within and between categories while discovering aspects of reality that the categories cannot explain.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_23-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-:0-23">[23]</a></sup> This meant that Marx had to build his arguments on historical narratives and empirical evidence rather than the arbitrary application of his ideas in his evaluation of capitalism.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_23-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-:0-23">[23]</a></sup>

On the other hand, _Das Kapital_ has also received criticism. There are theorists who claimed that this text was unable to reconcile capitalist exploitation with prices dependent upon subjective wants in exchange relations.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> Marxists generally reply that only [socially necessary labor time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socially_necessary_labor_time "Socially necessary labor time"), that is, labor which is spent on commodities for which there is market-demand, can be considered productive labour and therefore exploited on Marx's account. There are also those who argued that Marx's so-called [immiseration thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immiseration_thesis "Immiseration thesis") is presumed to mean that the [proletariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat "Proletariat") is absolutely immiserated.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability"><span title="The material near this tag failed verification of its source citation(s). (May 2019)">failed verification</span></a></i>]</sup> The existing scholarly consensus tends towards the opposite view that Marx believed that only relative immiseration would occur, that is, a fall in labor's share of output.<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> Marx himself frequently polemicized against the view "that the amount of real wages ... is a fixed amount."<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>

The value \[of labour\] was declared to be 'the common factor which appears in the exchange relation of commodities' (i. 13). We were told, in the form and with the emphasis of a stringent syllogistic conclusion, allowing of no exception, that to set down two commodities as equivalents in exchange implied that 'a common factor of the same magnitude' existed in both, to which each of the two 'must be reducible' (i. 11). (...) And now in the third volume (...) that individual commodities do and must exchange with each other in a proportion different from that of the labour incorporated in them, and this not accidentally and temporarily, but of necessity and permanently. I cannot help myself; I see here no explanation and reconciliation of a contradiction, but the bare contradiction itself. Marx's third volume contradicts the first. The theory of the average rate of profit and of the prices of production cannot be reconciled with the theory of value. This is the impression which must, I believe, be received by every logical thinker. And it seems to have been very generally accepted. Loria, in his lively and picturesque style, states that he feels himself forced to the 'harsh but just judgment' that Marx 'instead of a solution has presented a mystification.'

Marx credits Aristotle for being the "first to analyze \[...\] the form of value". In addition, he identifies the categories of use and exchange value with the Aristotlean distinction between the _Oeconomic_ and the _Chrematisitic_. In the _Politics_, the former is defined as value in use while the latter is defined as a practice in which exchange value becomes an end unto itself.
