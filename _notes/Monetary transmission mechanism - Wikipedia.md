From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The **monetary transmission mechanism** is the process by which [asset prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance) "Valuation (finance)") and general economic conditions are affected as a result of [monetary policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy "Monetary policy") decisions. Such decisions are intended to influence the [aggregate demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_demand "Aggregate demand"), [interest rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate "Interest rate"), and [amounts of money and credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply "Money supply") to affect overall economic performance. The traditional monetary transmission mechanism occurs through interest rate channels, which affect interest rates, costs of borrowing, levels of [physical investment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_(economics) "Investment (economics)"), and aggregate demand. Additionally, frictions in the [credit markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_market "Credit market"), known as the credit view, can affect aggregate demand. In short, the monetary transmission mechanism can be defined as the link between monetary policy and aggregate demand.

## Traditional interest rate channels\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monetary_transmission_mechanism&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Traditional interest rate channels")\]

An interest rate channel may be categorized as traditional, which means monetary policy affects [real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_interest_rate "Real interest rate") (rather than nominal) interest rates, which influence investment, spending on new housing, [consumer spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending "Consumer spending"), and [aggregate demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_demand "Aggregate demand"). An easing of monetary policy in the traditional view leads to a decrease in real interest rates, which lowers the cost of borrowing, resulting in greater investment spending, involving an overall increase in aggregate demand.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_transmission_mechanism#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>

## Credit view\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monetary_transmission_mechanism&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Credit view")\]

In addition to the traditional interest rate channel, which focuses on the effects of interest rate changes, there are other methods through which monetary policy can influence economic outcomes and aggregate demand. These alternative channels are classified under the credit view,<sup id="cite_ref-Mishkin_2-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_transmission_mechanism#cite_note-Mishkin-2">[2]</a></sup> which argues that financial frictions in the credit markets create additional channels that lead to changes in aggregate demand. These channels operate through effects on bank lending, as well as the effects on the balance sheet of a given firm or household.<sup id="cite_ref-Mishkin_2-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_transmission_mechanism#cite_note-Mishkin-2">[2]</a></sup>

-   Bank lending channel

Monetary policy affects [bank deposits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_deposit "Bank deposit"), leading to changes in the amount of [bank loans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_loan "Bank loan") and investment in residential housing.<sup id="cite_ref-Mishkin_2-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_transmission_mechanism#cite_note-Mishkin-2">[2]</a></sup>

-   Balance sheet channel

Monetary policy affects [stock prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_price "Stock price"), leading to [moral hazard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard "Moral hazard") and [adverse selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_selection "Adverse selection"), which leads to changes in lending activity and investment<sup id="cite_ref-Mishkin_2-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_transmission_mechanism#cite_note-Mishkin-2">[2]</a></sup>

-   Cash flow channel

Monetary policy leads to changes in [nominal interest rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_interest_rate "Nominal interest rate"), which affects cash flow, leading to moral hazard, adverse selection, and changes in lending activity and investment<sup id="cite_ref-Mishkin_2-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_transmission_mechanism#cite_note-Mishkin-2">[2]</a></sup>

-   Unanticipated price level channel

Monetary policy can lead to unanticipated [price level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_level "Price level") changes, resulting in moral hazard, adverse selection, and changes in lending activity and investment<sup id="cite_ref-Mishkin_2-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_transmission_mechanism#cite_note-Mishkin-2">[2]</a></sup>

-   Household liquidity effects

Monetary policy affects stock prices, leading to changes in financial wealth and the probability of financial distress, which affects residential housing and consumer spending<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_transmission_mechanism#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

## Other asset price effects\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monetary_transmission_mechanism&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Other asset price effects")\]

Finally, other asset price effects have separate channels allowing monetary policy to influence aggregate demand:

-   Exchange rate effects on net exports

Monetary policy affects real interest rates and the [exchange rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate "Exchange rate"), leading to changes in [net exports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_exports "Net exports")<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_transmission_mechanism#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

-   Tobin's _q_ theory

Monetary policy affects stock prices, leading to changes in [Tobin's q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobin%27s_q "Tobin's q") (the market value of firms divided by the replacement cost of capital) and investment<sup id="cite_ref-Mishkin_2-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_transmission_mechanism#cite_note-Mishkin-2">[2]</a></sup>

-   Wealth effects

Monetary policy affects stock prices, which affects financial wealth and consumption (consumer spending on nondurable goods and services)<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_transmission_mechanism#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

-   Uncertainty channel

Stock prices respond more aggressively and asymmetrically to monetary policy under high uncertainty. The time-varying link between monetary policy and stock prices depends on uncertainty.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_transmission_mechanism#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>
