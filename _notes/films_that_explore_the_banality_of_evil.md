## Films that explore the Banality of Evil ...

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1b948yg/films_that_explore_the_banality_of_evil/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1b948yg/films_that_explore_the_banality_of_evil/)

> Hello there fellow cinephiles -
> 
> I'd appreciate your collective knowledge for some film viewing suggestions. I'm writing a thesis on the Banality of Evil examined in modern cinema.
> 
> Hannah Arendt came up with this term in a now infamous essay to address Eichmann at his trial. Long story short, she contested that Eichmann - a Nazi architect and implementer of the Holocaust - had an element of "thoughtlessness" to his actions, never felt true guilt as he was just doing his job / taking orders, etc despite the obscene and horrifying actions being ordered and implemented from his desk. This is only the the preliminary of a point she was making and the essay is both vastly comprehensive and vastly contested, but t's a start point for where I'm going...
> 
> Think the most recent film The Zone of Interest. Now this is very close to home in the literal subject of the Arendt essay, but it masterfully portrayed the domestic life of a aspiring young German family whilst horrors were being enacted just over the wall. We saw glimpses of their dehumanising and evil behaviours but they were so subtly disguised by the flow of their daily lives.
> 
> I'm looking for other films that explore / address this theme. I've taken a long look at Haenke - especially his early work.

> Any and all suggestions are greatly appreciated!

	I just watched Michael Clayton (2007) and I think it could be a good fit. It revolves around a business who's practices are causing health issues in people in the community. The film lets you observe the company's CEO as she focuses all her power on keeping the business and it's reputation in good standing with no real concern for those they harmed. It's also about the lawyers hired to defend them and weather they do their job in the firm and support or refuse to do their job and side with the victims even if it means consequences.

			One that could potentially fit following this mold is Margin Call from 2011 by JC Chandor. It's inspired by the 2008 financial crisis and follows a firm trying to do damage control. There's a great scene of someone that's brought in from a consulting firm just coldly laying off Stanley Tucci. It's been a while since I've seen the film, so it may not fit - but it's worth a gander.

	The Act of Killing (2013) - documentary focusing on the violence perpetuated by the military junta in Indonesia. I watched this film in a Human Rights in Film &amp; Literature class that used Arendt’s essay as criticism. It’s… mind-blowing. I had to watch it twice.

	Colonia Dignidad (2023) - documentary focused on the infamous German colony in Chile that was used as a black ops site for Pinochet’s reign of terror. Just watched it recently and it’s interesting to listen to the survivors explain why they stayed when they knew what was going on.

	Depending on how deep you want to dive into the subject of cults, there are many recent documentaries that rely on survivor testimony to explore the questions of “why didn’t you leave?” or “why didn’t you say/do something?” Just know that going down this rabbit hole is… well… it’s a rabbit hole I’m still in, so… don’t waste too much time.

	I am limiting my recommendations to the two docs listed above because they focus more on specific points in history where the conditions were similar to those in Nazi Germany. I think they both pair nicely with Arendt’s essay.

		The Act of Killing was so incredible because the people you watch talking and joking have actually killed hundreds of people. They aren't actors. But they are also normal people. And they live normal lives. It left me with a ton of different, conflicting emotions.

			The act of killing is absolutely what you are looking for. Not only they recreate their murders frivolously, they even engage in dreamy Hollywood sequences where they act all dressed up like musicals, the cognitive dissonance is so strong. They talk about murdering tens of thousands almost in a bored way and then are excited about dressing up as cowboys.

			I think it’s easy to be seduced by these extreme events, circumstances or personality’s and miss the larger point, which the word “banal” captures: boring, ordinary, and not original.  Every day people are harming others in small and large ways, and yet we point to Hitler, Nazi’s, and in this example, a cult leader as a demonstration of evil.  Well of course it is.  
			
			A bit of a ramble here, but something that’s banal is a behavior that’s made acceptable or normal, and when you look around at society there’s a lot of banal ways in which people harm or ruin other people’s lives.  But who’s looking for the banal?  Who sees it?  Often it’s succeeding generations that see the previous generations trespasses.  We’re so busy pointing at the extreme and obvious evils of a Hitler or a cult leader that we fail to recognize our own.  Maybe that’s partly the point.

	Particularly in that context, Conspiracy ([available on MAX](https://www.max.com/movies/conspiracy/16e1e931-e01f-452d-a2d8-676216e38eb2?utm_medium=sharebutton&amp;utm_id=5D933EF8-593A-4C3A-9717-72EE672E36B3) at least in the U.S.) fits the bill, to say the least.

	Absolutely chilling film. It really conveys how bureaucratic and impassionate the decisions that led to the Holocaust were, and the way they try to rationalize their decisions is just horrifying. The most “heroic” character (they’re all absolute monsters) is Wilhelm Stuckart played by Colin Firth and he’s one of the worst people you could ever know, a sniveling stickler for some of the most hateful and damaging laws ever enacted, that he is significantly responsible for. Yet the others are so barbaric, and casually so, that he almost comes off as the reasonable one.

	The whole banality of evil notion rings especially true in that movie, not least because Adolf Eichmann himself plays a major role. Certain characters have certain misgivings (almost solely for self-aggrandizing or logistical reasons), but it’s basically all treated as one big dinner party.

		Watched this last night thanks to your mention of it. Deeply, deeply disturbing film. Subject matter aside I also thought it was just an incredible depiction of group polarization and poor group decision making in real time. The way that the meeting took on its own momentum and direction, sweeping up the reluctant members to go along with whatever was presented. The tacit sense of fear and conformity that was in their eyes. And, as is the topic of this thread, the banality of it. Their little quips and jokes, or comments on the food, etc.

		* 🟧 **[ThingsAreAfoot](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThingsAreAfoot)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-03-11 11:02:16)_

			Glad you enjoyed it, if that’s even the right word heh.  And good analysis. 
			
			Kenneth Branagh was especially impressive to me as Heydrich, the way he would twist the meeting and the others to his own agenda, which you can see he had already decided on before the meeting even took place. 
			
			I don’t remember if he ever *directly* threatened any of the other members at the table, or at least overtly rather than with insinuation, but there was always the implicit threat, especially as Heydrich was so menacing as head of the SS that even other top Nazis were wary of him. And Branagh communicated so much with just that… impossibly cold stare of his. 
			
			Of course it is Kenneth Branagh, and in something like this that is basically a stage play, he’s certainly gonna do his thing.

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 34 _(2024-03-07 17:16:36)_

	Since "The Act of Killing" and "Conspiracy" have already been mentioned, how about "Waltz with Bashir"?

	The film is a depiction of the Lebanon War and the Sabra and Shatila massacre through the eyes of the film's director Ari Folman: an ex Israeli soldier who might or might not have been involved.

	During the film, he interviews many of his ex batallion comrades, trying to understand what happened and why he can't remember the day of the massacre.

	Although the film is a documentary, it is fully animated. Folman used this style to try to reflect the surreal and fragmented nature of memory and trauma.

	* 🟨 **[pimasecede](https://www.reddit.com/user/pimasecede)** ⬆️ 13 _(2024-03-07 18:00:17)_

		Waltz with Bashir is an interesting suggestion. Not sure I agree as an example of the banality of evil, but I think everyone should watch it. The dream sequences are genuinely some of the most captivating animation I’ve ever seen. 
		
		Act of Killing for sure, and just a 10/10 all around.

	* 🟨 **[Longjumping_Gain_807](https://www.reddit.com/user/Longjumping_Gain_807)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-03-07 20:08:22)_

		It is so sad to see Ari Folman follow up Waltz with Bashir with The Congress. Seriously The Congress is one of the worst films I’ve seen this year. And it’s insane because I really liked Waltz with Bashir. It was a poignant story that is part documentary and other part biography. It detailed personal experiences. It makes you feel something and tells you a story from another perspective. That movie was one of the best movies I saw in 2023.
		
		But if you were gonna mention Waltz With Bashir I’d also mention The Dissident. About the Saudi journalist that got killed. It’s the perfect film that centers around evil governments and how these people need to flee from their home country and even then they cannot escape when their government targets them for daring to speak out.

	As you mentioned Haneke films are the closest philosophically to Ardent and aesthetically to the Zone Of Interest. Especially Hidden, the White Ribbon, Benny's Video and Funny Games

	There is a spanish film from the early 00s from Jaime Rosales called "Las horas del día".

	The Act Of Killing is most probably the only film that had physically made sick before Zone of Interest.

	Compliance is such a twisted true film, that totally captures this idea.

	Please also check Dog Days and all of the films by Ulrich Seidl.

	Finally the Conformist by Bertolucci is an unparalleled masterpiece about the same subject

	Lord of War with Nicholas Cage comes to mind. A gun runner who relies on the inevitability of war to justify his occupation even though it slowly eats away his humanity. 

	Not as 121 as Zone of Interest but it probably applies.

	Scorsese’s recent Killers of the Flower Moon. DiCaprio’s character is one of the best portrayals of the concept. A good-hearted man capable of unspeakable evil through his own willful inability to introspect. To the very end, the two facts remain true: that he sincerely loves his wife, and he’s poisoning her.

	 Also: This Must Be The Place (Sorrentino 2013).

	* 🟨 **[MisterManatee](https://www.reddit.com/user/MisterManatee)** ⬆️ 24 _(2024-03-07 17:27:33)_

		Hale, especially, never seems to come to terms with the fact that what he has done is monstrous. Pure evil.

	* 🟨 **[VitaminTea](https://www.reddit.com/user/VitaminTea)** ⬆️ 24 _(2024-03-07 17:34:54)_

		This is a great case study because it contrasts Ernest with DeNiro’s Bill Hale -- who I think fits better into the classic “banality of evil” archetype, while Burkhart has a lot of Useful Idiot stuff mixed into his characterization.
		
		The whole movie is kind of a mediation on the different shades of evil that perpetrated the violence on the Osage. Scott Sheperd &amp; Louis Cancelmi’s characters are also varying degrees of this idea. The scene when Kelsie Morrison (Cancelmi) asks the insurance agent about collecting on the deaths of his adoptive children is chilling on a factual level, but played for laughs. A great example.

				Yes, we would all love to believe that. But the whole point of the banality of evil is that evil is… *banal*. The most ordinary people in the world are capable of it. Ernest can be both a mass murderer and a loving father, a kind man. The Nazi rank and file were full of ordinary people kissing their children before punching the clock at Dachau.

		The Killers of the Flower Moon did not need dramatization. The book alone, without characterization, was proof enough that humanity will exploit any weekends or loophole, regardless of spiritual cost. Edit punctuation?

	* 🟨 **[ExoticPumpkin237](https://www.reddit.com/user/ExoticPumpkin237)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-03-08 12:02:05)_

		That's what I came out thinking about the movie, it's a really vivid depiction of how conspiracies work in reality (Casino and Goodfellas also show this too) , and just a culture of terror. In this case it's a really open conspiracy because of the racism towards Indians but it's even crazier in the book how deep the conspiracy was, how many people went along with it, how many people went missing. IMO the movie actually downplayed the events in a lot of places.

	Do experimental documentaries count? 

	&amp;#x200B;

	If so, two films by Joshua Oppenheimer are extraordinary : The Act of Killing (2012) and The Look of Silence  (2014) provide an insight into the banality of evil in that it humanises mass murder(ers) and deals with the aftermath of killings.

	&amp;#x200B;

	The Act of Killing is particularly interesting in that it looks at the murders through the eyes of the perpetrators, and we see how they incorporate Hollywood film tropes (heroes and villains, good versus evil, etc) into justifying their acts. 

	&amp;#x200B;

	In fact, it's their recreations (or recollections through reenacted 'scenes') that show how 'banal' evil can be.

	Any time the banality of evil comes up I can’t help but think of animal agriculture. What we do to animals is deliberately hidden away because most people would prefer not to think about what their money is actually paying for.

	Dominion (2018) is a fantastic documentary that exposes this stuff.

* 🟩 **[BlackManWithaHorn](https://www.reddit.com/user/BlackManWithaHorn)** ⬆️ 21 _(2024-03-07 16:22:58)_

	Michael (2011). A very disturbing yet low-key film about a pedophile who keeps a boy locked up in his basement. None of the abuse is dramatized though it’s very sickeningly implied, while much of the film follows the main character in his mundane day-to-day activities, such as trying to get a promotion in the office, resting up in the hospital from an accident, going on a ski-trip with friends. Certainly one of the most compelling films I’ve seen about the banality of evil. Very Haneke-esque—the writer and co-director was the casting director for several of Haneke’s films, so a direct influence is likely.

* 🟩 **[weoutheeyah](https://www.reddit.com/user/weoutheeyah)** ⬆️ 14 _(2024-03-07 16:36:09)_

	The International (2009) is one of THE most unsung movies in this genre.

	Clive Owen, at the peak of his powers, plays an INTERPOL agent investigating the two-way arms-dealing of an HSBC-like megabank. Sources get assassinated left and right, replaced with new cogs, as the machine marches ever on. Not a classic film, but as fun a watch as Michael Clayton imo. 

	Fantastic score by the director himself, Tom Tykwer.

	Seeing the ending, as a child, really shaped how I view the many systems that make up our world. That the most dominant forms of evil come in beige and charcoal colors, and hide in plain sight.

* 🟩 **[Holy_Chromoly](https://www.reddit.com/user/Holy_Chromoly)** ⬆️ 8 _(2024-03-07 23:42:25)_

	Not a film but in my opinion Utopia, the UK version, fits the bill. It's got bits from all the already mentioned films like the conspiracy and the international, yet produced in a disturbingly camp style which I think gives it nightmarish quality.

* 🟩 **[The_Dex](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Dex)** ⬆️ 10 _(2024-03-07 17:22:51)_

	No Country for Old Men and Badlands might be good choices for thoughtless evil. Under the Skin, also by the Zone of Interest director, could be a good touch point too for seeing how the Nazi’s sensibilities and goals are so alien to us. 

	Burn After Reading could be a funny/interesting choice re: how the human lives of the characters are affected are treated totally instrumentally by the secret agents in covering up their mess. Blade Runner and 2049 are interesting options too re: how free will and the humanity of the victims should factor into our evaluation of evil.

		I don’t think any of those people examples illustrate the banality of evil at all. Anton Chighur is larger than life, almost mythic figure of menacing evil; a glutinous sex monster from outer space is the polar opposite of banal; nobody in Burn After Reading rises to the level of evil; ditto for the Blade Runner films.

	I haven't seen any of these movies mentioned, so I don't know to what extent they anticipate that Arendt actually walked out of that trial before it was revealed that Eichmann was putting a mask of normalcy and was much more intentional and informed in his crimes than he wanted people to believe. It's 'mundane' today in that it's not a far cry from various criminal psychopathologies that employ instrumental violence we are researching in prisons today, it's... morbidly typical in a small percentage of the population. A different neurotype. Perhaps 'Mindhunter' would be a good show to reference? It's a hard watch though, take care of yourself. It's one of those I wouldn't watch twice, as much as I laud it.

	I thought the new 'Hannibal' with Mads Mikkelsen was very good for that too (although aside, the representation of Autism through the show is questionable). It shows well how the mask slips and the character appears steadily more disgusting as they are exposed, and very importantly, how much they *project themselves onto you* and make you believe you are just like them, taking advantage of your natural mimicry and ability to bond with something as simple as proximity. Or even through abstraction! I suppose... be careful you don't let Eichmann begin to rent space in your head from beyond the grave with his propaganda of what a 'normal person' is like. He hasn't the first clue, honestly.

	Another show called 'Killing Eve' based on the book 'Villanelle', about a woman killer this time, does well to illustrate that many people think too often that the previously dubbed 'psychopath' is a full human with some extra quality of evil attached. Actually, the experience of them is rather more like feeling like something very important is missing, to the neurotypical mind who encounters them.

		You are really on to something here. Ive personally noticed how many people, normal people, will allow themselves to be swayed into this opinion that monsters are just like everyone else sans a few layers of cultural lacquer. It's a really unnerving behavior that, I think, is grounded in a kind of empathy but it is a blind, stupid empathy. The kind of ignorant empathy that is there to be abused and used against a person. There is something particularly disgusting about watching good, albeit naive, people identifying (at least on some level) or even sympathizing with monsters because of a misguided, ignorant concept of perceived shared personhood.
		
		It's like watching predators and prey.

			Funnily enough, I was shaking quite a bit after writing my comment and had a little difficulty returning to the thread. The body remembers being the deer in the lion's jaws. It is a strikingly apt metaphor. I also felt somehow... let down, even betrayed, by everyone, in the aftermath. Why wasn't I informed of the reality so I could protect myself?

				Good notes to hit there. I never actually connected the sociopath/psychopath with the Trickster before. The connection is so blatant, I dont know why it never clicked in that way for me. The Trickster is almost a perfect personification of that kind of predator (or savior depending on how they're presenting).
				
				Pie on my face.
				
				On a personal note, I would point out that the Western Christian tradition absolutely has warnings against these kinds of people. Bad spirits/demons/devils are constantly presented as tricksters and temptresses (what is the masculine of 'temptress'?). We just don't teach with those sorts of archetypes anymore.

						Im getting the impression you think Im someone Im not but Ill happily answer. Personally, I think shame is an extremely powerful tool both for society and individuals. Short of physical force it is probably one our most powerful social tools. It is a way for the larger society to police itself and that kind of power will inevitably be used for the wrong reasons. 
						
						It's easy to shoehorn shame into being nothing but negative until you look around you one day and really see what the world looks like without it (you ever been in the vicinity of a trump rally?). It's a powerful, powerful tool that needs to be used wisely.

	Most recently, The Killer by David Fincher was a pretty isolated and “simple” exploration of this concept, especially during the extended opening scene. The very first line of the movie is: “It's amazing how physically exhausting it can be to do nothing. If you are unable to endure boredom, this work is not for you.” And then the next 20-30 minutes follow a boring stakeout from a window where a hired assassin does nothing but wait until his victim arrives. The rest of the movie is filled with the killer’s frequent monologues and inner philosophies that are repeated ad nauseam. He has a cut and dry routine that works, but the movie is only interesting once the banality of his routine wears off.

* 🟩 **[LuminaTitan](https://www.reddit.com/user/LuminaTitan)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-03-08 08:42:31)_

	Although the movie adaptation does a pretty good job exploring the concept, the book version of “The Sea and Poison” (by Shusaku Endo, author of “Silence”) has the absolute best depiction of this I’ve ever encountered. It’s about the doctors that performed live vivisections on downed American pilots during WW2, seen through the eyes of a young, naive medical student. Endo interviewed some of the actual people involved while researching for the book, and the brilliance of it, is how it makes you *feel* the banality of evil. It gets you into the very mindset of people worn down by bureaucracy, and the stress of war in a hostile workplace combined with the extreme difficulty in speaking out against something you know is wrong when the prevailing attitude around you runs counter to that. The simple, ugly truth is that all it takes for evil to take root and fester, is when good people refuse to speak out against it, whether out of fear, self-preservation, or cowardice. That’s it. That’s all it takes for horrific atrocities to occur. Some movies or books visualize, or describe the banality of evil, often in a somewhat detached way, but Endo makes you feel it. He makes you understand how easily it occurs, and that most people are probably not going to be that sole exceptional person who stands up for what is right at the cost of everything. As you can tell it’s very disturbing (the movie’s last third is extremely tense and stressful), not only for its gruesome subject matter, but also how it adeptly illuminates something that’s so basic and intertwined into the human condition.

	I'd highly recommend La Historia Oficial (1985), about a family that adopts a child of a disappeared person during the Argentine military dictatorship.

	**I, Daniel Black** (*2016, Loach*)   

	After a heart attack, a man tries to sign on to the dole. Possibly more Kafka than Arendt, as it focuses on the victim, but the nebulous responsibility of British bureaucracy is plainly the source of Loach’s ire.

	**Babylon** (*Boyle, 2014*)   

	A TV show, but since Danny Boyle is involved I’m counting it on Twin Peaks rules. The Met hire a new PR head whose first job is spinning an officer shooting an unarmed teen. It’s also a comedy!

	**The Crying Game** (*Jordan, 1992*)   

	Ok, I’ll concede that in a world where Salò exists, this one’s a walk. But the films queer themes largely overshadow that the first 20ish minutes are a British soldier and his IRA captor debating who is to blame for the situation.

	A Question of Silence directed by Marleen Gorris.

	Three women, otherwise seemingly "normal" people, kill a man for no immediately apparent reason. They then go about their lives as if nothing happened.

	The people live "banal" lives but the act is quite shocking. Why would they "snap" and do such a thing?

	The movie implies (though it's left open to interpretation) that the banal, everyday acts of men and the patriarchal society in which they live accumulate day after day to wear these women down, deny them agency, undermine their self expression, and make them lash out. 

	But nothing is directly explained; we must infer that the actions of the characters are partly a response to the people and systems that influence them. It raises some interesting questions about gender relations and how individuals react within an oppressive society when their oppression has become normalized to such a degree that the people around them don't even see it. 

	It also explores what "sanity" means, and how people have motives bubbling under the surface that aren't recognizable to those around them. And how an outburst of outward violence can be a response to the quiet, dull violence of internalized repression.

	It's thoughtful and deals with disturbing, shocking themes in a fairly understated but interesting way.

	Only that I felt utterly revolted throughout and had to take a shower right after, real kick to the gut, and I think "banality of evil" would be a perfect term to describe it, because the way everything is presented and how it all unfolds...

	Like, from reading the synopsis, I knew what it would be about, but I never would've thought it would be that level of graphic. I was just speechless throughout, sickened.

	First obvious film, Schindler’s List. Clearly the Nazis couldn’t care less about their victims. It’s was industrialized murder. 

	Next, I suggest a made for TV movie, Conspiracy (2001). Kenneth Branagh and Stanley Tucci. It’s an about the Wannsee Conference where the SS develops the Final Solution. In attendance are Heydrich, Eichmann, et al. Nothing gruesome or horrific is shown, only discussed. I think this is truest definition of “banality” in the discussion of liquidation camps and extermination of an entire heritage and race. They eat, drink coffee and tea, joke, make small talk, all while developing a policy of expanded ethnic cleansing. The wrap up the meeting like nothing ever happened. Records were destroyed shortly after the war was doomed but discovered years later.

	*Mr. Death,* the Errol Morris documentary, tackles this subject pretty explicitly.  I don't think Leuchter is a BAD guy, and his ostensible original motivations- to build a better, more humane execution machine - can be seen as laudable, in a certain sort of light.  But his obsessive focus on some things causes him to miss the forest for the trees, as it were; and his need to have his ego gratified (to be seen as an expert on something, even if he's not really qualified) leads him down the garden path to evil, and to ending up allied with exactly the wrong sort of people.

	I’m surprised no one’s mentioned Hirschbiegel’s DOWNFALL. It’s a really interesting war film in that there are so few sympathetic to the (rightfully) losing side, but in addition to the literal downfall of the Nazi regime and the highest-ranking party officials dealing with the knowledge that all they’ve done has come to naught, it focus on how the German people themselves are brutalized by Hitler’s casual ego toxins and delusions. 

	The overall intention of the movie is to humanize the Nazi high command, because they were human, not manifested monsters and beings of pure evil. In place of that, the culture at large, the fanaticism and structures of power can be examined to see how things came to be, and the human capacity of evil tied up in zealotry and blind faith in a party leader. It’s an excellently-acted film, and is completely believable that most would rather their entire family die than see the end of national socialism, Hitler flits between delusions of the impossible and everyone else entertains him, the chain of command follows a very steep pyramid and so on. 

	The film does an excellent job embodying its title and threading the needle in making its principle characters real human people 

	with emotional capacities who have distinct inner lives, cry and feel sorrow, but does not portray them sympathetically, at most pitiful. There is, then, this curious mood to the film in that the content is, strictly speaking, watching everything crumble, a true to its title downfall that is the closest to how we’ll ever know it, yet the tone of the films avoids treating this as something celebratory or making you sympathize with any of the characters (apart from the narrator maybe), so it leaves itself more open to be thought about and observed as things come crashing down.

	Nightcrawler comes to mind. The protagonist appears to those around him to just be 'hustling', in his mind he's just trying to get a goody story. Even as it gets people hurt or killed it never occurs to him that he is responsible.

	The act of killing feels quite obvious. A movie thats stuck with me for decades. Never seen anything like it since, to hear these people describe the killings it's just surreal. 

	Richard jewel might qualify too, it's a story of how, if the state trains its eye on you, it's largely irrelevant if you are guilty or not, the wheels are in motion, no human being, even if they cared to, would save you.

I think the most important and interesting thing about the film is just how evil he gets and his potential to get more evil in the future. And at the end he’s training other people and saying that he’s not gonna make them do anything that he wouldn’t do.

	I commented earlier in this thread but I just watched L’Argent yesterday and I feel that it represents this list perfectly. A French film by a legendary director and it also happened to be the last film of that director. Before this movie I had never watched his work and this movie made me curious about the rest of his work so I will give the rest of his work a shot even though I personally didn’t enjoy L’Argent *that* much. But the premise of the movie is that this guy gets done dirty by getting fake money planted on him which ends up getting him fired from his job and everything. This leads to him getting involved in crime and eventually murder. It’s such an interesting premise and shows just how evil people can be and what that can lead to. Unfortunately the movie doesn’t do a really good job of it with its short run time and sort of dull performances by the actors but it’s still a relatively good movie and perfect for this thread

	Extremely effective film. Apparently Kubrick was quite so taken by it, he would talk to the films director regarding how it was made, and called it "the most terrifying film he had seen". I saw it about 25 years ago, and was shocked by how non shalant, mundane, and matter of fact thre film is. I had never seen a film with the subject of a kidnapping handled that way. It felt real.

	One example I'm thinking of is Beau is Afraid. The main antagonist, Beau's mother, is not banal at all, but everyone who surrounds her is. Like, there's this entire cottage industry devoted to torturing this poor guy and all of them act like it's a regular nine-to-five job. I think abusive power figures like surrounding themselves with complicit people in order to normalise abuse and making the victims seem like the weird ones for calling it out, and I like the depiction of these complicit people as normal workers who act like Beau being tortures by his mother is normal.

	Also, not a film, but in Sex House, a youtube series by The Onion, there's a character called Frank who acts like a normal, kinda arkward and boring guy, then does these really horiffic things without even seeming to realise that they are bad. I think he's honestly the most convincing depiction of an abuser I've seen in anything.

	After just recently watching May December I think it fits into this category. The film is loosely based on a real life incident of a 36 year old teacher having an "Affair", with one of her 12 year old students. The film shows over 20 years later after her imprisonment and they are still together with a family. But it subtly, until the very end, shows the damage it has done to the student victim. Julianne Moore's character is a convicted paedophile but it shows Natalie Portman's character who plays an actress preparing for a role as her and in her own words finding it to be a "Very human story", and why she is interested in the role. 

	But the bigger point is there is no perspective from the victim's side which is always the case with these true crime stories. The media painted it to be a taboo story of a forbidden affair instead of what is actually is, which is an adult grooming a child and sexually abusing them. Julianne Moore's character exemplifies the "Banality of evil", as shown as she is not some monster, her son from her first marriage says that she was sexually abused by her older brothers growing up. Then it's revealed by her at the end that it was a lie to see if she could be trusted by not going to the press which she didn't. But the actual point is that it doesn't matter, many have traumatic upbringings who don't go on the repeat the same evil things.

	Would definitely recommend giving it a watch.
