The civil war began in September 2014 when [Houthi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement "Houthi movement") forces [took over the capital city Sanaa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sanaa_(2014) "Battle of Sanaa (2014)"), which was followed by a rapid [Houthi takeover of the government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_takeover_in_Yemen "Houthi takeover in Yemen"). On 21 March 2015, the Houthi-led [Supreme Revolutionary Committee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Revolutionary_Committee "Supreme Revolutionary Committee") declared a general mobilization to overthrow then-president [Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdrabbuh_Mansur_Hadi "Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi") and expand their control by driving into southern provinces.<sup id="cite_ref-125"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-125">[124]</a></sup> The Houthi offensive, allied with military forces loyal to former Yemeni President [Ali Abdullah Saleh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Abdullah_Saleh "Ali Abdullah Saleh"), began fighting the next day in [Lahij Governorate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahij_Governorate "Lahij Governorate").

## Historical context [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Historical context")

When Islam first came to Yemen, it mostly took the form of [Zaydism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaydism "Zaydism"), a [Shia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam "Shia Islam") sect. It was not until the arrival of the Rasulids that Shafi'i Sunnism became popular. From there on, the two groups, Zaydis in the north and [Rasulids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasulid_dynasty "Rasulid dynasty") in the South, started competing with each other. The state of rivalry was cut short by the fall of the Rasulid rule and the succession of imperialist powers' involvements in the Middle East, notably the expansionist [Ottoman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire").<sup id="cite_ref-:0_146-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-:0-146">[141]</a></sup>

The defeat of the Ottomans in the first World War eventually gave way to the first unification (although not complete) of Yemen. This was possible during the Hamid al-Din dynasty under [Imam Yahya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Muhammad_Hamid_ed-Din "Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din") and his son's rule. The unification also meant the establishment of a hierarchy within which Zaydis had authoritative power over Sunnis.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_146-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-:0-146">[141]</a></sup> As a consequence, the difference in status became instituted and normalized. The Hamid al-Din dynasty faced the Zaydis' discontent due to a non-conformity to Zaydi traditions, thus coming to an end with the overthrow of Imam Yahya's grandson, Imam Badr, in 1962. What followed was a [civil war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Yemen_Civil_War "North Yemen Civil War") opposing republicans to royalists. Helen Lackner explains that such a division was not ideological; it was based on past feuds. Nonetheless, external powers like Saudi Arabia intervened for ideological motives, as the latter sought to maintain the monarchy system which it adhered to itself. Despite Saudi Arabia's original intentions, in 1970, the republican form was retained.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_146-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-:0-146">[141]</a></sup>

While these developments took place in the North, liberation movements against British presence broke out, amounting to the creation of a socialist state, hence Soviet Union ally, in the Southern Arabian region. It was named the [People's Democratic Republic of Yemen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen "South Yemen") (PDRY).<sup id="cite_ref-:0_146-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-:0-146">[141]</a></sup>

The PDRY was involved in the internal disputes of its northern counterpart. It had previously supported the republicans in fighting off Saudi Arabia's influence, but it was the [Hamdi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrahim_al-Hamdi "Ibrahim al-Hamdi") regime in the Yemen Arab Republic (North Yemen) that was most notorious for its policies that aimed to reduce Saudi presence in Yemeni politics. His rule was, nonetheless, short-lived.  A series of political unrest marked by the assassination of former presidents, led to [Colonel Ali Abdullah Saleh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Abdullah_Saleh "Ali Abdullah Saleh")'s rise to the presidency of the Yemen Arab Republic. Saleh's rule lasted for 33 years. The major event that marked his regime was the [unification of Yemen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_unification "Yemeni unification") in 1990. His attempt was not entirely successful as a civil war broke out in 1994. However, he was able to come out of it victorious. Subsequently, the Republic of Yemen became constitutionally established.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_146-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-:0-146">[141]</a></sup>

Saleh tried to maintain his position through constitutional amendments, hoping for his son to take over, but strong opposition and protests pressured him out of office. Meanwhile, the group "Friends of Yemen" was created, initially to stop al-Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) after evidence pointed at it as the main perpetrator behind multiple attacks on US military bases and equipment. The "Friends of Yemen" group becomes more involved in Yemen during the [Arab Spring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring "Arab Spring") following suit the [Gulf Cooperation Council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Cooperation_Council "Gulf Cooperation Council") (GCC) and United Nations recommendation to put the management of Yemen's "crisis" in the hands of global actors.<sup id="cite_ref-:5_147-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-:5-147">[142]</a></sup>

After the end of their rule, from the 1960s onwards, Zaydis faced discrimination and _Sunnification_ policies from the consequent Sunni dominated governments. For example, [Salafis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salafi "Salafi") in [Saada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saada "Saada") claimed [al-Shawkani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Shawkani "Al-Shawkani") as an intellectual precursor, and future Yemeni regimes would uphold his Sunnization policies as a unifier of the country<sup id="cite_ref-148"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-148">[143]</a></sup> and to undermine Zaydi Shi'ism.<sup id="cite_ref-149"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-149">[144]</a></sup>

Ansar Allah (sometimes Anglicised as Ansarullah), known popularly as the [Houthis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthis "Houthis"), is a Zaydi group with its origins in the mountainous [Sa'dah Governorate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%27dah_Governorate "Sa'dah Governorate") on Yemen's northern border with [Saudi Arabia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia "Saudi Arabia").

After several weeks of street protests against the Hadi administration, which made cuts to fuel subsidies that were unpopular with the group, the Houthis fought the [Yemen Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen_Army "Yemen Army") forces under the command of General [Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Mohsen_al-Ahmar "Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar"). In a [battle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sanaa_(2014) "Battle of Sanaa (2014)") that lasted only a few days, Houthi fighters seized control of [Sanaa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanaa "Sanaa"), the Yemeni capital, in September 2014.<sup id="cite_ref-165"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-165">[160]</a></sup> The Houthis forced Hadi to negotiate an agreement to end the violence, in which the government resigned and the Houthis gained an unprecedented level of influence over state institutions and politics.<sup id="cite_ref-166"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-166">[161]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-167"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-167">[162]</a></sup>

The partial evacuation measure came on the eve of an ICRC worker, a Lebanese national, being killed on 21 April by unknown gunmen in the southwestern city of [Taiz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiz "Taiz"). The ICRC stated, "our current activities have been blocked, threatened and directly targeted in recent weeks, and we see a vigorous attempt to instrumentalize our organization as a pawn in the conflict." In light of the serious security deterioration for ICRC personnel, the international organization has called for all parties of the conflict "to provide it with concrete, solid and actionable guarantees so that it can continue working in Yemen."

British researcher [Alex de Waal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_de_Waal "Alex de Waal") wrote that the "responsibility for Yemen goes beyond Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to London and Washington. Britain has sold at least £4.5 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia and £500 million to the UAE since the war began.

In August 2018, a report by UN experts said all parties to the conflict may have committed war crimes, including the governments of Yemen, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, and the Houthi movement. The UN described the conflict as the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The report documented 6,475 deaths in the conflict, but estimated the true number was significantly higher. The report criticized Saudi-led airstrikes and accused parties of unlawful violations such as "deprivation of the right to life, arbitrary detention, rape, torture, enforced disappearances and child recruitment".<sup id="cite_ref-280"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-280">[273]</a></sup>

In February 2020, British law firm Stoke White appealed the authorities in Britain, the U.S., and Turkey to arrest senior officials from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for allegedly carrying out war crimes and torture in Yemen.

### Religious minorities [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Religious minorities")

The US government estimates that religious minorities in Yemen constitute less than 1% of the population. They are categorized into four groups including Baha’is, Jews, Christians and Hindus. The Houthi movement has been said to be intolerant towards religious minorities. It was claimed that Houthis attachement to their own practices has led to a discriminatory stance against other types of faiths present in territories that are under their control. The Baha’i International Community stated that a number of Baha’is were imprisoned by the Houthi for religious reasons.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_318-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-:1-318">[311]</a></sup>

#### Education [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Education")

The civil war in Yemen severely impacted and degraded the country's education system. The number of children who are out of school increased to 1.8 million in 2015–2016 out of more than 5 million registered students, according to the 2013 statistics released by the Ministry of Education.<sup id="cite_ref-Moheyddeen_324-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-Moheyddeen-324">[317]</a></sup> Moreover, 3600 schools are directly affected; 68 schools are occupied by armed groups, 248 schools have severe structural damage, and 270 are used to house refugees. The Yemen government has not been able to improve this situation due to limited authority and manpower.

Some of the education system's problems include: not enough financial resources to operate schools and salaries of the teachers, not enough materials to reconstruct damaged schools, and lack of machinery to print textbooks and provide school supplies. These are caused by the unstable government that cannot offer enough financial support since many schools are either damaged or used for other purposes.<sup id="cite_ref-325"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-325">[318]</a></sup>

Despite warfare and destruction of schools, the education ministry was able to send teams to oversee primary and secondary schools' final exam in order to give students 15–16 school year certificates.<sup id="cite_ref-Moheyddeen_324-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-Moheyddeen-324">[317]</a></sup> Currently, [UNICEF](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF "UNICEF") is raising money to support students and fix schools damaged by armed conflicts.

#### Residential condition [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Residential condition")

The Yemeni quality of life is affected by the civil war and people have suffered enormous hardships. Although mines are banned by the government, Houthi forces placed anti-personnel mines in many parts of Yemen including Aden.<sup id="cite_ref-326"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-326">[319]</a></sup> Thousands of civilians are injured when they accidentally step on mines; many lose their legs and injure their eyes. It is estimated that more than 500,000 mines have been laid by Houthi forces during the conflict. The pro-Hadi Yemen Army was able to remove 300,000 Houthi mines in recently captured areas, including 40,000 mines on the outskirts of [Marib](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marib "Marib") province, according to official sources.<sup id="cite_ref-327"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-327">[320]</a></sup>

In addition, the nine-country coalition led by Saudi Arabia launched many airstrikes against Houthi forces; between March 2015 and December 2018 more than 4,600 civilians have been killed and much of the civilian infrastructure for goods and food production, storage, and distribution has been destroyed.<sup id="cite_ref-328"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-328">[321]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-329"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-329">[322]</a></sup> Factories have ceased production and thousands of people have lost their jobs. Due to decreased production, food, medicines, and other consumer staples have become scarce. The prices of these goods have gone up and civilians can no longer afford them for sustenance.<sup id="cite_ref-330"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-330">[323]</a></sup>

It has looked for solutions to alleviate security concerns in Yemen and stop the Hadi-Houthi conflict from escalating. The Peace and National Partnership Agreement in 2014 was its final attempt at quelling the dispute before it transformed into a war.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_146-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-:0-146">[141]</a></sup>

The United Nations representative [Baroness Amos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerie_Amos,_Baroness_Amos "Valerie Amos, Baroness Amos"), [Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under-Secretary-General_for_Humanitarian_Affairs_and_Emergency_Relief_Coordinator "Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator"), said on 2 April 2015 that she was "extremely concerned" about the fate of civilians trapped in fierce fighting, after aid agencies reported 519 people killed and 1,700 injured in two weeks. The UN children's agency reported 62 children killed and 30 injured and also children being recruited as soldiers.<sup id="cite_ref-369"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-369">[362]</a></sup>

[Russia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia") called for "humanitarian pauses" in the coalition bombing campaign, bringing the idea before the [United Nations Security Council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council "United Nations Security Council") in a 4 April emergency meeting.<sup id="cite_ref-370"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-370">[363]</a></sup> However, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United Nations questioned whether humanitarian pauses would be the best way of delivering humanitarian assistance.<sup id="cite_ref-371"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-371">[364]</a></sup>

On March 22, 2015, the UN declared its recognition of Hadi as the sole legitimate president and encouraged the peaceful resolution of the dispute. A few days later, Saudi Arabia intervened military with an air strike.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_146-6"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-:0-146">[141]</a></sup>

On 14 April 2015, the [United Nations Security Council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council "United Nations Security Council") adopted a resolution placing sanctions on [Abdul-Malik al-Houthi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul-Malik_al-Houthi "Abdul-Malik al-Houthi") and [Ahmed Ali Saleh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Ali_Saleh "Ahmed Ali Saleh"), establishing an [arms embargo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_embargo "Arms embargo") on the [Houthis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement "Houthi movement"), and calling on the Houthis to withdraw from Sanaʽa and other areas they seized.<sup id="cite_ref-372"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-372">[365]</a></sup> The Houthis condemned the UN resolution and called for mass protests.<sup id="cite_ref-373"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-373">[366]</a></sup>

[Jamal Benomar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Benomar "Jamal Benomar"), the UN envoy to Yemen who brokered the deal that ended [Ali Abdullah Saleh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Abdullah_Saleh "Ali Abdullah Saleh")'s presidency during the [2011–12 revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_Revolution "Yemeni Revolution"), resigned on 15 April.<sup id="cite_ref-374"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-374">[367]</a></sup> Mauritanian diplomat [Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Ould_Cheikh_Ahmed "Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed"), formerly the head of the UN's Ebola response mission, was confirmed as the new UN Envoy to Yemen on 25 April.<sup id="cite_ref-375"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-375">[368]</a></sup> The Panel of Experts on Yemen mandated by the [Security Council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Council "Security Council"), UN submitted a 329-page report to the latter's president on 26 January 2018 denouncing the UAE, the Yemeni government and the Houthis for torturing civilians in the Yemeni conflict.<sup id="cite_ref-376"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-376">[369]</a></sup>

In December 2018, UN-sponsored talks between the Houthis and the Saudi-backed government were expected to start. The UN also started using its jets to carry wounded Houthi fighters out of the Yemeni capital, [Sanaa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanaa "Sanaa"), to Oman, paving the way for planned peace talks after nearly four years of civil war.<sup id="cite_ref-377"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-377">[370]</a></sup>

According to [United Nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations"), more than 3.6 million Yemenis have been displaced in the 5-year-old conflict. The [World Food Programme](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme "World Food Programme"), which feeds more than 12 million Yemenis needs more funding to continue the ongoing operations and ramp back up operations in the north. Without funding, 30 of 41 major aid programmes in [Yemen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen "Yemen") would close in the next few weeks.<sup id="cite_ref-378"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-378">[371]</a></sup>

On 27 September 2020, the United Nations announced that the Iran-backed Houthi rebels and the Hadi government supported by the Saudi-led military coalition, agreed to exchange about 1,081 detainees and prisoners related to the conflict as part of a release plan reached in early 2020. The deal stated the release of 681 rebels along with 400 Hadi government forces, which included fifteen Saudis and four Sudanese. The deal was finalized after a week-long meeting held in Glion, Switzerland, co-chaired by UN Special Envoy for Yemen, [Martin Griffiths](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Griffiths "Martin Griffiths").<sup id="cite_ref-:3_379-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-:3-379">[372]</a></sup> The prisoner-swap deal was done by the UN during the 2018 peace talks in Sweden which produced the Stockholm Agreement. The latter consisted of three major documents. The first one suggested the formation of a committee; the second called for the exchange of prisoners; the third aimed at creating the United Nations Mission to support the al-Hodeida Agreement (UNMHA).<sup id="cite_ref-:0_146-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-:0-146">[141]</a></sup> Both parties agreed on several measures including the cease-fire in the strategic port city of Hodeida. A prisoner swap deal was made as part of the 2018 peace talks held in Sweden. However, the implementation of the plan clashed with military offensives from Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition, which aggravated the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, leaving millions suffering medical and food supply shortages.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_379-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-:3-379">[372]</a></sup>

On 7 October 2022, the UN Human Rights Council adopted, without a vote, a futile resolution on Yemen that failed to establish a credible independent and impartial monitoring and accountability mechanism. The adoption came a year after the same body rejected the renewal of the mandate for the Group of Eminent Experts (GEE), an international, impartial, and independent body established by the Human Rights Council in 2017 that reported on rights violations and abuses in Yemen.<sup id="cite_ref-380"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-380">[373]</a></sup>

## Peace process [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Peace process")

The Yemeni Civil War, which began in 2014, has been one of the most heavy conflicts in history, and caused a severe humanitarian crisis. In recent years, however, there have been several efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution and bringing stability to the country.<sup id="cite_ref-381"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-381">[374]</a></sup>

One of the most important developments in the peace process was the Stockholm Agreement, which was reached in December 2018 between the conflicting parties, the government of Yemen and the Houthi rebels. This agreement focused on implementing a ceasefire in the city of [Hodeida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hudaydah "Al Hudaydah") and the areas surrounding the city. The agreement also focused on the redeployment of forces, and addressing humanitarian concerns. The agreement was seen as a significant step to alleviate the suffering of the Yemeni people and for further negotiations.<sup id="cite_ref-382"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-382">[375]</a></sup>

Subsequently, there have been multiple rounds of talks and negotiations facilitated by the United Nations. These discussions have covered a comprehensive political solution, prisoner exchanges and the establishment of a transitional government. The main goal has been to address the causes of the conflict, foster national reconciliation and restore security and stability in Yemen.<sup id="cite_ref-383"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-383">[376]</a></sup>

Another important development in the peace process was the [Riyadh Agreement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh_Agreement "Riyadh Agreement"), between the Yemeni government and the [Southern Transitional Council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Transitional_Council "Southern Transitional Council") (STC) in November 2019. This agreement aimed to resolve power struggles in southern Yemen by establishing a power-sharing arrangement between the two parties. It was seen as a significant step towards achieving a unified Yemen and an important component of the broader peace process.<sup id="cite_ref-384"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-384">[377]</a></sup> While progress has been made, the road to peace in Yemen remains challenging due to ongoing clashes, political divisions and regional rivalries. Additionally, the humanitarian situation in Yemen remains dire, with millions of people in urgent need of assistance.<sup id="cite_ref-385"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-385">[378]</a></sup>

_[The Wall Street Journal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal "The Wall Street Journal")_ reported in March 2023 that Iran agreed to halt all military support to Houthis and abide by the [UN arms embargo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_embargo "Arms embargo"), as part of a [Chinese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China")\-brokered [Iran-Saudi rapprochement deal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Saudi_Arabia_proxy_conflict#Iran-Saudi_Arabia_Rapprochement "Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict").

The agreement was concluded in the background of Iran's international isolation following the escalation of its [nuclear program](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran "Nuclear program of Iran"), an ongoing crackdown on [Mahsa Amini protests](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahsa_Amini_protests "Mahsa Amini protests") and its [support to Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_and_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "Iran and the Russian invasion of Ukraine").<sup id="cite_ref-386"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-386">[379]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-387"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-387">[380]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-388"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-388">[381]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-389"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-389">[382]</a></sup>

## Environmental impact [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Environmental impact")

### Water [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Water")

Yemen is facing one of the world's worst Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) crises. The lack of governance has left Yemen without a viable water supply. Poor sanitation and the lack of clean water has had a deteriorating effect on the health of Yemenis, which is apparent through the increasing cases of cholera in Yemen since 2015. The entire country has been affected by a water shortage and the price of drinking water has more than doubled. Drinking water has become unaffordable for most Yemenis. The problem in Yemen is widespread, thus making it difficult to prevent the problem from escalating because it is hard to supply everyone on a regular basis.

The Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa at UNICEF, Geert Cappelaere, has explained that the fuel shortages in Yemen have deepened the water and health crisis. The water pumping stations in Yemen have been jeopardized as they are quickly running out of fuel and over 3 million people are dependent on these water pumps which have been established through public networks. The ICRC has been working closely with vulnerable people where the resources are limited but aim to prevent the water crisis from worsening by buying 750,000 liters of diesel to provide clean water for people living in Yemen. Already a scarce commodity, the amount of water withdrawn from wells in 2016 reached unsustainable levels. The ICRC has also been working carefully with local authorities to provide water to 330,000 people in Aden. They have also installed wells nearby Aden to provide water to the neighborhood when they are experiencing water shortages.

Water resources have been used by both sides during the war as a tactic during the conflict. Unlike other countries in the Middle East, Yemen has no rivers to depend on for water resources. In 2017, 250,¬000 people of Taiz's total population of 654,330 were served by public water supply networks. As a result of the ongoing conflict NGO's have struggled to reach the sanitation facilities due to security issues. Since the aerial bombardment, Taiz has been left in a critical situation as the current water production is not sufficient for the population.

[Water availability in Yemen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Yemen "Water supply and sanitation in Yemen") has decreased.<sup id="cite_ref-405"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-405">[398]</a></sup> Water scarcity with an intrinsic geographical formation in highlands and limited capital to build water infrastructures and provision service caused a catastrophic water shortage in Yemen. Aquifer recharge rates are decreasing while salt water intrusion is increasing.<sup id="cite_ref-406"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-406">[399]</a></sup> After the civil war began in 2015, the water buckets were destroyed significantly and price of water highly increased. Storing water capacity has been demolished by war and supply chains have been occupied by military personnel, which makes the delivery of water far more difficult. In 2015, over 15 million people need healthcare and over 20 million need clean water and sanitation—an increase of 52 percent since the intervention, but the government agencies can not afford to deliver clean water to displaced Yemeni citizens.<sup id="cite_ref-407"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-407">[400]</a></sup>

The Yemen civil war resulted in a severe lack of food and vegetation. Agricultural production in the country has suffered substantially leaving Yemen to face the threat of famine. Yemen has been since [UNSC resolution 2216](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_2216 "United Nations Security Council Resolution 2216") was approved in April 2015,<sup id="cite_ref-unsc2216_368-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-unsc2216-368">[361]</a></sup> under blockade by land, sea, and air which has disrupted the delivery of many foreign resources to Houthi-controlled territory. In a country where 90% of the food requirements are met through imports, this blockade has had serious consequences concerning the availability of food to its citizens.<sup id="cite_ref-Rageh_408-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-Rageh-408">[401]</a></sup> It is reported that out of the population of 24 million in Yemen, everyday 13 million are going hungry and 6 million are at risk of starvation.<sup id="cite_ref-Rageh_408-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-Rageh-408">[401]</a></sup> In October 2016, [Robert Fisk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fisk "Robert Fisk") reported that there is strong evidence suggesting that the agricultural sector in Houthi-controlled territory was being deliberately destroyed by the Saudi-led coalition, thus exacerbating the food shortage and leaving the Houthis dependent solely on imports, which are difficult to obtain in view of the blockade.<sup id="cite_ref-fisk16_409-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)#cite_note-fisk16-409">[402]</a></sup>
