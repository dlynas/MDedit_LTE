## Why I‚Äôm against taxing unrealized capital gains.

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/comments/1ch1302/why_im_against_taxing_unrealized_capital_gains/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/comments/1ch1302/why_im_against_taxing_unrealized_capital_gains/)

> Leading up to the passage of the 16^(th) amendment in 1913 ‚Äì which allowed the federal government to levy an income tax ‚Äì politicians were claiming that it would ‚Äúmake accumulated wealth pay its just burden of taxation‚Äù. The first versions of the income tax started at just 1% on incomes over $3,000, which only affected about 2% of the population at the time so people widely supported it.

> 
> Once the 16^(th) amendment was passed however, it set a precedent that allowed the federal government to levy an income tax on anyone, and quickly they applied this to everyone. Fast forward to today, and most of us in the middle class are paying > 30% in federal income tax, whereas those top wealthiest people in the United States are barley paying anything. This is because they can use their wealth to influence the tax code and carve out special exemptions that only they can take advantage of. I firmly believe that if we grant the federal government the ability to tax unrealized capital gains, this pattern will repeat and they will find a way to make sure it doesn‚Äôt affect the wealthiest citizens, but instead it will end up being used to target the middle class.

At some point in the next 10 years, they will have to either cut benefits, or raise the retirement age, both of which are political suicide for whoever must make that decision. I‚Äôm concerned that they are trying to pass this tax on unrealized gains now to set a precedent, so that when it comes time to make these hard decisions in the coming years, they will be able to levy a tax on private retirement accounts to cover the shortfalls in the name of ‚Äúequality‚Äù.

> 
> First off, I‚Äôm not taking a republican point of view on this. While republican politicians‚Äô rhetoric may reflect what I‚Äôm saying, their actions have largely been to raise spending when they are in power. I‚Äôm not proposing where the cuts need to be made, but they do need to be made, or the debt / interest problem will become untenable. ‚ÄúEconomic growth‚Äù is the primary way politicians want you to believe we can get out of this, because it doesn‚Äôt involve unpopular tax hikes or spending cuts, but we‚Äôre nowhere near the level need to grow our way out of this. You may also be led to think that we can solve this through higher taxes, but as I stated above, there is a maximum amount of tax that can be collected before people start finding a way around it, or it cuts deeply into economic growth which will also negatively impact the actual total federal revenue collected.
> 
> See [this chart](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFRGDA188S) and you‚Äôll notice that the federal tax receipts have never actually exceeded 20% of GDP (despite the myth that we used to tax the top 1% over 90%), meaning that without some miraculous economic growth, they won‚Äôt be able to collect enough tax to cover the current expenditure.

		I 100% agree.  What happens if your unrealized returns are in the red, am I getting a tax refund?  How do you tell someone this asset you hold costs you more money now even though you didn't sell it and it's volatile so it can change
		
		
		You want to tax net worth I'd be open to listening to a proposal.  It would need some significant carve outs to not destroy an average American (i.e. taxing net worth over 1M would decimate a lot of people who own homes).

			If I have, say, 100,000 shares in a company and it's worth $10/share, then goes up to $20/share my unrealized gains are $1m. So the IRS says I owe 20% of the unrealized gains, say, so I owe $200,000 in taxes. In January, it's uncovered that there was accounting fraud (or whatever, insert a legal reason in here; a disruptive tech was announced and rendered that company obsolete), and the stock value tanks to $0.50/share. So...I now have a net worth of $50,000 and a $200,000 tax bill to pay in April?
			
			Or let's say a billionaire's company has a great year and this billionaire's tax bill is $1bn. He's not likely to have $1bn sitting around in cash, so now he has to liquidate $1bn in assets in one go to pay this tax bill? How would this not create immense downward pressure on the stock price?
			
			How does this work on other things like unique houses or artwork that don't have any comps? It's not like you can hold an auction and after it's sold, you just go "just kidding!" and record the highest bid as the comp. Even the best appraisers are just giving their best guess. Just look at the wide variation between the appraised value and actual sale value at auctions. But now you have to do this appraisal for every single piece of artwork and other valuables in the country *every year*? The IRS can't even figure that out with the laws we have right now, as [evidenced by](https://web.archive.org/web/20240105035210/https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/arts/design/a-catch-22-of-art-and-taxes-starring-a-stuffed-eagle.html) that time they tried to tax an inherited piece of artwork that was illegal to sell.
			
			I've never understood how people consider unrealized capital gains a tangible thing to tax. There's a reason why it's called unrealized.

				That's the perversity of it all. Someone like Bezos is worth north of $150 billion because of the shares he owns in Amazon stock. I think that's probably one of the least understood economic and financial aspects among the general population (i.e., among voters). It's not money stuffed into mattresses somewhere, or even income. It's ephemeral and really nothing more than accounting. 
				
				So when Bezos' net worth increases from, say, $150 billion to $175 billion, people think, "Wow, look at all that money he's making! Let's get some!" That's how to understand why people consider something like "unrealized capital gains" to be a tangible thing to tax. Politicians are just as ignorant, but of course they have all the guns. And philosophically, the details don't really matter.

					Maybe they could make it illegal to use stock as collateral on loans instead.

					* üü• **[zettajon](https://www.reddit.com/user/zettajon)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 7 _(2024-05-01 09:44:18)_

						Or tax that transaction itself *instead* of a general tax on unrealized capital gains. 
						
						If rich person P is telling the bank that their collateral stocks are collectively "worth" $X, and the bank is agreeing that they're worth $X, then *THEY'RE WORTH $X*. If they're deemed to be worth $X by both yourself and the bank, then you've indirectly realized the gains and they should be taxed. 
						
						If you never take a loan against the stocks, they they stay unrealized until you sell. That's fair. Same as me not getting taxed on my 401K until I sell some of it at age 66 to get myself a vacation.
						
						You can't have your (supposedly zero worth) cake and eat it too.

						Why they have value, and presumably the bank does their due diligence and determines that the loan is in their interest.  Banks don't do anything that does not benefit them - it's why they have so damned much money.

						* üü´ **[IchneumonMethod](https://www.reddit.com/user/IchneumonMethod)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 14 _(2024-05-01 05:38:51)_

							They have so much money because they don't suffer the consequences of their actions. If they fuck up bad enough they run to daddy government to bail them out with tax-payer dollars, even if it's the direct result of their greed. I don't think it's fair to assume that banks do their due diligence, at all, especially in recent history.

							Do you want banks to have more money? Because that‚Äôs not much better. If the Uber wealthy can‚Äôt use stocks as collateral (and avoid paying the taxes) then they have to sell shares or actually pay themselves more salary (both causing them to pay a fairer amount of taxes).

				I'm always surprised when people say taxing unrealized gains is difficult: property taxes, an unrealized tax, are widely implemented and well understood.
				
				You simply pay a percentage of the assessed value. For monetary instruments, the value is well known.  For non-monetary things, the value is assessed by assessors. There is a process for contesting the assessment.
				
				If you look at the real-world examples of your hypotheticals: yes, say you have a property tax bill and then it's determined you built on a swamp, and now the property is worth half as much? You still have to pay. You can contest the assessment moving forward.
				
				The billionaire has a lot of properties and get a huge property tax bill? He has to pay, it's not up to the government where he gets the funds. If he fails to do so, they can come after him and his properties.
				
				I'm not saying taxing unrealized gains is a good idea, not at all, just pushing back on the idea that's it's hard to do or complicated as a reason it doesn't work.

						I believe this would only cause significant downward pressure in the short term if billionaires had to scramble to quickly sell assets to cover the cost. They would catch on that they need money to pay off taxes and would endeavor to ensure they could pay their tax in subsequent years. But there are ways to mitigate the downward pressure. You could:
						
						1) introduce the tax to begin in 2-3 years. This would give people time to sell assets over time to reduce the impact which would occur with a massive sell-off. Still significantly affects prices.
						
						2) Currently, billionaires get around paying taxes by offering shares as collateral for significant loans, nothing stops them from doing the same thing here and getting enough money to pay off their massive debt the way they always have. The richest people would have more debt while doing the same as now. They already don't sell so nothing changes.
						
						3) Surrender assets at current value. Let's say shares of Microsoft are worth  $400. The value will drop as they sell, so to get $1B, instead of selling 2,666,666 shares (dropping the value to $350, selling for an average of 375) if they surrender 2,500,000 for an average of $400 then there is no effect on the market and these shares can be used as financial incentives for other businesses or to cover pensions, etc.
						
						Or if they can't afford to sell enough shares to cover the cost, then they surrender real estate as does everyone else who can't cover property tax.

					Property taxes aren't analogous to unrealized capital gains tax, though I grant that there are similarities in calculation. Property taxes are taxes of about up to 2% or so on tangible assets. Unrealized capital gains are income taxes of up to 20% of the difference on current estimated values minus originally purchased amount. The stakes are a bit different when the percentage is an order of magnitude higher. But still, assessed value on property has its own issues. House values, even for those that have lots of comps still have sale values far off its assessed value. A friend of ours has been bidding on houses recently and even though some houses are listed at "fair market value", bids still can drive up the prices 15% (which is what happened in the last house they bid on). When my parents listed their first house for sale, the real estate agent recommended their appraised value but by the time they sold a few months later (this was a long time ago, now), they had to drop the price 20%. Now if you look at the ultra-wealthy, their houses have pretty much no comps. Those properties can be wildly off of assessed value. How do you comp a 20,000 square foot 7 bedroom house when the closest house is 11,000 square feet, before you throw in its history of formerly housing a celebrity?
					
					But really, steel man my argument instead of picking the easiest example I listed. How do you assess the value of a one of a kind piece of artwork? View the NYT article linked above and how the IRS valued a piece of unresellable artwork at $15 million, then later changed their mind and valued it at $65 million. If the valuation of a piece of art can suddenly inflate 4x+ on a whim...by the IRS no less, how is there not going to be lawsuits flying around all over?
					
					Lastly, if your contention is that property taxes are similar because of the metrics used for valuation, well, this would be fairly similar to wealth taxes. And we can take a look at places across Europe that attempted wealth taxes but abandoned them when the required manpower it took to value everything and deal with all the contested valuations cost way more than projected (there were other issues as well, like capital flight, but still, valuation was one of them).

					So the housing market is artificially inflated by corporations buying up houses......the govt sent out people to assess my property value and they said it's worth almost twice what I paid for it(it isnt) now I have to pay them more taxes.

			This is the only way. Close loopholes, yes. But if taxing while unrealized, they will simply put their money elsewhere - and that will of course leave the average investor holding the bag as the stock market crumbles. Even if it's just large investors being taxed, their relative weight when they hide the money from cap gains will affect everyones retirement accounts.

		The first tax day that comes around after the tax goes into effect would make that abundantly clear.
		
		It would essentially destroy everyone's investments, including anyone with a 401k, because everyone with sizable capital gains would face pressure to sell to cover tax bills.
		
		Placing that pressure to sell on investments would ruin the value of nearly every investment out there.
		
		This will destroy the economy if implemented.

Spending on EBT helps keep farners producing, keeping prices on food staples low. Investment in infrastructure directly impacts things as varied as shipping prices for goods to local proprty values which then converts into local tax revenue.

		1. The wealthy loaning against their stock portfolio is grossly exaggerated. Bezos isn't out there taking $50 billion loans, he's selling stock. Banks won't loan that much even to someone like Bezos.
		
		2. So you want to hit everyone who takes a HELOC or cash out refinance with a tax? It would be an accounting nightmare with multiple loans and tax credits when the asset is sold.

		If I understand correctly there would be taxes on the loan but if you tax the actual (let's just say) stocks, how would that work? It seems simpler to tax the loan and then tax the stocks once sold. If they did this with home equity loans people would never be able to afford them, the tax on their "unrealized gains" is gonna be more than the amount you can even get from the loan. 
		
		For example, if I own a $10,000,0000 house and took a home equity loan, I would owe roughly $ 3 million in taxes so most people would end up being forced to sell the asset rather than get a loan with it as collateral. 
		
		If i own a $100,000 house I would owe 30 grand!! What kind of loan would possibly work under those
		Circumstances. If this is a real problem the only viable solution is to not allow unrealized gains to be used as collateral, and again that just screws the middle class out of the largest piece of wealth we can realistically expect.

			If you‚Äôre taking out a HELOC, you‚Äôre pledging an appreciated asset to gain cash to then spend on whatever without paying capital gain taxes.
			
			Most homeowners wouldn‚Äôt be subject under current capital gains rules on property, but in the $10 mil example, if it looks like a capital gain being avoided via margin, tax it like a capital gain.

	I‚Äôd like to address the capital gains tax issue.  Many on hear think that‚Äôs a great idea, but most of us, at least those of us involved in finance, see it as a horribly corrosive idea. Let me give you the data points as to why and show you why this has a bearing on other issues discussed here:

	1) by definition, a capital gains tax represents double or triple taxation.  Simple Example: someone saves their money (after tax money) and invests in the stock market, when they sell and generate a profit, these profits are called capital gains and taxed.  The higher the tax rate, the less incentive there is to put money in stocks, and therefore less money to fund equity and thus company growth.  Less liquidity in the market results in lower equity values and less access to capital to fund promising companies.  Hong Kong for years had zero capital Gains taxes and pre china takeover became on the largest and most dynamics financial centers in the world.  

	2) while gains are taxed, losses are only counted to level they offset similar gains or $3000 a year.  In other words, the investor takes all the risk and government get a free ride to tax when there is a profit and doesn‚Äôt have any risk if there are losses.  

	3) capital gains are largely passive - you go to work all day and generate ‚Äúincome‚Äù by that work.  Most investments are passive, simply helping some organization fund investments.  the world benefited from these investments so we should incentivize ore investment not less.  

	4) Many - most likely the majority - of capital gains come from irregular events.  Such as the one time sale of a business.  Let‚Äôs say you sell your business in retirement that you worked a lifetime to build.  Sell it this year, 20% goes to. The government.  In Biden‚Äôs confiscatory tax scheme, the rate would be 45% to the government.  If passed - which I do not believe will happen, I believe its an election year scam to help sell the economically illiterate that Biden is for ‚Äúthe little guy‚Äù - sorry, I digress - anyway, the result would be a flood of sales pre effective date of the tax, depressed valuation and likely the interruption of million ones of jobs.   

	5) Business owners get to choose how much cash payout to take for themselves vs how much to reinvest in the business.  It is a societal good for such people to grow their businesses.   They buy equipment , hire more people, expand to different markets, etc.  If there is less value in growing the business (the government takes a massive share of it), less of all of the above will happen, to the detriment of society and the economy. 

	There are more but that‚Äôs enough‚Ä¶

		I agree that wealth taxes and taxing unrealised gains are poor ideas.  However, please elaborate on #1.  How is capital gains tax double taxation any more than income tax is?  The money that is used to pay people's income is largely money that was already taxed as somebody else's income.  Capital gains are not double taxation of your own money.  By definition capital gains are money that you didn't have before.  If you didn't have it before, you haven't already been taxed on it.

	A lot of really great points I haven't even considered about this. My big one is that many don't have the liquidity to pay some large tax on their stock holdings. It stands to reason they will have to sell off some of the very stock they're being taxed on to cover the bill. How does this not create a sizeable sell off in the stock market? With so many economic indicators showing us teetering on financial disaster, wouldn't this just be a giant shove off the cliff?

	Our evaluations of monetary value have become completely disconnected from their actual energetic cost that  purchasing power has been completely sabotaged to a point of no return.

	**Top 10% pay 70% of taxes** **^(\[)**[**^(1)**](https://www.ntu.org/Library/imglib/2024/02/whopays24-3.png)**^(\])**

	So factually the system works roughly as expected. Sure, everyone gets taxed *somewhat*. But it's clearly skewed towards the rich paying most taxes. And it was even ***more*** skewed in the past when taxes were just introduced. Over the century rich people lobbied and found ways to work around them. If you introduce this new way of taxing these 'safe taxing harbors' it will take them another century to figure out how to work around the system.

	Cap gains tax  on unrealized gains is the nuttiest proposal I've ever heard of.  First off, if they do this there will be NO cap gains to tax.  The economy will literally grind to a halt.

	How would they establish what those unrealized gains are?  Lets say you have a stock that goes up 40% and you pay the tax.  Then it goes in the dumper.  Now what?  Do you get refund?  Will they tax your home when it goes up in value?  Lets say a $500,000 house goes up 5% in a year.  Thats $25,000.  The proposal is a 44.6% tax.  Thats an $11,150 extra tax.  You have that much eXtra laying around to pay Biden and his ilk?  Lots of farmers around here.  They are land rich and cash poor.  Can they come u with an extra $100,000 to pay an unrealized tax when they might be only making $200,000?  Of course not.

You are right that they always sell the idea that only the rich will pay, but every time it's the middle class that pays. The lower class gets subsidized and the the wealthy work the tax code.

	Taxing unrealized gains just further makes the world sink deeper into a recession if there is one. The scenario - the market goes bonkers high in 2025 days on a windfall year and you get taxed up the B on unrealized capital gains taxes. The government sees $$ in their eyes as they‚Äôre about to collect, and the recession happens. They don‚Äôt collect because since the gains were unrealized, their gains fall with the market. They don‚Äôt sell to cover their taxes. End game - you get screwed, government gets screwed, global recession, nobody wins, game over.

	Your first argument is possible. Maybe we will be paying wealth tax. Your second argument is true, a spending problem is definitely real.

	However, neither actually address the pros and cons of a wealth tax. While it may be true that some day it may be a tax on people with 401k, that says nothing about whether or not it is good. Maybe the distribution of taxes would be more fair for more people, despite my personal reason.

	Second, the spending problem is not a con against the wealth tax. While I see your point, that is more of a statement saying the government shouldn't tax themselves out of this pickle, they should cut. Maybe the wealth tax is the best approach and most people would enjoy a tax cut.

	I too have problems with the unrealized gain proposal despite the fact that the proposed structure is very clearly directed at very unique circumstances impacting about 10,000 people out 320 Million and that (as proposed) would not impact total tax liability on a multi year basis because the step up in tax for unearned cap gains is a direct tax credit against tax on future realized gains.  If you want me to do the math for you I can do it in another comment.  My math n point is that in the long run it has zero impact on total net tax rate over multiple tax years.

	What I want to help you understand in this comment is the difference between Debt held by the Public and Debt debt related to social security, SSDI, Medicare, and Government Employee retirement trust funds as well as other ‚Äúinternal debt‚Äù of the U.S. government.

	This has very little to do with ‚Äúon budget‚Äù income tax revenue and debt held by the public other than interest payments.

	This ‚Äútrust account debt‚Äù equals money actually deposited with the U.S. Treasury from dedicated payroll taxes or regular spending paid to individuals or divisions of the government out of the normal budget in annual spending set aside for future use.

	Examples:

	1. Social Security Taxes are paid to the Social Security Trust fund as cash.  The trust fund deposits this cash (non interest bearing note of the federal government) with US Treasury which the U.S. Treasury replaces with an interest bearing note).  This is almost exactly the same thing as a savings bank deposit.  The only additional cost to the government/taxpayer is interest.  The government did not borrow money to generate this debt.  It issued a big CD for money deposited.

	Let‚Äôs say the government didn‚Äôt pay interest and just held cash reserves as cash.  It would still be a government obligation because cash is a government obligation.

	Let‚Äôs say that we increased SS Tax by 20% and made it solvent and started increasing the size of the trust fund to build up a bigger reserve.  Then the obligation  either in cash or government notes would grow despite more tax revenue.  

	2. With Government Employee pension funds something different happens: For each paycheck written there is an **on budget** current year contribution to the general pension account.

	After the **on budget* payment the resulting ‚Äúdebt‚Äù of the U.S. Treasury to that account gets treated just like the SS and Medicare trust accounts.

	3. Everytime Congress authorizes spending for a department (like the defense department) funds not immediately used by that department are deposited in a treasury account with or without interest via treasury notes.  Those deposits show up at internal debt from the Treasury to departments funded by Congress.

	**Total national debt is currently at about 120-125% of GDP comparable to the end of WW2 and then it took several decades to get it down to normal levels.  Back then most of the national debt was held by the public.**

	**Today ‚ÄúDebt held by the Public‚Äù is currently only about 95-98% of GDP and (because of the discussion above) that‚Äôs really what counts when it comes to **on budget** spending and taxation.**

	If you look at either a presidential OMB budget or Congressional budget you will always see on budget and off budget debt and financing numbers as part of standard presentation because of all this.

	You will also see the calculation of both debt types as well as spending levels based on GDP and interest rate projections and see the long term projection on total debt in different categories.

	One final note: 

	Anybody with reasonable knowledge of how our graduated tax system works knows the truth of the Fed chart you posted on Federal Receipts as a percent of GDP.  (It‚Äôs one of my favorite charts)

	The current Biden plan when you go through all the calculations and projections increases total receipts from the current 16.2% mark to the 17.5-18.0% mark which is slightly higher than rates just before Trump took office and where rates were for the first six years of Clinton until failure to index for inflation and growth of GDP took them even higher.

	Most middle of the road, non partisan economists would tell you that tax burden in this range is fiscally responsible, keeps the deficit and debt in line, and is not high enough to kill growth.

	Let me know if you want the math on the unrealized gain tax.

	What middle class people are paying > 30% in federal taxes?

	Tldr. 

	It's a fucking asinine idea. It will never fly (gawd I hope not)

	Let's say theoretically it does fly. I'd have to sell my house every so often to pay the unrealized gains on it. Whine all you want about that (I've seen comments before on this, what your house is worth that much? Yeah motherfucker it is!!). This would cause an instant bart on the housing market. Say what you want about trickle down theory, the entire housing market would fucking collapse. Most of our net worth is tied up in our houses. When that starts getting fucked with, the economy as a whole will start collapsing. You think inflation is bad now? Think about how much worse it would be if you didn't have the safety net of your home.

	It's just stupid. Fuck that.

	Why not just have a cap on how much capital gains can be taxed at long term rate before it is taxed as income. A cap of $1M, $5M whatever seems reasonable

	In Florida we had an intangibles tax for years. Until the republicans took over, of course. It worked fine.

	So isn‚Äôt the actually offensive thing about increasing wealth inequality that the billionaire class can live‚Ä¶ like billionaires‚Ä¶ without having the tax realization events that would be necessary to straightforwardly fund that kind of lifestyle?

	Like, I don‚Äôt think that the majority of people intuitively have a problem with unrealized capital gains being untaxed if their value is truly locked up in those assets. If Warren Buffet wants to live in his suburban Omaha home because he doesn‚Äôt want to pull money out of his businesses, that‚Äôs fine.

	But if you‚Äôre collateralizing your five thousand acre Montana ranch and your Caribbean island with shares you still own, using near zero interest balloon loans that you can just keep rolling over‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs offensive and insulting.

	Couldn‚Äôt there be a possible solution in increasing the number and types of income retaliation events?

	Like maybe if you‚Äôre using stock as collateral for assets that are for personal use, that stock has to be taxed or something‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm not sure logistically how you would do it, but just some sort of set up where if you buy a 5000 acre Montana ranch, you have to pay for it with after-tax money.

	If unrealized capital gains get taxed in 401ks I‚Äôm going to start buying treasury bills or securities that don‚Äôt have taxes. I‚Äôd maybe start putting more in CDS to fax guaranteed returns.

	How about if you use it as collateral for a loan, it gets taxed?

	Probably a lot of loop holes, but the theory makes sense to me

	Yeah this is basic shit. An unrealized capital gains tax would be a disaster. I'm all for a 49% federal income/realized cap gains tax above 500K though.
