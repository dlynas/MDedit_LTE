If you aren’t putting together that every protest movement in our country gets met with hyper militarized police force except white supremacists it’s easy to miss your rights being swept away as well



Put another way by someone much more talented than I “some of those that work forces, are the same that burn crosses”

THAT is the goddammed TRUTH!

Can you provide an example of white supremacists protestors that did not get met with a hyper militarized police force?

It’s because the hyper militarized police force and white supremacists are generally the same lol you can’t do fascism to yourself

& this entire time, politicians pass laws making it harder to protest, which leads to these arrests happening & being “justified.” so many people miss these laws because it’s not screaming in your face the intention. we must hold our lawmakers accountable for stripping our rights

Protests are one thing. I’m all for it. Deciding that certain students can’t go to class (Jewish students) because you don’t like a war being waged on the other side of the world by someone who happens to be of similar relation to them, is quite another.

The dots are there and numbered and everything, they still can’t do it

In school they sung the praises of civil disobedience and passive resistance, showed cops having to clear 60's protest crowds at great expense of labor by carrying people out one by one. Now cops just deploy enough pepper spray and tear gas to make the streets uninhabitable.

And the key to realize is that this is under a Biden Administration (not just Trump).

I am honored to have President Trump’s TOTAL and ONLY endorsement in the New Jersey Senate race. I stand arm in arm with President Trump in the fight against the WOKE, NEO-MARXIST TOTALITARIANS who are destroying our country.

Because some of them are apart of that group

It's gonna get much much worse since people think not voting against a criminal pseudo fascist is somehow going to keep him out of office.

if you guys weren’t so violent, this wouldn’t have escalated like it did.

Courageous conservatives are the only ones standing in the way of extremists getting their left-wing agenda passed into law. We are in DIRE need of your help to keep the People’s House away from those who chant such genocidal garbage as “Death to America”.

OTOH, this is what happens to RW protesters:
