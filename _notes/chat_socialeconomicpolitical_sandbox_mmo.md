> If the player that owns a land doesn't log in for say... 1 month, all the land and estate he owns goes up for auction.
> The money that the auction acquires (at least major part of it) goes to the player that owned it.

> You could build a home, a farm, a restaurant, a shop, a factory... Maybe own a club or casino, even.

> Basically the way to advance would be to set up production chains. And find the best way to provide it to others.

> There would probably be 'buildings' that you can place on any unclaimed block of land. Like maybe a fireplace, a tent or a mobile merchant stall or similar.
> 
> **SHOPS**
> Shops would be all player run. You can set up shops to BUY and SELL things. So, lets say you set up a timber shop right next to a huge forest. So new players can come and chop wood near your stall, and sell them for say 5$ a piece. You could flip them maybe for 10$ to the nearby WIP town, where people have money and want to build fast without wasting time to collect the resources.
> 
> Or maybe you have a farm, and a bakery. You could set up shop to sell your baked goods. Everyone needs to eat.

> 
> I'd like to balance it so that manufacturing actually takes considerable time and effort from actual player. So if you have a machinery to say... make clothes, you need someone with some tailoring skills to work it. An actual person. You could do it yourself, but maybe provide new aspiring tailor to work for you.
> 
> This provides a dilemma for me. No one likes to play a game where you're stuck in some factory, working on a line.
> Yet... if you get paid for it, you might actually be able to build such a factory yourself and employ people.
> Not sure. I kind of like the idea of needing considerable time, resources and actual effort from some player to manufacture something, but at the same time "Factory worker sim 2018" is not the goal here.

> I don't think there would be any direct combat. Maybe like hunting, but no PvP. It's not that I have something against it per se. But I just dont think it'd be an essential part in such a game. But the main reason for me to completely exclude this from my plans is the fact that it's really intensive work to actually include this. Excluding combat makes already ambitious project much more fathomable. Including the combat would mean completely re-working the server structure, as well as making everything much more resource intensive.

	This sounds so fucking bad

		Your opinion is just as valid as anyone elses.
		
		But like I said this is a niche type of game. Not catered to the biggest audience possible.
		
		But I would like to argue the importance of both NPC's and combat.
		
		When you look at your standard MMORPG's and imagine them without combat and NPC's then all that's left is... farmville. I agree.
		But that's not the idea here.
		
		* **NPCs**
		Are usually to fill in the shops and quest giving. That's pretty much it. Right?
		
		But if the shops are built and managed by players. And the quest and objective is what you set for yourself, really. Then the NPC becomes just a decor.
		
		I have thought about also leaving players in-game while they have logged out (for limited time). To leave them working on something. For example, being a shop keeper, or crafting something time-consuming while you're not exactly online.
		But you would be visible in-game, still, and marked appropriately.
		This would give better atmosphere for a game with small population, as well as make the game less grind-heavy.
		But then again this too has it's downsides.
		
		
		* **COMBAT**
		
		I would argue that - yes, game without some kind of 'combat' or resistance is pretty much bland and boring. BUT there are more than one ways to fight with one-another.
		
		Straight up combat, as in - go and hit somebody or shoot someone - is not something you have to have available in every single game. Not by a long shot. And that's the kind of combat I'm talking about.
		
		Economics can be used as weapon, as well as politics.
		For example - If there was a larger-scale struggle between several nations for certain resources or points, it would create a much grander scale of resisting force and 'violence' or 'combat'.
		
		Think combat more in terms of grand-scale RTS, not RPG or FPS.
		Conquering territories, not owning noobs.

		* 🟧 **[RagnarokChu](https://www.reddit.com/user/RagnarokChu)** ⬆️ 1 _(2017-10-21 02:17:32)_

			Problem with grand-scale RTS type game is the same problem with the opposite in heavily PVP based game. It heavily bleeds players after awhile because if you can't make it be a "winner", why would you bother being fodder to the ones above you.
			
			If it's so niched that the amounts of spots of "winners" you have are just slightly above the player count to support that then you hardly have a grand game to begin with. If I want to play a life sim were my work makes be better then other people I can do that IRL.

			* 🟦 **[Residev](https://www.reddit.com/user/Residev) (OP)** ⬆️ 2 _(2017-10-21 06:27:20)_

				So... who's the winner in WoW? Who's the winner in Second Life?
				Who's the winner in EvE? Who's the winner in *insert any MMO*?
				
				
				I'd argue that there doesn't need to be a leaderboard that decides a winner. Ain't no PUBG, no chicken dinners.
				
				The winner is the one who enjoys the game the most, I'd say.
				
				But I kind of get your point.
				
				I'll return to the community. I believe the way to feel like you're winning is the fact that you're successful in the game. You have properties which are profitable - which really means - the other players, aka community, support them.
				
				Or simply the fact that you stand up in the community. Maybe you have great ideas, or play your role great. Maybe they have voted for you to represent your village or town.
				
				
				About the "IRL" argument. You could say that to anything. This is worn. There's grind to most every MMO, and you'd be better of going out and grinding on something more 'real'. What people look for in games are entertainment.
				Even if you play a game where you have to "work" like you work IRL, you dont have the same responsibilities and effects as IRL does on your life. But it can still be rewarding.

					Everybody is a winner in WoW, Second Life, Eve ect because the game is guaranteed their success on what they are looking for in the game.
					
					In WoW I expect to be a hero of the lands, baseline wise I cannot be below this nor does it depend on other people.
					
					In Second life it's purely a socializing game, I win by socializing with other people. Nothing else in the game can artificially stop me from achieving my goals if I choose too.
					
					In eve winning at the game is living out the fantasy of living the space life. Which is arguably since there is a heavy influence on what you can and cannot do depending on when you joined the game. If you just like roaming around then sure, if you want to "move up in the game" there is an extremely restricted player based structure that you exactly have to follow.
					
					-----
					
					IRL argument applies because I do not play games to stimulates real life were my age, gender, background, luck, time of entry, ect ect to merely playing the entire game. Minecraft is fun because I can use my creativity to the fullest. What I can do isn't affected politically, socially or economically.
					
					With all 3 cats entire point of the game is to achieve higher standing in this, or do what you want. Which is impossible at a certain point because you cannot remove or complete with the people already above you. At a certain point within the game life-span at best I am fodder for everyone else success.
					
					It's not like in real life where I can "move" to another part of the country, or there is an ever growing population with different needs and wants (niche game). Due to the how the game is designed and limited population there would be at best a super city with everyone building around it. The problem is your counting on a thriving population to be spread across the map with people constantly building outwards without actual thought to human behavior and they are looking for.
					
					If there any remote sense of combat in the game what's stopping groups of players with there infinite respawns to run people down to remove them? If there is 0 combat how do you have groups of players enforce their power and opinion for a change? If there is no agent of change when why play if everything is going to stay the same once it's figured out and the initial wave of people plant their roots? Even if you do allow players to enforce their power (voting council or whatever) due to human behavior in a video game the people in power are the ones that were already there since the beginning.

		That's KIND OF what I was thinking.
		
		But rather than progress in time itself, it'd be more like advancement of technology,starting from primitive.
		
		Like you wouldn't see medieval fashion and such. But that doesn't change the fact that initial players would start in the middle of forest.
		
		In order to get to the chainsaw you'd have to get there first.
		You don't have any means to acquire metal either. So you're pretty much forced to craft, for example, a stone axe out of stone, wood and some twine perhaps. Then you can craft maybe primitive axe, then maybe bigger, better axe... finally reach the chainsaw.
		
		Or like... clothes. You wouldn't be able to craft high-end, fashionable garments straight away, you'd have to go with simple, primitive and easy to craft items.
		But that doesn't necessarily mean medieval, as in medieval style and fashion of clothing.

			I'm actually more a fan of restricting time setting to something more similar to medieval or renaissance era.
			
			Allowing for progression super high tech stuff is awesome in theory, as it allows for society to advance. However, what ends up happening in practice is some group hits a big milestone, like electronics, then either dominates the landscape. Alternatively, there's not much competition, so they share with everyone and essentially everyone just bypasses all early tech.

			* 🟦 **[Residev](https://www.reddit.com/user/Residev) (OP)** ⬆️ 1 _(2017-10-20 22:05:40)_

				I agree.
				I'm kind of in-between the 'modern' and 'classic RPG' kind of setting.
				
				* Modern has it's charm. It would be rather unique in the field of MMO's. It would have more industrial feeling. And there would be more areas to play with. Especially when it comes to town management, which is kind of like 'democratic clan' in my current vision. Like you said, electricity, fuels, plastics...
				
				* On the other hand medieval/classic RPG has it's own charm too... you know, a blacksmith, instead of noisy smoking machinery. Stone castles, log cabins, horses, nature... the atmosphere we all know. It kind of makes sense in a 'Player vs Environment" setting. Conquering a TV set, after driving on asphalt to home, is no conquering of environment.
				Besides, in a modern world you wouldn't go out and chop a tree. There would be like a monster-truck driving over rainforests. And you wouldn't go fishing with a rod - you'd net the whole ocean and throw the turtles back in.
				
				I guess what I'm trying to say is. Classical RPG/Medieval setting makes more sense and is more authentic in this sense. "Simpler times."

		Be settlers on a new (earth-like) world far away from any supply routes during a war. Your planet has been cut off from the nearby hyperspace gate and now relies on primitive tools after using all their high tech equipment years ago with no replacement parts. You can then actually have things progress in a realistic fashion as people rediscover technologies (rather than pretending that 10,000 years of technology is suddenly being discovered by super-geniuses who thought it all up within a very short game-like timespan).

	* Would there be a place for such a game? 

	Probably. Id use a farmville style and just slap it on facebook.

	* Would you play it?

	god no.

	* How would you see the mechanics working?

	Basically, eve online all on land without the pvp. 

	* What time would you see it in? (Hint: I've been thinking about something realistic and modern. No magic or dragons. More like skyscrapers (potentially) and cars (potentially))

	If you want to make anything from it, wizards and dragons seems the way to go for money to be honest. cutesy graphics 2d, quick and dirty development.

	Anything past that you'd be wasting time. The interest in a game like that is very low outside of a timewaster.

		Thanks for your opinion.
		
		However the game is 3D, standalone, 3rd person.
		
		Note that I'm saying IS, not WOULD BE.
		
		I have a client and server running. Terrain and nature generation mechanics in place and working. I can gather resources from nature and I'm moving onto building mechanics as we speak.
		
		You say wasting time, I say  - learning, at very least.

		You're on the right tracks for single dev indie project with mmo- features and persistent world, it'd need to a simple in execution as possible.
		
		>**Social/Economic/Political/Sandbox type of MMO**
		
		OP, you're bang on the money here what will eventually explose in the MMO- genre. So first choice is good.
		
		On your ideas, you have to start **hierarchical** on EVERYTHING! No random "this feature, pinch of that feature, 2 tsp of X and a 50lbs of Y etc"
		
		For example:-
		
		What emotions do I want players to experience?
		
		How will you try to represent these in the world?
		
		>*Social/Economic/Political/Sandbox type of MMO*
		
		So you've already answered up to here, I just added the above emotions above it. Next question is how to implement these:
		
		Virtual persistent world with avatars?
		
		What sort of world?
		
		What would make players want to interact with this world?
		
		You said it: Land, building, growth, buildings, crafting, trade...
		
		What would make players care about the above happening?
		
		... ! etc

			* Actually you hit the nail pretty much on the head.
			
			
			
			* I need to be efficient with my effort and focusing on the right things.
			This is kind of why I came to here, instead of keeping lowkey until something's done for presentation.
			
			
			
			* It's not my first rodeo, to be honest. I've developed before, for niche community, kind of like I'm planning. I know how important it is to consider community and find a following with a project like this.
			In fact, community is the most important aspect of this, and any MMO out there, I would argue.
			And community is much harder to develop than software.
			
			
			
			
			* I cannot provide a ton of features and content straight up.
			So I need to set a pace and milestones along the way.
			I think that's what you mean by starting hierarchical.
			
			
			* I know what I want - I want an open-world with persistent and player-driven environment. So that's where I'm going right now.
			The rest is pretty much up for grabs. That's why I'm here. I find this is what "sandbox" is. It's not how many sandbox-y features you can throw at player. It's how well the game can tailor itself around the players needs.
			
			###
			
			* My main worry about this is your last sentence... "What would make players care about the above happening?"
			Say I published my game to a site. Obviously I don't have, and won't have a huge marketing campaign or anything. So it has to be a soft launch.
			And I don't expect there to be a TON of players anyway.
			
			* So say I post the game here. One of you would download it, log in, look at the vast emptiness, and probably forget about it. So the next one comes... maybe some would take an interest, but then it would fade away too.
			
			* That's because players give all of this a value. Community MUST be the reason why players care to make above happening. This, and active developlent and progression. No MMO is fun without community.
			That's why I'm hoping to start a dialogue now, before I got anything real to showcase.
			
			* But I do plan that it'd be pretty open development. It has to be. It's cant be "5 years in the basement, to make the best game ever" type of thing.

					Thanks for the link.
					
					I agree with the post. And that's exactly what I'm trying to do. Like I've stated in the original post, I'm not looking to create a next-gen AAA MMORPG with a million online.
					
					Creating an MMORPG has been a "dream" of mine for awhile, since I first started playing MMORPGs as a teenager. And trust me, I have looked into it, and given up many times before even beginning. Because "you cant just go off and write an MMORPG... who do you think you are? You dont have hundreds of millions to spend, or the most epic team to back you up".
					
					But I do feel that I'm experienced enough by now that I know I can do it. I have the fundamentals. I know how to step forward. I could do it by myself underground and think that I will publish the game once it's "ready", but I also know that it's not possible. I've ran communities, and I've ran what you'd call an MMO before. I know that it'd be the wrong approach to this. 
					And I like how the post you link to also mentions how important the community is.
					
					The fact that I dont spend hundreds of millions, or have a 1000 people on payroll to support actually give me the power to do something unique. I dont need 500 000 paying, subscribing players for 5 years to pay back the time and money invested in this.
					I'm happy with much, much less.
					
					If there were a couple of hundred or few thousand active users that would be really awesome. And the game doesn't have to be fully-featured and rich at release. Just the fundamental has to be there. The community has to make the game to a degree, by their own needs.
					Or rather, the developer needs to be actual part of the community and listen for peoples needs.
					
					
					
					##########
					
					
					Many would argue that Runescape and Haven and Hearth are bad games.
					But you cant appeal to everyone.
					You either have mediocre appeal to large group, or you have a high appeal to small group.
					
					Runescape was highly popular. I played it. A lot of people played it, invested a lot of time in it. And it's made by two brothers. It has succeeded for over a decade. If you personally like the game or not has little value, as the game does exist.
					It still has tens of thousands of active players, even after the prime of the game is long past. Most of them are paying players too.
					The game is a success, if you like it or not.

							But that's really besides the point. There is room for more than one game of the genre. More than one game similar in it's concept. We're in an MMORPG subreddit, after all.

							* Open-world, persistent building
							
							* Player driven economy

								This is the key - of course.
								
								But a lot of players may know what they want but cannot express it in terms of a new concept MMO- game, without reference to old tired staples that won't work! That's the conundrum for a developer, that is very important.

	Why [Sandbox MMO's](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/75itel/sandbox_vs_themepark_aka_freewill_and/dodysj7/) fail. 

	From the looks of things you may have the building aspects but from I have seen there is no consumption aspects. There is no gameplay in it that people can enjoy outside of building things.

	>You log in, and you're in a middle of the forest. The land is 100% free and uncontested. You simply choose a place, and start to claim it.

	That means the claims will be all over the place. If your system don' generate player cities, you are doing it wrong.

	>So to fix it my proposal is this: If the player that owns a land doesn't log in for say... 1 month, all the land and estate he owns goes up for auction.

	This means the owners will have a patchwork of land instead of land for expansion.

	>I'd like to balance it so that manufacturing actually takes considerable time and effort from actual player. So if you have a machinery to say... make clothes, you need someone with some tailoring skills to work it. An actual person. You could do it yourself, but maybe provide new aspiring tailor to work for you.

	>This provides a dilemma for me. No one likes to play a game where you're stuck in some factory, working on a line. Yet... if you get paid for it, you might actually be able to build such a factory yourself and employ people. Not sure. I kind of like the idea of needing considerable time, resources and actual effort from some player to manufacture something, but at the same time "Factory worker sim 2018" is not the goal here. Thoughts?

	**Worthless.** Where is the gameplay in that? Do you actually think players will do another job for free? You might as well have NPC slaves and make a proper management game out of it. MMO Dwarf Fortress or Rimworld at least has potential.

	>This would be the basis of 100% player run economy.

	Your economy has no basis. There is no fun in it to the players.

	>Including the combat would mean completely re-working the server structure, as well as making everything much more resource intensive.

	Excuses.

	>At the end of the day, I do not think PvP combat is needed.

	There is a reason PVP combat in Sandbox games is that its the main driver of gameplay, now its not necessary but the question remains. **Where is your gameplay?**

	**Wide eyed idealist** think sandbox games you just add building,crafting and economy to work. But lets say if building is to limited too be creative, No Minecraft or EQ Landmark levels of expression here, the crafting is boring,monotonous,grindy and the economy broken, **what is there else to do?** What is the gameplay that players do for the majority of time and have fun with it? Don't even get me started on "procedural exploration", No Man's Sky already burnt that bridge.

	You can make it about building,crafting and economy but better be damn sure those aspects are **impeccable**, no ifs,no buts, you need to have clear mechanics that makes it fun and a game with challenge.

		First of all, thanks for the first post to actually question the idea, with proper brought up points.
		
		I understand much of what you say, and would have to agree to a point. But I would like to bring out some counter-arguments to see what you think about it.
		
		> That means the claims will be all over the place. If your system don' generate player cities, you are doing it wrong.
		
		I really don't agree here.
		Why would I want to generate cities, if there's no real meaning for them? Just for the atmosphere?
		
		About the claims being all over the place. That's true. But - I'd argue it adds to a gameplay in some ways, as in:
		You'd have to actually socialize to get the piece of land you want. And you might never get it. Unless maybe your neighbor decides not to play "for a month" and then you can bid on it.
		
		Also - I do plan to implement ability to build housing with multiple stories, so if you cant go horizontal, you'd still be able to go vertical.
		
		And what if your bakery is two streets around the corner from you house? I don't really see a big deal with it.
		
		> Worthless. Where is the gameplay in that? Do you actually think players will do another job for free? You might as well have NPC slaves and make a proper management game out of it. MMO Dwarf Fortress or Rimworld at least has potential.
		
		Who said anything about doing it for free?
		What if it's set up kind of like a quest replacement. Most of the quests in MMO's are fetch quests anyway. So say you have the equipment to weave clothing. You could set up the machinery so anyone can use it with set conditions.
		*"Bring 10 fiber to this loom, make a piece of cloth from it, I'll give you 100 monies."*
		
		Production is something to strive for. In my mind it would add a layer to simply gathering resources, to being able to reach a point where you get other people to do it for you.
		
		> Excuses
		Absolutely :)
		But I got to stay real here. I need to make it as light-weight as possible. Combat, and specifically combat result verification by authoritative server is expensive.
		Also, I do think that it is not necessary.
		
		> There is a reason PVP combat in Sandbox games is that its the main driver of gameplay, now its not necessary but the question remains. Where is your gameplay?
		Wide eyed idealist think sandbox games you just add building,crafting and economy to work. But lets say if building is to limited too be creative, No Minecraft or EQ Landmark levels of expression here, the crafting is boring,monotonous,grindy and the economy broken, what is there else to do? What is the gameplay that players do for the majority of time and have fun with it? Don't even get me started on "procedural exploration", No Man's Sky already burnt that bridge.
		You can make it about building,crafting and economy but better be damn sure those aspects are impeccable, no ifs,no buts, you need to have clear mechanics that makes it fun and a game with challenge.
		
		I disagree. PVP combat might be the main driver for you.
		I'm the type of player who don't care much for the PVP too much. Sure, it's fun, but not the main driver of the gameplay, definitely not for me.
		Many play the game for the simple fact of entertainment and community, but most importantly - the sense of progression and striving for some set goals.
		
		Whether you like it or not, it's the same for yourself. It's just that you like to set goals that are more competitive in nature.
		
		I'd use Runescape here for example. It's a pretty unique game in a sense that you have tons of skills and activities not related to combat. Farming, smithing, woodcutting, mining etc.
		And people are perfectly happy dedicating themselves to these. Most go out to kill monsters to get loot. But PVP is really not a big part of the game.
		I remember when they removed wilderness from their game which was the only big area dedicated for open PVP. Huge part of the community was outraged. And sure - for many this is a deal-breaker.
		But there's also a lot of people who, frankly wouldn't give a shit about PVP.
		
		**So, what is there to do?**
		
		At first, you need to gather resources. Exploration is something I don't see as a feature of the game at all, even if the terrain is procedural. It's there for a reason, and the reason is expansion - not exploration.
		
		You always need more resources, even if it's just food to survive.
		
		After you get some resources you can start building stuff. You can build in wide variety of places. You can choose from variety items to put in those places to give these buildings a function.
		This makes it strategic in nature.
		
		*Say you have a town - you can build another bakery in it, but there are already several. People don't need another bakery in this town, what they need is another lumberyard to expand further. But you don't care - you build another bakery, still. But you will undercut their price so you can still be successful, besides you really want to own a bakery. Then again... you could move to another town, or start your own, with no competition*
		At least this could be a model of how one would think and consider about what and where to build.
		
		
		But it wouldn't be all building. It's about community.
		So you can't really provide everything you need by yourself. You have to choose somewhat on what aspect you take a focus on.
		If you'd like to be the one who provides food or some other raw resource. Or the one who focuses on processing that material.
		
		You could be several things at once, of course - you could be a farmer, a baker and a bakery owner. But that's still focus on one branch of the tree.
		
		The way I'd like to do the character progression is that you can't really be the best in everything. Kind of like... "forget&amp;remember" style of skill system for the extremes.
		
		So, you can't be a a good farmer, a good baker, and good bakery owner, AND good metal smith, AND good engineer or whatever.
		
		My point being - you NEED the community to grow as a group, and this gives it drive.
		
		It's kind of like grouping up with people - you're the tank, he's the DPS, and she's the healer.
		It'd be kind of the same, you can group up with people and devise strategies and roles.
		* "I'll be the miner and smelter of metals, so Joe can be the engineer to build the machinery for Jane to cook her cookies on! We could be totally self sufficient and start our own little town! Cookies all around!"
		
		
		There's also politics which could be the "end-game" kind of thing for the people who have exhausted their interest in building stuff, and already have what they wanted.
		
		> You can make it about building,crafting and economy but better be damn sure those aspects are impeccable, no ifs,no buts, you need to have clear mechanics that makes it fun and a game with challenge.
		
		> Your economy has no basis. There is no fun in it to the players
		
		People play games for different reasons. There are tycoon games. There are city-builders and strategy games that involve little or no combat.
		There's Minecraft and there's Goat Simulator.
		
		Not all games have to be the same.
		And trust me I DO REALIZE how ridiculous it sounds when one says "I'm developing an MMO" - especially something that has no proven mass appeal on paper.
		But then again, I'm not doing it because I'm bored and just want to do it. I do think there's a kind of void in the are that could develop into something bigger and better. It does need work and thought. But there is a serious lack of some types of games.
		
		* Games like The Guild, which is basically just a RTS game where you control very limited amount of units and there's no real combat. Just trading and hierarchy. One could argue that it's boring and has no drive. And it's not for everyone, but there still is a following of people for such games.
		
		* Or another parallel with Runescape  - or Mabinogi next to it, which has "life skills" in it - and both of them have appeal to certain type of players. It's not about the overgrown world of PVP games. It's about finding something else altogether. There are so many WoW clones, but little of something else. ´
		
		* Or even The Sims, which also has appeal to some people (a lot of people, it seems), not because it has the best combat ever. Or that you can express yourself like Minecraft allows you to build GPU's and GIFs of pixelated characters out of blocks. But for the simple fact that you can live out a life that is not yours. You can kill people in pools, and build a little house like you want it.
		
		All of these games have also people who would never play it. It seems pointless and boring. *"No aiming, no DPS - what is this?!"*

				> Are you paying the minimum wage? Then how is that not working for free?
				People working for your virtual bullshit is not going to power your economy. You have to make that virtual bullshit engaging and I see no evidence of this in your design.
				
				Look at you, PVPing for your virtual bullshit.
				Posting in a subreddit dedicated to virtual bullshit.
				
				> Let's take your example. What is that player going to be doing? Maybe bake bread or bake bread? Could it be bake bread? Then bake bread? More bake bread? Less bake bread? Could it just be that you bake fucking bread? It must be baking bread!?
				Do you now understand? A games needs choices, it needs consequences, it needs mechanics, it needs concrete ideas that work and are fun.
				
				Baking bread is a choice. It has mechanics. You need to gather resources for bread, as well as develop an outlet to sell said bread. 
				It has the possible consequence of making you wealthier in order to perhaps bake more bread. Or maybe try out some other kind of activity, not involving bread.
				
				> What PVP does is modulate the economy. It gives real values and demands that can be manipulated. It is a source of change from which the economy must adapt to and give rise to new opportunities while shacking up the establishment. YOU as player that likes to play in a certain way does not need to participate. But someone has to so that your way of game can work.
				
				I kind of agree with you here. Combat/PVP give various items bigger value. A sword +2 is worth more than sword +1 and so on.
				In crafting based game, the better crafter can make better swords and sell them for higher prices. Blabla.
				
				All in all, it creates a item-based goal and money sink for economy.
				It creates items that people desire.
				
				My theory to replace this is - your building and equipment in it is your new "sword" or "sword +1", as well as your product.
				
				For example. A bread +1 or "High Quality Bread" would satisfy your hunger better than "Bread +0" or "Average Bread", giving it more depth and consideration for both buyer and seller.
				
				Also, the equipment that players make and use to process stuff. Like "Baking Oven" and "Baking Over +1", which is capable of perhaps making bread faster, or maybe it is able to produce "Bread +1" when "Baking Oven +0" isn't.
				
				It's an economic PvP, kind of.
				
				> The patchwork community with no city.
				Patchwork community, developing a city*
				Yes.
				
				> Except combat is a real fucking game with complex mechanics. It's why combat is ubiquitous, and management/tycoon games not so much, and you're not even a management game.
				
				This makes no sense to me. So "Combat is a real game" and tycoon/management games are not?
				You later say you like the genre, so... it just makes no sense.
				
				This is very much a management game. A strategy game. A sandbox game with economic and political functions. This makes it so you can manage your economical facilities, as well as the city their reside in, with politics.
				
				
				> I completely agree and as someone who likes the genre I can say your game has nothing of that sort.
				The Guild has AI NPCs with AI workers. If you want to make The Guild fine. Add you NPC slaves and build a management game around it. But if you are trying to us players as AI workers it will not work.
				Runescape has plenty of combat. If you want to make another skill grinder game have at it but we are way past people playing those kind of games.
				Does your game have the creative expressiveness of The Sims or Minecraft? Engineering awesome stuff like in Factorio?
				
				I'm not comparing this with Runescape or Minecraft or Factorio directly.
				I'm saying - it has the same kind of allure to it, in my eyes, as some of these games do.
				
				Yes, runescape has combat, minecraft has combat, and even factorio has combat. But that's besides the point. Combat is not an essential part in any of them. Players play each of these games with different objectives than conquering the biggest boss, or gaining the best weapon. Runescape might be exception, but still there is a major chunk of players who do take objectives that are completely different. 
				
				Besides, I'm completely open to the idea of AI workers. It's all just a theory at this point, the very reason I'm here to discuss the ideas.
				I just think it would be pretty cool idea to actually have players replace the AI, or turn the players into AI when they log off.
				
				> Before you have a community you must first have payers sticking around, I see no reason to.
				
				And you have no obligation to. I've stated multiple times that I realize this is a niche product, and I'm not looking for a million players to be online.
				
				I don't particularly enjoy flash dress-em-up games. So I've successfully managed to avoid participating in them, or discussing them. I simply steer away when I see one.
				
				But thank you for your opinion. Many of what you bring up is what makes me doubt in the ideas. Player needs incentive.
				But I do think that for many the incentive of progression, sense of community and general management of the world + possible grand-scale strategy decisions would make it all worthwhile.
				
				Even if all of it is "virtual bullshit".

					It's a quantification of depth. Combat can have very high depth and is pretty easy to get it. Current Management/tycoon games have less depth and very hard to get more. You have no depth. Its perfectly logical.

					That is all fine. I want that kind of game. But you need to put much more thought into it. Your **game development concerns** are not your only problem. Tackling an unexplored genre means you are going to have a lot of **design concerns** also.

						Please do realize that this is exactly why I'm here.
						I'm not here to promote my game or the perfect game idea I have.
						
						I'm here to simply state:
						I'm trying to develop a niche MMO with such and such features. Lets chat and discuss how this could and should play out.
						
						> I sword +1 would be a bad equipment system even in that case. A bread +1 would be even worse, what kind of stats does it give? Why should I care about brad +0, bread +1, bread +5 or bread +16? It just fills a hunger bar what is the point?
						You are underestimating what value might entail. You are not God sets commandments in stone on what is valuable. You are not Comrade Stalin controlling the State Economy.
						
						
						The "Bread +1" is just an example. Let's call it "High Quality Bread" instead, for better taste. It could have various properties to make itself worth more to a player. Like filling the hunger meter faster. Or perhaps modifying the maximum fulness the hunger-meter can have. Perhaps it boosts the speed the player is able to work for a short while.
						
						Similar to how a sword gives you faster attack, or higher damage. Or shield can give you better defense or chance to parry.
						
						But the point is, I've not decided or designed any of this, yet. It's open for discussion, as I do realize the value of community. And I am more than willing to listen the feedback and ideas.
						
						> Don't take it personal, I am just putting some pressure on you to get you to think.
						Its not like there is no solutions. There are plenty of games to take inspiration from. You have game like Space Station 13 that can give you an idea how to make players interact with each other. You have The Guild and Patrician.
						In my big list of links i have some topics on management and trading games you might want to check out. I also have an idea along the lines but it requires at least AI workers, and more classical sandbox MMO idea.
						
						I don't take criticism as a personal attack. No worries.
						
						But I would like this dialogue between me and all of you to be more solution oriented.
						
						Rather than pointing out the problems, I would value ideas, suggestion and solutions much more. As I'm getting into the phase of development where I need to start considering every step I take, and how it influences the gameplay.
						
						I do not have time or energy to just fiddle around with systems that would never work.
						I do not claim to be the one who knows all the solutions.
						
						But that's not to say I don't appreciate the pointing out of problems either.

								But the thing is, it's not a survival game. It's not about finding the next portion of the food.
								
								But if you do need to eat to survive, then there's economy in exchange of the food. Even if it's cheap, everyone requires it. Kind of like it is in real world. It isn't complicated to survive or find food. You just go to shop and buy some. Let someone else worry about it.
								
								But if one person sells "Regular old bread" that fills my belly +10 for 3$, and another player sells "High Quality Bread" that fills my belly +15 for 4$... that's a competition, and player would consider the price, the effect as well as proximity and convenience.
								So the player selling "Regular old bread" has to either lower the price to 2$ a loaf, or get better at baking bread.
								
								Or what if "Regular old bread" is able to fill your belly to a margin of 100, while "HQ Bread" can fill it to a margin of 150.
								You might go out and buy cheaper bread to fill it up to 100, but also some loaves to boost it up to 150, so you don't have to eat as often. Giving the market a chance to sell both of the items. Leaving both of the items relevant at the same time.
								
								
								There are various ways to approach this.
								It doesn't have to go to extremes. Some people might just go into the first shop they see, and buy apples instead of bread. Even if they cost more and are less effective, they'd rather do something else. They don't care about if it's 3$ or 5$ or whatever.

										The food that is needed to survive?
										
										Or the money that player buying the food gives to the shop, to receive said food, to survive?
										
										
										////
										
										Parallel from real life is - does it matter or have any value if you go to soup kitchen, mcdonalds, pizzahut or gourmet restaurant?
										
										In the end you're getting your belly full, and live on your pointless existence of insecurity and lies that is our political and monetary systems. So, you acknowledge it has no value...? What?
										
										
										It's just, to some people it makes no difference if they buy a 1$ burger or a 100$ burger.
										They simply have enough money to buy both or either without it swaying them either way. So they make their choices on the grounds of convenience and taste, instead of effectiveness and value.
										
										How does that make it so the burgers have no real value?...

	Holy shit OP, have you been reading my diary? I’m ready to play this game right fucking now. It’s exactly the sort of thing I’ve been looking for but seems to be so bizarrely difficult to find. Just a pure sandbox with no (set) objective, pure simplicity and focus on community. And just... life. As for time and setting I’m extremely pleased to hear you are steering clear of ugly futuristic themes or dime a dozen pseudo-medieval fantasy dragon goblins and whatnot. I’m seriously interested in this. Would love to be one of the first players and help establish a community. 

	The best games to me are ones where you CAN do anything, but you don’t HAVE to do anything. Except survive, of course. 

	Really excited about this. I’d like to stay up to date! Good luck, stay true to your vision. There’s gotta be an audience for it. Slim chance that I’m the only one dying for something like this lol. 3D open world, just perfect. Let me know if there’s any way I can help out!

		Thank you for your feedback :)
		
		The economic aspect of the game is the most troublesome. Obviously it's (one of) the main drivers of the whole game. So supply and demand must be in balance.
		Economy must be sustainable.
		
		My current vision includes this:
		* Terrain and nature is generated.
		* Some resources are rare, but deplete slower. Like metals and mountains of rock. Once it's gone. It's gone.
		* Some resources, like trees and plants are abundant. But once you cut down a tree, the tree is cut down for good. It wont respawn again. But you are able to plants trees and other plants. Yet, seeds are also limited and it will take time for them to grow. Especially trees.
		*Some resources are infinite. Like fish from the sea. I'm also considering machinery to extract resources from the land at slow pace, but being infinite.
		
		
		I think that's a good start for sustainable economy in a sense that...  there is no infinite faucet for all of the resources. You would have to venture further and further away to find new nodes of limited resources. Or wait for them to grow again.
		
		Major part of this is also money, which I'm having some problems with.
		
		It needs to be sustainable, and inflation has to be under control.
		
		One idea is to have gold as limited resource, and minting coins as a part of the crafting tree. So the currency is literally player created, and finite. Players would find small nodes of gold trough-out the world.
		
		Since there would be no goblins to kill who drop currency, but it has to be made available somehow.
		
		
		About the setting... I think feudal setting is the way to go, the more I think about it. You're right, it just makes more sense. It's easier to implement into the gameplay, while leaving it to fell 'authentic'.

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 2 _(2017-10-22 04:13:02)_

	The idea is nice, but I think that 1 month is too long time. Otherwise the game will be full of empty buildings. 

	Chronicles of Elyria plans to  turn players in to a kind of NPCs when they are not logged in. I really like this idea. As an alternative inspiration there is a web rpg in which all buildings decay over time, so if you build  something it will slowly disappear. This gives a nice feel to the game.

	* 🟨 **[Residev](https://www.reddit.com/user/Residev) (OP)** ⬆️ 1 _(2017-10-22 05:29:09)_

		I've thought about buildings decaying as well. And this is certainly something I want to implement in one way or another.
		
		But auctioning off other peoples property, instead of waiting it to decay has a lot of good sides to it, I find.
		
		First, it creates a competitive market, and potential to buy something that is worth more than you pay for it. Kind of like these auction shows on TV or whatever...
		
		
		But it also makes it so that the effort a player puts into the building of the property is not simply decaying to nothing. If the property is in a good location, or has good features to it - someone would buy it. And if it's an auction, it has a good chance of fair price for it.
		And the original owner, even though absent from the game either permanently or temporarily, gets something in return for his effort, even if he loses the property.
		
		But **most importantly**, I want the game to look and be persistent. This largely includes economy. I want to limit the economic faucets that feed the game, as well as sinks - to keep the inflation under control as best as I can.
		This means the resources that were put into the building of property are likely not infinite, and thus the very walls have some kind of value.
		
		Sure, if you buy a property you can demolish it and build it from scratch. And it could decay into nothing if a player completely abandons it. But I think this is a nice way to go about it, kind of best of both worlds.

		Hopefully there are people around to socialize with. That might be a reason.
		
		You can start gathering resources and building stuff.

	When I see another new sandbox MMO, first thing I want to know about it is what will be main drive to do anything in it. Politics doesnt work without conflict. 

	Most players in SWG were on basic treadmill. Most players in EVE are about PVP. Players dont spend months in games just because they can.

	What mechanics will provide motivation to do stuff in your game? Why would I want to be successful factory owner or whatever in it? What can I do with that success?

	* 🟨 **[Residev](https://www.reddit.com/user/Residev) (OP)** ⬆️ 1 _(2017-10-23 09:45:16)_

		What do you mean by "basic treadmill" though?
		
		Saddly, I've not been part of SWG, or Ultima Online, which both tend to be the "daddies" of the subgenre. I've looked into both, and I have tried SWGemu briefly. But I haven't had the opportunity to "capture the essence" of neither.
		
		However my goal is to make the motivation of playing to be the sense of progression in, and as a community foremost.
		But yes, answering the replies here I have realized that it might not be enough.
		
		Looking at the possibilities I have with current limitations - combat being the major one.
		And the angle of "grand-strategy" - I'm thinking about some form of combat mechanics as well. Still not PvP style of combat. Not in a regular sense anyways.
		
		
		I'm thinking about - making AI NPC's part of the game. But rather than NPC's being rather static - make it so the politicians could hire and position them.
		Think town guards, controlled by town leading player(s).
		
		Townspeople would need to (probably) pay for them in form of taxes. But could also have a chance of arming them with weapons and armor perhaps.
		
		Just an idea at this phase. But it could be possible solution, while still allowing me to keep the game server in the form it is now, and not worry about player griefing, and cheating (as much).

			> What do you mean by "basic treadmill" though?
			
			Farm levels (skillboxes in SWG), farm gear, farm crafting mats, get stronger, farm more of the same - repeat till NGE. With all stuff SWG did differently, most playtime was spent in same way as in any mmo - grind stats and items.
			
			Controlling dumb NPCs is not politics, more of pokemons training. And it would be hard to do well, imagine leading players taking a vacation and NPCs are being unsupervised for a while, then after timeout they suddenly start following different leader. Keeping in touch with your NPCs would be a huge chore, since they are supposed to be limited. You cant have unlimited guards, unless they are just for show.

				I believe you might be following a wrong genre. MMO's do it on purpose to prolong the gameplay. They're social and interactive in nature. They often **make content for years, instead of providing it for hours**.
				 
				As opposed by single-player games that provide more varied and action oriented content that you blaze trough in some hours or days and move on.
				
				***
				
				Grind-less MMO might seem nice and casual on surface, but at the end of the day - grind is what makes achievements worthwhile. The question should be, rather, how to make that grind fun, or at least tolerable.
				
				The answers are mostly to give players a choice on what to grind. Various skills or methods. Or making it social - so the actual grind becomes sub-action, rather than main focus.
				
				MMO's without any sort of grind would simply be empty and pointless. What would keep you playing if it wasn't some sort of gear item, or level or similar goal that you have set for yourself?
				
				Blaze trough quests, get more powerful items, go trough same scenario as everyone else, be just as powerful and look the same like everyone else in the game - what's the fun in that?
				
				Time + effort = accomplishment and reward.
				
				***
				
				And to reply to the rest of what you're saying - there's a whole lot of assumptions and little more.
				
				I literally have no idea where you get your NPC politics, pokemon training or... overall NPC mechanics from.

					Who are you talking with? I surely didn't ask for grindless MMO, I dont think traditional MMO is even possible without grind.
					
					Fun grind gets old really fast anyway, what is really needed is proper system built on top of grind. Devs add grind and slap in some small systems then think its done. Grind should be like walking - natural and necessary but not a purpose of a game. Game should be built on top of grinding mechanics, not around it, meaning every system should be interesting without grind. Grind is there to just control time.
					
					>Time + effort = accomplishment and reward.
					
					BS. Heroic deed can take one minute and feel more rewarding than years of some bland hard work. Time-consuming mechanics are needed to control speed at which player can achieve things and to create a mood.
					
					>I literally have no idea where you get your NPC politics, pokemon training or... overall NPC mechanics from.

		I have thought about the monetizing part of the MMO aspect.
		Contrary to other indie projects that are fueled by interest against the subject, an MMO can not survive on love and praises.
		
		MMO needs a server to be running which has cost.
		
		Having been part of projects that are free for the player, but do have costs of running a game server, I believe that game can be free, and still survive.
		
		I believe that once the game is able to be played with, players are willing to support it, if they find interest in it.
		
		Say there are 100 active players. So there is a need for a server that can support that, and more for reserve.
		Or 1000, or 1 000 000, it doesn't matter.
		
		In those 100 players there are probably 10 who are willing to give up 10$ a month just to have the recognition of having supported the project. A badge infront of their name in forums or in-game, or something.
		
		Now there's 100$/month to keep the server running for 100+ players.
		
		##########
		
		Now here are some other considerations. Is 100$/month enough to keep the server running for 100+ players?
		Well short answer is, yes. And that's for 100 players online at the same time.
		
		Long answer is, it depends. It depends on the server architecture and how resource intense the process and bandwidth usage is per online player.
		
		This is part of the reason I have swayed away from real-time combat. It has expensive to have combat that is fair, real-time and MMO/Open-world capable.
		Not to mention the development time it requires and balancing.
		
		But that being said. I have taken resource needs into deep consideration since the beginning of the project. The server needs to be as light as possible with given features.
		It has dictated some of the design choices, as far as I've thought this trough for myself, it is completely doable using relatively light-weight and scalable server-infrastructure compared to AAA titles.
		Making it both cheaper to run, and faster to develop such an MMO.
		
		**######**
		
		**Now, your specific question is - why am I not asking for trillions of dollars on KickStarter like any other dev?**
		
		* I believe and I have witnessed that such a project can be supported by much less, and I believe that it's actually better to ease the project into existence. Rather than announce something grand, ask for trillions and then underdeliver, like so many projects have done.
		
		* I believe that things cannot be planned too far in advance. This includes making the game financially viable. There is no telling in how big the interest in the game will be, given the zero marketing (includes kick-starter), community-centric nature.
		
		* Once there is an actual product, I might open up a channel for people to support the project. Something like Patreon, or maybe even kickstarter or indiegogo, once the projects future is more certain. 
		
		My biggest concern in the development is graphical part of it. Modelling and animation. Especially animation. It certainly would be nice to off-load some of the work to someone else who knows what they're doing :)
		
		**My goal is to keep the game free to play, and fair for all, if possible at all.**

		It could be either a resource or effort based struggle.
		Or, thinking about it, there might be need for limited PVP combat after all.
		But since the focus on on persistent, open-world - the combat would not be. Rather, something limited to specific location and timeframe.

		Sure, however I would like to mention that I have created a community forum to discuss this project on - you can find it at http://reside.cf - I had some problems with it and just set it up AGAIN. It should be fine now, however.
		
		If you're interested in the concept and would like to read more, ask questions, and have a voice in the development of this project - I would very much like to see you at forums.
		
		***
		
		I do not want to punish players for not playing all day, everyday. And as such nothing directly will happen to a player who plays 4 hours a week.
		
		However - I think it is also important to value both time and effort the player puts into the game, and obviously the player who plays 4 hours a week should have much slower progression, and smaller role, than player who plays 4 hours a day.
		
		***
		
		The major penalties to players who don't play will start to show up when you don't play for awhile. Lets say you haven't logged in for a week or month.
		The specific time-range is a matter of discussion, but at some point the properties that the player owns will be auctioned off. That is necessary to avoid abandoned properties all over.
		
		The player will get (a part of) the profits from the auction - so when the player returns, the progress is not lost completely. But setback is obviously there.
		
		***
		
		I also have an idea about how character progression would work - and this could involve a mechanic that would make characters 'forget the skills' they have, either with time - or simply to balance the character in a classless system.
		
		I do plan to write on it in more depth.
