	And we are done

	**Edit 1:**Also a side note

	I haven't covered any nsfw and nsfl subreddits because I was running out of space. There's a 15000 word limit for self posts. But if you guys want, I can work on a seperate post for that. Now there might be a few errors in this post. Grouping related subreddits together was the hardest part and you can see some subreddits that don't particularly belong to the type they are mentioned in. If you notice something unusual let me know

	Also the reason I have linked to a top post for each sub is because no one really has the time to check out each one of these. So the top post might give you an idea what to expect from the subreddit with a single click(or without a click if you have hoverzoom installed)

	Feel free to copy it, edit it and submit it to other places. And do check out the related subreddits as well. They are equally great and I linked them in a different row only to save some space (and so that I dont cross the 15000 word limit)

	Here's the source if you dont have RES installed

	http://pastebin.com/eykN2P4p

	**Edit 2:**I hear a lot of people saying that this may harm the smaller subreddits and may turn them into shit. Although it can be easily countered with good moderation and most mods will love to see some more subscribers, its still much better if we save them the the trouble and do our part as subscribers. So I ask you people to please read the sidebar before posting anything or voting on posts in any of the subreddits. It will help keep the quality of these subreddits

	**Edit 3:** I just wanted to point out that /r/ImGoingToHellForThis and /r/firstworldanarchists are not exactly meme based.  Infact they don't even allow memes. I don't know why I made that category. So please don't submit memes to those subs

	**Edit 4** I might add it to the post later on but for now I will leave this here

	Checkout these sites if you are looking to discover new subreddits:

	* http://www.metareddit.com

	* http://redditlist.com

	* http://stattit.com/

	**Edit 5**: I am working on a new version of this post(error fixes, better grouping, some new subs). I won't post it again but I will add a link here. So if you are interested, do check back this comment on wednesday

	**Edit 6**: Here's version 2 of this post

	* Sorted subreddit list according to interest using the data from this post (I wrote the number of subscribers before posting this here and I noted the number of subscribers after a day of posting it here. The difference shows the amount of subscribers gained by each subreddit through this post. I then sorted this list using that data, with subreddits that gained most subscribers on top of the group and so on)

	* Added the multilink directly in the post

	* Fixed a few errors, fixed groups

	* Added 10 more subreddits, deleted a few

	* 🟨 **[zuperxtreme](https://www.reddit.com/user/zuperxtreme)** ⬆️ 43 _(2013-07-14 22:06:05)_

		Just so you guys know, with [RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) you can add multi-reddits to the nav bar:

	* 🟨 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 11 _(2013-07-14 18:52:58)_

		Could you add /r/NatureGifs to your list?

		* 🟧 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 10 _(2013-07-14 18:55:09)_

			Whoa, I'm pretty impressed by the quality of content in there considering its age.

		* 🟧 **[endisnear12](https://www.reddit.com/user/endisnear12) (OP)** ⬆️ 5 _(2013-07-14 18:58:07)_

			Added it to the multilink. Neat sub

	* 🟨 **[joshguillen](https://www.reddit.com/user/joshguillen)** ⬆️ 9 _(2013-07-14 21:37:18)_

		This is what keeps Reddit alive and expanding. Like a small business Saturday, it's little posts like these that keep the mainstream subreddits from overwhelming the little guys. Thank you.

	* 🟨 **[buglp](https://www.reddit.com/user/buglp)** ⬆️ 8 _(2013-07-14 23:12:38)_

			Wow. Thanks a ton. I can finally go ahead and subscribe to 100 subreddits now

			* 🟦 **[Chucmorris](https://www.reddit.com/user/Chucmorris)** ⬆️ 4 _(2013-07-14 21:50:08)_

				One of the Amazon subs I think it was amazondeals ran the links through referrals. 
				So the mods, who were the main submitters, were making money of each click they got Amazon or something like that.
				
				 Not sure if the other subreddits do that but just a heads up. 

				* 🟪 **[earnestlyhemmingaway](https://www.reddit.com/user/earnestlyhemmingaway)** ⬆️ 7 _(2013-07-14 23:53:08)_

					Yeah, a few of the beermoney sites do it as well (mainly r/hitsworthturkingfor) through adfly. I figure hey, they're helping me make money, why shouldn't they gain a measly cent for me clicking through their link?

				* 🟪 **[sklark23](https://www.reddit.com/user/sklark23)** ⬆️ 3 _(2013-07-14 22:33:49)_

					They still do. Anytime someone tries to xpost to fmf I have to check to see if there is a referral and almost every time there is

					* 🟥 **[Chucmorris](https://www.reddit.com/user/Chucmorris)** ⬆️ 4 _(2013-07-14 22:50:01)_

						Yeah, I browsed that sub regularly for a bit. And finding out threw me off it. I guess I wouldn't have cared as much if there was a warning in the sidebar. It's a bit shady if you ask me.

	* 🟨 **[Dr_HL](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dr_HL)** ⬆️ 5 _(2013-07-14 23:39:25)_

		Hey there, could I shamelessly suggest adding /r/CatsInSinks to animals? :)
		
		Also I'm not sure if one of the mods have already stepped in, but I'd like to vouch for /r/movieoftheday ? The guys there put so much love into that sub and it's really great for movie lovers to explore new movies they might've not seen. They could use some exposure.
		
		Thanks for compiling all of this!

	* 🟨 **[ThatGuyYouKindaKnow](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThatGuyYouKindaKnow)** ⬆️ 8 _(2013-07-14 19:59:48)_

		Can I suggest /r/classicalmusic to be added?  Very inclusive to anyone new and when if someone has a question it will be answered to its full extent by atleast 10 people, [case and point!](http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/ylm0t/im_14_and_just_discovered_classical_what_do_you/)  I went from not having a clue and wanting to try something new to finding a new passion!

		* 🟧 **[endisnear12](https://www.reddit.com/user/endisnear12) (OP)** ⬆️ 3 _(2013-07-14 20:02:28)_

			Added to the multilink. thanks

	* 🟨 **[roastedbagel](https://www.reddit.com/user/roastedbagel)** ⬆️ 5 _(2013-07-14 21:22:15)_

		You should add /r/FoodHacks to the food list, cause, it's an amazing community with chefs as mods!

	* 🟨 **[deathbyaspork1](https://www.reddit.com/user/deathbyaspork1)** ⬆️ 3 _(2013-07-14 18:16:57)_

	>Name: Birds with arms  

	  

	What the fuck is that?  

	  

	>Description: Birds with arms  

	  

	Oh, okay.

	* 🟨 **[endisnear12](https://www.reddit.com/user/endisnear12) (OP)** ⬆️ 63 _(2013-07-14 18:20:28)_

		I am not a creative person

		* 🟧 **[walruz](https://www.reddit.com/user/walruz)** ⬆️ 37 _(2013-07-14 18:49:16)_

			Don't fret, it's the best description anyone could hope to achieve. 

	* 🟨 **[Skyb](https://www.reddit.com/user/Skyb)** ⬆️ 10 _(2013-07-14 21:48:42)_

		But that's the most accurate description possible for that subreddit. It contains birds with arms.

		* 🟧 **[k1o](https://www.reddit.com/user/k1o)** ⬆️ 5 _(2013-07-14 22:53:31)_

			Much like the lesser known /r/helicopterswitharms

	* 🟨 **[Jman513](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jman513)** ⬆️ 3 _(2013-07-14 22:50:52)_

* 🟩 **[Psychosonic](https://www.reddit.com/user/Psychosonic)** ⬆️ 17 _(2013-07-14 20:09:43)_

	As a mod of /r/FearMe and /r/FifthWorldPics, thanks for adding us to the list!

	* 🟨 **[endisnear12](https://www.reddit.com/user/endisnear12) (OP)** ⬆️ 10 _(2013-07-14 20:11:03)_

		I love /r/FearMe. Thanks for making such a great sub:D

		* 🟧 **[Rachmaninov43](https://www.reddit.com/user/Rachmaninov43)** ⬆️ 10 _(2013-07-14 20:38:27)_

			Bad bad idea to look at this at bed time.

* 🟩 **[jsmayne](https://www.reddit.com/user/jsmayne)** ⬆️ 16 _(2013-07-14 21:23:32)_

	**www.metareddit.com  see all 246,655+ subs!** 

* 🟩 **[bansley](https://www.reddit.com/user/bansley)** ⬆️ 14 _(2013-07-14 20:26:51)_

	Wonderful post, thank you! 

	I'd also like to suggest /r/Documentaries - I have found so many great films through this subreddit. 

* 🟩 **[scottlawson](https://www.reddit.com/user/scottlawson)** ⬆️ 54 _(2013-07-14 20:28:51)_

	I noticed that you didn't include any biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, or engineering subreddits. Here's a quick list of my personal favourites in case you want to add a science section:

	**Science:**

	/r/science 

	/r/Physics

	/r/compsci 

	/r/chemistry 

	/r/chemicalreactiongifs 

	/r/biology 

	**Space and space related science:**

	/r/Astronomy

	/r/astrophotography 

	/r/space 

	**Engineering:**

	/r/engineering 

	/r/EngineeringStudents 

	/r/EngineeringPorn 

	/r/MechanicalEngineering 

	/r/ECE 

	**Math:**

	/r/math 

	/r/cheatatmathhomework 

	**Other:**

	/r/dataisbeautiful 

	/r/GradSchool 

	/r/AskAcademia 

	

	* 🟨 **[endisnear12](https://www.reddit.com/user/endisnear12) (OP)** ⬆️ 16 _(2013-07-14 21:18:25)_

		All these are great subs. The reason I haven't included these is because most of these are too obvious. For EX: /r/engineering is the first thing someone will type when looking for engineering help. Same goes for /r/math, /r/physics etc. Same reason why I haven't included subreddits dedicated to particular sports, teams, games etc. 
		
		 /r/dataisbeautiful and /r/chemicalreactiongifs are there in the list.
		
		There are a couple of subreddits that does sound interesting and should have been there in the list but weren't included because there's a maximum word limit in a self post

	* 🟨 **[cptn_jtk](https://www.reddit.com/user/cptn_jtk)** ⬆️ 3 _(2013-07-14 22:48:16)_

		Don't forget /r/futurology either! 

* 🟩 **[Celebreth](https://www.reddit.com/user/Celebreth)** ⬆️ 45 _(2013-07-14 18:04:55)_

	Just a quick note! /r/AskHistorians is one of my favourite subreddits, and as such, I'll go ahead and include this note here. The moderation there is extremely strict (Same as /r/AskScience), and as such, the quality of the sub is kept at tip-top shape. So I'll go ahead and note here that before you post in /r/AskHistorians, please [glance at the rules quickly before you do!](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules) They're pretty basic, and getting your posts deleted is no fun at all. Good luck, have fun, and enjoy the sub!

	* 🟨 **[mollaby38](https://www.reddit.com/user/mollaby38)** ⬆️ 13 _(2013-07-14 20:56:37)_

		This should probably be mentioned for any new subreddit you're thinking of subscribing to. Read the sidebar! Reading the rules will give you a good idea of what the place is about. Browsing a little bit before contributing will also help.

	* 🟨 **[Morningrise](https://www.reddit.com/user/Morningrise)** ⬆️ 7 _(2013-07-14 21:18:13)_

		And read the [popular questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/faq) before submitting one.

	Hey, thanks for putting /r/albumaday in there. I'd love it if more people showed up there, I'm a moderator there, and I submit reviews on thursdays. I've found a decent amount of music I like from it.

	Here are the last 10 reviews:

	1. Spooky Action at a Distance by Lotus Plaza.

	2. Beach Head by Sun Araw. 

	3. Emergency &amp; I by The Dismemberment Plan

	4. Head On by Samson

	5. Homogenic by Björk

	6. Balkans by Balkans

	7. Wormfood by Jamaican Queens

	8. A Ass Pocket of Whiskey by R.L. Burnside

	9. Gods of War by Manowar

	10. Return II Space by Digital Mystikz

	We're trying to make ways for the community to participate more; the head moderator there just implemented a new "suggest an album" button, so you guys can suggest things for us to review. I try my best to make good reviews. Again, it'd be great if you guys would stop by, there aren't many subscribers yet.
