## After leaving the protest, pro-Palestine protesters were unexpectedly apprehended by the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group as they boarded the subway to disperse from a @palyouthmvmt march. The NYPD’s actions raise serious concerns about civil liberties and freedom of assembly.”

	So they arrest Pro Palestinian protestors in the subway but allow over 100 Proud boys to jump the turn style and fare evade on camera after coming back from an extremely racist march through Greenwich village, without so much as a single word from the police.

		Pssttt it’s bc the police are a legalized gang with no system for consequences of their actions and they support and uphold a christofascist “agenda” that punishes and kill’s people for advocating for the rights of anyone who is not straight, white, Christian, and AMAB. 
		
		We are in the first phase of a descent into christofascism. And while this is often an overused analogy… this is exactly what the third reich did in the beginning. Blame and condemn the media and press (“fake news!”) ban and burn books, demonize queer people as “pedophiles,” create an “us vs them” mentality by establishing a scapegoat persona (the Jewish, queer, disabled, etc) and exploiting the hatred of the scapegoat group as means of a unified cause, protect corporate power and suppress labor power, anti-intellectualism and anti-science/evidence, establishing military supremacy/military service to the fascist cause as moral superiority, and obsession with borders and national security.

			I hate telling this story but it needs saying.  
			
			
			Like 20 years ago I was walking home after school when some boys from my school that I didn't even know tried to knock my head off with a pipe stuck out their vehicle window. I heard the whistle as it went past my ear and felt pain as it caught and yanked out some of my hair. The guy holding the pipe stuck his head out the window and turned around to shout a word at me, which until that moment I didn't realize could be used as a slur.  
			
			
			I stood rooted to the spot in shock for awhile before bursting into tears and continuing the walk home. I was still bawling when I walked in the door, and since both my parents were at home they were quickly both sitting next to me in a police station while a cop leaned low to hear my answers and took careful notes.  
			
			
			Then he asked if they said anything during the attack. My parents were religious and I didn't want my home life going to hell for something as far as I understood the term wasn't true, but I told the truth followed by a panicked "but I don't even know why they'd say that!"  
			
			
			The cop bolted up straight, took a step back, looked me up and down real quick, frowned, snapped his notebook shut, and basically said "there's nothing we can do, go home now."  
			
			
			We didn't have the words for this stuff back in the day but I'm non-binary. My friends at the time told each other I'm "male software running on female hardware."

			I feel like this is an incredibly naive take that is devoid of historical context… not sure how we could be in the first phase of a descent into Christofascism when the country was objectively more of what you would call a „christofascist“ state in the past… if anything , the country has been gradually steering away from what you would call the „christofascist“ state over the past 60 years.

				We were more Christian, but less fascist. MLK was very religious but not a fascist.

					I mean I guess I don’t know what you define as fascist, because it is one of those terms where everyone seems to have their own squishy definition. 
					
					I would define it as a scenario where the ethnic majority dominates all levers of power and uses that power to reinforce a strong national myth that further reinforces the power of the ethnic majority, whether or not the is at the expense of everyone else. According to the creator of fascism himself, Mussolini, you cannot have fascism in a democracy, it can only exist in an autocracy. 
					
					Per this definition, the US has never been a fascist state, but by some measures you could say it used to be more fascist than it is today. For example, take all the laws introduced after the end of slavery to reinforce a system that was racist by design to the benefit of the white Christian majority. Also, look at how police forces in the 60s responded to the civil rights movement. We have objectively improved since then, although things aren’t perfect.

	NY state also recently deployed the national guard into the subways. 

	Additionally they’re moving to a mostly phone and credit card based fare system (over the cash based metro card). 

	Additionally they’re moving to gate-like turnstiles that can’t be hopped over or crouched under.

	Additionally the governor is pushing a move to ban people with a criminal record from the subway.

	50% of NYC, and 80% of Manhattan, does not own a car. The subway *is* freedom of movement, the subway *is* freedom of assembly.

	Their intentions here are very obvious, and it’s clear why they need a police department that would rank 24th in military spending if counted by itself.

									Yes I would push for police to release all security footage. None of that justifies the headline though. There are lots of things one could have done to be detained by police. I'm not going to speculate. Instead, the OP should support their post with credible facts like who the woman is and why she were detained. This post is highly misleading.

	I guess when people's right to protest makes the donors feel   uncomfortable....donors  "feelings" matter more than the rights of the common man 

	This must have been planned by NYPD , mayor and the GOv?

	Is this the new group that was deployed to the subways?

	It is similar in the UK as well...but at least they say it a bit clearly - "you people have protested long enough. Now shut up" is the message.

		Yeah I'm sure things would have gone *much* better if one of the protestors pulled out a gun during this situation. As opposed to what actually happened where no one was shot at all.

			I know right...that would have made from page news and the cops would have gone nuts.
			The media would have had breathless coverage on how the protests have turned violent and need to be curtailed 
			
			
			In the UK...their home office minister etc have been openly saying things like ' protests have gone on too long ...now shut up. We heard you ..but not gonna do a thing "

					I think armed resistance has its place and time and it will be sooner and in more places if this is allowed to continue. There is nothing deterring the government from doing this more and for whatever reason it deems appropriate.

			Yes, I am aware of the bonus march and other similar events. It would be somewhat difficult to get a tank down into the subway or a transport terminal/hub. Things would then be more pvp at that point.

				PVP?
				
				Used tanks as an example. Seems like the venue (subways ) was chosen ...if not thanks .the government can still bring different things to bear!

					To me it looks like a difficult place in which to deploy these tactics since these are closed spaces with little room to move around. A crowd can work against the police here just as much as the police themselves.

			Because I wanna see the full vid, get the full story?
			
			Because videos have never been cropped to look innocent. Because never in history has someone taken advantage of how thing look instead of how they were.
			
			Whats scary sad is when someone releases the reality of ppl and don't just believe anything they read on the internet, that makes them what's wrong with a country? Are you nuts?
			
			Police aren't supposed to do shit like this if it was a peaceful safe protest.
			
			But guess what? That small a space with that many ppl, might be a fire hazard. Refusal to gather somewhere with a higher person capacity is illegal.
			
			Blocking the entrance/exit to a subway is illegal.
			
			Harassment (screaming at ppl when your right next to them) is illegal.
			
			You and everyone that downvotes or disagrees with simply wanting to see the protest before the cops showed up, is to scary stupid to have a say in things that effect others lives.

			And we don't get to see what they did just from this vid. The caption tells you what your small brain is supposed to see.

		Mayor is a dem
		President is a dem.
		
		Suspect this was planned ..to make sure protests die down and people stay away.
		
		If this has happened in China/even (Syria /Egypt in 2012...)...the US government would have put on the "human rights mask" and condemned.
