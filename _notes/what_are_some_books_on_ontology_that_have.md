	Marin Heidegger's "Being and Time". The first half. Completely transformed my way of thinking in a way that I didn't think was possible.

	You will need a mentor/teacher/complementary material to grapple with the text, though.

		Can you elaborate in what way it transformed your thinking?

			Well, the whole idea of the book is to break down some ways of thinking.
			
			He's trying to get you out of, specifically, a dualist frame of mind, where you are something like body+mind ("Cartesian Dualism") and define whatever it is that we are ("A conscious entity", lets say) from scratch, without using dualism. It's a fascinating exercise, and he does this quite effectively. Heidegger absolutely can argue well, but there's something more profound that he does. Actually, a couple of things.
			
			First, he uses language in a novel way to try to escape the labyrinth of our vocabulary and the ways of thinking it constructs. In this, there is something very close between Heidegger and Wittgenstein: they both believe language lays traps.
			
			Second, he has an uncanny way of "getting behind" concepts that I don't think I've seen anyone do. It's such a weird feeling how he describes certain things, how the specific word that he chooses completely dislocates your previous perception. It can be something like using the word "ejection" to describe how we move through time that is so vivid, or how he describes the relationship between the carpenter and the hammer, or how he builds complex ontological structures with concepts that are so commonplace and easy to miss ("Idle Talk" and "The One" come to mind), an uncanny ability for a perfectly placed analogy that illuminates (I'm thinknig of "it's easy to forget you're wearing glasses" or how he thinks as consciousness as stepping into a clearing).
			
			I could go on and on. The moment that Heidegger clicked for me, and I was reading it from the start, again, understanding it, was absolutely my intellectual "Matrix Moment", the feeling of gaining access to a completely new way of seeing reality.

				That sounds pretty cool! Any authors I should be familiar with before embarking into Heidegger? I do apeak german natively.

				* 🟪 **[Anarchreest](https://www.reddit.com/user/Anarchreest)** ⬆️ 7 _(2024-02-16 12:29:30)_

					Kierkegaard and Nietzsche really help. The overlap between S. K. and Heidegger in particular is something he often tried to dismiss, but it rings through clearly when you're comfortable with both.

						Sidenote: actually, Heidegger opened the door to Nietzsche for me, which I consider it as a blessing because had I known and read Nietzsche in depth at an earlier stage in my development I would've been susceptible to some of the worst messages from him.
						
						I kinda feel that Heidegger helps with Kierkegaard more than the other way around, but for me Kierkegaard was always a particularly obscure philosopher. Anyway that's my rant.

							From what I've read of Heideggerians, there seems to be a pretty unfair treatment of poor Søren, possibly influenced by Heidegger's own dismissal of him. If you crack what S. K. is getting at (and remembering half the time that he is shrouding himself in irony and jokes to tease you towards the answer), I really feel he opens up Heidegger. Sadly, I've only come across Caputo and Dreyfus (a notoriously controversial Heideggerian who might better be referred to as a secular Kierkegaardian) who made a case for S. K.'s unfair subliminality in Heidegger's work.

					Humm well the canon of western philosophy going back to ancient greece doesn't hurt.
					
					EDIT: I kid, but if you have no clue about Kant or Descartes or a bit of an overview of modern philosophy, you won't get how what he's saying is important.

					* 🟥 **[hagosantaclaus](https://www.reddit.com/user/hagosantaclaus)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-16 12:17:21)_

						Yeah I‘m decently familiar with the canon and Kant and Descartes

						* 🟫 **[kurtgustavwilckens](https://www.reddit.com/user/kurtgustavwilckens)** ⬆️ 4 _(2024-02-16 13:26:09)_

							Have at it then. I'm sure its gonna be a trip in German. I read it in Spanish and we have the privilege of an absolutely delicious translation by José Gaos who also studied under Heidegger.
							
							Enjoy!

								Yes, I have a mexican friend who is very much into heiddegger that told me about this. The only problem he has is nobody understands him when he speaks about philosophy. 😅

		The late Hubert Dryfus has load of videos on YT bout this he was an expert on Heidegger.

		can you suggest a good complementary material too please?

			Actually, I don't know that I can, it was a while back, I took some classes on it. Gianni Vatimo has a very beautiful book on Heidegger. Hubert Dreyfus has a very americanized understanding that I would recommend you only touch AFTER you've had some scuffles with the text yourself. He can taint your interpretation, I think, but its good for bringing it together afterwards.

			* 🟦 **[apophatic_confusion](https://www.reddit.com/user/apophatic_confusion)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-02-16 12:59:24)_

				americanized version
				
				What do you mean by this? Ive come across alot of ways to understan B&amp;T each approach has been helpful in understanding but Ive never heard it put this way.

				* 🟪 **[kurtgustavwilckens](https://www.reddit.com/user/kurtgustavwilckens)** ⬆️ 4 _(2024-02-16 13:02:40)_

					I think he oversimplifies some stuff and tries to build a too neat of a structure on top of Heidegger that sort of misses the opening line of Being and Time (the question about Being being very important).
					
					It's supposed to be a book about Being mainly, while Dreyfus makes it too much of an anthropological analysis for my taste.
					
					Don't get me wrong, its great, but in taking away some of the mistery it... takes away some of the mistery.

			william j richardson’s **heidegger through phenomenology to thought** is the most comprehensive and intelligible second hand literature on heidegger’s thinking i’ve ever come across

		Yea while I’m definitely interested in Heidegger- everything I’ve heard about his work seems interesting- I’ve also heard he can be pretty inscrutable at best 
		
		Is there any complementary material that you would recommend to make the reading more digestible ?
		
		I’ve also heard he can be particularly difficult to translate and that often a lot is lost in English translations, is there any way to get around that issue, or any specific translations you can recommend ?

		* 🟧 **[kurtgustavwilckens](https://www.reddit.com/user/kurtgustavwilckens)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-02-17 05:38:57)_

			You can check out the other comments for some additional resources. 
			
			Regarding the translation, I read the book in Spanish where we have a traditional and great translation by a highly prominent spanish philosopher called Jose Gaos and never looked much into the issue.
			
			The inscrutability is, I think, not as bad as people make it out to be, as long as you're open-minded about it and not get confrontational with the text (a lot of people feel outright aggrieved by the way some philosophers write).

			* 🟦 **[natetheapple](https://www.reddit.com/user/natetheapple) (OP)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-02-17 05:56:40)_

				Yea I realized you already answered my first question a bit after posting it lol sorry bout that 
				
				Unfortunately I can’t speak Spanish so I’ll have to go with another translation but I appreciate the recommendation 
				
				I’m glad to hear he’s not as esoteric as some say, I’ll try to approach the book with an open mind and hopefully I’ll get a lot out of it, thanks for the info

					Don't get me wrong, it's pretty inscrutable, but I get him waaaay much more than others. For me, Heidegger has nothing on, for example, Derrida, in terms of instructability.

	Terry Horgan &amp; Matjaz Potrc's _Austere Realism: Contextual Semantics Meets Minimal Ontology_ is mind-bending and compellingly argued.

		How difficult of a read is it? 
		
		Would you say it requires a lot of technical knowledge or is it fairly accessible so long as you have some basis in ontology ? 
		
		Prima facie seems interesting tho, I also love the word ‘blobject’ lmao
