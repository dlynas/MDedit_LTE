I've been a professional negotiator in the music biz for almost a decade. It's should be simple. Here's how I negotiate shows for my artists.



1\. Start with the room capacity (Try to play rooms you can pack out), and figure out a reasonable ticket price that your fans will pay. For the purpose of simplicity, let's use a $20 advance ticket price in a 500 capacity room.

2\. $20 x 500 tix = $10,000 gross potential. Easy, right? So why do some artists and managers ask for $50,000 when it's 5x their actual value? Who's going to be willing to take that L?

3\. So, if a promoter or venue has the potential to gross $10,000 from tix, they still have to pay for a number of expenses... Let's say they spend $500 advertising, $1500 for sound/lights/rental, $500 security, $500 hospitality, which equals $3,000 in total expenses.

4\. $10,000 gross potential minus $3,000 expenses = $7,000 net potential. My job as an agent is to get a solid amount of that potential guaranteed, while allowing the promoter to profit, so they can stay in business. It's important to establish good relationships with promoters.

5\. In this scenario for a tour, I might get guaranteed offers anywhere from $2,000 to $7,000. In all offers, I look for backends, so after we reach our split point (the guarantee + expenses + taxes/ fees + 15% promoter profit), we should get 80-85% of the remaining profits.

6\. Pro Tip: At sellout, I'm looking to see that 60-65% of the total gross should go to my client. So if the show sells out and grosses $10K, we should walk with $6,000-$6,500.

7\. Offers vary based on market size, room capacity, and ticket price. You normally see higher guarantees from bigger cities, but you shouldn't discount B and C markets. I'm an advocate of starting with some high offers in big markets and then routing smaller markets around them.

8\. You can also ask for some extra perks up front, such as hotels, backline, hospitality, meals, and travel. Sometimes I ask for these knowing I won't get them all, but it allows me a few bargaining chips I can back off of in order to maximize the guarantee for the artist.

9\. Promoters may offer a door deal (a percentage of gross or net ticket sales), but with no guarantee. If you believe in your ability to sell tix, you may decide to take the risk. If you do, make sure you have the potential to make more at sell out than you would with a guarantee

10\. I'm not a fan of door deals. But be aware that with guarantees, promoters often pad their expenses, so you may not reach the backend as easily as you think. Padding expenses is common business practice, but you can ask about some specifics such as where ad budgets are spent.

11\. Know the difference between a talent buyer (who works directly with the venue) and a promoter who doesn't work in-house. Talent buyers can sometimes offer more, because they get income from the bar, parking, ticketing fees, etc. Promoters only make money from the show.

12\. Some promoters and venues also ask for a percentage of merchandise. Some let you keep all of your merch money. This can be negotiated, but they may want 20% of your soft merch (clothing, non-music items) or they may want 20% of all merch. Again, it's negotiable.

I know it's a lot to pack into a tweet, but hopefully these tips help. Feel free to message me if you have any other questions about how these negotiations work.

Thank you for sharing this with the TL.

We know you work hard, so we do too to bring you top tier offers like this one.

In your scenario wouldn’t you seek out venues that buy talent directly? Seems like most 500 cap venues at this point have the infrastructure in place to mitigate some of those expenses and if the artist is providing all the ticket demand…why go through a promoter?

I work with both. I do a lot with venues directly, but sometimes they don’t understand the value in a certain artist. You can’t fully rely on one or the other.

Thank you Erik. How do you handle “arts funded” / soft tix situations where the economy is not totally based on tix sales (and where you’re kind of guessing their budget, esp if they insist on you naming a price). Would love to see a thread on your thought process w/ this.

Don’t have a whole thread, but I gauge by asking their budget. It may be more than I would have asked, so that’s a good way to start. Usually they want someone specific so it gives us more leverage. I might ask double what I would for hard ticket, esp. if we have to cover travel.

Glad it helps. Appreciate it.
