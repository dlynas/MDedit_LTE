	"The kind of strategy is kind of meet social needs and then like an NGO, the more that capacity
	grows, the more you become dependent on conventional institutions for acceptance, cooperation,
	funding, access.
	And it's like, it's like the material reasons that the politics dissolves is the orientation
	was never about, oh, we need to build a revolutionary party for organizing a diverse multinational
	working class for the fact that revolution will happen.
	Right?
	That's not even, that's not part of it.
	The politics is always in, up becoming secondary.
	Listen to our full conversation with Jody Dean and Kai Heron, anywhere you get your
	podcast."

	"When we think about the sort of nonprofit industrial complex, it is
	laundering all of our capitalist sins through this kind of like idealized faux
	praxis in the form of feckless philanthropy. Filetropic ventures and the
	organizations that support them are crucial to maintaining the capitalist order,
	not just in their sort of like emotional material and psychological laundering,
	but also in their functional role, the functional role that they play in
	emeliorating a very small amount of material hardship just enough to
	maintain the illusion of progress and quell these sort of feelings of distress
	we may have when we are in fact confronted with these terrible realities of
	capitalism. And the very idea of the nonprofit itself
	cements the notion of an individuated reality and an individuated
	culpability under capitalism, not a systemic one, not a collective one."
