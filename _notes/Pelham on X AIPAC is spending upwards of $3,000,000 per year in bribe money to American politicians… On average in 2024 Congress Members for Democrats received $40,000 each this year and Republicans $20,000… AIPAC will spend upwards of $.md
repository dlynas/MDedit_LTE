AIPAC is spending upwards of $3,000,000 per year in bribe money to American politicians… On average in 2024 Congress Members for Democrats received $40,000 each this year and Republicans $20,000… AIPAC will spend upwards of $10,000,000 on political bribes this year to get their candidates elected… This is how the zionists control American politics… and every single politician receiving bribes should be trialled for treason..



AIPAC will spend \*$100,000,000\* this year:

“AIPAC has dedicated $100 million to defeating Democratic candidates in the 2024 U.S. election to counter growing support for Palestinians. During the 2022 election cycle, AIPAC made $13 million in political contributions to members of the 118th Congress.” democratherald.com/opinion/letter

US giving money to Israel, Israel giving money to US. Why bother with the transaction in the first place, then 

Stop donating to these crooks and betrayers!

People worried about Muslims taking over, but the Zionists conquered that hill along time ago.

AIPAC sets the price for Congressional bribery.

They got all this amount of money so what next , it will not make them immortal in this life

From the figures in the video I think you mean at least $30m, not $3m. $3m is actually a small sum. However, your point about how easily politicians are bought remains the same.
