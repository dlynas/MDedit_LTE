			Well you could put the proper amount of context to each of these tips. But by then you’ll essentially be writing a research paper over each one and hopefully realize how much more there is to being able to do some of these things than just a simple want to do them. The “small steps” “eat properly” and “manage your state” are all things that can be made incredibly difficult if not impossible based on the requirements of your job for example. “Work to live NOT live to work” misses the fact that in many current economic systems you are not encouraged to do what would be best for you as an individual. If you are not able to meet a particular economic threshold doing what make you happier then just doing something as simple as feeding yourself or addressing a medical situation at all can become difficult to accomplish causing you to be forced to eventually give in or die. The problem is that all of this is just very surface level advice that if it works at all will only work under particular circumstances. And like you have done it is often presented in a “this is all there is to it” manner which isn’t true as there is so so so much more to it. Like if one of these things works for someone that’s great, but that doesn’t mean it can work for everyone as not everyone is in the same situation that will allow for the same outcome. People are not cookies so stop trying to use cookie cutters on them and their problems.

			These guides ought to be backed up by science and have sources somewhere in them, I suggest in very small writing at the bottom. So long as it's correctly formatted people will be able to understand it.
			
			It's good that you want to help people, but it can't just be your opinion. You could seriously damage someone's life if they take your advice to heart and you realise later it was bad or useless advice. That's time they could have spent learning effective methods, and some people don't have much time because of health reasons which they're looking for advice on.

	Great advice for de-stressing your life if you’re in management!

	Stressed at work, don’t worry just drop all your work/deliverables/responsibilities and go for a walk! You’ll be de-stressed in no time when you won’t have to worry about reporting to work the next day.

Don’t get me wrong, the reason I read through the comments is because of how ridiculous it find the  post to be. Cheat fairly regarding food and water, and strike that blasted powerhouse if you’re in a “bad” state of mind?

			Are you seriously trying to argue that lying in a purportedly "backed by science" piece of media is fine, so long as no one "does harm" by using it?
			
			Misinformation is misinformation, period.  Claiming that lies are "backed by science" not only discredits you, but makes people less likely to trust actual science in the future, as more and more they see lies being pushed using a "scientific" narrative.

		So bad that it hurts.
		
		"Just breathe properly guise, so ez.  Can't believe you weren't doing that right along.  Open your eyes!!"  Breathing properly is instinctual, and if someone isn't doing that already, there's a reason why not.  I had to get a major surgery done on my nose to fix my physiological problems that prevented me from proper breathing so I can sleep a full 8 hours at night.  That's hardly available to most.  At least the "if you're feeling depressed, go take a shower" type drivel is actionable.
		
		That's the common thread between all the real helpful advice of this style.  It's always well into draw-the-rest-of-the-fucking-owl territory.
		
		It's nonsense that's so superficial it feels as though it's been written by retarded aliens that observe humans from 1000000 lightyears afar but have never interacted with any.  If I actually had to bet, I'd put my money on this book (or perhaps the guide?  seems like this guide is adapted from the referenced book) being mostly written by AI.
