## links between white supremacy and narcissism.

![[3230456627831048703.mp4]]

"There's a reason why people are silent.
There's a reason why Joe Biden is able to do everything
he's doing and still sleep at night.
If there's a reason why people are able to defend genocide,
it's narcissism.
White supremacy is a byproduct of narcissism.
I made a little van diagram, that's a circle
because there are no differences
between white supremacy and narcissism.
First, we have the tragic victim complex,
which we're seeing loud and clear every single day
on this app.
White people make themselves the victim
because when you're a victim, you don't have to be held
accountable for the oppressor's actions.
This is done both globally and interpersonally.
Like, we are seeing propaganda from the Israeli government
to make us believe that they are the victim
even though they are obviously not.
You also see this with white women tears.
Next, we have lack of empathy.
This is how some people are able to watch a genocide
on their phones and somehow go about their normal lives
and stay silent and say it's complex.
It is because they lack empathy.
And as we are all being indoctrinated
into white supremacy, one of the first things it does
is it attacks our empathy.
It's also wild to watch how whiteness has more empathy
for fictional characters, celebrities, dogs
than they do for Palestinians.
Next is sense of entitlement.
Both white supremacy and narcissism
makes you feel entitled to land, money, comfort,
the result of whiteness not receiving
what they feel entitled to.
It ends up deadly in so many situations
because they feel entitled to power.
They feel entitled to land.
They will commit genocides to get land.
That's the heritage of whiteness.
Next is the bread and butter tool of narcissism,
which is gaslighting.
We're obviously seeing this with propaganda.
We're seeing this with celebrities.
Interesting because celebrities spend a lot of time
establishing power.
Then when important things happen, they pull back
and act as if they do not have power
to change or influence.
They spend their lives trying to gain influence
in the moment we need them to actually use
that influence suddenly.
They don't have it.
A post won't change the world.
They're on this app, seeing what's happening
with our own eyes.
And then our government officials are telling us
that what we're seeing isn't real.
Even Joe Biden is trying to plant seeds of doubt
around how many Palestinians have been on a lot.
They are doing whatever they can
to make us doubt what's real, what's actually happening.
Both narcissism and white supremacy
cares so much about image.
This is why all of our white friends
who were BLM are silent.
This is why.
They cared more about appearing good to you
than actually caring about BLM.
They cared more about appearing woke
than actually being safe for black and brown people
to be around.
They care more about how they look
than how you feel.
It is everything to them.
They want to be perceived as good
and not being perceived as good feels like hell.
They don't want to post what's happening
because they don't want to be controversial.
They don't want to get in trouble.
They want to look good.
This is why they rewrite history.
They want to be remembered as good
even when they weren't good.
During American at all,
you know how our politicians occasionally
do nice things to gain approval.
All editions love to do this.
It's like we're asking for one thing,
but you give us the other thing.
That's not quite the thing that we want to,
but at least it's something
and we're supposed to be happy with this something.
And they use that to paint their legacy.
Like when I criticize Trump,
people will say, well, Trump got a stimulus checks.
It's like I'm glad that we got those
but we deserved more.
All of us deserved more.
Then the middle of them, oppressing us,
they do these nice things
and we're supposed to be happy with them for some reason.
Difficulty taking criticism.
I feel like those of us who are from marginalized communities,
we experience this a lot on an interpersonal level.
And we see it when big things happen in the world
and we're critical of our government
of different systems that are put in place to keep us safe
or provide for the people.
When we're critical of the villain system,
suddenly we're the villains.
This is also because whiteness thinks it's at the pinnacle
of self-awareness, of intelligence.
It thinks that it's the standard here beyond reproach.
As black and brown people were criticized constantly.
So we have so much awareness of everything that's wrong
with us and our communities.
But if you do that to whiteness, it is your terrorist.
Next we have that they depend on nostalgia to keep you bought in.
We see this a lot at like the Olympics
and different sporting events.
Like they want us to remember how great it is to be an American.
Whiteness also loves to use nostalgia to fear monger.
Because when we're afraid, they're able to control us.
The willingness to exploit is what they do best.
To even survive in capitalism, which serves whiteness,
you have to be willing to exploit.
Like that is part of it.
The reason why so many of us are okay
with the exploitation of others,
it's because we're being exploited ourselves.
Next they like to rewrite history once you leave.
The US likes to rewrite history as it's happening.
Whiteness and narcissism takes the person who's the victim
and paints them as bad.
Or they paint the villain as good.
They'll say things like,
but my family was nice to their slaves.
Like they were nice slave owners.
They lie to create the narrative that they want.
Even the amount of celebrities and public figures and politicians
who will try to act as if they were propel sign the whole time.
There will be so many over the next five years.
This is why one of the best things that we can do is simply remember.
Remember Amy Schumer, remember Selena Gomez,
remember these people who are being horrible.
We know that they're gonna try to rewrite history.
This was something that was actually studied
by Dr. Carl C. Bell back in the 70s.
He was a black psychologist who wrote about the links
between narcissism.
