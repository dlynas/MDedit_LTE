The **United States fiscal cliff** refers to the combined effect of several previously-enacted laws that came into effect simultaneously in January 2013, increasing taxes and decreasing spending.

The [Bush tax cuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_tax_cuts "Bush tax cuts") of 2001 and 2003, which had been extended for two years by the [2010 Tax Relief Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Tax_Relief_Act "2010 Tax Relief Act"), were scheduled to expire on December 31, 2012. Planned spending cuts under the [Budget Control Act of 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_Control_Act_of_2011 "Budget Control Act of 2011") also came into play. That Act was passed as a compromise to resolve a dispute concerning the [US debt ceiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt_ceiling "United States debt ceiling") and address the failure of the [111th Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/111th_United_States_Congress "111th United States Congress") to pass a federal budget. Discretionary spending for federal agencies and cabinet departments would have been reduced through broad cuts referred to as [budget sequestration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_sequestration "Budget sequestration"). Mandatory programs, such as [Social Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States) "Social Security (United States)"), [Medicaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid "Medicaid"), federal pay (including military pay and pensions) and veterans' benefits would have been exempted from the spending cuts.

The fiscal cliff would have increased tax rates and decreased government spending through sequestration. This would lead to an operating deficit (the amount by which government spending exceeds its revenue) that was projected to be reduced by roughly half in 2013. The previously-enacted laws causing the fiscal cliff were projected to produce a 19.63% increase in revenue and a 0.25% reduction in spending between fiscal years 2012 to 2013. The [Congressional Budget Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office "Congressional Budget Office") (CBO) had estimated that the fiscal cliff would have likely caused a mild [recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession "Recession") with higher unemployment in 2013, followed by strengthening in the labor market with increased economic growth.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>

The [American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Taxpayer_Relief_Act_of_2012 "American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012") (ATRA) addressed the fiscal cliff's revenue side by implementing smaller tax increases compared to the expiration of the Bush tax cuts. Adjustments to spending were expected to be resolved in early 2013. Intense debate and media coverage regarding the fiscal cliff triggered widespread public attention in late 2012 due to its projected short-term fiscal and economic impact.

ATRA eliminated much of the fiscal cliff's tax side while the reduction in spending caused by budget sequestration was delayed for two months. With ATRA's passage, the CBO projected an 8.13% increase in revenue and a 1.15% increase in spending for fiscal year 2013. The act caused a projected $157 billion decline in the 2013 deficit over 2012, rather than the sharp $487 billion decrease projected under the fiscal cliff.

The raise in revenue contained in the ATRA came from increased marginal income and capital gains tax rates relative to their 2012 levels for annual income over $400,000 ($450,000 for couples); a phase-out of certain tax deductions and credits for those with incomes over $250,000 ($300,000 for couples); an increase in estate taxes relative to 2012 levels on estates over $5 million; and expiration of payroll tax cuts (a 2% increase for most taxpayers earning under approximately $110,000). None of these changes would expire.<sup id="cite_ref-weisman1_2-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-weisman1-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-hook1_3-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-hook1-3">[3]</a></sup>

At 12:01 am EST on January 1, 2013, the US "technically" went over the fiscal cliff.<sup id="cite_ref-Over_the_fiscal_cliff:_Day_One_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-Over_the_fiscal_cliff:_Day_One-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-House_5-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-House-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Live_Updates:_House_Will_Vote_on_‘Fiscal_Cliff’_Deal_6-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-Live_Updates:_House_Will_Vote_on_%E2%80%98Fiscal_Cliff%E2%80%99_Deal-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-The_Fiscal_Cliff_7-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-The_Fiscal_Cliff-7">[7]</a></sup>

Around 2 am EST on January 1, 2013, the [U.S. Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate "United States Senate") passed this compromise bill by an 89–8 margin. At about 11 pm that evening, the [U.S. House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives "United States House of Representatives") passed the same legislation without amendments by a 257–167 vote.<sup id="cite_ref-houserxn1_8-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-houserxn1-8">[8]</a></sup> [U.S. President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States") [Barack Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama "Barack Obama") signed it into law the next day.<sup id="cite_ref-Obama-signs-autopen_Fox_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-Obama-signs-autopen_Fox-9">[9]</a></sup> However, the budget sequestration was only delayed and the debt ceiling was not changed, thus triggering the [United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt-ceiling_crisis_of_2013 "United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2013").

Budget deficits, projected through 2022. The "CBO Baseline" (in red) shows the expected effects of the fiscal cliff under then-current law, i.e., if Congress took no action in 2012. The "Alternative Scenario" (in blue) represents what was expected to happen if Congress were to extend the [Bush tax cuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_tax_cuts "Bush tax cuts") and repeal the [Budget Control Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_Control_Act_of_2011 "Budget Control Act of 2011")\-mandated spending reductions.

The term _fiscal cliff_ has been used in the past to refer to various fiscal issues.<sup id="cite_ref-BBC_News_Who_What_Why_Nov_14_10-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-BBC_News_Who_What_Why_Nov_14-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Fox_11-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-Fox-11">[11]</a></sup> The term started being used in the context of the expiration of the [Bush tax cuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_tax_cuts "Bush tax cuts") in 2010.<sup id="cite_ref-BBC_News_Who_What_Why_Nov_14_10-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-BBC_News_Who_What_Why_Nov_14-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> In 2011, the term started to be used to refer to the point at which tax cuts would expire, and spending cuts would be triggered, that would have occurred in 2013 under a fiscal-cliff scenario.<sup id="cite_ref-BBC_News_Who_What_Why_Nov_14_10-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-BBC_News_Who_What_Why_Nov_14-10">[10]</a></sup>

In late February 2012, [Ben Bernanke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Bernanke "Ben Bernanke"), chairman of the [U.S. Federal Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Federal_Reserve "U.S. Federal Reserve"), popularized the term "fiscal cliff" for the upcoming reduction in the deficit.<sup id="cite_ref-CNN_Money_Dec_12_13-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CNN_Money_Dec_12-13">[13]</a></sup> Before the [House Financial Services Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Financial_Services_Committee "House Financial Services Committee") he described that "a massive fiscal cliff of large spending cuts and tax increases" would take place on January 1, 2013.<sup id="cite_ref-BBC_News_Who_What_Why_Nov_14_10-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-BBC_News_Who_What_Why_Nov_14-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CNBC120621_14-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CNBC120621-14">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Reuters-Bernanke-1202_15-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-Reuters-Bernanke-1202-15">[15]</a></sup>

Some analysts had argued that _fiscal slope_ or _fiscal hill_ would have been a more appropriate analogy because while the cumulative economic effect over all of 2013 would be substantial, it would not have been felt immediately but rather gradually as the weeks and months went by.<sup id="cite_ref-BBC_News_Who_What_Why_Nov_14_10-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-BBC_News_Who_What_Why_Nov_14-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CNN_Money_Dec_12_13-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CNN_Money_Dec_12-13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-NJ_Dec_13_17-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-NJ_Dec_13-17">[17]</a></sup>

### Legislative history\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_fiscal_cliff&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Legislative history")\]

During a [lame-duck session](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lame_duck_session "Lame duck session") in December 2010, Congress passed the [Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Relief,_Unemployment_Insurance_Reauthorization,_and_Job_Creation_Act_of_2010 "Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010"). The act extended the [Bush tax cuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_tax_cuts "Bush tax cuts") for an additional two years (until January 1, 2013) and "[patched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_Minimum_Tax#%22Patches%22_to_tax_rates_and_exemptions "Alternative Minimum Tax")" the [exemptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_Minimum_Tax#Exemptions "Alternative Minimum Tax") to the [Alternative Minimum Tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_Minimum_Tax "Alternative Minimum Tax") (AMT) for tax year 2011. This act also authorized a one-year reduction in the Social Security ([FICA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FICA "FICA")) employee-payroll tax. The reduction was extended for the 2013 year by the [Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Class_Tax_Relief_and_Job_Creation_Act_of_2012 "Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012"), which also extended federal unemployment benefits and the freeze on [Medicare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States) "Medicare (United States)") physician payments.<sup id="cite_ref-at-sum_18-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-at-sum-18">[18]</a></sup>

On August 2, 2011, Congress passed the [Budget Control Act of 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_Control_Act_of_2011 "Budget Control Act of 2011") as part of an agreement to resolve the [debt-ceiling crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt-ceiling_crisis_of_2011 "United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011"). The Act provided for a [Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Select_Committee_on_Deficit_Reduction "Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction") (the "super committee") to produce legislation by late November that would decrease the deficit by $1.2 trillion over ten years. When the super committee failed to act,<sup id="cite_ref-statement20111121_19-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-statement20111121-19">[19]</a></sup> another part of the BCA went into effect. This directed automatic across-the-board cuts (known as "sequestrations") split evenly between defense and domestic spending, beginning on January 2, 2013. Also, the [Affordable Care Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Care_Act "Affordable Care Act") imposed new taxes on families making more than $250,000 a year ($200,000 for individuals) starting at the same time.<sup id="cite_ref-cp-score_20-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-cp-score-20">[20]</a></sup>

At the end of 2011, the patch to the AMT exemptions expired. Technically, the AMT thresholds immediately reverted to their 2000 tax year levels, a drop of 26% for single people and 40% for married couples. Anyone over these reduced thresholds at the end of 2012 would be subject to the AMT. Therefore, more taxpayers would pay more unless some legislation was passed (as was done in 2007) that affects the exemptions retroactively.<sup id="cite_ref-at-sum_18-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-at-sum-18">[18]</a></sup>

The fiscal cliff was finally eliminated at the very last minute during late-night and early-morning sessions of Congress on [New Year's Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s_Eve "New Year's Eve") and [New Year's Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s_Day "New Year's Day"). During a 2 am vote on January 1, 2013, the Senate passed the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 by a margin of 89–8. The House passed the bill without amendments by a margin of 257–167 at about 11 am that same morning.<sup id="cite_ref-houserxn1_8-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-houserxn1-8">[8]</a></sup> Eighty-five House Republicans and 172 Democrats voted in favor while 151 Republicans and 16 Democrats were opposed.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

### Key laws leading to the fiscal cliff\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_fiscal_cliff&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Key laws leading to the fiscal cliff")\]

-   Reversion of the Alternative Minimum Tax thresholds to their 2000 tax year levels;
-   Expiration of measures delaying the [Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Sustainable_Growth_Rate "Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate") from going into effect (the "[doc fix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_fix "Doc fix")"), as extended by the [Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Class_Tax_Relief_and_Job_Creation_Act_of_2012 "Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012") (MCTRJCA);
-   Expiration of the 2% Social Security payroll tax cut, most recently extended by MCTRJCA;
-   Expiration of federal unemployment benefits, as extended by MCTRJCA.
-   New taxes imposed by the [Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act") and the [Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Care_and_Education_Reconciliation_Act_of_2010 "Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010").

Without new legislation, these provisions were to automatically go into effect on January 1, 2013.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> Some provisions increased taxes (the expiration of the Bush and FICA payroll tax cuts and the new Affordable Care tax and AMT thresholds) while others reduced spending (sequestration, expiration of unemployment benefits and implementation of the [Medicare SGR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Sustainable_Growth_Rate "Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate")).<sup id="cite_ref-CBOOutlook1208_23-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CBOOutlook1208-23">[23]</a></sup>

Proposals to avoid the fiscal cliff involved repealing legislation containing certain of these provisions or passing new legislation to extend provisions that were due to expire. Different proposals were to include changes to some or all of the above provisions. For example, the [Congressional Budget Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office "Congressional Budget Office")'s "Alternative Fiscal Scenario" included only the first four items above. Changes to other provisions were sometimes included in such proposals, such as changing the original caps on discretionary appropriations contained in 2011's Budget Control Act, indexing the AMT exemptions for inflation (rather than capping them for one year at a time) or the wholesale or partial reform of the tax laws and/or the entitlement programs (sometimes called "the grand bargain").<sup id="cite_ref-CBO_Discretionary1_28-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CBO_Discretionary1-28">[28]</a></sup>

## Effects\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_fiscal_cliff&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Effects")\]

### Effects of sequestration\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_fiscal_cliff&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Effects of sequestration")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e3/CBO_Budget_Deficit_Assuming_Continuation_of_Policies.png/220px-CBO_Budget_Deficit_Assuming_Continuation_of_Policies.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CBO_Budget_Deficit_Assuming_Continuation_of_Policies.png)

U.S. Federal budget deficit as % of GDP assuming continuation of certain policies for 2012–2022. The baseline deficit indicates the scenario with the fiscal cliff, meaning tax cuts expiring and spending cuts applied. Avoiding the "fiscal cliff" increased the projected deficit.

The spending reduction elements of the fiscal cliff are primarily contained within the [Budget Control Act of 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_Control_Act_of_2011 "Budget Control Act of 2011"), which directed that both defense and non-defense discretionary spending<sup id="cite_ref-DiscretDef_29-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-DiscretDef-29">[note 1]</a></sup> be reduced by "sequestration" if Congress was unable to agree on other spending cuts of similar size. The scope of the law excludes major mandatory programs such as Social Security and Medicare. As of January 2013, Congress was unable to reach agreement on spending cuts and the sequestration was delayed until March 2013 as part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.

The effect on discretionary spending will be significant if the sequestration is not avoided. Cuts totaling $110 billion per year will be applied from 2013 to 2022, split evenly ($55 billion each) between defense and non-defense discretionary spending. For scale, discretionary funding for 2011 totaled $1,278 billion: budget authority of $712 billion for defense and funding totaling $566 billion for non-defense activities.<sup id="cite_ref-CBO_Discretionary1_28-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CBO_Discretionary1-28">[28]</a></sup>

During 2013, discretionary spending would be maintained around 2012 levels due to the sequester. However, the spending begins to rise thereafter, but not at the pace projected prior to the sequester. In other words, the trajectory of spending increases is reduced, but spending is not frozen at 2012 levels. Increases in discretionary spending from 2013 to 2021 would be about 1.5% annually, significantly below the prior decade.<sup id="cite_ref-CBO_Discretionary1_28-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CBO_Discretionary1-28">[28]</a></sup>

For example, according to the CBO Historical Tables, defense spending (including overseas contingency operations for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan) grew from $295 billion in 2000 to $700 billion in 2011, an annual [growth rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_annual_growth_rate "Compound annual growth rate") of 8.2%. Non-defense discretionary spending grew at a 6.6% annual rate during that time, from $320 billion to $646 billion.<sup id="cite_ref-CBO_Historical_Tables_30-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CBO_Historical_Tables-30">[29]</a></sup>

The austerity represented by the sequester is not unprecedented; from 1990 to 1999, defense spending actually declined by about 1% annually, from $300 billion to $276 billion, although non-defense discretionary spending grew by 4.5% annually, rising from $200 to $297 billion.<sup id="cite_ref-CBO_Historical_Tables_30-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CBO_Historical_Tables-30">[29]</a></sup>

The CBO estimated the possible impact on defense spending in October 2011 testimony: "Compliance with the caps on discretionary funding could occur through many different combinations of defense and non-defense funding. For example, defense and nondefense appropriations might be cut proportionally relative to the funding that would be necessary to keep pace with inflation. In that case, funding for defense programs apart from overseas contingency operations would drop from $552 billion in 2011 to $538 billion in 2012 before rising again and reaching $637 billion in 2021 (see Table 3).<sup id="cite_ref-CBO_Discretionary1_28-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CBO_Discretionary1-28">[28]</a></sup>

Between 2012 and 2021, such funding would be $445 billion less than the amount that would occur if the amount of funding for 2011 grew at the rate of inflation. When measured as a share of GDP, funding for defense would decline by about 1 percentage point from 2011 to 2021, or by more than one-fourth (see Table 5). Funding for defense in 2021 (excluding overseas contingency operations) would represent 2.7 percent of GDP; by comparison, annual funding for defense (excluding overseas contingency operations) has averaged 3.4 percent of GDP during the past decade."<sup id="cite_ref-CBO_Discretionary1_28-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CBO_Discretionary1-28">[28]</a></sup>

The CBO estimated the possible impact on non-defense discretionary spending in October 2011 testimony: "If defense and nondefense appropriations were cut proportionally relative to the funding that would be necessary to keep pace with inflation, nondefense budget authority would decrease from $511 billion in 2011 to $505 billion in 2012 before rising again and reaching $597 billion in 2021 (see Table 4). Between 2012 and 2021, budget authority for nondefense purposes would be $418 billion less than the amount that would be provided if funding grew at the rate of inflation after 2011. Under an assumption that the obligation limitations for certain transportation programs grow over time at the rate of inflation, nondefense funding in 2021 would represent 2.8 percent of GDP; by comparison, such funding has averaged 4.1 percent of GDP during the past decade (see Figure 6)."<sup id="cite_ref-CBO_Discretionary1_28-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CBO_Discretionary1-28">[28]</a></sup> Alan Houseman of the [Center for Law and Social Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Law_and_Social_Policy "Center for Law and Social Policy") has also argued that significant cuts to programs included under non-defense discretionary spending would harm low-income families deeply.<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-31">[30]</a></sup>

Loren Thompson of the [Lexington Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington_Institute "Lexington Institute") has noted that, as entitlement programs are largely exempt from the mandated cuts, sequestration would result in these programs assuming a larger percentage of the (reduced) budget, while spending on other programs such as defense would make up a smaller percentage of the budget.<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-32">[31]</a></sup>

Secretary of the Navy [Ray Mabus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Mabus "Ray Mabus") has said that continuing to operate under a series of continuing resolutions would be just as bad as sequestration, because these would freeze all programs at last year's spending levels, instead of allowing each program to adjust to its current situation. Also the CR is $4.6 billion below the proposed budget, which matches the $4.6 billion cut of sequestration.

### Effects of tax increases\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_fiscal_cliff&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Effects of tax increases")\]

Various sources have estimated the impact on taxpayers from the tax increases that would have occurred if the Bush income tax cuts and the Obama payroll tax cut had been allowed to expire with the fiscal cliff. The table below shows the dollar and percentage increase in income taxes for the 2013 tax year, if the fiscal cliff had taken effect.<sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-52">[51]</a></sup>

| Income  
level | Single  
(1 allowance) | Married  
(2 allowances) | Married, two children  
(4 allowances) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $50,000 | $1,693 / 17% | $1,870 / 32% | $1,870 / 32% |
| $100,000 | $4,193 / 16% | $3,272 / 17% | $3,038 / 18% |
| $150,000 | $5,967 / 15% | $5,046 / 16% | $4,812 / 15% |
| $200,000 | $7,467 / 13% | $6,546 / 14% | $6,312 / 14% |
| $250,000 | $8,046 / 13% | $8,046 / 13% | $7,812 / 13% |

Each piece of the fiscal cliff would have had varying effects on people at different income levels. Low-income households are most affected by expiring expansions of the child tax credit and earned income tax credit. Middle-income households are affected most by the [payroll tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payroll_tax#United_States "Payroll tax") and [income tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States "Income tax in the United States"). Households at the top income level are most affected by the income tax and the tax increases on [unearned income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unearned_income "Unearned income") such as capital gains.

Although European companies and investors will hardly see any direct taxation effects, corporate taxation of their U.S. subsidiaries may change significantly.<sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-53">[52]</a></sup>

## Congressional Budget Office projections\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_fiscal_cliff&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Congressional Budget Office projections")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/ATRA_Deficit_Scenarios_-_v1.png/400px-ATRA_Deficit_Scenarios_-_v1.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ATRA_Deficit_Scenarios_-_v1.png)

Three CBO deficit scenarios related to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) and the Fiscal Cliff. The blue line (August 2012 baseline) at bottom was the "current law" baseline, with tax increases and spending cuts that would take effect if laws were not changed. The grey line (March 2012 alternative baseline) was the "current policy" baseline, which represented the avoidance of the tax increases and spending cuts. The orange line (February 2013 baseline) was the post-ATRA result.<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-54">[53]</a></sup>

### CBO scenarios\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_fiscal_cliff&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: CBO scenarios")\]

While Congress was debating actions to take to mitigate the fiscal cliff, the [Congressional Budget Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office "Congressional Budget Office") provided policy-makers with projections of two fiscal scenarios for the years 2013 to 2022:<sup id="cite_ref-CBOBaseline_55-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CBOBaseline-55">[54]</a></sup>

-   The baseline projection (if Congress took no action and the cliff occurred): This scenario would have lower deficits and debt but would also have lower spending and higher taxes.
-   The alternative fiscal scenario (another option in which some laws are changed): This would have had higher deficits and debt but lower taxes and higher spending.<sup id="cite_ref-AFSDef_56-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-AFSDef-56">[note 2]</a></sup>

These painted starkly different fiscal futures. If Congress and the President did not act, allowing tax cuts to expire and mandated spending cuts to be implemented, the next decade would have more closely resembled the baseline projection. If they acted to extend current policies, keeping lower tax rates in place and postponing or preventing the spending cuts, the next decade would more closely resemble the alternative fiscal scenario.

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Historic_Federal_Debt.png/220px-Historic_Federal_Debt.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Historic_Federal_Debt.png)

U.S. federal debt from 1940 to 2022. The right side of the diagram projects what would happen to the debt if Congress (a) allowed the "cliff" laws to take effect and reduce the deficit (the baseline) or (b) extended the existing _policies_, such as keeping tax cuts in place (the alternative).

**Baseline projection.** The CBO has been publishing baseline projections, following existing law, since 1985.<sup id="cite_ref-CBO_Discretionary1_28-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CBO_Discretionary1-28">[28]</a></sup> Under the baseline projection (with the "cliff" occurring), tax cuts are allowed to expire and spending cuts are implemented in 2013, resulting in higher tax revenues plus reduced spending, thus lowering deficits, debt and interest for the next decade and beyond. Future deficits would be reduced from an estimated 8.5% of GDP in 2011 to 1.2% by 2021. Revenues would rise towards 24% GDP, versus the historical average 18% GDP.<sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-57">[55]</a></sup>

The total deficit reduction or debt avoidance over ten years would have been as much as $7.1 trillion, versus the projected $10–11 trillion debt _increase_ under the CBO's alternate scenario. In other words, roughly 70% of debt increases projected over the next ten years could have been avoided by "going over the cliff" and allowing the expiration of tax cuts and required sequestration expected at the end of 2012.<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-58">[56]</a></sup>

CBO estimated, under the baseline projection, that public debt would rise from 69% GDP in 2011 to 84% by 2035.<sup id="cite_ref-cbo.gov_59-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-cbo.gov-59">[57]</a></sup> In the long run, lower deficits and debt would have led to relatively higher growth estimates. But, in the short run, real GDP growth in 2013 would have likely been reduced to −0.5% from 1.1%. This would mean a high probability of recession (a 1.3% GDP contraction) during the first half of the year, followed by 2.3% growth in the second half.<sup id="cite_ref-CBOFiscal_60-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CBOFiscal-60">[58]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CBPPFiscal_61-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CBPPFiscal-61">[59]</a></sup>

**Alternative fiscal scenario.** If Congress had "avoided" the "fiscal cliff" by continuing its existing policies, the future would have more closely resembled the CBO's "alternative fiscal scenario". This scenario involved extending the Bush tax cuts, repealing the automatic spending cuts, restricting the reach of the AMT, and keeping [Medicare reimbursement rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Sustainable_Growth_Rate "Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate") at existing levels (the so-called "[doc fix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_fix "Doc fix")", versus declining by one-third). Revenues were assumed to remain around the historical average of 18% GDP. Under this scenario, public debt rises from 69% GDP in 2011 to 100% by 2021 and approaches 190% by 2035. This scenario has considerably higher debt and interest payments than the baseline projection, but the short-term impact on the economy would have been avoided.<sup id="cite_ref-cbo.gov_59-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-cbo.gov-59">[57]</a></sup>

### Projected effects\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_fiscal_cliff&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Projected effects")\]

Overall effects of the fiscal cliff.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that allowing certain laws on the books during 2012 to expire or take effect in 2013 (the baseline scenario) would cut the 2013 deficit approximately in half and significantly reduce the trajectory of future deficits and debt increases for the next decade and beyond. However, the 2014 deficit reduction would adversely impact the economy in the short-run. On the other hand, if Congress acts to extend current policies (the alternative scenario), deficits and debt will rise rapidly over the next decade and beyond, slowing the economy over the long run and dramatically increasing interest costs.<sup id="cite_ref-CBOBaseline_55-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CBOBaseline-55">[54]</a></sup>

CBO estimates that if the baseline scenario is allowed to take effect in 2013, it would reduce federal spending by $103 billion and increase tax revenues by $399 billion (and another $105 billion "mostly in revenue") through September 2013 (the end of [FY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year#United_States "Fiscal year")2013). This would amount to a net total of $560 billion, roughly half the $1.2 trillion FY2011 deficit.<sup id="cite_ref-CBOFiscal_60-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CBOFiscal-60">[58]</a></sup> The White House estimates that a family of four with an income of $50,000 to $85,000 would pay an additional $2,200 in federal taxes.<sup id="cite_ref-WHExtend_62-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-WHExtend-62">[60]</a></sup>

The CBO has identified the following metrics for its baseline and alternative scenarios for the period starting January 2013:<sup id="cite_ref-CBOInfographic1208_63-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CBOInfographic1208-63">[61]</a></sup>

|   
Fiscal or Economic Measure | CBO  
Baseline | Alternative  
Scenario |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Federal deficit in FY2013 | $641 billion | $1037 billion |
| Economic growth in FY2013 | −0.5% of GDP | 1.7% of GDP |
| Unemployment rate for October thru December 2013 | 9.1% | 8.0% |
| Public debt in 2022 | 58% of GDP | 90% of GDP |

Consideration of these scenarios and other options<sup id="cite_ref-AFSDef_56-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-AFSDef-56">[note 2]</a></sup> leads to what the CBO calls "a broad spectrum of fiscal policy choices."<sup id="cite_ref-CBOInfographic1208_63-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CBOInfographic1208-63">[61]</a></sup>

### Estimated deficit for the first year\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_fiscal_cliff&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Estimated deficit for the first year")\]

The CBO estimated that the [total deficit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_balance#Primary_deficit,_total_deficit,_and_debt "Government budget balance") of [fiscal year _2012_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_United_States_federal_budget "2012 United States federal budget") (which ended on September 30, 2012) will be $1.171 trillion. The CBO also estimated that the total reductions to the [fiscal year _2013_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_United_States_federal_budget "2013 United States federal budget") deficit by letting current laws take effect (which increase taxes and reduce spending) would be about $560 billion.<sup id="cite_ref-CBOFiscal_60-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CBOFiscal-60">[58]</a></sup>

Therefore, since the total [U.S. public debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._public_debt "U.S. public debt") was approximately $11.053 trillion as of July 2012,<sup id="cite_ref-USDebt_64-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-USDebt-64">[62]</a></sup> the public debt will climb by the end of FY2013 to either $11.664 trillion.

Under current laws scheduled to take effect by the end of 2012, the total 2013 deficit will be $612 billion, as opposed to $1,171 billion for the previous year. The pie chart to the right contains a breakdown of the currently authorized reductions to the FY2013 deficit. The total of this chart is $606 billion but this is without considering economic feedback. Reduced taxes and increased spending, due to the 1.3% contraction in the first half of 2013, as well as other constraints, are expected to decrease the savings by $47 billion, giving a net total of $560 billion in deficit reduction during FY2013.<sup id="cite_ref-CBOFiscal_60-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CBOFiscal-60">[58]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CBPPFiscal_61-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CBPPFiscal-61">[59]</a></sup>

### CBO analysis of policy options\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_fiscal_cliff&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: CBO analysis of policy options")\]

The CBO reported in November 2012 the economic and employment effects of various policy options related to the cliff. Each option has a different GDP and employment [impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_multiplier "Fiscal multiplier") per dollar of deficit impact. In other words, some choices are economically more efficient. CBO explained why spending cuts have a more significant adverse impact on the economy than tax increases per dollar of deficit reduction: "The larger 'bang for the buck' next year of the spending policies under the alternative fiscal scenario occurs because, CBO expects, a significant part of the decrease in taxes (relative to those under current law) would be saved rather than spent."<sup id="cite_ref-CBO_November_2012_Report_65-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CBO_November_2012_Report-65">[63]</a></sup>

### CBO analysis of 2012–2013 ATRA changes\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_fiscal_cliff&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: CBO analysis of 2012–2013 ATRA changes")\]

The CBO's August 2012 "Baseline scenario" assumed revenue would increase from $2,435B (billion) in 2012 to $2,913B in 2013, an increase of $478B or 19.63%. It also assumed spending would decline from $3,563B in 2012 to $3,554B in 2013, a decrease of $9B or −0.25%. The deficit was projected to be $641B in 2013.<sup id="cite_ref-66"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-66">[64]</a></sup>

The CBO's January 1, 2013 analysis of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) included adjustments to the Baseline scenario for 2013 of -$280B in revenues and +$50B in spending. This lowers the 2013 Baseline revenue projection from $2,913 to $2,633B, an increase of $198B or 8.13% versus 2012 revenues of $2,435B, while raising the 2013 spending from $3,554B to $3,604B, an increase of $41B or 1.15% versus 2012 spending of $3,563B. After adjusting for these changes, the deficit was projected to be $971B in 2013 instead of the $641B projected prior to ATRA, an increase of $330B. Both deficit projections were below the 2012 deficit of $1,128B by $157B and $487B, respectively.<sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-67">[65]</a></sup>

Democratic and Republican leaders meet in late November as part of the fiscal cliff debate.

On July 25, 2012, the Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate voted 51–48 to pass a bill supporting the President's tax proposal which extended the Bush tax cuts for 98% of taxpayers, while allowing them to lapse for the top 2%.

During November 2012, President Obama expressed a preference for replacing the more blunt cuts of the sequester with more targeted cuts, while raising income tax rates on the top 2% of earners.

### Republican proposals\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_fiscal_cliff&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Republican proposals")\]

Congressional Republicans have proposed that the Bush tax cuts be extended in their entirety.<sup id="cite_ref-77"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-77">[75]</a></sup> In August 2012, the CBO estimated that extending these tax cuts for the 2013–2022 time period would add $3.18 trillion to the national debt relative to the current law baseline, comprising $2.74 trillion in foregone tax revenue plus another $440 billion for interest and debt service costs.<sup id="cite_ref-78"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-78">[76]</a></sup>

On December 3, 2012, Speaker John Boehner proposed a Republican plan that included $2.2 trillion in deficit cuts over a decade. Revenue would be generated mainly by reducing tax expenditures (exemptions and deductions) rather than increasing income tax rates. Further, it included raising the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 and slowing increases in Social Security costs by reducing [cost-of-living adjustments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-of-living_adjustment "Cost-of-living adjustment").<sup id="cite_ref-79"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-79">[77]</a></sup>

On December 12, 2012, the [Federal Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve "Federal Reserve") announced it would keep short-term interest rates near zero percent in an effort to lower unemployment to 6.5 percent.<sup id="cite_ref-CNN_Money_Dec_12_13-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CNN_Money_Dec_12-13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Fed_Dec_13_87-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-Fed_Dec_13-87">[85]</a></sup> However, when commenting on the upcoming fiscal cliff, Federal Reserve officials "agree that the impact of the bank's stimulus campaign will be trivial in comparison to the consequences, and the economy will most likely return to recession."<sup id="cite_ref-Fed_Dec_13_87-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-Fed_Dec_13-87">[85]</a></sup>

The [US debt ceiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_debt_ceiling "US debt ceiling") became involved in the fiscal cliff debate when Treasury Secretary [Timothy Geithner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Geithner "Timothy Geithner") introduced the President's authority to raise the country's borrowing limit as a part of his first formal proposal.<sup id="cite_ref-Nov_30_2012_T.G._neg_88-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-Nov_30_2012_T.G._neg-88">[86]</a></sup> Although not strictly part of the fiscal cliff,<sup id="cite_ref-89"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-89">[note 3]</a></sup> the current debt-ceiling will also expire around the end of the year, unless ["extraordinary measures"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt-ceiling_crisis_of_2011 "United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011") are used.<sup id="cite_ref-CNNDebt_90-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CNNDebt-90">[87]</a></sup>

On December 26, 2012, Geithner announced that the federal government would exceed the current debt ceiling on December 31, 2012. Therefore, a number of measures would be put into place to delay this from happening, starting with suspending issuance of State and Local bonds on December 28 and investing in two government pension plans. These and other measures would normally delay reaching the debt ceiling for about two months but, because of debate over the fiscal cliff, this might be extended if there is no change in the current laws.<sup id="cite_ref-NBCNews-DebtC-121226_91-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-NBCNews-DebtC-121226-91">[88]</a></sup>

### American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_fiscal_cliff&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012")\]

At around 2 am on January 1, 2013, the Senate passed a compromise bill, the [American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Taxpayer_Relief_Act_of_2012 "American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012"), by a margin of 89–8. The bill faced uncertain prospects in the House of Representatives as [Eric Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Cantor "Eric Cantor"), the [House Majority Leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Majority_Leader "House Majority Leader"), said on January 1 that he did not support it.<sup id="cite_ref-102"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-102">[98]</a></sup> The prospect was raised that the House would pass an amended bill, but it was determined to be unlikely that the Senate would vote on any amended legislation before the end of the 112th Congress at noon on January 3, 2013 (all legislation under consideration expires at the end of each Congress). The House passed the bill without amendments by a margin of 257–167 at 11 pm on January 1, 2013.<sup id="cite_ref-houserxn1_8-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-houserxn1-8">[8]</a></sup> 85 Republicans and 172 Democrats voted in favor while 151 Republicans and 16 Democrats were opposed.<sup id="cite_ref-103"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-103">[99]</a></sup>

The act contains the following provisions:<sup id="cite_ref-weisman1_2-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-weisman1-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-hook1_3-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-hook1-3">[3]</a></sup>

-   The budget sequestration was delayed by two months to give time for further negotiations on deficit reduction. $24 billion (out of $110 billion for FY2013) was offset by tax increases, as well as a provision allowing 401(k) accounts to be rolled over into Roth IRA plans, requiring taxes to be paid on the assets.
-   Marginal income and capital gains tax rates increased relative to their 2012 levels for those with annual income over $400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for couples, but the rates below these levels remained at their 2012 levels. The top income rate increased from 35% to 39.6%, and the capital gains rate increased from 15% to 20%.
-   A phase-out of tax deductions and credits for incomes over $250,000 for individuals and $300,000 for couples was reinstated. Limits on deductions had existed before the Bush tax cuts, and had disappeared in 2010.
-   Estate taxes were set at 40% of the value above $5,000,000, an increase from the 2012 rate of 35% of the value over $5,120,000.
-   Changes were made to the alternative minimum tax to index it to inflation, to avoid its application to middle-class families.
-   The two-year-old cut to payroll taxes was allowed to expire.
-   Federal unemployment benefits were extended for a year without a budget offset elsewhere, at a cost of $30 billion.
-   Some tax credits for poorer families were extended for five years, including ones for college tuition and an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit.
-   The Medicare "doc fix", suspending a decrease in physician payments due to the [Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Sustainable_Growth_Rate "Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate"), was extended for one year.
-   A pay freeze for members of Congress was extended, but the general pay freeze for government workers was not.
-   Some portions of the farm bill that had expired in September were extended for nine months, but without changes supported by dairy farmers and legislators.<sup id="cite_ref-104"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-104">[100]</a></sup>
-   A number of corporate tax breaks and loopholes were extended, including the "active financing" tax exemption for major corporations (cost $9 billion<sup id="cite_ref-105"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-105">[101]</a></sup>), a rum tax supporting Puerto Rico rum industry ($547 million in 2009) and a tax benefit for NASCAR racetrack owners (around $43 million).<sup id="cite_ref-106"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-106">[102]</a></sup>

In all, the bill included $600 billion over ten years in new tax revenue, about one-fifth of the revenue that would have been raised had no legislation been passed. This would be the first year-to-year income-tax rate increase since 1993. The new rates for income, capital gains, estates, and the alternative minimum tax would be made permanent. The passage of the bill came after days of negotiations between Senate leaders and the Obama administration, with the final agreement being attributed to talks between Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Some Democrats criticized the bill for not raising taxes on the wealthy more, while Republicans criticized it for raising tax rates while not providing explicit spending cuts.<sup id="cite_ref-weisman1_2-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-weisman1-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-hook1_3-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-hook1-3">[3]</a></sup>

According to CBO, the total deficits for the 2013–2022 period would be increased by $3,971 billion relative to not passing the bill.<sup id="cite_ref-107"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-107">[103]</a></sup> CBO separately indicated in January 2013 that $600 billion in additional interest costs over the 2013–2022 period were not included in their initial assessment discussed above. This increases the deficit estimate to $4,571 billion.

The table below shows the estimated impact on taxpayers from the tax increases that occurred with the expiration of the Obama payroll tax cut and partial expiration of the Bush income tax cuts. The estimated impact is given as an average for the different income levels. The baseline that is used is if the payroll tax cut had been extended, new health care tax not implemented, and Bush income tax cuts fully extended. Average federal taxes include individual income taxes, corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, and estate taxes as a percentage of average cash income.<sup id="cite_ref-109"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-109">[105]</a></sup>

### Debt limit extension\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_fiscal_cliff&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Debt limit extension")\]

The sequestration fight was then expected to occur during negotiations over a [debt limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_limit "Debt limit") increase that was expected to be needed sometime in February.<sup id="cite_ref-110"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-110">[106]</a></sup> However, on January 23, 2013, the Republican-led House passed a bill suspending the debt ceiling until May 18, 2013. The bill did not include any offsetting budget cuts, as Republicans had previously stated as a precondition for raising the debt limit. The move was seen as an attempt to delay a showdown on the debt limit given their experience with the 2011 [debt-ceiling crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt-ceiling_crisis_of_2011 "United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011"), as well as the recent Democratic gains in the [2012 elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_elections,_2012 "United States elections, 2012").<sup id="cite_ref-debtextension_111-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-debtextension-111">[107]</a></sup>

The May 18 deadline is after the March 1 deadline for the sequestration, and the March 27 expiration of the [continuing resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_resolution "Continuing resolution") funding the federal government. The bill also included a provision that would delay the salaries of Congressmen of any house that had not passed a resolution on the [FY2013 budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_United_States_federal_budget "2013 United States federal budget") by April 15, 2013.<sup id="cite_ref-debtextension_111-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-debtextension-111">[107]</a></sup>

Four bills are being discussed.

1.  [H.R. 8](https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/8), the Job Protection and Recession Prevention Act of 2012 (which was later renamed the [American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Taxpayer_Relief_Act_of_2012 "American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012")), would extend the expiring 2001 and 2003 Bush-era tax cuts for one year.[\[1\]](http://beta.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/8?q=H.R.+8)

3.  Senate-passed Middle Class Tax Cut Act (S. 3412), which was voted on in the Senate on July 25, 2012, would extend for one year the Bush-era tax cuts on the first $ 250,000 of income reported on joint returns and would patch the alternative minimum tax for 2012, but not 2013.[\[3\]](http://beta.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/senate-bill/3412?q=S.+3412)

The bill would delay the budget sequestration by two months, and increase marginal income and capital gains tax rates relative to their 2012 levels for annual income over $400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for couples. A phase-out of tax deductions and credits for incomes over $250,000 would be reinstated from the times before the Bush tax cuts. The two-year-old cut to payroll taxes would expire, while estate taxes would increase, and changes would be made to the alternative minimum tax to avoid its application to middle-class families. These changes would all be made permanent.

## Notes\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_fiscal_cliff&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Notes")\]

1.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_ref-DiscretDef_29-0 "Jump up")** Discretionary spending is that part of the federal budget that Congress generally controls through annual [appropriation acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation_bill#United_States "Appropriation bill") including the [cabinet departments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_executive_departments "United States federal executive departments") and [federal agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_agencies_of_the_United_States_government "Independent agencies of the United States government"). This is as opposed to mandatory spending: those "self-funded" programs (such as [Medicare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States) "Medicare (United States)") and [federal crop insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_crop_insurance "Federal crop insurance")) that have had their expenditures written into their "enabling acts"; that is, the acts that created them.  
    In 2011, discretionary spending totaled about $1.35 trillion, accounting for close to 40 percent of federal expenditures. Slightly more than half of the discretionary money went for defense. The rest of the discretionary spending funded a wide variety of government programs and activities, including education, veterans' benefits, public health and the administration of justice.
2.  ^ [Jump up to: <sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_ref-AFSDef_56-0) [<sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_ref-AFSDef_56-1) The Alternative Scenario incorporates the following assumptions over the Baseline: (a) Expiring tax provisions (other than the FICA tax cut) are extended, (b) the AMT is indexed for inflation after 2011, (c) Medicare's payment rates for physicians are held constant and (d) the automatic sequestrations do not occur.<sup id="cite_ref-CBOBaseline_55-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_note-CBOBaseline-55">[54]</a></sup> Both scenarios would have allowed the federal unemployment benefits and the 2% FICA payroll tax cut to expire. Both would have implemented the original caps on discretionary appropriations contained in 2011's [Budget Control Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_Control_Act_of_2011 "Budget Control Act of 2011") and allowed the new taxes for the [Affordable Care Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Care_Act "Affordable Care Act") to come into effect.
3.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_ref-89 "Jump up")** This is because the debt ceiling is not a factor in the budget process _per se_; if the deficit is increased above the debt ceiling then that debt must be authorized in what has historically been a separate process.
4.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_fiscal_cliff#cite_ref-table-reverse_101-0 "Jump up")** These provisions are basically corporate tax credits or specific spending authorizations, which are set to expire from time to time and therefore must be renewed (or made permanent) if Congress wants that particular effect not to run out. They act _against_ the primary purpose of avoiding the fiscal cliff, either increasing spending or decreasing taxes.
