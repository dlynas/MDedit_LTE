#### The Coup\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boots_Riley&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: The Coup")\]

In 1991, Riley founded the [political hip hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_hip_hop "Political hip hop") group [The Coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coup "The Coup") with [E-roc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coup#E-roc "The Coup").<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_Riley#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> Alongside rappers [Spice 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_1 "Spice 1") and [Mopreme Shakur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mopreme_Shakur "Mopreme Shakur") (then known as Mocedes), they released a song on a 1991 compilation album called _Dope Like a Pound or a Key_, released by Wax That Azz Records.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_10-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_Riley#cite_note-:2-10">[10]</a></sup> Group DJ [Pam the Funkstress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_the_Funkstress "Pam the Funkstress") joined the following year.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_Riley#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> Riley was both chief lyric writer and music producer of The Coup's albums.

In 1992, The Coup signed to [Wild Pitch Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Pitch_Records "Wild Pitch Records")/[EMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMI "EMI"),<sup id="cite_ref-:2_10-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_Riley#cite_note-:2-10">[10]</a></sup> and released their debut album _[Kill My Landlord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_My_Landlord "Kill My Landlord")_ in 1993. Two of the album's singles, "Dig It" and "Not Yet Free" received play on national Black radio, [BET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Entertainment_Television "Black Entertainment Television") and _[Yo! MTV Raps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo!_MTV_Raps "Yo! MTV Raps")_.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_10-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_Riley#cite_note-:2-10">[10]</a></sup>

In 1993, [E-40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-40 "E-40") released the video for "Practice Lookin' Hard", a song based around Riley's lyric, "I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard", from the song "Not Yet Free".<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_Riley#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> The video featured Riley singing the chorus while he, E-40 and [Tupac Shakur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur "Tupac Shakur") reflected light into the camera from a handheld mirror while dancing around.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_Riley#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

In 1994, The Coup released their second album, _[Genocide & Juice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide_%26_Juice "Genocide & Juice")_, featuring guest appearances by E-40 and Spice 1. Fueled by video play and some radioplay for the single "Fat Cats and Bigga Fish", the album shot up the charts, but stalled when EMI absorbed Wild Pitch.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_Riley#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> At this point, E-roc left The Coup on amicable terms.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_Riley#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

1998's _[Steal This Album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_This_Album "Steal This Album")_, released on indie label Dogday Records, was called "a masterpiece of slow-rolling West Coast funk" by _[Rolling Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone "Rolling Stone")_ magazine.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_Riley#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> The single, "Me and Jesus the Pimp in a '79 Granada Last Night", was an eight-minute song about the grown-up son of a prostitute driving his mother's killer to a secluded place in which to murder him.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_Riley#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> A novel, _Too Beautiful for Words_ by Monique W. Morris, based on the story characters and descriptions in the song, was published by [HarperCollins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HarperCollins "HarperCollins") in 2000.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_Riley#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> [Del the Funky Homosapien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_the_Funky_Homosapien "Del the Funky Homosapien") guests on the track "The Repo Man Sings for You".

The group's fourth album, _[Party Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_Music "Party Music")_, was released on 75 Ark Records in 2001. It was re-released in 2005 by [Epitaph Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitaph_Records "Epitaph Records"). The original cover art depicted group members standing in front of the Twin Towers of the [World Trade Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_(1973%E2%80%932001) "World Trade Center (1973–2001)") as they explode.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_Riley#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_Riley#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> Riley is depicted pushing a button on a bass guitar tuner and DJ Pam the Funkstress is shown holding conductor's wands. The photo was taken in May 2001, with the album scheduled to be released just after the [September 11, 2001 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11,_2001_attacks "September 11, 2001 attacks"). In response to the uncanny similarity of the artwork with the attacks, the release was delayed until an alternative cover could be prepared. The album hit No. 8 in the 2001 _[Village Voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village_Voice "Village Voice")_ Pazz and Jop Poll- the most important year-end critics' list, was named "Pop Album of the Year" by _[The Washington Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post "The Washington Post")_, and "Hip-Hop Album of the Year" by _Rolling Stone_. The album included a guest appearance by [dead prez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_prez "Dead prez") on the song "Get Up".

Riley released a controversial press release on September 18, 2001, later published in the book, _Another World Is Possible_. The press release stated that "last week's events were symptomatic of a larger backlash against U.S. corporate imperialism". The controversy surrounding the cover art, press release and the lyrics from _Party Music_ (specifically the song "5 Million Ways to Kill a CEO") led to Riley appearing on local network news affiliates all over the U.S. He appeared on [Fox News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News "Fox News")'s _[Hannity and Colmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannity_and_Colmes "Hannity and Colmes")_ and [ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company "American Broadcasting Company")'s _[Politically Incorrect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politically_Incorrect "Politically Incorrect")_ with [Bill Maher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Maher "Bill Maher"). During this time, conservative commentator [Michelle Malkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Malkin "Michelle Malkin") called Riley's lyrics "a stomach-turning example of anti-Americanism disguised as highbrow intellectual expression".<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_Riley#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> _The Independent_ concluded it was "protest album of the year, by a million-man march".<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_Riley#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

In 2006, The Coup released _[Pick a Bigger Weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick_a_Bigger_Weapon "Pick a Bigger Weapon")_ on Epitaph Records, featuring guest appearances by [Tom Morello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Morello "Tom Morello"), [Talib Kweli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talib_Kweli "Talib Kweli"), [Black Thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Thought "Black Thought") from [The Roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Roots "The Roots"), and [Jello Biafra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jello_Biafra "Jello Biafra").<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_Riley#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>

#### Work with Tom Morello\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boots_Riley&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Work with Tom Morello")\]

In 2003, guitarist [Tom Morello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Morello "Tom Morello") invited Riley to be part of the "Tell Us the Truth Tour", which was meant to shed light on the [monopolization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopolization "Monopolization") of the media and the coming [FTAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTAA "FTAA") agreements.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_Riley#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> The tour, hosted by [Janeane Garofalo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janeane_Garofalo "Janeane Garofalo") and [Naomi Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Klein "Naomi Klein"), featured acoustic performances by Riley, Morello, [Billy Bragg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Bragg "Billy Bragg"), [Steve Earle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Earle "Steve Earle"), [Mike Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Mills "Mike Mills"), and [Jill Sobule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Sobule "Jill Sobule").<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_Riley#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_Riley#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>

In 2006, Morello approached Riley to form a band together under the name Street Sweeper. The duo, who later changed their name to [Street Sweeper Social Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Sweeper_Social_Club "Street Sweeper Social Club"), releasing their self-titled debut album in 2009. They toured in support of it along with [Nine Inch Nails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Inch_Nails "Nine Inch Nails") and [Jane's Addiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane%27s_Addiction "Jane's Addiction").<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_Riley#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> On May 24, a press release went out announcing Street Sweeper Social Club as one of the headliners of the 2010 [Rock the Bells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_the_Bells "Rock the Bells") tour. Street Sweeper Social Club released _[The Ghetto Blaster EP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ghetto_Blaster_EP "The Ghetto Blaster EP")_ in late July 2010.

In 2010 and 2011, Riley recorded with Ursus Minor on the album _I Will Not Take "But" for an Answer_, and toured with the group in France.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_Riley#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup>
