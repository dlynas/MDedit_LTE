If you’re comparing: Ukraine doesn’t have 10x the casualties In 18 months, 545 Ukrainian children have been killed. In 5 months, 14,000 Palestinian children have been killed In 18 months, 10,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed. In Gaza, 30,000 civilians have been killed

I’m sorry but people who treat Israel-Palestine as the deciding issue of the 2024 election are so fucking annoying. I get it if you’re literally Palestinian and/or personally affected but everyone else is such virtue signaling. Ukraine has ten times the casualties



It also has like 20x the population

We sent guns to Ukraine. Imagine the meltdown if activists were demanding guns for Gazans.

This. Also, as horrible as the Ukrainian numbers are, look at the proportions. There are more than 37 million people living in Ukraine. There are only 2.4 million living in Gaza. And more than 90% of Gazan victims are civilians.

I don’t think they are referring solely to civilian casualties (which makes their argument even weaker).

the difference between a war between two armies of commensurate size and a genocide of the occupying army over its occupied civilian population disallowed to have an army.

All loss of live is horrid. Difference between the two conflicts is the unquestionable support that Western Govt offer to [#Ukranians](https://x.com/hashtag/Ukranians?src=hashtag_click) who are also armed by us compared to utter disregard for [#PalestinianLivesMatter](https://x.com/hashtag/PalestinianLivesMatter?src=hashtag_click) who are unarmed & being slaughtered.

Ukrainians don’t hide in hospitals

Don't forget too that Palestinians are trapped in Gaza while Ukrainians have been able to apply for refugee status everywhere. Or that UNRWA has been defunded & Gaza is suffering from massive famine at an unprecedented rate. Or the mutilations and the destruction of hospitals.

Never mind the fact that Biden is also largely responsible for the disaster that has befallen Ukraine.

In addition, Biden supports the genocide in Gaza militarily and politically, but on the contrary, he raids the Ukrainians

That's only based on the UN numbers which even they say is under reported since they were in areas that saw much less combat. I'd take this down if I were you.
