The **Twitter Files** are a series of releases of select internal [Twitter, Inc.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter,_Inc. "Twitter, Inc.") documents published from December 2022 through March 2023 on [Twitter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter "Twitter"). CEO [Elon Musk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk "Elon Musk") gave the documents to journalists [Matt Taibbi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Taibbi "Matt Taibbi"), [Bari Weiss](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bari_Weiss "Bari Weiss"), [Lee Fang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Fang "Lee Fang"), and authors [Michael Shellenberger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Shellenberger "Michael Shellenberger"), David Zweig and [Alex Berenson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Berenson "Alex Berenson") shortly after [he acquired Twitter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk "Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk") on October 27, 2022. Taibbi and Weiss coordinated the publication of the documents with Musk, releasing details of the files as a series of Twitter threads.<sup id="cite_ref-Grynbaum_1-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Grynbaum-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:1_2-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:1-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:16_4-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:16-4">[4]</a></sup>

After the first set of files was published, an assortment of technology and media journalists said that the reported evidence demonstrated little more than Twitter's policy team struggling with difficult decisions, but resolving such matters swiftly; conservative journalists characterized the documents as confirmation of Twitter's liberal bias.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_5-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:4-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-alJazeeraDec7_6-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-alJazeeraDec7-6">[6]</a></sup>

A major aspect of the examination surrounded assertions by Musk and others that Twitter had been ordered by the government to help presidential candidate [Joe Biden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden") in the coming election by suppressing an October 2020 _[New York Post](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post "New York Post")_ story about [Hunter Biden's laptop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden_laptop_controversy "Hunter Biden laptop controversy"), though researcher Matt Taibbi found no evidence of government involvement in Twitter's decision to initially withhold the story.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

In a June 2023 court filing, Twitter attorneys strongly denied that the Files showed the government had coerced the company to censor content, as Musk and many Republicans claimed,<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> and asserted that Republican officials also made takedown requests so often that Twitter had to keep a database tracking them.<sup id="cite_ref-Binder_9-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Binder-9">[9]</a></sup>

Internal Twitter emails showed the company allowed accounts operated by the U.S. military to run a Middle East influence campaign; some accounts were kept on the platform for years before being taken down.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

The releases prompted debate over the nature of [blacklisting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacklisting "Blacklisting"),<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> vows for congressional investigation, calls for the full release of all documents for the sake of transparency, and calls to improve [content moderation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_moderation "Content moderation") processes at Twitter.

## Background [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twitter_Files&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Background")

The inner workings of Twitter's content moderation systems were not well known to the public, on the basis that knowledge of the details could enable manipulation.<sup id="cite_ref-Coldewey_2022_13-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Coldewey_2022-13">[13]</a></sup> But American conservatives had long contended that Twitter used its moderation policies to muzzle conservative views.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> On November 28, 2022, a month after Musk officially acquired Twitter, Musk announced that he planned to release a portion of Twitter's internal documents related to "free speech suppression", adding, "The public deserves to know what really happened" under Twitter's prior leadership.<sup id="cite_ref-Gans_11/29/2022_15-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Gans_11/29/2022-15">[15]</a></sup>

Musk subsequently gave a series of internal Twitter documents—including screenshots, emails, and chat logs—to freelance journalists [Matt Taibbi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Taibbi "Matt Taibbi") and [Bari Weiss](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bari_Weiss "Bari Weiss").<sup id="cite_ref-Coldewey_2022_13-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Coldewey_2022-13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Corn_2022_16-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Corn_2022-16">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:4_5-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:4-5">[5]</a></sup> Taibbi noted that "in exchange for the opportunity to cover a unique and explosive story, I had to agree to certain conditions" that he did not disclose.<sup id="cite_ref-:6_17-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:6-17">[17]</a></sup> Weiss stated that the only condition she and her reporting team agreed to was that the material would be first published on Twitter.<sup id="cite_ref-busins1_18-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-busins1-18">[18]</a></sup> Musk later stated he had not read the documents before their release to Taibbi and Weiss.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>

On December 6, Musk fired [James Baker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Baker_(government_attorney) "James A. Baker (government attorney)"), deputy general counsel at Twitter, for allegedly vetting the information before it was passed on to Taibbi and Weiss and providing an explanation that Musk found "unconvincing."<sup id="cite_ref-alJazeeraDec7_6-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-alJazeeraDec7-6">[6]</a></sup> Taibbi said that the planned publication of Twitter's internal documents related to its handling of the [Hunter Biden laptop story](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden_laptop_controversy "Hunter Biden laptop controversy") had been delayed because of Baker's vetting.<sup id="cite_ref-alJazeeraDec7_6-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-alJazeeraDec7-6">[6]</a></sup> Baker had previously been general counsel for the FBI and investigated Russian interference into the 2016 election.<sup id="cite_ref-alJazeeraDec7_6-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-alJazeeraDec7-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-BusInsider_22-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-BusInsider-22">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>

## Topics [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twitter_Files&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Topics")

In his prelude, Taibbi stated that the files told a "[Frankenstein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein "Frankenstein") tale of a human-built mechanism"—"one of the world's largest and most influential social media platforms"—"grown out \[of\] the control of its designer".<sup id="cite_ref-Grynbaum_1-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Grynbaum-1">[1]</a></sup> Taibbi wrote that these documents, as well as the assessment of "multiple current and former high-level executives", demonstrate how, although external requests for moderation from both political parties were received and honored, an overwhelmingly left-wing employee base at Twitter facilitated a left-leaning bias.<sup id="cite_ref-:16_4-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:16-4">[4]</a></sup>

The first installment included content related to Twitter's moderation process regarding a _[New York Post](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post "New York Post")_ article on the Hunter Biden laptop story.<sup id="cite_ref-Fung_12/3/2022_24-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Fung_12/3/2022-24">[24]</a></sup> The second installment addressed what Musk and others have described as the [shadow banning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_banning "Shadow banning") of some users.<sup id="cite_ref-hill20221208_25-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-hill20221208-25">[25]</a></sup> The third installment highlighted events within Twitter leading to President [Donald Trump](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump")'s [suspension from Twitter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_suspensions "Twitter suspensions"). The fourth installment covered how Twitter employees reacted to the [January 6 United States Capitol attack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack "January 6 United States Capitol attack") and the conflict within Twitter on how to moderate tweets and users supporting the attack. The fifth installment covered how Twitter employees influenced the decision to ban Trump from the platform. The sixth installment described how the FBI contacted Twitter to suggest that action be taken against several accounts for allegedly spreading election disinformation. The seventh installment showed Twitter's interaction with the intelligence community around the _New York Post_ story on Hunter Biden's laptop.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> The eighth installment showed the Twitter Site Integrity Team whitelisted accounts from [United States Central Command](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command "United States Central Command") (CENTCOM) used to run online influence campaigns in other countries.

### No. 1: Content moderation of _New York Post_ story [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twitter_Files&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: No. 1: Content moderation of New York Post story")

Journalist [Matt Taibbi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Taibbi "Matt Taibbi"), who published the first installment of the documents

On December 2, 2022, Taibbi posted a lengthy Twitter thread reporting on the first installment of the Twitter Files, which he illustrated with images of some of the files.<sup id="cite_ref-Grynbaum_1-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Grynbaum-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> Taibbi's installment attracted thousands of retweets.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_28-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:2-28">[28]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Fung_12/3/2022_24-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Fung_12/3/2022-24">[24]</a></sup> Some documents described Twitter's internal deliberations regarding the decision to moderate content relating to the [Hunter Biden laptop controversy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden_laptop_controversy "Hunter Biden laptop controversy"),<sup id="cite_ref-Grynbaum_1-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Grynbaum-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:6_17-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:6-17">[17]</a></sup> while others contained information on how Twitter treated tweets that were flagged for removal at the request of the [2020 Biden campaign team](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign") and the [Trump White House](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_White_House "Trump White House").<sup id="cite_ref-:3_29-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:3-29">[29]</a></sup> He also shared communications between California Democrat [Ro Khanna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ro_Khanna "Ro Khanna") and then-Twitter head of legal [Vijaya Gadde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijaya_Gadde "Vijaya Gadde"), in which Khanna warned about the free-speech implications and possible political backlash that would result from censorship.<sup id="cite_ref-mercnewswool_30-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-mercnewswool-30">[30]</a></sup>

The laptop controversy related to a 2020 _[New York Post](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post "New York Post")_ article that presented allegations concerning a [laptop computer of Hunter Biden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden_laptop_controversy "Hunter Biden laptop controversy"), son of then-presidential candidate [Joe Biden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden").<sup id="cite_ref-ArsTechnica-Cox_31-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-ArsTechnica-Cox-31">[31]</a></sup> Twitter, along with [Facebook](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook "Facebook"), implemented measures to block its users from sharing links to the story, and Twitter further imposed a temporary lock on the accounts of the _New York Post_ and White House Press Secretary [Kayleigh McEnany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayleigh_McEnany "Kayleigh McEnany"), citing violations of its rules against posting hacked content.<sup id="cite_ref-ArsTechnica-Cox_31-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-ArsTechnica-Cox-31">[31]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-WaPo-Dwoskin_32-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-WaPo-Dwoskin-32">[32]</a></sup> The _[Washington Post](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Post "Washington Post")_ reported that this was a result of the company's scenario-planning exercises to combat disinformation campaigns, which included potential "hack and leak" situations like what had transpired during the [Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections "Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections"). The decision generated an outcry from then-President Trump and conservatives who saw it as politically motivated.<sup id="cite_ref-WaPo-Dwoskin_32-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-WaPo-Dwoskin-32">[32]</a></sup> [Yoel Roth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoel_Roth "Yoel Roth"), then Twitter's Head of Trust and Safety, later said he had not been in favor of withholding the story and acknowledged that it was a "mistake" to censor it.<sup id="cite_ref-:11_33-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:11-33">[33]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup>

The installment shed light on an internal debate on whether Twitter should prevent the story from being shared, with leadership arguing that it fell under the company's prohibition on hacked materials.<sup id="cite_ref-:5_35-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:5-35">[35]</a></sup> According to Taibbi, then-CEO Dorsey was unaware of the decision to suppress the content when it was made.<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> Days later, Dorsey reversed the decision, calling it a "mistake",<sup id="cite_ref-Grynbaum_1-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Grynbaum-1">[1]</a></sup> and Twitter updated its hacked materials policy to state that news stories about hacked materials would be permitted, but with a contextual warning.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:6_17-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:6-17">[17]</a></sup> Taibbi also shared a screenshot of what appeared to be a request from the Biden campaign asking for a review of five tweets, along with the Twitter moderation team's reply, "Handled these." Taibbi did not disclose the content of those tweets,<sup id="cite_ref-tny1_38-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-tny1-38">[38]</a></sup> but four were later found from internet archives to contain nude images of Hunter Biden,<sup id="cite_ref-:6_17-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:6-17">[17]</a></sup> which violated Twitter policy and California law as [revenge porn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge_porn "Revenge porn");<sup id="cite_ref-BusInsider_22-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-BusInsider-22">[22]</a></sup> the content of the fifth deleted tweet is unknown.<sup id="cite_ref-BusInsider_22-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-BusInsider-22">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Fung_12/3/2022_24-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Fung_12/3/2022-24">[24]</a></sup>

Musk tweeted that Twitter had acted "under orders from the government", though Taibbi reported that he found no evidence of government involvement in the laptop story, tweeting, "Although several sources recalled hearing about a 'general' warning from federal law enforcement that summer about possible foreign hacks, there's no evidence—that I've seen—of any government involvement in the laptop story."<sup id="cite_ref-Fung_12/3/2022_24-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Fung_12/3/2022-24">[24]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:3_29-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:3-29">[29]</a></sup> His reporting seemed to undermine a key narrative promoted by Musk and Republicans that the FBI pressured social media companies to suppress the Hunter Biden laptop stories.<sup id="cite_ref-Fung_12/3/2022_24-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Fung_12/3/2022-24">[24]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:10_39-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:10-39">[39]</a></sup>

### No. 2: Visibility filtering [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twitter_Files&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: No. 2: Visibility filtering")

Weiss published the second installment on December 8, covering "visibility filtering." Twitter "rank\[s\]" tweets and search results, promoting some tweets for "timely relevance" and limiting the exposure of others.<sup id="cite_ref-wired1_40-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-wired1-40">[40]</a></sup> The company uses the term "visibility filtering" to refer to these practices as well as user-generated filtering—such as when one user blocks or mutes another account.<sup id="cite_ref-wired1_40-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-wired1-40">[40]</a></sup> One goal of visibility filtering is to reduce the reach of accounts that violate Twitter rules without committing violations egregious enough to warrant suspension.<sup id="cite_ref-obrien_ortutay_klepper2022_41-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-obrien_ortutay_klepper2022-41">[41]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Warzel_2022_42-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Warzel_2022-42">[42]</a></sup>

Weiss contended that "visibility filtering" was merely Twitter's in-house term for "[shadow banning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_banning "Shadow banning")".<sup id="cite_ref-wired1_40-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-wired1-40">[40]</a></sup> She posted screenshots of employee views of user accounts with tags indicating visibility filtering, and wrote that politically sensitive decisions were made by the Site Integrity Policy, Policy Escalation Support (SIP-PES) team, which included the chief legal officer, head of trust and safety, and CEO.<sup id="cite_ref-Al_Jazeera_20221209_43-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Al_Jazeera_20221209-43">[43]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-hill20221208_25-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-hill20221208-25">[25]</a></sup> She posted screenshots of the accounts of Stanford professor [Jay Bhattacharya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Bhattacharya "Jay Bhattacharya") (an opponent of [COVID-19 lockdowns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns "COVID-19 lockdowns")), conservative radio host [Dan Bongino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Bongino "Dan Bongino"), and conservative activist [Charlie Kirk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Kirk "Charlie Kirk"), which were respectively tagged with "Trends Blacklist", "Search Blacklist", and "Do Not Amplify".<sup id="cite_ref-gizm1_44-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-gizm1-44">[44]</a></sup> She also said that the SIP-PES team was responsible for the multiple suspensions of the anti-LGBT account [Libs of TikTok](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libs_of_TikTok "Libs of TikTok"), which had been tagged with "Do Not Take Action on User Without Consulting With SIP-PES".

Author Michael Shellenberger, who published the fourth and seventh installments

The fourth installment was published on December 10 by Shellenberger. It covered how Twitter employees reacted to the January 6 United States Capitol attack and the conflict within the company about how to take action against tweets and Twitter users who were supporting the attack without a specific policy as backing,<sup id="cite_ref-TheTimesTrumpTwitterPolicy_58-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-TheTimesTrumpTwitterPolicy-58">[58]</a></sup> due to the unprecedented nature of Trump's false claims of [winning the 2020 United States presidential election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"). Shellenberger shared screenshots of Roth asking a coworker to blacklist the terms "stopthesteal" and "kraken", both of which were associated with supporters of the January 6 attack. He also said that pressure from the company's employees appeared to influence Dorsey to approve a "repeat offender" policy for permanent suspension. After receiving five strikes as per the new policy, Trump's personal Twitter account was permanently suspended on January 8. Shellenberger's installment also provided screenshots suggesting that there were instances when employees flagged tweets and applied strikes at their own discretion without specific policy guidance, which according to Shellenberger, are examples of a frequent occurrence.<sup id="cite_ref-Folmar_12/10/2022_59-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Folmar_12/10/2022-59">[59]</a></sup>

The fifth installment was published on December 12 by Weiss. It covered the conflict between Twitter employees and how it influenced the decision regarding Trump's ban from the platform. Those communications include requests from the FBI and other agencies to determine if a particular tweet violated policies against election manipulation.<sup id="cite_ref-:10_39-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:10-39">[39]</a></sup> Weiss reported that two tweets Trump made on the morning of January 8, 2021, were used as a foundation for his suspension. She said that the two tweets were initially cleared as having no indication of incitement of violence, to the agreement of multiple employees. According to Weiss, former head of Legal, Policy, and Trust Vijaya Gadde dissented, suggesting that the tweets were [dog whistles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_whistle_(politics) "Dog whistle (politics)") for future [political violence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence "Political violence"). Weiss reported that Twitter's "scaled enforcement" team engaged and agreed with Gadde, suggesting that the tweets violated the "glorification of violence" policy and that the term "American Patriots" Trump used in a tweet was code for the Capitol rioters. She also said that one team member referred to Trump as a "leader of a terrorist group responsible for violence/deaths comparable to the Christchurch shooter or [Hitler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler "Hitler")". Weiss reported that after a 30-minute all-staffer meeting, Dorsey asked Roth to simplify the language of the document for Trump's suspension. One hour later, Trump's account was suspended "due to the risk of further incitement of violence".<sup id="cite_ref-:13_52-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:13-52">[52]</a></sup>

### Nos. 6–7: FBI communications with Twitter Trust and Safety Team [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twitter_Files&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Nos. 6–7: FBI communications with Twitter Trust and Safety Team")

The sixth installment, published by Taibbi on December 16, described how the FBI reported several accounts to Twitter's Trust and Safety Team for allegedly spreading election misinformation. According to Taibbi, many of the accounts reported had small numbers of followers and were making tweets seemingly [satirical](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satirical "Satirical") in nature, such as user Claire Foster who had tweeted "I'm a ballot counter in my state. If you're not wearing a [mask](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_mask "Surgical mask"), I'm not counting your vote. #safetyfirst" and "For every negative comment on this post I'm adding another vote for the democrats". He also reported that Twitter did not always take action against tweets and accounts flagged by the FBI. Taibbi wrote that a high-ranking staff member referred to the company's relationship with the FBI as "government-industry sync" due to the frequency of emails and meetings with the agency.<sup id="cite_ref-TgraphFBI_60-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-TgraphFBI-60">[60]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:12_61-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:12-61">[61]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:14_62-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:14-62">[62]</a></sup>

The seventh installment was published by Shellenberger on December 19, 2022. It described the FBI's involvement in moderating the Hunter Biden laptop story. Shellenberger reported that the FBI's and the [DHS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHS "DHS")' warnings about potential foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election influenced Twitter to moderate the Hunter Biden laptop story. Roth wrote in an internal discussion about the _Post_ story that due to "the SEVERE risks here and lessons of 2016", Twitter should apply a warning to the story and prevent it from "being amplified". Shellenberger shared screenshots of an email from 2021, which included a communication from Twitter's Safety, Content, & Law Enforcement (SCALE) team that Twitter had received $3,415,323 from a 2019 program designed to meet the "statutory right of reimbursement" for the cost of processing requests from the FBI. Musk claimed in a tweet that this payment is proof of the U.S. government bribing the company "to censor info from the public", despite such payments being commonplace for processing legal requests. Twitter's guidelines under law enforcement state that "Twitter may seek reimbursement for costs associated with information produced pursuant to legal process and as permitted by law (e.g., under 18 U.S.C. §2706)". [Alex Stamos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Stamos "Alex Stamos"), former chief security officer at Facebook and partner at cyber consulting firm Krebs Stamos Group, wrote that the reimbursements from the FBI have "absolutely nothing to do with content moderation".<sup id="cite_ref-:14_62-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:14-62">[62]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:15_63-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:15-63">[63]</a></sup>

The eighth installment by [Lee Fang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Fang "Lee Fang") on December 20, 2022, reported documents that showed the Twitter Site Integrity Team [whitelisted](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitelist "Whitelist") accounts from [United States Central Command](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command "United States Central Command") (CENTCOM) used to run online [influence campaigns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_operations_(United_States) "Psychological operations (United States)") in other countries, including [Yemen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen "Yemen"), [Syria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria "Syria"), and [Kuwait](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait "Kuwait"). This whitelisting prevented the accounts from being flagged. Many of the accounts didn't disclose their affiliation with the military, and posed as ordinary users.<sup id="cite_ref-Khalil_Loo_12/21/2022_64-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Khalil_Loo_12/21/2022-64">[64]</a></sup>

On January 27, 2023, Taibbi published the fifteenth installment, which discusses the _Hamilton 68_ Dashboard maintained by the [Alliance for Securing Democracy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_for_Securing_Democracy "Alliance for Securing Democracy") (ASD).<sup id="cite_ref-Sinnenberg_1/30/2023_67-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Sinnenberg_1/30/2023-67">[67]</a></sup> Taibbi wrote, "News outlets for years cited Watts and Hamilton 68 when claiming Russian bots were 'amplifying an endless parade of social media causes – against strikes in Syria, in support of Fox host Laura Ingraham, the campaigns of both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders."<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Jackson Sinnenberg of _[The National Desk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_Desk "The National Desk")_ critiqued Taibbi's release, describing Taibbi's allegations and the response of the Alliance for Securing Democracy. Taibbi called ASD's work a "mix of digital McCarthyism and fraud \[that\] did great damage to American politics and culture".<sup id="cite_ref-Sinnenberg_1/30/2023_67-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Sinnenberg_1/30/2023-67">[67]</a></sup> Sinnenberg noted that in 2018 the ASD had already explained how, contrary to media reports, they did not track bots. He describes how neither Twitter, Taibbi, or most media outlets "noted the specific disclaimers...at the end of the methodology guide". He sums up by noting that although Hamilton 68 was "an imperfect tool...calling it McCarthyism or fraudulent seems hyperbolic on Taibbi's part".<sup id="cite_ref-Sinnenberg_1/30/2023_67-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Sinnenberg_1/30/2023-67">[67]</a></sup>

Republican politicians also lobbied Twitter to moderate or not moderate certain content to benefit their political interests. Twitter removed "go back to where you came from" from its anti-immigrant hate speech policy after a 2019 Donald Trump tweet used a similar phrase to insult (mainly U.S.-born) Democratic congresswomen.

The nineteenth installment of the Twitter Files, published March 17, 2023, dealt with how, according to [_Reason_ magazine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason_(magazine) "Reason (magazine)"), [Stanford University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University "Stanford University")'s "Virality Project", in cooperation with several nonprofits, "worked with social media platforms to flag and suppress commentary on COVID vaccines, science, and policy that contradicted public health officials' stances, even when that commentary was true." The object was to police alleged COVID misinformation that included true information being misused to favor misinformation tropes: "While individual true stories about negative vaccine side effects were not treated as misinformation or disinformation, they could be labeled 'malinformation' if they exaggerated or misled people, said researchers."<sup id="cite_ref-Britschgi_3/17/2023_71-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Britschgi_3/17/2023-71">[71]</a></sup> ZDNet tech reporter Dan Patterson wrote: "At the beginning of the vaccine, there was a lot of misinformation about how these vaccines worked, and what they were trying to do is find out what's real, and then make sure that false information doesn't get accidentally amplified."<sup id="cite_ref-Entin_3/17/2023_72-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Entin_3/17/2023-72">[72]</a></sup>

In a [Fox News](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News "Fox News") interview, Republican House Minority Leader [Kevin McCarthy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy "Kevin McCarthy") defended Taibbi's reporting and said of Elon Musk that his critics are "trying to discredit a person for telling the truth."<sup id="cite_ref-Grynbaum_1-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Grynbaum-1">[1]</a></sup>

Democratic House Representative [Ro Khanna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ro_Khanna "Ro Khanna") confirmed the authenticity of his email to Twitter criticizing the suppression of the _[New York Post](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post "New York Post")_'s story as a violation of First Amendment principles.<sup id="cite_ref-wapo-khanna_73-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-wapo-khanna-73">[73]</a></sup> He also said that Twitter should implement "clear and public criteria" of removal or non-promotion of content, make such decisions in a transparent way, and give users a way to appeal the decisions.<sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup> House Republicans have stated their intention to investigate the exchange between Khanna and Twitter.<sup id="cite_ref-75"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup>

[Donald Trump](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump") referred to the first release of Twitter Files as proof of "Big Tech companies, the [DNC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee "Democratic National Committee"), & the Democrat Party" rigging the 2020 United States presidential election against him, declaring that "the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution" was necessary. He asked whether the "rightful winner" should be declared or a new election should be held. [White House Deputy Press Secretary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Office_of_the_Press_Secretary "White House Office of the Press Secretary") Andrew Bates condemned Trump's comments, writing that the U.S. Constitution is a "sacrosanct document" that unites the country "regardless of party" and that calling for its termination is an attack against "the soul of our nation".<sup id="cite_ref-76"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup> Musk tweeted, "The Constitution is greater than any President.

### FBI [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twitter_Files&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: FBI")

On December 21, 2022, the FBI responded to accusations made against them in the Twitter Files, releasing the following statement:<sup id="cite_ref-Perez_O'Sullivan_Fung_12/23/2022_77-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Perez_O'Sullivan_Fung_12/23/2022-77">[77]</a></sup>

> The correspondence between the FBI and Twitter show nothing more than examples of our traditional, longstanding and ongoing federal government and private sector engagements, which involve numerous companies over multiple sectors and industries. As evidenced in the correspondence, the FBI provides critical information to the private sector in an effort to allow them to protect themselves and their customers. The men and women of the FBI work every day to protect the American public. It is unfortunate that conspiracy theorists and others are feeding the American public misinformation with the sole purpose of attempting to discredit the agency.

An FBI agent at the center of the controversy stated in sworn testimony that the bureau did not give a directive to Twitter about the Hunter Biden laptop story.

Musk claimed that Twitter's content moderation violated the [First Amendment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "First Amendment to the United States Constitution").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> However, legal experts refuted the idea that content moderation by a private company violates the First Amendment, as it only restricts government actors.<sup id="cite_ref-78"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup> David Loy, legal director for the [First Amendment Coalition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_Coalition "First Amendment Coalition"), said that Twitter is legally able to choose what speech is allowed on their site, noting that both the Biden campaign, which was not part of the government, and the Trump White House could request specific content moderation actions.<sup id="cite_ref-mercnewswool_30-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-mercnewswool-30">[30]</a></sup>

### Privacy and security [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twitter_Files&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Privacy and security")

Taibbi was criticized for not redacting email addresses from published screenshots; [Yoel Roth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoel_Roth "Yoel Roth"), Twitter's former head of Trust and Safety, called it "fundamentally unacceptable", and Musk conceded that the email addresses should have been redacted.<sup id="cite_ref-Grynbaum_1-6"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Grynbaum-1">[1]</a></sup> Though Musk was supportive of Roth while he was employed by Twitter, after his resignation he began publicly criticizing him and endorsing tweets making false accusations. This included an accusation that he was sexualizing children, which [Donie O'Sullivan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donie_O%27Sullivan_(journalist) "Donie O'Sullivan (journalist)") of [CNN](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN "CNN") said is a "common trope used by conspiracy theorists to attack people online". Roth subsequently faced a wave of threats of violence serious enough for him to flee his home.<sup id="cite_ref-osullivan2022_79-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-osullivan2022-79">[79]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-80"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup> Musk directed his new head of Trust and Safety, Ella Irwin, to give screenshots of internal views of users' accounts to Weiss, which she posted online.<sup id="cite_ref-Wagner_2022_81-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Wagner_2022-81">[81]</a></sup> The publication of the screenshots, and a statement by Musk that writers working on the files would have unfettered access, raised concerns that people could access sensitive user data in violation of a 2022 privacy agreement between Twitter and the [Federal Trade Commission](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission "Federal Trade Commission").<sup id="cite_ref-Wagner_2022_81-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Wagner_2022-81">[81]</a></sup> On December 10, 2022, Musk threatened to sue any Twitter employee who leaked information to the press, despite his claims to be a "free speech absolutist," and having released internal messages and emails to selected journalists. This threat was expressed in an all-hands, with Twitter employees given a pledge to sign indicating that they understood.<sup id="cite_ref-Fortune20221210_82-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Fortune20221210-82">[82]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Independent20221211_83-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Independent20221211-83">[83]</a></sup>

The Federal Trade Commission had conducted an investigation into the information released as part of the Twitter Files in late 2022, and ruled in February 2024 that no data privacy violations had occurred as Twitter engineers had "\[taken\] appropriate measures to protect consumers’ private information".<sup id="cite_ref-84"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup>

### Former Twitter CEO [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twitter_Files&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Former Twitter CEO")

Twitter's former CEO and co-founder [Jack Dorsey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey "Jack Dorsey") urged Musk to release all the internal documents "without filter" at once, including all of Twitter's discussions around current and future actions on content moderation.<sup id="cite_ref-85"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup> Dorsey later criticized Musk for only allowing the internal documents to be accessed by select people, suggesting that the files should have been made publicly available "[Wikileaks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks "WikiLeaks")\-style" so that there were "many more eyes and interpretations to consider". Dorsey conceded that "mistakes were made" at Twitter but stated his belief that there was "no ill intent or hidden agendas" in the company. He also condemned the harassment campaigns waged against former Twitter employees, saying that it is "dangerous" and "doesn't solve anything".<sup id="cite_ref-86"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup>

### Journalists [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twitter_Files&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Journalists")

After the first set of Files was published, an assortment of technology and media journalists said that the reported evidence demonstrated little more than Twitter's policy team struggling with difficult decisions, but resolving such matters swiftly; while conservative journalists characterized the documents as confirmation of Twitter's liberal bias.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_5-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:4-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-alJazeeraDec7_6-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-alJazeeraDec7-6">[6]</a></sup> Former Twitter employees and Trump White House officials confirmed that Republicans also made takedown requests so often that Twitter had to keep a database of them.<sup id="cite_ref-Binder_9-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Binder-9">[9]</a></sup>

_[Forbes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes "Forbes")_ reported on Taibbi's posts regarding the _New York Post_ story that "Twitter staff took 'extraordinary steps' to suppress an October 2020 _New York Post_ story" and appeared to indicate "no government involvement in the laptop story," contradicting a conspiracy theory that claimed the FBI was involved.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_28-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:2-28">[28]</a></sup> [Mehdi Hasan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehdi_Hasan "Mehdi Hasan") of [MSNBC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC "MSNBC") criticized Taibbi on Twitter for the appearance of performing public relations for Musk; Taibbi responded by asking how many of his critics "have run stories for anonymous sources at the FBI, CIA, the Pentagon, \[and\] White House."<sup id="cite_ref-Grynbaum_1-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Grynbaum-1">[1]</a></sup>

[Miranda Devine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_Devine "Miranda Devine"), a columnist with the _New York Post_ who was among the first to write about the laptop, told Fox News host [Tucker Carlson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson "Tucker Carlson") that the presentation regarding the story wasn't the "smoking gun we'd hoped for".<sup id="cite_ref-:6_17-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:6-17">[17]</a></sup> [Jim Geraghty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Geraghty "Jim Geraghty") of _[National Review](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Review "National Review")_ wrote that "the files paint an ugly portrait of a social-media company's management unilaterally deciding that its role was to keep breaking news away from the public instead of letting people see the reporting and drawing their own conclusions."<sup id="cite_ref-87"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup>

_[Intelligencer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligencer_(website) "Intelligencer (website)")_ wrote that the first two installments contained "a couple \[of\] genuinely concerning findings" but were "saturated in hyperbole, marred by omissions of context, and discredited by instances of outright mendacity" and thus "best understood as an egregious example of the very phenomenon it purports to condemn — that of social-media managers leveraging their platforms for partisan ends."<sup id="cite_ref-Levitz_12/10/2022_88-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Levitz_12/10/2022-88">[88]</a></sup>

Charlie Warzel of _[The Atlantic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic "The Atlantic")_ characterized the initial two threads as "sloppy, anecdotal, devoid of context, and...old news," but wrote that the files demonstrated the "immense power" possessed by [Big Tech](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech "Big Tech") platforms as a result of "\[outsourcing\] broad swaths of our political discourse and news consumption to corporate platforms." He also suggested that Musk's core goal is to "anger liberals" and appeal to the political right, citing him allowing the documents to only be accessed by select people "who've expressed alignment with his pet issues" and telling his followers to vote Republican in the [2022 midterm elections](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_elections "2022 United States elections").<sup id="cite_ref-Warzel_2022_42-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Warzel_2022-42">[42]</a></sup>

After the first Weiss thread, Caleb Ecarma of _[Vanity Fair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine) "Vanity Fair (magazine)")_ wrote it was still unknown how many accounts had been "shadow banned," how they had been selected, and what their political persuasions were. He noted that several prominent leftist and [anti-fascist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifa_(United_States) "Antifa (United States)") users had been banned under Musk, while he had reinstated several banned prominent right-leaning users.<sup id="cite_ref-89"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-90"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup>

Katherine Cross of _[Wired](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(website) "Wired (website)")_ portrayed Weiss' and Taibbi's threads as "transparency theater", writing that Musk's ulterior motive is to achieve "freedom from any accountability" and "a world where no one tells him 'no'". Cross said that the word "shadowban" has become "whatever people want it to mean", comparing it to the use of the word "[woke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke "Woke")" by the political right. She also asked why Musk had not been transparent about his own decision-making, suggesting that "everything they have falsely accused Twitter of doing is what they seek to do to their many ideological enemies".<sup id="cite_ref-wired1_40-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-wired1-40">[40]</a></sup>

The [Editorial Board at _The Wall Street Journal_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editorial_Board_at_The_Wall_Street_Journal "Editorial Board at The Wall Street Journal") praised the release for exposing "a form of political corruption" where current and former U.S. intelligence officials have an influence on elections.<sup id="cite_ref-91"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-91">[91]</a></sup> [Gerard Baker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_Baker "Gerard Baker") of _[The Wall Street Journal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal "The Wall Street Journal")_ wrote that the Twitter Files "exposed how a powerful class of like-minded people control and limit the flow of information to advantage their monolithically progressive agenda" and added that they "tell us nothing new", and that it does not contain any "shocking revelation" regarding government censorship or manipulation by political campaigns. Baker added that the Files "bring to the surface the internal deliberations of a company dealing with complex issues in ways consistent with its values."<sup id="cite_ref-92"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup> [Ted Rall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Rall "Ted Rall") of the _Wall Street Journal_ asked: "Can't both sides back free speech?"<sup id="cite_ref-93"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-93">[93]</a></sup>

Oliver Darcy of CNN commented on the fact multiple news organizations were not reporting on the Twitter Files, saying that this is because "the releases have largely not contained any revelatory information", for the Files only demonstrate "how messy content moderation can be—especially when under immense pressure and dealing with the former President of the United States." However, he noted news outlets not covering the Files allows for "dishonest actors in right-wing media" to hijack the narrative with "warped interpretation\[s\]", thus creating complications for laypeople trying to research the Files.<sup id="cite_ref-94"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup> CNN interviewed six technology executives and senior managers, as well as multiple federal officials familiar with the matter, all of whom said the FBI had not given Twitter any directive to suppress the Hunter Biden laptop story.<sup id="cite_ref-Perez_O'Sullivan_Fung_12/23/2022_77-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Perez_O'Sullivan_Fung_12/23/2022-77">[77]</a></sup>

Following the sixth release of Files, [Robby Soave](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robby_Soave "Robby Soave") of the libertarian magazine [_Reason_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason_(magazine) "Reason (magazine)") wrote that "social media companies have every right to moderate jokes" but called the FBI's communications with the company "inappropriate" and a "free speech violation". He commented that it was "frankly disturbing" for tech companies and the federal government to be "working in tandem to crack down on dissent, contrarianism, and even humor".<sup id="cite_ref-:12_61-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:12-61">[61]</a></sup> Elizabeth Brown of the magazine opined that the documents presented in the seventh installment were "interesting—though hardly the sort of smoking guns many on the right are making them out to be". She wrote that the documents were not proof of Twitter trying to rig the 2020 presidential election in Joe Biden's favor by suppressing the _Post_ story but rather an "understandable mistake" done in reaction to accusations of the site aiding Russian trolls in 2016 and "pressure from government forces" such as the FBI and DHS, who she said were the "real villains here".<sup id="cite_ref-:14_62-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-:14-62">[62]</a></sup>

A year after the launch of the Twitter Files an article on their impact by Brittany Bernstein was published in the _[National Review](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Review "National Review")._ The article assesses national awareness of government censorship of social media and attributes Elon Musk's "shocking transparency" as a key factor leading to the "Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruling that the White House likely "coerced the platforms to make their moderation decisions by way of intimidating messages and threats of adverse consequences."<sup id="cite_ref-95"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup>

### Wikipedia article [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twitter_Files&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Wikipedia article")

Musk accused [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia "Wikipedia") of "non-trivial left-wing bias" after the Twitter Files article was considered for deletion, replying to screenshots of select users referring to it as "not notable" and a "nothing burger"; however, the final [decision was to keep the article](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Twitter_Files_Investigation "Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Twitter Files Investigation").<sup id="cite_ref-Bhaimiya2022_96-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-Bhaimiya2022-96">[96]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-97"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup>

## Aftermath [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twitter_Files&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Aftermath")

In June 2023, lawyers working for Twitter contested many of the claims made in the Twitter Files in court. According to CNN "Altogether, the filing by Musk’s own corporate lawyers represents a step-by-step refutation of some of the most explosive claims to come out of the Twitter Files and that in some cases have been promoted by Musk himself."<sup id="cite_ref-98"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup>

An unlikely arbiter recently emerged in this debate: Twitter itself. In October it released a paper it said demonstrated that its algorithm, which picks which tweets users see in which order, favoured right-leaning American news sites. In six of the seven countries studied, the algorithm also gave a disproportionate boost to lawmakers from conservative political parties.

With characteristic breathless hyperbole, Carlson declared that the documents "show a systemic violation of the First Amendment, the largest example of that in modern history." Musk and Carlson are both profoundly wrong; the documents released so far show no such thing. In October 2020, when the laptop story broke, Joe Biden was not president. The Democratic National Committee (which also asked for Twitter to review tweets) is not an arm of the government. It's a private political party. Twitter is not an arm of the government; it is a private company.
