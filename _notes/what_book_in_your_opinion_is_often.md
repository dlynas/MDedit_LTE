## What book, in your opinion, is often misinterpreted/misunderstood?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/auzg9p/what_book_in_your_opinion_is_often/](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/auzg9p/what_book_in_your_opinion_is_often/)

> It really grinds my gears for example that many seem to think that ’Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep’ makes a clear distinction between androids and human - That androids, unlike human, can’t feel any emotion. I personally believe that Philip K Dick made the complete opposite point; That there is no clear distinction between the two. Or rather; Humanity has become the very thing they despise androids for being.

				copying an old comment I made here:  
				 
				I loved the book, but did not love the film with Jeremy irons at all. They made small changes to the plot that add up to making HH far more sympathetic, so that the film could almost be said to be the story of a romance between a middle aged man and a 14 year old girl-which is at worst dangerous if it emboldens actual pedophiles. In fact it's barely an exaggeration to say that in the film she seduces him (''she seduced me, officer!'').   
				 
				
				The film leaves out the following   
				
				
				-that when he was in college he was seriously considering raping his friend's younger sister before killing himself  
				 
				
				-that his favourite hobby before meeting lo was to sit on park benches getting turned on by children playing  
				
				
				
				-that he'd been in mental institutions twice  
				
				
				-that he was lying when he told Lolita she was his first (he'd been with dozens of prostitutes, and married twice)  
				
				
				
				-his plan to impregnate her so that he can molest and impregnate their daughter, and then molest her daughter too, so that he'd have substitutes for her once she hit puberty and therefore stopped being attractive to him. Seriously.  
				
				
				
				-that his original plan had been to drug her and rape her while she slept, and the only reason he didn't was because the sleeping pills weren't strong enough. That's why he was testing the sleeping pills on her mother, not to avoid sex with her mother as in the film (where it's played for laughs).  
				
				
				-that he'd been planning to murder her mother in order to get her to himself, and only changed his mind at the last second  
				
				
				
				-the part where he pays her small change to jerk him off while they sit in a classroom at her detention, and he focuses on one of her schoolmates sitting in front of them 
				
				
				
				while these are mostly minor changes individually, the overall effect is to make him less of a monster, and almost a victim of her seduction. Perhaps this was done to try and make it less disgusting, and if so that was a mistake-it just makes it pedophile wish fulfilment. Also, some of the scenes verge on softcore child porn

		Yes it is.. It’s love with the English language.. it’s just beautifully written.. such loving, flirtatious, sensual plays on words. I feel the distasteful subject matter only serves to juxtapose with the beautiful prose, so that in the end you’re astounded at how much you loved it and were seduced into almost emphatising with that vilest of human beings, a paedophile. And you’re like, well played, Nabokov. That was a masterpiece. This is so beautifully written that it’s beautiful in and of itself, even in a story with no other redeeming qualities.

		I remember reading this for my senior thesis class (Postmodernism in American Literature) for my English minor in college. It was a class of 12 and I'd say that about 9 of the students were sickened and upset that we were reading it. Three of us thought it was an amazing work of art for art's sake (kind of the entire point of the class). I remember trying to explain it to one of the 9 and feeling like I was talking to a brick wall.

		Lolita comes up every time a thread like this is posted, and I am always baffled that anyone could think that it is a love story. So much so that when people say that there are a lot of people who consider it a love story, I think they're totally bullshitting and that these people don't exist. But, you know, then I remember the movie poster and all the "branding" around it, and realize that this misconception probably exists, and is due largely to the fact that people who hold this misconception have never read the book, they just see the heart shaped glasses and the sucker.

			I think the issue is not so much with the book itself but the fact that there have been cases of white kids repeating the n-word at their black classmates after reading it. I don't think that banning it (or any book) is the answer - and if the book was being taught by a good teacher who could clearly emphasize the anti-racist message, it even could be a good thing - but I understand why some black parents might prefer to just avoid the issue altogether, especially if they don't have faith in the local teachers to explain the book with appropriate nuance.

				We read Huck Finn in High School.  Our teacher took almost a full class period before we started reading to go through the historical context of when it was written and to remind us of the pain caused by the n-word and making it very clear that we were not to use the actual word in discussions of the book, but rather say "the n-word".  I thought it was a pretty good way of doing it, but many teachers may not be so careful.

	The Great Gatsby. We read it for english lit and a surprising amount of students (including the teacher) thought that Gatsby’s obsession with his ex-lover was romantic and cute and the fact that it proved to be Gatsby’s downfall was completely acceptable because it also made him rich. 

	I found it really creepy and kinda sad that he only met this girl a few times, years before the plot and he’s basically made his whole life revolve around her, with no real guarantee that he would ever see her again...  

	* 🟨 **[Jasbot1](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jasbot1)** ⬆️ 48 _(2019-02-26 13:28:15)_

		Ultimately, everything that went wrong for Gatsby and everything that could've gone wrong for him was a result of his obsession with Daisy. I feel like that was important because it makes it clear that you don't have to be born rich like Daisy or Tom to have a deeply flawed and problematic side. Gatsby was a good man (in my opinion) but his obsession, his need to 'repeat the past' ultimately ruined him both metaphorically and literally. Essentially, his obsession with Daisy was as dangerous as any other character's obsession with money/status. Just because he paid the price while others didn't doesn't necessarily make him any less flawed. 

	* 🟨 **[Legtagytron](https://www.reddit.com/user/Legtagytron)** ⬆️ 44 _(2019-02-26 13:39:13)_

		His obsession has to do with the American obsession over materialism. She represented this mad chase for wealth which is pointless. He also did it in the most obscene way by teaming up with gangsters. 
		
		He doesn't really love her, he loves the pursuit of his own gains because he was poor. He didn't want society to tell him who he could or couldn't love. 
		
		It's a black love because of what he sacrifices to have her, proving his love was never worth it in the first place.

	Dune. (Especially if folks have just seen the movie.)

	A main point of this book (and series) is that heroes/messiahs are ultimately destructive forces, not that Paul is a superman who saves the world. It is not a straightforward scifi adventure but wrestles with deep and conflicted questions about ecology, philosophy, sociology, and religion.

		Right!
		Part of the central tension for the stories is that Paul was *not* willing to do what it took to save the human race.
		
		He loved Chani too much. Because of his Prescience he knew what would happen to her. So instead he lead the universe in to a state of Holy Jihad. He was too human.
		
		That’s why Leto was able to save humanity. By losing his own humanity. Doing what Paul couldn’t.

There's a pretty epic scene in there where a neighbor is trying to marry off his sister by leaving her overnight at another house (the puritanical idea being that if she spends the night at a bachelor's house she is effectively married to him). The guys who own the house realize he left and chase him down in the middle of the night to give him back his sister. I always laughed at that scene.

	The first time I read "The Scarlet Letter" it did not register to me how badass Hester Prynne was, but re-reading it in college i was blown away. She's getting shame from each direction, has to do the emotional labor for a milquetoast preacher, but she's completely unapologetic because she loves her daughter. Her letter is bright and ornate and her entire attitude it "Haters gonna hate". I love that by the end, all the Puritans have huffed and puffed their anger, she's undisturbed and then they're like "Well, she is the best seamstress in town, so I guess let's talk to her again" and she gets to be the woman who gives advice to young girls, sew stuff and just gets to live in peace.

In high school freshman English, I didn't think it was so bad, and then in college I took an American Literature course and read it yet again, and that time I loved it. I think some novels are better when we read them young (*On the Road*, *The Catcher in the Rye*), but *The Scarlet Letter* isn't something a younger person is likely to appreciate as much.

				Reminds me somewhat of *The Crucible*. Pushed in high school, but extremely adult themes. *The Crucible* and *Scarlet Letter* both require not only empathy for a variety of characters with a variety of motives and in a variety of fucked-up situations, but a *historic* empathy that can put emotional understanding within a context that doesn't exist in this day. I think Arthur Miller screwed up somewhat by making the girls in *Crucible* "motiveless" whereas a much more powerful play would have explored the notion of female children in Protestant New England being little more than a futures contract -- to be married away in exchange for property or status. And how the Witch Trials represented a backlash towards changing attitudes on civil liberties as society supplanted religious conservatism and a church-based moral code towards a state-based mercantile morality. That's obviously not something the majority of high schoolers should be expected to empathize with or understand on more than a very academic level. *Letter* has a lot of similar themes, and I feel the same way about it being taught in high school.

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 65 _(2019-02-26 10:48:15)_

	See, I think that Do Androids Dream is the one that’s so often misinterpreted—people always ask whether the androids can feel emotion, when I think the point of the book is not for us to focus on what the androids feel, but instead for us to focus on what the humans are capable of feeling. 

	In fact, I think that the book becomes a lot more poignant when you consider that Dick portrays the humans and the androids as so similar, but the androids demonstrate behavior we would find cruel (even behavior that we would find cruel in children). We are so similar—we feel many of the same things, we want many of the same things, we’re even capable of understanding androids as human—and yet we (through Deckard) call ourselves superior. Why? On what grounds? 

	In the book, it’s because humans are capable of using the empathy boxes—in other words, because we’re capable of having certain types of dissociative religious experiences that connect us to our fellow humans. But if we can feel a togetherness, a oneness with androids, shouldn’t that mean that they deserve to be included in the human experience? Dick, I think, answers “yes”—regardless of what the androids or the electric sheep are capable of emotionally, if they are incorporated into our lives in ways that reflect back to us who we are and help us define ourselves, they deserve to be respected and protected. And, most importantly, they deserve to be understood as alive. As Deckard says, “The electric things have their lives, too. Paltry as those lives are.” 

	So, their lives may be paltry. They may pale in comparison to the richness of our lives. Maybe the androids can feel emotion, maybe they can’t. Maybe they’re stunted, maybe they’re fully actualized in each moment just as we are. But despite being artificial, mechanical, ‘electric,’ they are still alive—and if we, as humans, fail to recognize and cherish that life, then we lose part of what makes us human.

		I totally agree. Whether or not replicants can feel almost seemed a little irrelevant. They certainly act like terrifying monsters the whole time, and never show human feeling (depending on how you interpret what Rachel does to the goat, that seems a little like a jealous girlfriend). 
		
		But the book seems much more oriented to understanding Deckard's experience. The question of whether or not he is a replicant is pretty explicit in the typical PKD mindfuck way at the police station. He can't relate to his wife or her use of the empathy box. All the human feelings he stews in  are nasty ones like envy of the neighbors horses. He has so much hope caught up in the toad he finds out in the wastes at the end....but then even that turns out to be fake. 
		
		Not my favorite pkd book, but def deserves thought. Especially in comparison to the movie, which very much concludes that replicants are human.

		It's a very well thought out perception, and while I don't really agree per se, it's a good example of what PKD so often did. There is certainly enough there to draw out those conclusions, thus your interpretation cannot be wrong it gives different weight to different parts of the prose.
		
		It's part of why I find the OPs choosing of PKD and in particular androids, as something that bothers I don't think we will ever reach a point that can say definitively that one persons read is 'wrong' it's an ambiguous work, it's supposed to challenge us to think. I'd be disappointed if everyone did agree on it.

		I agree - I don't see whether or not androids feel emotion is a central question in that book, but rather what makes us human. I see it as a book exploring what it means to be human. The setting in a society with parallels to our own and to how Dick envisioned the future, and where society has lost humanity for the main part sharpens the tool he uses to probe whats left of humanity. 
		
		Whether or not the androids actually feel emotion is a detail in this, but not a central theme.

					What happened was; teacher brushes Holden's hair, Holden freaks out. He leaves while teacher lights a cig and sits on his chair.
					
					That could very easily be read as; Holden's falling asleep, and his teacher, who knows that Holden looks up to him as a father, tries to comfort his surrogate son as he knows Holden is going through some tough stuff.
					
					Holden, having serious trouble with platonic intimacy, understandably overreacted to the gesture. As he's leaving, the teacher is seemingly confused, and trying to re-evaluate the relationship he thought he understood.

					This is quite the stretch... There is no mention of roofies or anything. 
					
					There are multiple ways to interpret the scene. For example, the teacher actually is coming on to Holden because the teacher is intoxicated or that Holden and his past experiences cause him to overreact to the situation. You have to remember that it is all from Holden's perspective and that he is potentially inaccurate.
					
					However, I would say there is little evidence about grooming and zero about roofies.

He would have been viewed as weak, self-involved, unmotivated etc. It wasn't looked upon well to be openly suffering from emotional or mental disorders in the 50's. Yet, Holden's struggles are why so many young adults were drawn to the story and why its merit as a classic has been so heavily debated. 
		Salinger managed to write a completely character centered story (with very little plot to drive the reader forward) that is consistently relevant to today's culture. Holden is a real person. That's the beauty of the book. When I first read it I hated Holden. When I was 17 I was enamored with him. When I was 25 I felt incredibly sad for him.

	Machiavelli's The Prince.

	IMO, It's a damning critique.  Extrapolating the political ruling philosophy that the ends (the ruler maintaining power) justify the means to its ideal, tyrannical, conclusions exposes it as an absurdly corrupt and immoral philosophy. The "best" way to rule, for the ruler, is shown to be obviously terrible for the people.

	That so many people actually take inspiration and straightforward guidance from it is terrifying.

		I think it's so important that people ready at least a base context for the period and location when books like The Prince were written. Machiavelli wrote the book at a time he saw under-handed systems take control of governing bodies in order to usurp power - primarily dealing with a particular powerful and corrupt family who I cannot remember for some reason. Machiavelli basically wrote an entire satire on how to be a "good ruler" because he disagreed with the basic tenants of his book but hinted at what could be a better motive. "It is good to be loved, but better to be feared." is one example that comes to mind (I haven't read the book in nearly 10 years so forgive my paraphrasing) where he hints that it's actually better to be loved instead of feared.

		* 🟧 **[TheCodeSamurai](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheCodeSamurai)** ⬆️ 22 _(2019-02-26 14:45:38)_

			The passage you refer to is one of my favorite in the book:
			
			> From this arises the question whether it is better to be loved more than feared, or feared more than loved. The reply is, that one ought to be both feared and loved, but as it is difficult for the two to go together, it is much safer to be feared than loved, if one of the two has to be wanting. For it may be said of men in general that they are ungrateful, voluble, dissemblers, anxious to avoid danger, and covetous of gain ; as long as you benefit them, they are entirely yours; they offer you their blood, their goods, their life, and their children, as I have before said, when the necessity is remote; but when it approaches, they revolt. And the prince who has relied solely on their words, without making other preparations, is ruined, for the friendship which is gained by purchase and not through grandeur and nobility of spirit is merited but is not secured, and at times is not to be had. And men have less scruple in offending one who makes himself loved than one who makes himself feared; for love is held by a chain of obligation which, men being selfish, is broken whenever it serves their purpose; but fear is maintained by a dread of punishment which never fails.
			
			I think sometimes people think of *The Prince* as satire because they make his message stronger than it was. He isn't arguing for cruelty for cruelty's sake or some sort of sadism, but perhaps just a stronger version of something most people would already believe: that sometimes, as a leader and especially as an autocrat, you have to make hard choices that may be distasteful in the face of hardship. Were the world always a perfect place, he isn't advocating for anyone to be cruel just for kicks: ideally, you would simply be loved and that would be the end of it. But, as he argues, the world (especially his world) is full of treachery, and in order to lead well you have to be strong in the face of treachery, even when that requires extreme measures. This passage is just arguing that, in times of trouble, it's better to err on the side of scaring people straight than to assume that your friends are all loyal and true.

	Not any one specific book, but Dostoyevski in general. A lot of people think that the books are nihilistic, or meant to inspire some sense of distrust or dislike in the status quo, or glorify so-called 'great men', or even inspire revolution. Instead they do the complete opposite. 'Great men' characters inevitably suffer for their pretense to greatness, that all their presumption of some revolutionary understanding of morality is portrayed as fundamentally misguided.

	Dostoyevsky is probably the greatest reactionary writer there ever was. In the end the message is usually that among all parties in the conflicts of his books nobody actually has the moral high-ground. This is a very classically Christian idea, where all of humanity is thought of as imperfect. The point is simply that all zealousness of revolution is misguided and futile, since the only way to improve as an individual or as a society is to look inward and become closer to God rather than looking outwards with some sense of superiority or pretense to moral authority.

			Karamazov and Demons more than The Idiot and Crime and Punishment. Especially with C&amp;P the whole point of the book is that Raskolnikov could not escape the moral responsibility of murder through his sense of superiority. Meanwhile with for example Demons one can easily delude oneself that while Pyotr is too limited to fill the role he aspires to, Stavrogin is the true 'ubermensch', a man who could bend the rules of society towards betterment by the force of his will and brilliance if he just cared enough. But what Dostoyevsky is really saying with the book is that this is nothing but a trap, and that it represents a lack up understanding of human nature.

		I agree *Pride and Prejudice* is not a romance novel, but I wouldn't call it an "anti-romance novel." I'd call it first and foremost a coming-of-age story.
		
		All of Austen's works are really *Bildungsroman,* not romances. They're novels about young women with character flaws who have to grow up after making big mistakes. (E.g., Emma Woodhouse makes a mess of her friends' lives playing matchmaker, Marianne Dashwood falls for a cad and makes herself sick throwing a melodramatic tantrum, and Catherine Morland offends her crush by letting her imagination run away with her.) The "romance" aspect is usually an afterthought thrown in at the end, barely integrated into the main plot at all.
		
		In P&amp;P, though, the love story is central to the plot. It's not pure satire of the Gothic romances popular the time, like Austen's *Northanger Abbey.* It doesn't focus on a drama largely unrelated to the OTP's relationship for the first 90% of the book, like in *Emma,* *Persuasion,* and *Mansfield Park.* 
		
		The plot of P&amp;P focuses almost exclusively on the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy: the misunderstandings between them and other obstacles to their marriage. In this way I'd say P&amp;P is the most similar to a modern romance novel.
		
		The thing I think a lot of people misread about P&amp;P, though, is that Elizabeth Bennet is not supposed to be a perfect loveable heroine and Mr. Darcy is not supposed to be the ideal misunderstood hero. They're both stubborn and arrogant. They both think they're better than everyone around them...until they find out they're not, and they have to make an effort to change. That's the real point of the story.

			The layers a lot of folk miss in Romeo and Juliet is their influence on the world around them. The story is much more than a boy and girl. Second, that neither loves the other. They are in love with the idea of that person.

		While I agree that Wuthering Heights is definitely not relationship goals, I never understand people that say it's not a love story. The entire thing is driven by the greedy selfish love of Heathcliff and Catherine. Heathcliff especially is a hugely damaged person who walks a thin tightrope between salvation and insanity and his love of Catherine is the best thing that ever happens to him. Her rejection of him despite their love and finally her dying ruins him completely, and his constant desire to be with her again is hampered by his fear of dying. It may not be a romantic story, but the entire thing is about the destructive power of love.

	1984 and Orwell in general are often used by conservatives, and particularily by the alt-right, to criticize communism and socialism, as inescapabely leading to nightmarish dystopias.

	Orwell was an (anti-stalinist) communist (later democratic socialist) who literaly killed fascists during the Spanish civil war, abhorred all totalitarian regimes and wrote extensively on socialism while bashing capitalism.

		It's more a warning of power of institutions and how any political ideology, whether it's capitalism or socialism, can obtain too much power through systematic control of basic influencing commodities. It's why his idea of new speak and his journalism essays on how to write have the same connotations. Ironically the mass media machines in journalism for the alt right are exactly what he was most worried about.

	* 🟨 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 23 _(2019-02-26 10:45:25)_

		Orwell is appropriated by ideologues of both the and left and right wing political factions to criticize whichever of those factions has power. During the Obama administration and around the time Snowden leaked information about NSA surveillance programs, 1984 sales boomed. In contrast, 1984 sales escalated when Trump was elected. Orwell is misappropriated by everyone who tries to vilify their political antithesis because it is a story about authoritarian systems. They all just seem to go silent when their preferred ideologues control the system. Everyone uses him as a warning for *what could happen* when they don’t like what they are seeing.

The book mocks the extremes of toxic masculinity (if memory serves, the author got the idea often being beaten up in a camping trip) and somehow (likely because of the movie,) a not insignificant portion of men of a certain age completely missed the point: don't be these guys, it doesn't benefit anyone.

	Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte. People often think it’s a love story between Heathcliff and Cathy, but it’s really not. Both Heathcliff and Cathy do share a romance, yes, and Bronte writes about it beautifully but THEY ARE BOTH SELFISH AND TERRIBLE PEOPLE. I think a lot of readers consider their coupling as a relationship goal (which is incredibly alarming considering how the book goes). There are healthy pairings in the book, but Heathcliff and Cathy don’t count. I would say that Wuthering Heights is a story about lineage, family and revenge. It’s twisted and well written and absolutely amazing and while the love story is an important part of the plot, it is not the point of the novel.

	* 🟨 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 92 _(2019-02-26 09:43:45)_

		I mean Lembas bread and Gollum's distaste for it is pretty evident of that, but I genuinely think it was just because Tolkien was Catholic and drew from the well of his life and experiences for the book. I think you can argue Christian and Catholic people misinterpret as apologetics just because it has similar symbolism to something like C.S. Lewis's "The Lion, the Witch &amp; the Wardrobe". That book is very heavy on symbolism and allegory, but Tolkien included so much mythos inspired by the Norse pantheon and other sources in his own creation that it seems disingenuous to call it apologetics.
		
		If you have a solid link showing that he certainly did, I would love to see it. I'll I can find are Christians blogs talking about how he did and didn't simultaneously.

			“The Lord of the Rings is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work; unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision." - that’s a direct quote from JRR Tolkien. Yes the mythos behind it takes both Christian mythology (the entire creation myth of middle earth is basically a carbon copy of the Christian one) and also Norse, but the messages and overarching themes of not just LOTR but all his writings about middle earth are about Christian themes and ideas, and were intended to be so.

			* 🟦 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 48 _(2019-02-26 10:04:32)_

				I found another quote by him on the subject as well:
				
				"I was primarily writing an exciting story in an atmosphere and background such as I find personally attractive. But in such a process inevitably one's own taste, ideas, and beliefs get taken up".
				
				Including christian themes, ideas, giving characters traits that a christian adherent would deem honorable are definitely some things that Tolkien wrote into the book (or later went back and edited in). I'm still a bit hesitant to call it apologetics, just because someone with no Christian background whatsoever could absolutely read his works with little to no suggestion for that worldview. He is in no way arguing for the justification of a religious system that is not even portrayed in the novels, which is kind of the definition of apologetics. Maybe he is through allegory or suggestion, but I do not think that is the case.
				
				 Still, it is very interesting to discuss such amazing novels that have affected the lives of people with different backgrounds. The man certainly used his faith for the better in the series. I don't think the Lord of the Rings would be the same without his personal Catholic faith. Thanks for showing me that quote!

	Fahrenheit 451 is not about a government that has outlawed books; it's about a society that has decided that books are too upsetting and that everyone should just watch TV. 1984 is not about surveillance. It's about control of thought via language. Sure, those things are elements in the books, but I feel like most people don't have a sense of the bigger picture.
