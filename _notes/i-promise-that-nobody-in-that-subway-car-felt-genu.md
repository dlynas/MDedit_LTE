## I promise that nobody in that subway car felt genuine fear except for Jordan Neely â€” the man who strangled him to death was not feeling fear, the people watching were not feeling fear, only Jordan was. Not that fear would be a legitimizing factor, of course, but we must understand how the narrative around fear is used structurally to excuse and legitimize violence from both the state and police and those who it informally deputizes to mete out punishments for poverty and skin color. The ritualized torture and murder of the other is a tradition that this country was founded on, and nothing has fundamentally changed.
