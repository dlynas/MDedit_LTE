## George Washington recommended a government without any political parties. How did he mean that it would work, how could it be made reality today?

> I was very interested when hearing Washington wanted to have no parties, and it's pretty clear that party structure in most countries are ruining the world, since allowing for binary parties (left vs right) legitimizes incompetent and unfit people to stand for election. The last seven years of global political actions prove this beyond any doubt.

> How would a modern solution to eradicating parties look? What would replace them?
> 
> Would the idea be to have a government run by experts? As in scientific experts that all agree to empirical solutions and evidence-based reasoning only (de-politicizing both environmental global health and gender studies)? Or did Washington have something else in mind?
> 
> If the people are to vote on something in an election without parties, would it be for an individual, a school of thought, or something else? It would seem Humanism would be the only viable option since wing-clipping and defanging capitalism will likely be the only way to save the world.

	Check out Sortition, it's basically how the ancient Greeks intended democracy - without political parties. [Here's an article on wrote on it.](https://kilkelly.substack.com/p/true-democracy-no-politicians-no)

		Very interesting, will read and get back to you.

			If you look for Sortition on google scholar you can find some good academic papers on it. here is a good starting point called "Sortition: What it can and cannot do" I think. 
			
			Sortition was also quite popular in renaissance Italy and there is a pretty strong argument that outside small, close knit communities, and without very strong civic values, it actually makes corruption more likely.

				Thanks. I am trying to find out what would be the most promising alternative to the tribalist party system of most nations, so that the experts at building nations and herald a new age of freedom from capitalist slavery.
				
				The word "meritocracy" has become completely devalued but something must be done to not let uneducated violent, hatefilled mobs control armies and fiscal policy.

	I'm no expert, but I believe the thought was you should run as an individual and explain how you would represent others if elected

		I am all for this, modern political theory for the most fair choice, and Ranked Choice is one of the most interesting choices, especially as it would make the third, fourth and fifth choices get ten times more exposure than before, and before you know it the political scene has a pulse again. 
		
		As long as the two bloated corpses of "Center" vs "Right" are carted off the stage. And corrupted judges/non-contributing professors with tenure are forced to again defend their title.
		
		But one battle at a time.

	He didn't.

	It can't.

	So... don't bother providing any evidence to support your claim, just make it obvious that you're not remotely familiar with party politics in other countries or regions.

	Is party politics, especially in the US, an absolute mess?

	Of course.

	Has it always been?

	Nope.

	Is it that way in every other country?

	Also, nope.

	Maybe OP should consider reevaluating their assumptions and premises.

	You probably won’t have any luck with abolishing political parties unless you’re going for something very radical like anarchism. Ranked choice voting and proportional representation are two methods that lower that worse parts of political parties that the US has struggled with.

		I agree it's a tough proposal, but the fat-cat solution of today have outlived their usefulness and have lost the faith and trust of the people. In every country it is seen that the leadership ignores pressing matters like 4-day workweek to stop burnouts and worker deaths, and stopping the needless deaths from opiate-based pain management where cannabinoid- or ketamine-based therapies could work better.
		
		There is so much to do and the people in charge are uneducated and are trained in the mentality of a bygone era. New people like Sanna Marin, AOC, and Jacinda Ardern is what we need more of.

			I don’t disagree, but I just think it’s too ingrained to be swept away like that unless we have some sort of anarchist revolution.

				I think there would have to be an alternative that is hard to get, because it would have to be A: Logically better, B: Achievable within 1 generation, and C: where the money is.
				
				We are seeing early stages of this with Solar, it's kicking fossil ass all over the world and coal will soon be stopped even in a country as backwards as India.
				
				But the political arena needs a good reason and method to outlaw lobbyism. And most countries already have the Secret Ballot, it's just the US that allows the GOP and the Dems to hound their won members into becoming Yes-men by being able to see how they voted in an issue. As soon as the Secret Ballot is reintroduced (Nixon killed it in the early '70s) all the people that can now vote their conscience will kill off lobbyism, I would think. Especially if AOC continues to show she's willing to talk if they're willing to behave. And then she'll become President, maybe.

				I think there is a sweetspot between robber baron corporate dictatorship and anarchy. A government made out of only pros (not 90% lawyers), and an education system that treats kids like the rulers and builders of tomorrow and not felons who need hall-passes just to take a shit.
				
				If students are made to realize they are valued and are not told "I am a strict professor and 80% of you will fail", then there is hope for tomorrow.
