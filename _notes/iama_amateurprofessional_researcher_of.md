					It's very interesting the drugs they have now that can combat alcoholism. Naltrexone is a big one that is being used both for alcoholism and smoking cessation, although chemically it is an opioid antagonist (meaning that it will reverse the effects of opioids in your system). 
					
					Seems it's efficacy is more or less entirely due to the way it regulates dopamine in your system.

	Given that you have tried many psychoactive drugs, what is your opinion on legalization?? Do you believe psychedelics should be legalized for medicinal use only, or do you believe legalizing recreational drugs in general would be beneficial? 

	I am of the opinion that drug use, medicinal and recreational, should be decriminalized. I'm always curious to hear what researchers think about the future prevalence these drugs may have for our society.

	* 🟨 **[Nervewing](https://www.reddit.com/user/Nervewing) (OP)** ⬆️ 162 _(2023-12-13 18:01:42)_

		I believe all drugs should be legalized. We should be free to alter our minds as we see fit and to be responsible for how we do it. Our society already legally entrusts us with so many dangerous and regulated mechanisms (guns, cars etc.), the benefit outweighs the  obvious risks. 
		
		  
		I am adamant that hallucinogens should be legalized for therapeutic use. The benefits are obvious, the only obstacle is archaic stigma that has to be dismantled. I genuinely think they can revolutionize the treatment of mental health disorders, but they must be handled carefully and extremely responsibly- they are not miracle cures and they can go very wrong and  we cant lose sight of that,

				Well decriminalization is definitely needed because nothing is as expensive as having to incarcerate somebody for their drug use. 
				
				If we could save all of that money we spend on incarceration and also remove illegal dealing from the equation along the model of how we've seen weed dispensaries promote responsible use and generate revenue we could have sooo much more money for sober living facilities and the like. 
				
				Obviously there has to be some middle ground between prohibition and total freedom to get out of my mind on stimulants next to a playground but I'm not sure exactly what it is.

			* 🟦 **[burghschred](https://www.reddit.com/user/burghschred)** ⬆️ 16 _(2023-12-14 00:08:31)_

				Legalization, not just decriminalization, would eventually lead to a much safer landscape for most substances. Not sure if it's the majority, but certainly a plethora of modern opiate overdoses - especially fatal ones - could be better characterized as fentanyl poisoning. That would be virtually eliminated if the drugs were regulated.
				
				One major issue with legalization that is often overlooked is that it doesn't have to mean that it's legal to be publicly intoxicated. We all know alcohol is one of the worst substances in terms of outcomes/impact on society despite being legal, but it's still not legal to be publicly intoxicated or to drive under the influence. I think legalization should come with similar intoxication laws, and ideally the penalty would be the option of jail or rehab. 
				
				The issue isn't a simple one and has many other factors at play, such as our (US) issues with housing and healthcare. That said, legalize, tax and regulate and I think a lot of the worst impacts would be ameliorated quite quickly.

				* 🟪 **[infra_d3ad](https://www.reddit.com/user/infra_d3ad)** ⬆️ 8 _(2023-12-14 11:49:28)_

					Legalize it, regulate it so purity is known, don't make it stupid expensive. People steal, assault and commit many other crimes in the name of getting a fix. If you insure purity and keep it cheap, you'll wipe out the cartels revenue for one, and if people can get it cheap you'll eliminate a lot of the crime that surrounds drug use. Basic supply and demand says as supply decrease the price increase for that supply, yet drugs have stayed the same price or gone down, that really tells you all you have to know about the success of the war on drugs.

				* 🟪 **[bennyboy8899](https://www.reddit.com/user/bennyboy8899)** ⬆️ 3 _(2023-12-14 14:46:17)_

					This is by far the sanest blanket answer, imo. Legal freedom to explore responsibly, with legal consequences for exploring in ways that directly harm the social fabric we rely on. To use your car analogy: we give people driver's licenses, but you can lose your license for driving 100mph on a suburban street. I think the same rules should apply.

		* 🟧 **[RC-Edison](https://www.reddit.com/user/RC-Edison)** ⬆️ 21 _(2023-12-13 20:17:05)_

			Based. The war on drugs has failed, and in the process it has claimed millions of lives that never would've been lost otherwise.
			
			Personally, I don't think a lot of the man-made horrors beyond our comprehension, ex. fentanyl analogs, would exist if prohibition never happened.

		* 🟧 **[Here4uguys](https://www.reddit.com/user/Here4uguys)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-12-14 07:05:25)_

			I'd like to note that the stigma against drugs (in the west at least) is probably only as ancient as the early 1900s when the US government outlawed Marijuana for the sake of creating fear/animosity towards Mexicans. Then Nixon declared drugs public enemy number one -- thereby making the hippies and blacks that were being associated with drug use to also be enemy number one. Reagan and his bitch wife escalated the affair into a "war".

			I agree with you 100%. I have PTSD and while I have come a long way with therapy, Marijuana use and occasional psychedelics, I would not in the slightest consider myself 'cured'. I still suffer from night terrors, sensory triggers, 'fight or flight' episodes, etc. I would love to someday be able to have the opportunity to try microdosing for mental illness.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU1huzL50BY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU1huzL50BY)  I find music playing during the journey makes a huge diff.  I can't listen to anything "pop" or with lyrics; instrumental only - sitars, didgereedoo, etc.  Also taking them in nature yields a much better experience for me.  I even had frogs laughing at my jokes, literally, in a boggy place that I went to.   I was there for 3 hours and I made 2 jokes in my mind during that time (e.g. "this is wayyyy better than netflix"), and both times there was a chorus of dozens of frogs ribbiting like "ah-ah-ah-ah" for like 20 seconds immediately after the joke played out in my mind.  Not an hallucination.  Those were the only times they made that noise during the whole 3 hours - after the jokes.   I was only on 4g.

		Lasting effects are obvious, but I can't pinpoint anything to specific experiences. I have HPPD, I always see colors and patterns on drab or mottled surfaces. I kinda like it, it makes life more interesting. Oddly enough, being prescribed wellbutrin years ago turned this effect up to 10. Constantly seeing stuff. pretty fun!
		
		&amp;#x200B;
		
		Many of the manic dissociatives have given me shifts in perspective or introspection that has ultimately benefited me and been therapeutic. I can often look past emotions and develop more grounded responses to challenges in my life. I think there is immense healing potential there if they are carefully controlled. But they are fun and also very addicting lol

			Wait, can you describe how your HPPD has been affected by Wellbutrin? I am staring at a script I got for it as I write this - haven't started yet. 
			
			I have HPPD too, I also find it interesting more than anything else. Though it also flares up when I have panic attacks, which can be disorienting. 
			
			Also, have you noticed the character of your HPPD changing over time?
			
			I first developed HPPD when I was 15 because of a 7 gram shroom trip. So, at first the hallucinations were heavily reminiscent of shrooms.
			
			As I tried new drugs, I found that the hallucinations/perceptual shifts would integrate elements from those drugs. Ex. After I tried acid, the patterns started resembling LSD. Over time, though, it always seems to settle back to the initial shroomy vibes.
			
			PSA: I do not recommend anyone take psychedelics at that age.

				Yes- digestive issues that I mostly pin to overstimulation of my gut serotonin system from psychedelics.
				
				Frequent urination from using dissociatives too much seems apparent, though i have mitigated it a bit with using green tea extract.

			Strongly disagree. I have been on a serious amount of trips in my life, similar to you maybe. Started at 17, 29 now. Studied pharma research, brain and a little while in organic chemistry. 
			
			But 2-CB is absolutely not the first thing I'd recommend. A close relative has taken it twice and twice it was a bad experience. And with bad I mean she almost got a full psychosis.
			
			If you read this and want to try psychedelics please consider the potential harm too. It's all fun and games until it's not. Prepare well and take it slow. Have people around. 2-CB is a pretty strong drug. Personally I'd rather recommend taking LSD as a first psychedelic drug, it's much easier to dose even if you just have paper tabs. Take a quarter or half tab and see if you like it before going on a crazy bender and ruining all future experiences because you started with a bad trip. Also be with friends.

The way I always explained it: what shrooms are to melting and warping, acid is to color and chrome, 2C-E is to angles and reality "shift". I found 2C-E to be my most favorable, even with the higher body load and nausea - I quite enjoyed its "duality" as it regularly shifted from normal world to what felt like a parallel universe full of all sorts of strange lights and patterning, back and forth for hours.

	I've talked about this in the past, but considering the special place in my heart that [the principles of harm reduction have](https://harmreduction.org/about-us/principles-of-harm-reduction/)  

	There are a few questions I would like to ask you, if that okay.  hopefully you can educate myself and others that may read this.  

	1. With the ever-changing popularity of various substances, and the rise in popularity of research chemicals, how have you seen the change in popularity of research chemicals over  the years of documenting and researching various substances?  

	And where do you think it's headed?   

	&amp;nbsp;

	2. Unrelated to research chemicals, but still on the topic of the rise and popularity of different substances, in the last few years I have noticed a significant increase in the popularity and consumption of [Datura](https://m.psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Datura).  

	In my experience, there seems to be an alarming amount of people consuming Datura without realizing just how potentially dangerous of a substance it is.  

	It's wildly varying degrees of potency based on so many factors, such as it's age, location grown and even weather climate during its growth, 

	Coupled with the fact that there is no even remotely relatively easy way to measure its potency without special equipment, it's potential for harm is so unpredictable, why do you think it is that such a substance had become so popular among so many so fast?   

	&amp;nbsp;

	3. My last question is probably going to be a bit unexpected especially compared to everyone else's questions here. 

	Tobacco and alcohol, 

	(yes yes, I know not what people typically think of when they think of "drugs") 

	Kill significantly more people per year than any other regulated or non regulated recreational substance in the world.

	How do you feel about the regulation of these substances in comparison to well.. any of the other drugs that you have ever consumed?

		I on the radical bench that yes, all drugs should be legal and be responsibly regulated. We have a right to alter our minds. A human right. It is nonsensical to deprive us of that, especially in the context of incredibly damaging drugs already being available and regulated. Our society's perception of drugs is dated and broken, People should be allowed to alter their states to their discretion, with pure substances and intentional doses. The war on drugs is a tragedy, it is an affront to the human condition, it is one of our species' greatest follies.

			I'll be honest I actually agree with you there, but just as you said they should be responsibly regulated in my opinion.
			
			While I absolutely don't disagree we should have the right to alter our own minds any which way we want, and our own bodies all together, I don't believe we have the right to do the same to others.
			
			As such regulation, and building laws around the freedom for one to do to themselves as they wish, but **not** in a way that may negatively impact or affect others in any fashion is something I personally could get behind.

		I would say the scene is in a state of stagnation. Similar to my own habits, there is not much expansion into novel compounds anymore, labs are just pumping out the big popular moneymakers- things like FXE (which isn't actually FXE as I recently confirmed via nmr testing), or they're pumping out pyrovalerones and benzos.
  
		
  
		
  
		
  
		There was one lab that was really diversifying and pushing the boundaries of psychedelics and dissociatives that ran into some pretty bad legal trouble last year. The loss of that lab has been a major hit to the community and a major hit to what's available. Gone are the days of 2C-x compounds and fun arylcyclohexylamines floating around :( Opioids are pretty much out of the market now too, no one wants to touch them for risk of starting the next fentanyl-like viral rash. O-DSMT, the tramadol analogue, seems dominant in that field now.
  
		
  
		
  
		
  
		I have no idea why people are consuming datura more! It's a really freaky thing that's always been on the fringes- some teen discovers erowid and knows how to identify a plant, that's how I tried it at first too! I don't know what may be pushing this trend more, maybe its blowing up on some social media I'm not active on, like tik tok? I am not aware of any research currently being done into tropane alkaloids.

		2. The research is extremely promising! I am very excited that people are actually looking into this now
		3. Once again, impossible to say, as I have no control group to compare it to. I think the recent daily use of dissociatives has taken a hit to short term memory, word recall etc; not good!
		4. I am addicted psychologically to dissociatives. I take them every day :\\ I am terrified of synthetic cannibanoids. I don't touch them at all, they are too unpredictable. Favorite drug would have to be good ol MXE or 3-MeO-PCE. Lovely dissociatives with depth and versatility, Worst would have to be ones that just felt like being poisoned, like [5-MeO-MET](https://nervewing.blogspot.com/2020/10/5-meo-met.html)

In other words, in those moments you're not simply falling into one of many possible delusions but instead altering your perception in a very specific way that could be interesting from a scientific or philosophical point of view. I for one am NOT volunteering though, haha

	I have a couple questions, if you have the time:

	1. If you had to pick just one, what drug do you think that everyone should experience at least once in their lives, and why?

	2. Can cannabis cause ego death? I feel like I experienced this the first time I took it (due to being unprepared and taking too much), but some people seem to think it can’t cause this. Curious as to your take on it..

	3. I started taking Wellbutrin a couple months ago and since then haven’t used cannabis because apparently it’s contraindicated (possibly due to decreasing seizure threshold?) Do you know anything about this? I really miss my occasional cannabis usage but I also don’t want to potentially give myself a seizure, but I have to think that hundreds of thousands of people taking Wellbutrin likely also smoke up..

	4. As a follow-up to the last question, should I consider ketamine therapy for depression when and if it becomes available in my state? What are your thoughts on using a mail order ketamine therapy service (pills) vs going into a clinic and receiving an injection?

	* 🟨 **[Darkshines47](https://www.reddit.com/user/Darkshines47)** ⬆️ 5 _(2023-12-13 19:31:36)_

		Not OP but re your fourth question, I have treatment resistant depression and have been doing ketamine therapy for the last two years. OP is right, none of us can give you medical advice. Speaking from my own experience though, if you’ve tried other medications and they haven’t been effective, it is definitely worth having the conversation with a provider. It has been incredibly effective (in combination with regular psychotherapy and other self-work) for me. I cannot stress enough the importance of having a therapist to work with if you’re doing ketamine therapy. While the ketamine definitely does act on a neurochemical level to correct the depression, it also creates a metric fuckload of material to process and work with when you’re not on ketamine. A therapist will help you navigate this often difficult material more effectively and with better self-compassion.
		
		As far as clinic vs online goes, I think the best option is the one that is most accessible to you. One thing to consider is cost. In general I think it’s best practice to assume insurance isn’t going to cover anything and that you’ll be paying out of pocket. I do both IV and oral ketamine (life is hard, homie) through a clinic. IV ketamine is not cheap. Prices I personally have seen when doing my own research range from $200-600/infusion. I pay $350. Usually treatment starts with a course of 4-6 sessions over two weeks, so there’s a significant up front cost. The oral ketamine, in the form of dissolvable tablets, is much cheaper. I pay about $60 for a 6 week prescription. Prices vary depending on the pharmacy your provider uses.
		
		It’s not a decision to be taken lightly, but if you’re struggling and not finding anything effective in dealing with it, then it’s definitely worth talking to providers. Again, just my own experience, but it has literally saved my life.
		
		Happy to answer questions via DM. Good luck!

		1. 3-MeO-PCE - One 15 -20 mg dose intranasal. This is such a miraculous and therapeutic drug, I think everyone should get a taste of what it has to offer. There is  serious healing potential in this.

			On #4 - Sorry, I wasn’t meaning to seek medical advice for myself. I was asking generally about Ketamine as it relates to depression - it is understood that you are not giving me medical advice. Is Ketamine known to be effective as a treatment for depression, and is there a difference between taking it via pill format vs injection? This is a general question that can be answered with no bearing to my personal situation, I hope.

				Yes, I think it has huge therapeutic potential in the way it allows people to aritculate their thoughts and separate themselves from tricky emotions
				
				On the ketamine- My experience with psych meds that it is all trial and error. If other things aren;t working, give it a shot. Everyone is different!

		1.MXE is probably the godliest thing that has ever been bestowed on us. Shame it's gone. 3-MeO-PCE is my top spot for right now.
		
		2. There are ones that just made me feel like I had been poisoned, like [5-MeO-MET](https://nervewing.blogspot.com/2020/10/5-meo-met.html) or [Glaucine](https://nervewing.blogspot.com/2016/08/glaucine.html). I also really do not like alcohol, and I am not big on stimulants, I am too anxious already. I don't like empathogens (MDMA etc.) bc I make a fool of myself every time lol.
		
		3. Worst for me right now is FXE, stimulating but deep short acting dissociative. Hard not to do at all times! Things like crack and 3-MMC etc didnt rlly set that off for me, I never got that feindishness, the addiction sets in more slowly and subtly for me.   
		
		
		Terrfiying experiences often come from mixing dissociatives and psychedelics; a few are documented here:

	In your opinion, what is the best drug for an introduction to Psychedelics?

	I think there’s a lot of stigma and disinformation around Ketamine and LSD, which typically leads people towards psylocibin.

	In my experiences psylocybin has always presented more challenges at “trip level” dosages so I tend to recommend LSD. I tell people that there’s always a “panic button” if they keep a few mg of Alprazolam handy but I haven’t found a surefire way to end an uncomfortable experience with mushrooms.

	My 16 year old son is very into all kinds of shrooms at the moment. He's memorized multiple genus and has really learned a tremendous amount about them. Recently he has come to the belief that eating psilocybin mushrooms will help cure his autism (not diagnosed and honestly I'm not sure he has). He, like me, does have ADHD (also undiagnosed, but ... it's so obvious). He's very introspective at this point and wants to help his creativity flow into his other hobby: music. This is two examples of his line of thinking about blue shrooms and there are other reasons he has come up with to try them.

	He is a very strong willed kid so I have taken a listen and love approach. I have asked him to wait as long as he can before he tries anything. A friend of mine who has done a few things said my son should wait until he's in his late twenties because his brain is still forming. My son doesn't like that idea.

	I have zero experience with drugs so I can't help him at all.

	As an expert on such things, what advice do you have for me and what advice do you have for him on this topic?

			He has been talking about micro dosing. He really knows his stuff. It seems like he's taking the concept very seriously and is thinking about it a lot. This is not a whimsical adventure for him.
			
			To be honest I think he's just full of teenage angst and is trying to eliminate it quickly. I think he thinks psilocybin will do that for him or perhaps he thinks it will have some dramaticly positive affect on him, like it has others whose stories he's heard. For example he told me of an autistic dude who experienced feelings for the first time after dosing blue shrooms.
			
			At any rate, I'll keep the listening, caring for him and hopefully what ever he decides he'll make me a part of it so I can offer guidance... I don't know what else I can do.

		I would say this stands out as the ["greatest"](https://nervewing.blogspot.com/2018/04/ether-memantine-3-meo-pce-lsd-4-aco.html) experience

	Did you like LSD or psilocybin better? In my dozens of trips, I’ve always felt LSD was a super concentrated man-made version of psilocybin which occurs naturally. Did you feel the same?

		LSD is my favorite psychedelic- divrerse, able to fit into so many situtations etc !

	Are you the guy from Hamiltons Pharmacopeia? Your proof won't load for me for some reason, so I apologize for the dumb question lmao

	Have you ever tried [Angels trumpet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brugmansia) which is a very strong delirient similar to Datura? Do you feel that any delirient has any positive and/or therapeutic effect?   

	  

	I tried it and felt it is the worst drug ever. You do not realize you are hallucinating like you do on mushrooms. I was talking to imaginary people that were across the room having full conversations with them among other things.  

	  

	Bonus question: What drugs do you feel are good for treating major persistent depression disorder? I have heard of ketamine treatment but are there others you would suggest?

		I only slightly dabbled in the world of tropane alkaloids :x 
		
		&amp;#x200B;
		
		I think PCP analogues are seriously underexplored, there's such a stigma around them but I think their potential is immense

	What all do you have in your personal stash? As the great Hunter S. Thompson said, once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.

		I would love to share but I cannot.
		
		But I willl say, I do love to collect things

	Hope you read this. 

	It appears to me that about 15% of people just don’t chemically agree with psilocybin. Likewise some people just don’t get along well with MDMA. Agree?

* 🟩 **[Ihavetoleavesoon](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ihavetoleavesoon)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-12-14 03:10:34)_

	Do you have a way of dealing with vasoconstriction that certain chemicals might induce and make the experience uncomfortable, or of to a rocky start?

	1. How do we bring back MXE? 

	2. I seem to get bladder pain from ketamine now… I loved k, and mxe way back though. Do you have any recommendations for replacements? So sad to say goodbye to some of my favorite drugs.
