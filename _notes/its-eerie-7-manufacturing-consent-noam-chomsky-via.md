	I suppose you say, I mean the biggest international terror operations that are known are the ones that are run out of Washington.
	Or suppose you say what happened in the 1980s is the US government was driven under ground.
	Suppose I say the United States is invading South Vietnam as it was.
	The best political leaders are the ones who are lazy and corrupt.
	If the Nuremberg laws were applied, then every post-war American president would have been hanged.
	The Bible is one of probably the most genocidal book in Eric Toto-Tannon.
	Education is a system of imposed ignorance.
	No more morality in world affairs, fundamentally, than there wasn't a time when gang is con.
	They're just different factors to be concerned with.
	No, Joe, please. Thank you.
	Well, people will reasonably expect to know what you mean.
	Why did you say that? I never heard that before.
	If you said that, you better have a reason.

	"The world is burning and we are filmmakers.
	So what do you do in times like this?
	My name is Maravi Garima.
	My film Residue went to slam dance in 2020.
	We won the audience award,
	Grand Cherry Special Menchain, Best Actor Award, et cetera.
	And I want to say a couple things about the role
	of the artist.
	Everywhere you look, it is climate catastrophe,
	mass migration, endless school shooting,
	live broadcasts in a side.
	And I think the role of the artist in this moment is clear.
	It's to stand up and fight back alongside and forward
	the interests of your community and the people that we love.
	But our ability to do that is severely
	hindered by this outright political repression from Hollywood.
	Hollywood is literally destroying careers, livelihoods,
	just for speaking now.
	And so the end result is total silence
	in the industry of communicators.
	It's is eerie."

	"This B-like also become like us is over and that's what the Americans cannot understand.
	They still believe that they have to lead. The world must be led by the Americans
	and the reason they can't see it and their indenisal is that it's going down.
	Not the US as a state or a society but as an empire and all empires go down.
	There's no empire that has existed forever.
	So you may say the United States today is Titanic.
	The West is sitting as restaurants in Titanic and the water is coming up around the windows.
	Now instead of then reaching out and say okay our time is over we will be one among many and we
	will cooperate with you. What they do is they insist on one thing and that is to dominate by
	means of deception, untruths, narratives and secondly militarism. I would like to predict that
	this occasion. United States will go the same way as the Soviet Union because it is
	militarizing itself to death."
