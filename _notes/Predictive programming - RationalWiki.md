**Predictive programming** is a recurring element across many [conspiracy theories](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theories "Conspiracy theories"). The claim is that when conspirators plan a [false flag operation](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/False_flag_operation "False flag operation"), they hide references to it in the popular media before the atrocity takes place; when the event occurs, the public has softened up, and therefore passively accepts it rather than offering resistance or opposition.

The idea originates in conspiracist [pareidolia](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Pareidolia "Pareidolia"), seeing the real world as a slightly surreal literary construct complete with foreshadowing; the theory is invoked to try to explain why anyone would even do such a thing in the real world.

The main problems with the concept are the ridiculous infeasibility of the conspiracies that would be required, and the contrived nature of the theory itself, where the less realistic an example is, the stronger it is supposed to be. The logical fallacies involved are [cherry picking](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Cherry_picking "Cherry picking") and [special pleading](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Special_pleading "Special pleading").

## How it supposedly works\[[edit](https://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Predictive_programming&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: How it supposedly works")\]

The theory is used to push implausible claims about the future. The totalitarian US government in films such as _The Hunger Games_ series is taken as foreshadowing of such a government in reality.<sup id="cite_ref-Hague_1-0"><a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Predictive_programming#cite_note-Hague-1">[1]</a></sup> In fact, pretty much _any_ totalitarian government in fiction: predictive programming predicts that people would be more likely to accept the idea based on exposure to the concept in fiction.

Of course, that said government is portrayed as a _VILLAIN_ (i.e to be resisted/defeated/destroyed/etc) is said to be irrelevant. _Mere exposure_ to a concept is claimed to induce acquiescence to it.<sup id="cite_ref-Hague_1-1"><a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Predictive_programming#cite_note-Hague-1">[1]</a></sup> Science fiction adds a surrealistic tinge, therefore disarming the public from experiencing it as undesirable. ~Conspiracist~ Researcher [Alan Watt](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Alan_Watt "Alan Watt") explains:<sup id="cite_ref-Watt_2-0"><a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Predictive_programming#cite_note-Watt-2">[2]</a></sup>

> Things or ideas which would otherwise be seen as bizarre, vulgar, undesirable or impossible are inserted into films in the realm of fantasy. When the viewer watches these films, his/her mind is left open to suggestion and the conditioning process begins.

## List of examples\[[edit](https://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Predictive_programming&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: List of examples")\]

Examples include:

-   [David Icke](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/David_Icke "David Icke")'s claim that the [Sandy Hook](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook "Sandy Hook") shooting was predicted by the film _The Dark Knight Rises_<sup id="cite_ref-Icke_3-0"><a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Predictive_programming#cite_note-Icke-3">[3]</a></sup>
-   [Alex Jones](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Alex_Jones "Alex Jones")' belief that the Mexican oil rig explosion of 2010 was predicted in the film _Knowing_<sup id="cite_ref-Jones_4-0"><a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Predictive_programming#cite_note-Jones-4">[4]</a></sup>
-   [9/11](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/9/11 "9/11") conspiracists see these _everywhere._<sup id="cite_ref-Problem_5-0"><a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Predictive_programming#cite_note-Problem-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Imagination_6-0"><a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Predictive_programming#cite_note-Imagination-6">[6]</a></sup>

## Problems\[[edit](https://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Predictive_programming&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Problems")\]

The first problem is the question of why nobody in the entertainment industry has leaked this information out. According to the example from Icke mentioned above, the shot in _The Dark Knight Rises_ showing a close-up of a map with the name "Sandy Hook" visible is deliberate predictive programming. If that were the case, then logically several people involved in the shot would have been in on the conspiracy: the director, the cameraman, whoever obtained a map showing Sandy Hook as a prop, and the stage hand who positioned the map on the table in the right position.

If a shot involves computer-generated imagery, a lot of people would still need to be involved in the conspiracy. CGI is a technologically intense process, and it's usually split into different stages for division of labor. To make CGI, you need pre-visualisation artists to prepare preliminary mockups, model artists to create 3D assets, texture painters and shader developers to give those assets color, animators to make those assets move, lighting artists to ensure everything is lit up correctly, and editors to composite it all together. All these people typically work in teams, and there's usually someone around to coordinate different departments together on effects.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Predictive_programming#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> Each and every one of them would have be in on the conspiracy, because it's pretty much impossible for a lone infiltrator to insert something without _somebody_ noticing.

If plans to commit mass murders are regularly being revealed to the entertainment industry, and the information is apparently reaching low-level workers such as cameramen and stage hands, then surely one of them would have [blown the whistle](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Whistleblower "Whistleblower") by now?

Going even further, wouldn't it simply be easier to not just put things in them at all? The idea of openly putting in breadcrumbs that lead to knowing what their plans are in movies, let alone ANY conspiracy, makes the supposed villains look incompetent with their secret nature.

The second problem is the heads-I-win-tails-you-lose nature of the claims: that the _less_ plausible the claims, and the more contrived the link, the _more_ powerful it must be.
