## To be annoyed by inconvenience, discomfort and disruptions to our routines is a natural human response. But to direct one’s anger at those causing the inconvenience, rather than at the system that has made disruption the only option, is to misidentify the root cause of the problem in front of you. We march, disrupt, and prevent business as usual not out of a desire to inconvenience people, but because of the impossible situation that we are placed into — a situation that has been killing our people every day for 106 days, and that is made possible only through the complicity of the governments where we live. Without disruption, the genocide does not just continue: it expands and widens.

Next time you are inconvenienced by protestors marching in your city or blocking a road near where you live, ask yourself: What could be causing people to do this? What has become so urgent that there are people where I live who feel they have no other way to prevent injustice but to stop the world around them in its tracks? The paths you are led down on your way to an answer could change your outlook, not only on Palestine, but on the nature of struggle and overcoming oppression wherever in the world it may appear.
