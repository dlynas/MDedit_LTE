The **American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations** (**AFL-CIO**) is a [national trade union center](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_trade_union_center "National trade union center") that is the largest federation of [unions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_unions_in_the_United_States "Labor unions in the United States") in the United States. It is made up of 60 national and international unions,<sup id="cite_ref-AFL-CIO_2-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-AFL-CIO-2">[2]</a></sup> together representing more than 12 million active and retired workers.<sup id="cite_ref-OLMS_LM-2_2020-09-28_AFL-CIO_1-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-OLMS_LM-2_2020-09-28_AFL-CIO-1">[1]</a></sup> The AFL-CIO engages in substantial political spending and activism, typically in support of [progressive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States "Progressivism in the United States") and [pro-labor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_movement "Labour movement") policies.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

The AFL-CIO was formed in 1955 when the [American Federation of Labor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Federation_of_Labor "American Federation of Labor") and the [Congress of Industrial Organizations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Industrial_Organizations "Congress of Industrial Organizations") merged after a long estrangement. Union membership in the US peaked in 1979, when the AFL-CIO's affiliated unions had nearly twenty million members.<sup id="cite_ref-jillson_4-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-jillson-4">[4]</a></sup> From 1955 until 2005, the AFL-CIO's member unions represented nearly all unionized workers in the United States. Several large unions split away from AFL-CIO and formed the rival [Change to Win Federation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_to_Win_Federation "Change to Win Federation") in 2005, although a number of those unions have since re-affiliated, and many locals of Change to Win are either part of or work with their local central labor councils. The largest unions currently in the AFL-CIO are the [American Federation of Teachers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Federation_of_Teachers "American Federation of Teachers") (AFT) with approximately 1.7 million members,<sup id="cite_ref-OLMS_LM-2_2020-09-28_AFT_5-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-OLMS_LM-2_2020-09-28_AFT-5">[5]</a></sup> [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Federation_of_State,_County_and_Municipal_Employees "American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees") (AFSCME), with approximately 1.4 million members,<sup id="cite_ref-OLMS_LM-2_2021-03-30_AFSCME_6-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-OLMS_LM-2_2021-03-30_AFSCME-6">[6]</a></sup> and [United Food and Commercial Workers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Food_and_Commercial_Workers "United Food and Commercial Workers") with 1.2 million members.<sup id="cite_ref-OLMS_LM-2_2021-03-25_UFCW_7-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-OLMS_LM-2_2021-03-25_UFCW-7">[7]</a></sup>

The AFL-CIO is a federation of international labor unions. As a voluntary federation, the AFL-CIO has little authority over the affairs of its member unions except in extremely limited cases (such as the ability to expel a member union for corruption<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> and enforce resolution of disagreements over jurisdiction or organizing). As of May 2023, the AFL-CIO had 60 member unions representing 12.5 million members.<sup id="cite_ref-OLMS_LM-2_2020-09-28_AFL-CIO_1-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-OLMS_LM-2_2020-09-28_AFL-CIO-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

## Political activities [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AFL-CIO&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Political activities")

The AFL-CIO was a major component of the [New Deal Coalition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal_Coalition "New Deal Coalition") that dominated politics into the mid-1960s.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> Although it has lost membership, finances, and political clout since 1970, it remains a major player on [the liberal side of national politics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_in_the_United_States "Liberalism in the United States"), with a great deal of activity in lobbying, [grassroots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots "Grassroots") organizing, coordinating with other liberal organizations, fund-raising, and recruiting and supporting candidates around the country.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>

In recent years the AFL-CIO has concentrated its political efforts on lobbying in Washington and the state capitals, and on "GOTV" (get-out-the-vote) campaigns in major elections. For example, in the 2010 midterm elections, it sent 28.6 million pieces of mail. Members received a "slate card" with a list of union endorsements matched to the member's congressional district, along with a "personalized" letter from President Obama emphasizing the importance of voting. In addition, 100,000 volunteers went door-to-door to promote endorsed candidates to 13 million union voters in 32 states.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

## Governance [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AFL-CIO&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Governance")

The AFL-CIO is governed by its members, who meet in a quadrennial convention. Each member union elects delegates, based on proportional representation. The AFL-CIO's state federations, central and local labor councils, constitutional departments, and constituent groups are also entitled to delegates. The delegates elect officers and vice presidents, debate and approve policy, and set dues.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

### Annual meetings [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AFL-CIO&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Annual meetings")

From 1951 to 1996, the Executive Council held its winter meeting in the resort town of [Bal Harbour, Florida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bal_Harbour,_Florida "Bal Harbour, Florida").<sup id="cite_ref-Galvin1996_16-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-Galvin1996-16">[16]</a></sup> The meeting at the Bal Harbour Sheraton has been the object of frequent criticism, including over a labor dispute at the hotel itself.<sup id="cite_ref-Stieghorst1991_17-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-Stieghorst1991-17">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Sturr_2009_18-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-Sturr_2009-18">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Carmichael1986_19-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-Carmichael1986-19">[19]</a></sup>

Citing image concerns, the council changed the meeting site to [Los Angeles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles "Los Angeles").<sup id="cite_ref-PressRelease1997_20-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-PressRelease1997-20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Hershey1996_21-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-Hershey1996-21">[21]</a></sup> However, the meeting was moved back to Bal Harbour several years later.<sup id="cite_ref-Strope2004_22-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-Strope2004-22">[22]</a></sup> The 2012 meeting was held in [Orlando, Florida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida "Orlando, Florida").<sup id="cite_ref-Daraio2012_23-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-Daraio2012-23">[23]</a></sup>

### State and local bodies [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AFL-CIO&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: State and local bodies")

The AFL-CIO constitution permits international unions to pay state federation and CLC dues directly, rather than have each local or state federation pay them. This relieves each union's state and local affiliates of the administrative duty of assessing, collecting and paying the dues. International unions assess the AFL-CIO dues themselves, and collect them on top of their own dues-generating mechanisms or simply pay them out of the dues the international collects. But not all international unions pay their required state federation and CLC dues.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

### Constitutional departments [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AFL-CIO&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Constitutional departments")

One of the most well-known departments was the [Industrial Union Department](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Union_Department "Industrial Union Department") (IUD). It had been constitutionally mandated by the new AFL-CIO constitution created by the merger of the AFL and CIO in 1955,<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> as CIO unions felt that the AFL's commitment to industrial unionism was not strong enough to permit the department to survive without a constitutional mandate. For many years, the IUD was a _[de facto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto "De facto")_ organizing department in the AFL-CIO. For example, it provided money to the near-destitute [American Federation of Teachers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Federation_of_Teachers "American Federation of Teachers") (AFT) as it attempted to organize the [United Federation of Teachers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Federation_of_Teachers "United Federation of Teachers") in 1961. The organizing money enabled the AFT to win the election and establish its first large collective bargaining affiliate. For many years, the IUD remained rather militant on a number of issues.

There are six AFL-CIO constitutionally mandated departments:

-   [Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_and_Construction_Trades_Department,_AFL%E2%80%93CIO "Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL–CIO")
-   [Maritime Trades Department, AFL-CIO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_Trades_Department,_AFL%E2%80%93CIO "Maritime Trades Department, AFL–CIO")
-   [Metal Trades Department, AFL-CIO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Trades_Department,_AFL%E2%80%93CIO "Metal Trades Department, AFL–CIO")
-   [Department for Professional Employees, AFL-CIO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Professional_Employees,_AFL%E2%80%93CIO "Department for Professional Employees, AFL–CIO")
-   [Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Trades_Department,_AFL%E2%80%93CIO "Transportation Trades Department, AFL–CIO")
-   [Union Label Department, AFL-CIO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Label_Department,_AFL%E2%80%93CIO "Union Label Department, AFL–CIO")

## Constituency groups [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AFL-CIO&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Constituency groups")

Constituency groups are [nonprofit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit "Nonprofit") organizations chartered and funded by the AFL-CIO as voter registration and mobilization bodies. These groups conduct research, host training and educational conferences, issue research reports and publications, lobby for legislation and build coalitions with local groups. Each constituency group has the right to sit in on AFL-CIO executive council meetings, and to exercise representational and voting rights at AFL-CIO conventions.

The AFL-CIO's seven constituency groups include the [A. Philip Randolph Institute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._Philip_Randolph_Institute "A. Philip Randolph Institute"), the AFL-CIO Union Veterans Council, the [Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Pacific_American_Labor_Alliance "Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance"), the [Coalition of Black Trade Unionists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_of_Black_Trade_Unionists "Coalition of Black Trade Unionists"), the [Coalition of Labor Union Women](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_of_Labor_Union_Women "Coalition of Labor Union Women"), the [Labor Council for Latin American Advancement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Council_for_Latin_American_Advancement "Labor Council for Latin American Advancement") and [Pride at Work](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_at_Work "Pride at Work").

## Allied organizations [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AFL-CIO&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Allied organizations")

The Working for America Institute started out as a department of the AFL-CIO. Established in 1958, it was previously known as the Human Resources Development Institute (HRDI). John Sweeney renamed the department and spun it off as an independent organization in 1998 to act as a lobbying group to promote economic development, develop new economic policies, and lobby Congress on economic policy.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> The [American Center for International Labor Solidarity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Center_for_International_Labor_Solidarity "American Center for International Labor Solidarity") started out as the Free Trade Union Committee (FTUC), which internationally promoted free labor-unions.<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>

Other organizations that are allied with the AFL-CIO include:

-   [Alliance for Retired Americans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_for_Retired_Americans "Alliance for Retired Americans")
-   [Solidarity Center](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_Center "Solidarity Center")

-   [Ohio Organizing Collaborative](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Organizing_Collaborative "Ohio Organizing Collaborative")

## Programs [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AFL-CIO&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Programs")

Programs are organizations established and controlled by the AFL-CIO to serve certain organizational goals. Programs of the AFL-CIO include the AFL-CIO Building Investment Trust, the [AFL-CIO Employees Federal Credit Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL%E2%80%93CIO_Employees_Federal_Credit_Union "AFL–CIO Employees Federal Credit Union"), the AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust, the [National Labor College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_College "National Labor College") and Union Privilege.

## International policy [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AFL-CIO&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: International policy")

The AFL-CIO is affiliated to the Brussels-based [International Trade Union Confederation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Trade_Union_Confederation "International Trade Union Confederation"), formed November 1, 2006. The new body incorporated the member organizations of the [International Confederation of Free Trade Unions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Confederation_of_Free_Trade_Unions "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions"), of which the AFL-CIO had long been part. The AFL-CIO had had a very active foreign policy in building and strengthening free trade unions. During the [Cold War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War"), it vigorously opposed Communist unions in Latin America and Europe. In opposing Communism, it helped split the [CGT](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Confederation_of_Labour_(France) "General Confederation of Labour (France)") in France and helped create the anti-Communist [Force Ouvrière](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_Force "Workers' Force").<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>

According to the cybersecurity firm Area 1, hackers working for the [People's Liberation Army Strategic Support Force](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army_Strategic_Support_Force "People's Liberation Army Strategic Support Force") compromised the networks of the AFL-CIO in order to gain information on negotiations for the [Trans-Pacific Partnership](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership "Trans-Pacific Partnership").<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>

AFL-CIO headquarters in Washington, DC

The AFL-CIO has a long relationship with civil rights struggles. One of the major points of contention between the AFL and the CIO, particularly in the era immediately after the CIO split off, was the CIO's willingness to include black workers (excluded by the AFL in its focus on craft unionism).<sup id="cite_ref-Targ2010_30-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-Targ2010-30">[30]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Sustar2012_31-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-Sustar2012-31">[31]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> Later, blacks would also criticize the CIO for abandoning their interests, particularly after the merger with the AFL.<sup id="cite_ref-Hill1961_33-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-Hill1961-33">[33]</a></sup>

In 1961, [Martin Luther King Jr.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr. "Martin Luther King Jr.") gave a speech titled "If the Negro Wins, Labor Wins" to the organization's convention in [Bal Harbour, Florida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bal_Harbour,_Florida "Bal Harbour, Florida").<sup id="cite_ref-:0_34-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-:0-34">[34]</a></sup> King hoped for a coalition between civil rights and labor that would improve the situation for the entire working class by ending racial discrimination.

In the 21st century, the AFL-CIO has been criticized by campaigners against police violence for its affiliation with the [International Union of Police Associations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Police_Associations "International Union of Police Associations") (IUPA).<sup id="cite_ref-Kelly2020_38-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-Kelly2020-38">[38]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> On May 31, 2020, the AFL-CIO offices in [Washington, DC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_DC "Washington, DC"), were set on fire during the [George Floyd protests](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests "George Floyd protests") taking place in the city.<sup id="cite_ref-Gangitano2020_40-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-Gangitano2020-40">[40]</a></sup> In response, AFL-CIO president [Richard Trumka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Trumka "Richard Trumka") condemned both the [murder of George Floyd](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd "Murder of George Floyd") and the destruction of the offices, but did not address demands to end the organization's affiliation with the IUPA.<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup>

### Triumph and disaster: the politics of the 1960s [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AFL-CIO&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Triumph and disaster: the politics of the 1960s")

After the smashing electoral victory of [President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Lyndon_B._Johnson "Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson"), the heavily Democratic Congress passed a raft of liberal legislation. Labor union leaders claimed credit for the widest range of liberal laws since the New Deal era, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the Voting Rights Act of 1965; the War on Poverty; aid to cities and education; increased Social Security benefits; and Medicare for the elderly. The 1966 elections were an unexpected disaster, with defeats for many of the more liberal Democrats. According to Alan Draper, the AFL-CIO Committee on Political Action (COPE) was the main electioneering unit of the labor movement. It ignored the white backlash against civil rights. The COPE assumed falsely that union members were interested in issues of greatest salience to union leadership, but polls showed this was not true. The members were much more conservative. The younger ones were deeply concerned about taxes and crime, and the older ones had more conservative social views. Furthermore, a new issue—the War in Vietnam—was bitterly splitting the [New Deal coalition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal_coalition "New Deal coalition") into hawks (led by Johnson and Vice-President [Hubert Humphrey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Humphrey "Hubert Humphrey")) and doves (led by Senators [Eugene McCarthy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_McCarthy "Eugene McCarthy") and [Robert Kennedy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kennedy "Robert Kennedy")).<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup>

### New Unity Partnership [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AFL-CIO&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: New Unity Partnership")

In 2003, the AFL-CIO began an intense internal debate over the future of the labor movement in the United States with the creation of the [New Unity Partnership](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Unity_Partnership "New Unity Partnership") (NUP), a loose coalition of some of the AFL-CIO's largest unions. This debate intensified in 2004, after the defeat of labor-backed candidate [John Kerry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry "John Kerry") in the [November 2004 US presidential election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._presidential_election,_2004 "U.S. presidential election, 2004"). The NUP's program for reform of the federation included reduction of the central bureaucracy, more money spent on organizing new members rather than on electoral politics, and a restructuring of unions and locals, eliminating some smaller locals and focusing more along the lines of [industrial unionism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_unionism "Industrial unionism").

In 2005, the NUP dissolved and the [Change to Win Federation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_to_Win_Federation "Change to Win Federation") (CtW) formed, threatening to secede from the AFL-CIO if its demands for major reorganization were not met. As the AFL-CIO prepared for its 50th anniversary convention in late July, three of the federations' four largest unions announced their withdrawal from the federation: the [Service Employees International Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Employees_International_Union "Service Employees International Union") (SEIU), the [International Brotherhood of Teamsters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Brotherhood_of_Teamsters "International Brotherhood of Teamsters") ("The Teamsters"),<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> and the [United Food and Commercial Workers International Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Food_and_Commercial_Workers_International_Union "United Food and Commercial Workers International Union") (UFCW).<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup> [UNITE HERE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNITE_HERE "UNITE HERE") disaffiliated in mid-September 2005,<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> the [United Farm Workers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Farm_Workers "United Farm Workers") left in January 2006,<sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup> and the Laborers' International Union of North America disaffiliated on June 1, 2006.<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup>

Two unions later left CtW and rejoined the AFL-CIO.

### ILWU disaffiliation [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AFL-CIO&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: ILWU disaffiliation")

In August 2013, the [International Longshore and Warehouse Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Longshore_and_Warehouse_Union "International Longshore and Warehouse Union") (ILWU) disaffiliated from the AFL-CIO. The ILWU said that members of other AFL-CIO unions were crossing its picket lines, and the AFL-CIO had done nothing to stop it. The ILWU also cited the AFL-CIO's willingness to compromise on key policies such as labor law reform, immigration reform, and health care reform. The longshoremen's union said it would become an independent union.<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup>

### Norfolk Southern proxy fight [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AFL-CIO&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Norfolk Southern proxy fight")

In 2024, AFL-CIO voiced its opposition to an investor-led plan at [Norfolk Southern Railway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Southern_Railway "Norfolk Southern Railway") to replace the company's top management and several board members. Organized labor is divided on the issue, which is the major sticking point of a proxy battle between NS management and investors ahead of a May 9, 2024 shareholder meeting. AFL-CIO came out and voiced its support for Norfolk's CEO [Alan Shaw](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_H._Shaw "Alan H. Shaw"), citing concerns about safety, service, and job losses. The union criticized the proposal to replace Shaw and implement a system known as [precision railroading](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_railroading "Precision railroading").<sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup>

Extensive photo documentation of labor union activities from the 1940s to the present are in the photographic negative and digital collections.  Additionally, collections of graphic images, over 10,000 audio tapes, several hundred films and videotapes, and over 2,000 artifacts are available for public research and study.<sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL-CIO#cite_note-53">[1]</a></sup>
