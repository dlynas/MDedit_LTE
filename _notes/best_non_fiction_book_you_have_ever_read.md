		This book feels like a shot of morphine right into your eyeballs. Immediately picks up with them on the mountain and lays the groundwork of just how fucking insane it is to even think about climbing it. There is no fat on this book. Just grabs you by the balls and never lets go. Krakauer was on the mountain when it happened so not only does he have a first hand visual account of the disaster but it also has a writers touch and knows how to tell a great story

		“Welcome. And congratulations. I’m delighted that you could make it. Getting here wasn’t easy, I know…” [Goes on to explain how unlikely it is that atoms come together to make us, us.]

	My advice:

	(1) start with one book.  Don't try to read 10 books at once.  Just read one.

	(2) read 5-10 pages a day.  Set a reasonable expectation.

	(3) pick a subject that interests you.  I can recommend a lot of books, but not all of them will be books you'll want to read.  

	(4) once you finish your book, ask if there's anything you read that you want to learn more about.  Find a book on that, and that's your next book.

		I'll add something that has been helpful for me when reading non-fiction specifically. If it's any sort of book that offers insights to you, write them down. I read a fair bit of non-fiction now and have started writing down everything that either inspires me, makes me think differently, or provides guidance. 
		
		Many books will have references to other books or papers in them, if those interest you, write those down as well. Then when you read those, and if you take notes, refer back to the other book. Eventually you'll sort of create a lot of connections between what you're reading and your notes. For me, this has been the far more fun aspect of reading non-fiction. Making lots of connections between books and things I stumble on, and then forming my own opinion, or relating practical advice or history to my own life.

	You got a lot of random-ass titles. Reddit is like that. You're gonna ignore a bunch, I get it. So let me offer a title and an explanation: 

	{{Endurance, by Alfred Lansing }}

	It concerns the ill-fated 1915 Antarctic expedition led by Ernest Shackleton and the struggle for survival that ensued after the ship (Endurance) was caught in the ice. 

	In my opinion, if you're only gonna read one nonfiction book, or if you need an entry point to nonfiction, it's not even close. The book is written very well, both never drifting into feeling fictional, but never reading like a dry news report either. Lansing wrote it in the '50s and had access to first-hand accounts and interviews from people close to what happened.

What happens when the 1893 Chicago worlds fair, a mass murderer, young women, and an obsessive landscape designer are all in the same place at the same time? A bizarre combination of Americana and slaughter.

			I think the connection is that the two events just took place in the same place at the same time. One didn’t necessarily cause the other, except for the fact that Chicago appealed to young women because of the world’s fair but from what I recall, the story doesn’t try to prove a strong connection/causal relation. I would also say that the book is impeccably researched.

	* 🟨 **[oldtimehawkey](https://www.reddit.com/user/oldtimehawkey)** ⬆️ 4 _(2023-12-19 15:04:07)_

		I’m reading this now. It’s an okay book. I think there’s some stuff that could be done better. He seems to want us to believe that no one cared about the Osage getting killed, he’s mentioned it a couple times about “finding someone who cares to investigate.” But then the rest of the chapter IS about people investigating the murders. 
		
		There’s even one murder that he doesn’t care about himself where he just says white horn was murdered. An Osage woman was murdered. Then Annie was murdered. He didn’t give a shit enough about that woman to find out her name and didn’t even leave a note to say if that woman’s identity was known or not! 
		
		It kind of leaves a bad taste in my mouth when the book IS about people investigating the murders but “no one *wanted* to.” I think it should have been told from the angle of everyone trying to fuck over the Osage with the murders thrown into context of how that is fucking them over too. It would have been better if told like that.

		* 🟧 **[ashack11](https://www.reddit.com/user/ashack11)** ⬆️ 4 _(2023-12-19 15:40:54)_

			It’s been a couple months since I last read the book, so apologies if I forget anything. But I thought it was fascinating the way Grann focused on this place in transition between the lawless Wild West without a police force and the more modern policing structure that came to pass in the early 21st century. But in that old structure, the laws could only be enforced if people cared to enforce them - and the Osage weren’t seen as people worth protecting. 
			
			I’d recommend getting further into the book, I think particularly the courtroom section will be of interest to you. A big question was : “Would a jury of twelve white men ever punish another white man for killing an American Indian?” (P.233)
			
			Grann spends a lot of time digging into the details. Because even if Washington and Hoover cared about preserving rule of law and sent investigators, the white community in Oklahoma, and in much of the country, did not see the Osage as people still.

	Check out something by Mary Roach. I just got Gulp recently, haven’t checked it out yet but the little snippet of the audible sample I heard a while back stuck with me. It was explaining why dogs stick their heads out of windows when driving in cars. Because they “see” the world through smell and when their heads are out the window and the wind is rushing up their nose it ramps up their input intake something fierce and they love it. Most of the folks who mention reading her stuff seem to enjoy it and it should qualify as science, I think. Happy hunting!

	My personal favorite so far is "Dead Wake"by Erik Larsen.

	Great story and good writing style is extremely easy to read.  It feels like I'm reading a novel.

	I've enjoyed all of the books I've read of his, but Dead Wake really stands out above the others for me.

	For OP, it's not a very long book and the chapters are quite short, so it should be an easy read if you're not used to reading a lot 

	Also, good for you for making the effort to change and try new things.  There's nothing like a great book that you can just get absorbed in and lose yourself.  I hope you find something you love and keep reading.

	My non-fiction rec list, which covers multiple topics so pick one that interests you:

	The Amazons: Lives and Legends of Warrior Women Across the Ancient World by Adrienne Mayor - This one could be a little textbook-y.  I found the subject matter fascinating, so I didn't mind, plus I kind of like textbook-y depending on the context and subject, so I loved it, but feel free to take it slow or put it to the bottom of the list once you've cut your teeth on some less-textbook-y types.

	* 🟨 **[PopTart_](https://www.reddit.com/user/PopTart_)** ⬆️ 3 _(2023-12-19 15:20:05)_

		You may have already read these but two books I’ll recommend to you (and OP/others) based off of your list are:
		
		*The Feather Thief by Kirk Wallace Johnson* - this story was so crazy I thought it surely couldn’t be true. The first bit about the history of the bird feathers is important to understand so push through it if you’re like me and know nothing about the subject. I never thought I’d learn so much about birds, fly fishing, or be captivated by a heist that happened just a few years ago!
		
		*The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs by Steve Brusatte* - great information about dinosaurs that is easily accessible to anyone of all ages.

		* 🟧 **[blueberry_pancakes14](https://www.reddit.com/user/blueberry_pancakes14)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-12-20 11:30:36)_

* 🟩 **[StinkyAndTheStain](https://www.reddit.com/user/StinkyAndTheStain)** ⬆️ 4 _(2023-12-19 13:47:14)_

	I don't read a ton of nonfiction, but I really enjoyed Down and Out in Paris and London. Though it's supposedly not 100% realistic sort of in the same way as Walden, where Orwell had more help than he let on.

	* 🟨 **[rustblooms](https://www.reddit.com/user/rustblooms)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-12-19 15:52:04)_

		That's a great book! I also really enjoyed The Road to Wigan Pier, which is about the situation of mining communities in Northern England in the late 1920s-early 1930s. He goes and looks at houses, and down a mine. It's really interesting to get a look at poverty at that time.

	* 🟨 **[ferdfarkle](https://www.reddit.com/user/ferdfarkle)** ⬆️ 5 _(2023-12-19 14:31:40)_

	It's very dated now, but my first thought was the Next Whole Earth Catalog, which wasn't a normal book by any means, but instead a catalog listing other books that its editors considered the best of the best at the time, about a wide swath of life and the present and future. It is profusely illustrated, and includes useful excerpts/samples from every book to which it refers.

	I think it and related publications are now available online to access for free, as well as there being many copies in public libraries around the USA.

	When breath becomes air. Read this recently. And although there are surely better ones. There’s something to be said about a book written by someone who knows they are going to die. Gives you a perspective that would not exist in any other age… or probably from any other person. Quick read … leaves an impression.

* 🟩 **[Expression-Little](https://www.reddit.com/user/Expression-Little)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-12-19 14:34:37)_

	'Into Thin Air' by Jon Krakauer is really good. Amazing 'cast' (they're real people of course), high stakes (they're climbing Mt. Everest) and good writing (Krakauer is a journalist). A tale of human egotism versus an unexpected storm on the world's highest peak, and the desperation to survive under incredibly tough circumstances. Krakauer was there so it is also a first-person account.

	'Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors' by Piers Paul Read. An account of the survival of the people who survived the plane crash of Uruguay Flight 571 who lived on a desolate mountain in the Andes mountain range for 72 days. They faced avalanches, starvation, death, despair and finally, hope.  The survivors themselves contributed heavily to this book.

	A Street Cat Named Bob by James Bowen. I read this book when I was struggling to find a book I really enjoyed. I'd start a book, lose interest halfway and move on to another. But this book.... really hooked me in. I'm an animal lover which probably helped but it really does shine a light on homelessness and addiction, and just how much animals help us during tough times. The best part about it is it's a true story. Bob is sadly no longer alive but that book keeps his story around.

	I don't know if it's the best, but I recently read From Here to Eternity by Caitlin Doughty and loved it. It describes different cultures' approaches to death and burial customs in an easy to read and extremely interesting manner. Her other  book Smoke Gets in Your Eyes is more autobiographical and describes hiw she became interested in the field and her journey into the alternative mortuary world. It is very human and discusses her thoughts on how western culture's tendency to remove family from most responsibility for caring for the dead has done us a disservice.

	Why fish don’t exist - Lulu Miller. This short book got me back into reading from a long slump. It’s part memoir, part science, and part biography, all wrapped together by the question: How do you pick your life back up after everything falls apart? I couldn’t put it down.

	How Stella Learned to Talk by Christina Hunger is a pretty good one. Its nit for everyone but if you love dogs its well worth a read. Its about a children's speech pathologist that realizes that he puppy's communication milestones are similar to that of her patients snd decides to give her dog a few assisive communication words on buttons to see how it goes. She documents the process pretty well and is down to earth in her understanding of her dog's capacity.
