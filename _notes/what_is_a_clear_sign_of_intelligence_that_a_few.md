			Its incredibly suspicious if it happens in a short span of time. An example would be being extremely pro-life in one year and then flipping to be pro-choice the next. However, if your position today is radically different than your position was, 10 or 20 years ago,I can believe that you genuinely changed your mind.

				There is also the added complication of representing your constituents. If you were elected on and campaigning for certain issues, even a well informed change of view will be seen as a betrayal by those less informed or otherwise entrenched in their beliefs. 
				
				There is no virtue in "strength of beliefs" if it's unfounded.

		I have gotten into debates with people about topics and they eventually get mad at me for “arguing to be right” and I straight up tell them “I am *eager* for you to convince me otherwise, but you haven’t showed enough evidence to do so yet” with the added “I don’t care about either of our opinions, I’m gonna go with the answer that makes the most sense once we’ve both shared our supporting evidence”. And I’ve 100% fought tooth and nail for an opinion, and my debate partner will state something I was unaware of prior and my “diehard opinion” just completely fizzles. I’m all for the objective “truth”, no use dying on a hill that I can’t stand upon with 100% confidence.

			It's amazing to me how many people would rather risk going through life with a flawed opinion than to test their opinion via a sensible discussion.
			
			If your opinion is valid it should stand up to the discussion, if not why the fuck would you cling to it.

				Some people are just shitty at debate even if they do have good reasons for their beliefs. I know I have a fair few beliefs that I remember putting time into researching before I formed them, but if I had to debate someone about them I’d probably do a bad job because my memory isn’t stellar and I don’t remember the research I did, just the conclusion I took from it.

		The older I get, the more I realise that those two things are mutually exclusive. Or, they're becoming mutually exclusive in my life--narrative.
		
		I don't necessarily associate self awareness with intelligence--I've met some beautifully self aware people who you might not consider as "smart", perhaps emotional intelligence which I think is probably more important, but I do believe it's a wonderful way to separate the NPCs of the world from the people I actually want to spend time with.
		
		I might not be the most self aware, but I'm working on it. I surround myself with other people who actively work on it too.

		* 🟧 **[Newlyseperated46fla](https://www.reddit.com/user/Newlyseperated46fla)** ⬆️ 37 _(2024-04-21 07:19:44)_

			Without self awareness, you cant see what you are doing wrong and this will have an extremely difficult time improving yourself.  I do agree it's more of an emotional intelligence quality than intellectual one.

		* 🟧 **[RiccoBaldo](https://www.reddit.com/user/RiccoBaldo)** ⬆️ 32 _(2024-04-21 07:32:05)_

			Calling people you don't know "NPCs" feels very self absorbed. Like I know that maybe they'll be NPCs in your life, but it's not like those people only live for that. Everyone has their own shit to worry about.

			It feeds into my imposter syndrome. The bigger my skillet becomes, the more I realize how much I don't know. Then I'm tasked on a project I can probably do, but they want experts and I can't call myself an expert at anything. Just really really good at a lot of things.

			As said in Game of Thrones, any man who has to say he's the king is not the king. 
			
			If you're smart, people will figure it out with the way you carry yourself. If you're successful, they'll see it too. If you have to shout it to everyone you meet, there's a good chance you're not what you say you are.

		I used to work IT support in an office. It would really piss me off when old people - and it always was old people - would declare "oh I'm terrible with computers". It's your job! You work in an office and you literally have to use this computer to do your job. Fucking learn. Imagine a bus driver turning up and announcing "oh I'm such a bad driver tee hee".

		* 🟧 **[SnowyMole](https://www.reddit.com/user/SnowyMole)** ⬆️ 21 _(2024-04-21 08:06:16)_

			Yeah, I'm unsure why so many are still willing to coddle these people.  Computers have been a daily part of professional life for over two decades now.  The time for "oh, I'm bad with computers" has long since passed.  At this point, if anyone is still saying that, they are just straight up unwilling to learn or adapt, and can't be trusted in most professional roles.

		My dad has many opinions that he is not shy to share. But when I ask him where exactly he got his information from he never has an answer for me. I don't doubt that he knows many things, but sometimes his opinions are just unreflected bullshit. The funnier ones are when he judges people for stuff he does as well
		
		Anyone who pisses him off is either stupid, drunk, or on drugs. Mind you, my dad has never even smoked weed, he does not know anyone who actually takes drugs. 
		
		My favorite: welfare money is deposited at the end of the month, so when we go grocery shopping in the first or the last week of the month, no matter which day it is, he will complain about all those people clogging the supermarket because they got money to buy groceries. BUT: he too gets his salary in the same week and he too goes shopping at the same time as anyone else

	* 🟨 **[SnowyMole](https://www.reddit.com/user/SnowyMole)** ⬆️ 8 _(2024-04-21 08:04:06)_

		I mean, it's not even really being proud of their ignorance.  It's that they think that admitting they are wrong or that they don't know something makes them look bad.  I can't count the number of professional meetings I've been in that would have gone way smoother if one person had just been able to admit that there's something they didn't know.  Instead, almost everyone tries to cover their ignorance with bullshit pulled from thin air.  Then you have to waste time navigating around that, because calling them out on it just makes the situation worse.  It's a train wreck from start to finish.

		One of the reasons banning books with "controversial" topics is so bad.
		
		
		Exposure to alternative viewpoints, challenging themes, and controversial content is important to build critical thinking skills.

				It depends how you define intelligence. For me, it's more all encompassing than being a good problem solver, having good knowledge or being talented in a specific field. 
				
				For me, someone who behaves in the manner you described might be talented and/or clever, but they're not intelligent in this 'all round' way that I perceive as deserving of the label. A truly intelligent person would be able to listen to their conversation partner and gain some insight from them, and hopefully elevate the insight in both sides of the conversation by the way they engage. 
				
				I realise this is a subjective definition of intelligence though!

	Feeling like idiots for knowing how stupid they are, a bit too self conscious. Notices small things.

Curiosity and the ability to hold multiple, opposing ideas simultaneously are also good signs of intelligence often ignored, especially the latter. Low intellectual potential specimens are often not able to hold many opposing ideas simultaneously, thus what they do hold is full of contradictions they don't notice.

	1. Good spatial thinking ability - being able to think of concepts or objects in your head and then being able to visualise things comes into play once you get into high level concepts in STEM

	2. Good transferable knowledge base - some intelligent people have intelligence in narrow subject matters , some intelligent people are able to apply concepts from their field to another field. To do that it requires good analogical reasoning

	3. Good mentalisation ability - Mentalization (i.e., the ability to think about states of mind (e.g., thoughts, feelings, intentions) in the self and other people)

	4. Structured thinking and corrective thinking - intelligent people will usually approach problems in a very structured way and will have a rough idea of what they should expect at each step. They are usually careful to scrutinize their own thoughts for gaps or flaws.

	5. Patient and curious - they will usually listen and listen to information and ask questions to clarify information or to build on their understanding of something within the topic /or slightly just beyond the topic but closely related

				That’s a good way to sum it up. I’d only add that they tend to have a sort of spark or light, so to speak, and it goes with how they react and emote as a whole. It’s definitely an alertness and a sharpness, that’s for sure.

	They're quick-witted and funny. In the fraction of a second since someone said or did something, they've come up with a relevant way of expressing something which makes people laugh.

	I think that you can get a read one someone by their humor. To some, the peak of hilarity is something bad happening to someone else.

	A genuine curiosity about everything.  If a truly smart person encounters something new, they will ask probing questions to learn more about it.  The average person on the street will go "oh, interesting" then change the subject at best, or call you a nerd at worst.

* 🟩 **[tom_oakley](https://www.reddit.com/user/tom_oakley)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-04-21 09:29:03)_

	Deep calculation. You see it in competitive chess at higher level play, a player might play 15 moves in a row as if on autopilot (their preparation and experience of similar positions doing the heavy lifting), but then spend half an hour on a single move as they calculate multiple potential lines in search of future positions that could be advantageous. Even highly "intuitive" players from romantic era chess were likely combining raw calculation with... "positional imagination".. I guess?

	This calculation may not be strictly mathematical or spatial in nature. When you apply for a job, you're making a calculation as to whether this job position would create advantages for you, which in turn relates to the salary you negotiate, as the employer calculates your tangible and intangible "value" as a new hire. In life, as in chess, there are "moves" we make on intuition or habit alone, but there are moves that require deep calculation, especially those which represent a major upheaval or change in direction or new paradigm. Highly intelligent people have both the awareness of WHEN to deep calculate, as well as the capacity to calculate further out from the 'starting point' than the average person.

	Being open and receptive to most people, whether they be a binman or a professor surgeon.

	People who are genuinely very very intelligent tend to understand their own place in the universe and that they are really not at the top of the possible intelligence pyramid. Knowledge is vast, and the unknown is even vaster. There is almost always another human somewhere who is much smarter than you are, or a problem which you cannot solve without someone else's insight. Intelligence and insight also take many forms.

	Even the humble binman has thoughts, feelings, experiences and maybe some unique perspective on life or the world to offer. 

	Many highly intelligent people understand this, and that there is more to intelligence and value of a human being than just dry academic book-based exam grades, so they're open to listen or even just enjoy a good-natured interaction with a less educated but friendily person.

	They are also comfortable enough in their own skin to not put others down. It is obvious to them that having a friendily interaction with the binman in no way hinders their own intellectual accomplishments.

		Eghh, I think empathy is a proxy for having an accurate model for how others might feel or view things but empathy itself implies a connection or resonance with that feeling or perspective, which I argue is not necessary to showcase intelligence.
