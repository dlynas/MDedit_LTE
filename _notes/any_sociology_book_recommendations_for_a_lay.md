## Any Sociology book recommendations for a lay reader

In the beginning, I was full of inferiority, and then I questioned and completely gave up on the notion of national pride, but if you want a measuring-dick context, the crimes committed by first-world countries pretty much (in my eyes) would easily justify me being proud of my small insignificant country, and completely justify the petty crimes that some emigrants (just as poor natives) commit as the fall through the cracks.

	On the topic of Race and Ethnicity I'd recommend the following three classics:

	1) [Imagined Communities - Benedict Anderson](https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/1126-imagined-communities) Though not focusing specifically on ethnicity,  this work describes in a very detailed and accessible manner the emergence of nations and nationalism in recent centuries. 

	2) [Race, Nation, Class: Ambiguous Identities - Balibar &amp; Wallerstein](https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/1358-race-nation-class) 

	3) [Black Skin, White Masks - Frantz Fanon](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/313127/black-skin-white-masks-by-fanon-frantz/9780241396667)

	Happy reading!

	“Racism: a very short introduction” by Ali Rattansi might be helpful for you and there are free pdfs of it online. I read it for one of my classes and it taught me a lot

	I  think "Contested Knowledge: Social Theory Today"

	by Steven Seidman is an excellent survey of the field. It's accessible for specialists, generalists, or people just interested in exposure to some really fundamental currents in social and sociological thought. Your topics of interest are written about by Seidman and those he reviews.

	As one of the other posters wrote, you won't go wrong with Anthony Giddens. 

	I have plenty more directions to go if you're interested.

	If you want to keep reading more general and introductory books, "Sociology" (Anthony Giddens) is pretty much the bible. It covers A LOT of topics and it will give you all the basics you need.

	I also believe "The Sociological Immagination" (Mills) would be a great reading for what you're looking at.

	I know these are very basic suggestions, but in my opinion it's important to have a general sociological background before digging into more complex and specific themes.

* 🟩 **[SpinachOver487](https://www.reddit.com/user/SpinachOver487)** ⬆️ 3 _(2023-12-24 02:28:09)_

	Here to offer you the good classics everyone should know about.

	Look these authors up and you get a lot to choose from, they basically cover all the things you love i think. 

	Angela Y Davis

	Bell hooks

	Let me know what books interest yo[u/what](https://www.reddit.com/user/what) you’ll read. 

	I wanted to ask you what made you start questioning certain things? 

	Are you  now in a phase of questioning it all? Did your views drastically change? 

	Would love to hear more about your journey so far if you’d like to share. 

	Also curious about what makes it so that you have trouble with thinking about race as a social construct? what made gender as a social construct just click immediately? Most people would say the opposite, so i am curious.

	A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America by Ronald Takaki.  I would go with the 2008 edition.  

	As an immigrant I think you should read a Renegade History by Thaddeus Russel and Lies Across America &amp; Lies My Teacher Told.  by James Lowen.  These three books will give you a different perspective on history and politics as well as good reads

	* 🟨 **[gate18](https://www.reddit.com/user/gate18) (OP)** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-12-25 08:22:47)_

		I read "Renegade History by Thaddeus Russel" and really liked it. 
		
		From the few reviews for "Different Mirror", it might be one of those books that I've been looking for. A reviewer wrote "After Reading this book you will know how British colonists, African, Irish, Jew, Chinese, Japanese, and Afghans first came to America." - Perfect
		
		Thanks

	RE: Politics, Crawford Young's writing on Africa across his lifetime are very good. You may not have the interest in Africa, but you'll learn a lot about human nature and politics in general. They make great case studies.
