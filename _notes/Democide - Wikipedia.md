**Democide** refers to "the intentional killing of an unarmed or disarmed person by [government agents](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_agent "Special agent") acting in their [authoritative](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritative "Authoritative") capacity and pursuant to government policy or high command." The term was first coined by Holocaust historian and statistics expert, [R.J. Rummel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.J._Rummel "R.J. Rummel") in his book _Death by Government_, but has also been described as a better term than [genocide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide "Genocide") to refer to certain types of mass killings, by renowned Holocaust historian [Yehuda Bauer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehuda_Bauer "Yehuda Bauer").<sup id="cite_ref-Harff_1996_1-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-Harff_1996-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Harff_2017_2-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-Harff_2017-2">[2]</a></sup> According to Rummel, this definition covers a wide range of deaths, including [forced labor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_labor "Forced labor") and [concentration camp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_camp "Concentration camp") victims, [extrajudicial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrajudicial "Extrajudicial") summary killings, and mass deaths due to governmental acts of criminal omission and neglect, such as in deliberate [famines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine "Famine") like the [Holodomor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor "Holodomor"), as well as killings by _de facto_ governments, for example, killings during a [civil war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war "Civil war").<sup id="cite_ref-Harff_1996_1-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-Harff_1996-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Harff_2017_2-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-Harff_2017-2">[2]</a></sup> This definition covers any [murder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder "Murder") of any number of persons by any government.<sup id="cite_ref-Harff_1996_1-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-Harff_1996-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Harff_2017_2-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-Harff_2017-2">[2]</a></sup>

Rummel created _democide_ as an extended term to include forms of government murder not covered by _[genocide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide "Genocide")_. According to Rummel, democide surpassed war as the leading cause of non-natural death in the 20th century.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

## Definition [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Democide&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Definition")

Democide is the murder of any person or people by their government, including [genocide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide "Genocide"), [politicide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politicide "Politicide"), and [mass murder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_murder "Mass murder"). Democide is not necessarily the elimination of entire cultural groups but rather groups within the country that the government feels need to be eradicated for political reasons and due to claimed future threats.<sup id="cite_ref-Harff_1996_1-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-Harff_1996-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Harff_2017_2-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-Harff_2017-2">[2]</a></sup>

According to Rummel, genocide has three different meanings. The ordinary meaning is murder by government of people due to their national, ethnic, racial or religious group membership. The legal meaning of genocide refers to the international treaty on genocide, the [Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Prevention_and_Punishment_of_the_Crime_of_Genocide "Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide"). This also includes nonlethal acts that in the end eliminate or greatly hinder the group. Looking back on history, one can see the different variations of democides that have occurred, but it still consists of acts of killing or mass murder. The generalized meaning of genocide is similar to the ordinary meaning but also includes government killings of political opponents or otherwise intentional murder. In order to avoid confusion over which meaning is intended, Rummel created _democide_ for this third meaning.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

In "How Many Did Communist Regimes Murder?", Rummel wrote:

> First, however, I should clarify the term democide. It means for governments what murder means for an individual under [municipal law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_law "Municipal law"). It is the premeditated killing of a person in cold blood, or causing the death of a person through [reckless and wanton disregard for their life](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recklessness_(law) "Recklessness (law)"). Thus, a government incarcerating people in a prison under such deadly conditions that they die in a few years is murder by the state—democide—as would parents letting a child die from malnutrition and exposure be murder. So would government forced labor that kills a person within months or a couple of years be murder. So would government created famines that then are ignored or knowingly aggravated by government action be murder of those who starve to death. And obviously, [extrajudicial executions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrajudicial_execution "Extrajudicial execution"), death by torture, government massacres, and all genocidal killing be murder. However, judicial executions for crimes that internationally would be considered capital offenses, such as for murder or treason (as long as it is clear that these are not fabricated for the purpose of executing the accused, as in communist show trials), are not democide. Nor is democide the killing of enemy soldiers in combat or of armed rebels, nor of noncombatants as a result of military action against military targets.<sup id="cite_ref-Rummel_1993_6-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-Rummel_1993-6">[6]</a></sup>

In his work and research, Rummel distinguished between [colonial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism "Colonialism"), [democratic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy "Democracy"), and [authoritarian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarian "Authoritarian") and [totalitarian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarian "Totalitarian") regimes.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> He defined totalitarianism as follows:

> There is much confusion about what is meant by totalitarian in the literature, including the denial that such systems even exist. I define a totalitarian state as one with a system of government that is unlimited [constitutionally](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution "Constitution") or by countervailing powers in society (such as by a church, rural gentry, labor unions, or regional powers); is not held responsible to the public by periodic [secret](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_ballot "Secret ballot") and competitive elections; and employs its unlimited power to control all aspects of society, including the family, religion, education, business, private property, and social relationships. Under [Stalin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalin "Stalin"), the [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") was thus totalitarian, as was [Mao](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao "Mao")'s [China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China_(1949%E2%80%931976) "History of the People's Republic of China (1949–1976)"), [Pol Pot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Pot "Pol Pot")'s [Cambodia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Kampuchea "Democratic Kampuchea"), [Hitler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler "Hitler")'s [Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany"), and [U Ne Win](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U_Ne_Win "U Ne Win")'s [Burma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Republic_of_the_Union_of_Burma "Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma"). Totalitarianism is then a political ideology for which a totalitarian government is the agency for realizing its ends. Thus, totalitarianism characterizes such ideologies as [state socialism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_socialism "State socialism") (as in Burma), [Marxism-Leninism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism-Leninism "Marxism-Leninism") as in former [East Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany "East Germany"), and [Nazism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism "Nazism"). Even revolutionary Moslem [Iran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran") since the [overthrow of the Shah in 1978–79](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution "Iranian Revolution") has been totalitarian—here totalitarianism was married to [Moslem fundamentalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_fundamentalism "Islamic fundamentalism"). In short, totalitarianism is the ideology of absolute power. State socialism, [communism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism "Communism"), Nazism, [fascism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism "Fascism"), and Moslem fundamentalism have been some of its recent raiments. Totalitarian governments have been its agency. The state, with its international legal sovereignty and independence, has been its base. As will be pointed out, mortacracy is the result.<sup id="cite_ref-Rummel_1994b_8-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-Rummel_1994b-8">[8]</a></sup>

## Estimates [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Democide&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Estimates")

In his estimates, [Rudolph Rummel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_Rummel "Rudolph Rummel") relied mostly on historical accounts, an approach that rarely provides accuracy compared with contemporary academic opinion. In the case of Mexican democide, Rummel wrote that while "these figures amount to little more than informed guesses", he thought "there is enough evidence to at least indict these authoritarian regimes for megamurder."<sup id="cite_ref-Mexican_Democide_9-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-Mexican_Democide-9">[9]</a></sup> According to Rummel, his research showed that the death toll from democide is far greater than the death toll from war. After studying over 8,000 reports of government-caused deaths, Rummel estimated that there have been 262 million victims of democide in the last century. According to his figures, six times as many people have died from the actions of people working for governments than have died in battle. One of his main findings was that democracies have much less democide than authoritarian regimes.<sup id="cite_ref-Harff_2017_2-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-Harff_2017-2">[2]</a></sup> Rummel argued that there is a relation between political power and democide. Political mass murder grows increasingly common as political power becomes unconstrained. At the other end of the scale, where power is diffuse, checked, and balanced, political violence is a rarity. According to Rummel, "\[t\]he more power a regime has, the more likely people will be killed. This is a major reason for promoting freedom."<sup id="cite_ref-The_Freeman_1997_10-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-The_Freeman_1997-10">[10]</a></sup> Rummel argued that "concentrated political power is the most dangerous thing on earth."<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

Rummel's estimates, especially about Communist democide, typically included a wide range and cannot be considered determinative.<sup id="cite_ref-Harff_1996_1-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-Harff_1996-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Harff_2017_2-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-Harff_2017-2">[2]</a></sup> Rummel calculated nearly 43 million deaths due to democide inside and outside the Soviet Union during Stalin's regime.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Freeman_1997_10-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-The_Freeman_1997-10">[10]</a></sup> This is much higher than an often quoted figure in the popular press of 20 million, or a 2010s scholarly figure of 9 million.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Rummel responded that the 20 million estimate is based on a figure from [Robert Conquest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Conquest "Robert Conquest")'s _[The Great Terror](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Terror_(book) "The Great Terror (book)")_ and that Conquest's qualifier "almost certainly too low" is usually forgotten. For Rummell, Conquest's calculations excluded camp deaths before 1936 and after 1950, executions (1939–1953), the forced [population transfer in the Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_transfer_in_the_Soviet_Union "Population transfer in the Soviet Union") (1939–1953), the deportation within the Soviet Union of minorities (1941–1944), and those the Soviet [Red Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army") and [Cheka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheka "Cheka") (the [secret police](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_police "Secret police")) executed throughout Eastern Europe after their conquest during the 1944–1945 period. Moreover, the [Holodomor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor "Holodomor") that killed 5 million in 1932–1934 (according to Rummel) is also not included.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> According to Rummel, forced labor, executions, and concentration camps were responsible for over one million deaths in the [Democratic People's Republic of Korea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_People%27s_Republic_of_Korea "Democratic People's Republic of Korea") from 1948 to 1987.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> After decades of research in the state archives, most scholars say that Stalin's regime killed between 6 and 9 million, which is considerably less than originally thought,<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> while Nazi Germany killed at least 11 million, which is in line with previous estimates.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>

In 1993, Rummel wrote: "Even were we to have total access to all communist archives we still would not be able to calculate precisely how many the communists murdered. Consider that even in spite of the archival statistics and detailed reports of survivors, the best experts still disagree by over 40 percent on the total [number of Jews killed by the Nazis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_toll_of_the_Holocaust "Death toll of the Holocaust").

Democide in Communist and Nationalist China, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union are characterized by Rummel as deka-megamurderers (128,168,000), while those in Cambodia, Japan, Pakistan, Poland, Turkey, Vietnam, and Yugoslavia are characterized as the lesser megamurderers (19,178,000), and cases in Mexico, North Korea, and feudal Russia are characterized as suspected megamurderers (4,145,000).<sup id="cite_ref-Rummel_1994a_18-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-Rummel_1994a-18">[18]</a></sup> Rummel wrote that "even though the Nazis hardly matched the democide of the Soviets and Communist Chinese", they "proportionally killed more".<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup>

Detailed estimates have yet to be made, but preliminarily work suggests that some 2,000,000 foreigners have been killed in cold blood by democracies."<sup id="cite_ref-Rummel_1994b_8-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-Rummel_1994b-8">[8]</a></sup>

[Foreign policy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy "Foreign policy") and [secret services](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_service "Secret service") of democratic regimes "may also carry on subversive activities in other states, support deadly [coups](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup "Coup"), and actually encourage or support rebel or military forces that are involved in democidal activities. Such was done, for example, by the American [CIA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA "CIA") in [the 1952 coup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat "1953 Iranian coup d'état") against Iran Prime Minister [Mossadeq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossadeq "Mossadeq") and [the 1973 coup against Chile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat "1973 Chilean coup d'état")'s democratically elected President [Allende](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende "Salvador Allende") by General [Pinochet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinochet "Pinochet"). Then there was the secret support given the military in [El Salvador](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvadoran_Civil_War "Salvadoran Civil War") and [Guatemala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemalan_Civil_War "Guatemalan Civil War") although they were slaughtering thousands of presumed [communist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist "Communist") supporters, and that of the [Contras](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contras "Contras") in their war against the [Sandinista](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandinista "Sandinista") government of [Nicaragua](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaraguan_Revolution "Nicaraguan Revolution") in spite of their atrocities. Particularly reprehensible was the covert support given to the Generals in Indonesia as [they murdered hundreds of thousands of communists and others](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_mass_killings_of_1965%E2%80%9366 "Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66") after [the alleged attempted communist coup in 1965](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_September_Movement "30 September Movement"), and the continued secret support given to General [Agha Mohammed Yahya Khan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agha_Mohammed_Yahya_Khan "Agha Mohammed Yahya Khan") of Pakistan even as he was involved in [murdering over a million Bengalis in East Pakistan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_genocide "1971 Bangladesh genocide") (now Bangladesh)."<sup id="cite_ref-Rummel_1994b_8-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-Rummel_1994b-8">[8]</a></sup>

According to Rummel, examples of democratic democide would include "those killed in indiscriminate or civilian targeted [city bombing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II "Strategic bombing during World War II"), as of [Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany") and [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan "Empire of Japan") in [World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"). It would include the [large scale massacres of Filipinos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine%E2%80%93American_War#American_atrocities "Philippine–American War") during the bloody [American colonization of the Philippines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Philippines_(1898%E2%80%931946) "History of the Philippines (1898–1946)") at the beginning of this century, deaths in [British concentration camps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Boer_War_concentration_camps "Second Boer War concentration camps") in [South Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa "South Africa") during the [Boer War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Boer_War "Second Boer War"), civilian deaths due to [starvation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation "Starvation") during the British [blockade of Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_Germany_(1914%E2%80%931919) "Blockade of Germany (1914–1919)") in and after World War I, the [rape and murder of helpless Chinese in and around Peking](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Rebellion "Boxer Rebellion") in 1900, the [atrocities committed by Americans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War#War_crimes_committed_by_US_forces "Vietnam War") in [Vietnam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War "Vietnam War"), the murder of helpless [Algerians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Algeria "Demographics of Algeria") during the [Algerian War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_War "Algerian War") by the [French](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France"), and the [unnatural deaths](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unnatural_death "Unnatural death") of German [prisoners of war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_of_war "Prisoners of war") in [French](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_prisoners_of_war_in_France "German prisoners of war in France") and [American POW camps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_prisoners_of_war_in_the_United_States "German prisoners of war in the United States") after World War II."<sup id="cite_ref-Rummel_1994b_8-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#cite_note-Rummel_1994b-8">[8]</a></sup>

For decades, many historians counted Stalin' s victims in 'tens of millions', which was a figure supported by Solzhenitsyn. Since the collapse of the USSR, the lower estimates of the scale of the camps have been vindicated. The arguments about excess mortality are far more complex than normally believed. R. Conquest, _The Great Terror: A Re-assessment_ (London, 1992) does not really get to grips with the new data and continues to present an exaggerated picture of the repression. The view of the 'revisionists' has been largely substantiated (J. Arch Getty & R. T. Manning (eds), _Stalinist Terror: New Perspectives_ (Cambridge, 1993)). The popular press, even _TLS_ and _The Independent_, have contained erroneous journalistic articles that should not be cited in respectable academic articles.

Retrieved 17 November 2021 – via Forum för levande historia. While Jerry Hough suggested Stalin's terror claimed tens of thousands of victims, R.J. Rummel puts the death toll of Soviet communist terror between 1917 and 1987 at 61,911,000. In both cases, these figures are based on an ideological preunderstanding and speculative and sweeping calculations. On the other hand, the considerably lower figures in terms of numbers of Gulag prisoners presented by Russian researchers during the glasnost period have been relatively widely accepted. ... It could, quite rightly, be claimed that the opinions that Rummel presents here (they are hardly an example of a serious and empirically-based writing of history) do not deserve to be mentioned in a research review, but they are still perhaps worth bringing up on the basis of the interest in him in the blogosphere.
