## What is _Fight Club_ about?

Pressure creates stress. Stress evolves into anxiety. Anxiety triggers paralysis. Paralysis causes stagnation. Stagnation gives way to yearning. Yearning begets action. Action leads to catharsis. Catharsis to relief.

And that’s the story of _Fight Club_. 

On the human level, it’s the journey from stagnation to rebirth. The journey is bonkers, of course, because exaggeration and dramatization can often capture emotions and parts of reality better than realism. But all of that is only a means to an end. It’s the “how” but not the “why”.

To understand the “why” we have to zoom out from the human level_. Fight Club_ is very concerned with American consumerism, marketing, and corporatization, and how those things strip us of our individuality and sense of identity. Through such societal influences, you’re constantly told how to behave, what to buy, how you should look, how you should think, what you should aspire to be. To the point where you can subjugate yourself, forgetting entirely what it is you want, how it is you feel, how to express your true feelings, much less recognize them. 

To take it to an extreme point: why exist if being you doesn’t matter? If you’re doing what everyone else does, buying what everyone else buys, saying what everyone else says—is there even a you? Or are you merely another statistic?

_Fight Club_ doesn’t want you to be a statistic. It wants you to be an individual who is seen, heard, felt, and acting based on your wants, hopes, needs, and dreams. You should be someone who has agency in the world and affects the world. The way in which _Fight Club_ shows this is violent, exaggerated, and kind of absurd. But we’re not supposed to recreate the movie in our day to day lives. No one should start a fight club or cause physical damage to a Blockbuster (which you can’t even do anymore) or a Starbucks or another chain. Don’t start a cult or join a cult. If you like Starbucks, you like Starbucks. Just don’t like Starbucks because you think you should. Get out there and be who you are.

## The ending of _Fight Club_ explained

### Recap

The ending of _Fight Club_ begins at 1888 Franklin St., a building belonging to one of the 11 credit companies Project Mayhem has targeted with explosives. The Narrator (aka Jack) goes there to attempt to stop the explosion. He breaks in. No alarm sounds and no one is there to stop him. Why? Because the people working security and maintenance have all joined Project Mayhem. They cleared the building specifically so no one would be hurt. 

In the basement parking garage, Jack finds the van full of nitroglycerine. Jack relies on the fact that if Tyler knows how to build a bomb then he can diffuse one. It works. But this leads to the final physical altercation between the two. It’s one-sided and pretty alarming. Tyler bashes Jack, whips him with an antenna, stomps on him, drags him by the hair, tosses him through glass, beats him with a shoe, knocks him silly, then throws Jack down some stairs. Shots of the security camera feed reveal the one-sided nature of this battle.

When The Narrator wakes up, he’s at the top floor of a different building. We’ve caught back up to where the movie opened. Tyler had asked, during the opening, “Would you like to say a few words to mark the occasion?” and Jack says “I can’t think of anything.” We witness the same question. Except this time Jack says, “I still can’t think of anything.” Prompting Tyler to respond, “Ah, flashback humor.” 

Out the giant windows, Jack notices a bus pull up. Project Mayhem devotees get off, dragging Marla Singer with them. Jack and Tyler begin their final mental fight. Tyler says there is no “you” anymore, meaning that this seems to be a tipping point for who has primary control of Jack’s body, and he refuses to go back to how things were prior to his arrival, when Jack was at the height of being a consumer-driven drone. 

Jack manages to think through the reality of the situation. “The gun isn’t even in your hand. The gun’s in my hand.” This flips a switch in the power dynamic and comes off the back of Tyler telling Jack he needed to take some responsibility. And now Jack’s realizing that it’s been “his hand” this entire time. Even when he was passively watching Tyler, it was him, Jack, doing everything. That was something he had “known” but hadn’t understood, accepted, or taken responsibility for—until now. Which is encapsulated when Tyler says, “Why would you want to put a gun to your head.” And Jack responds: “Not my head, Tyler. Our head.” 

Jack says, “Tyler, I want you to really listen to me,” a callback to his first conversation with Marla about why they like to go to support groups. He continues, “My eyes are open.” Then puts the gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger. He falls into the chair, with an exit wound out the side of his face. Tyler falls dead. Just then, the Project Mayhem crew arrive, Marla in tow. He tells the guys to leave. As they do, they admire how tough Jack is. 

Marla is initially pissed off until she sees the wound. Then she goes into support mode. Jack explains that he’s okay, meaning both physically but also, now, mentally and emotionally. He says, “Trust me, everything’s going to be fine.” Just then the buildings around them detonate and collapse. Jack takes Marla’s hand. “You met me at a very strange time in my life.” They hold hands as the skyline clears. “Where is My Mind” by the Pixies plays. A single frame of male genitalia appears. 

### Meaning

Before we get into all the deeper stuff, the thing to keep in mind is that _Fight Club_ is ultimately a coming-of-age story, except for an adult rather than a kid or a high schooler. All the crazy stuff we see is just a dramatic and artistic way of externalizing the mental gymnastics of someone maturing. Tyler likes Marla, dates her, but isn’t ready to commit. Only to realize he is. It’s the plot of a romantic comedy. Except told through a dozen other genres. _Silver Linings Playbook_ is essentially the realistic version of _Fight Club_. Funny enough, the home menu for the DVD/Blu-Ray first appears as _Never Been Kissed_, a Drew Berrymore rom-com from the same year as _Fight Club_, before glitching to the actual film.

So, with that said, let’s get into all the deeper stuff.   

One of our “How to watch a movie” key terms is mise-en-scene, which is a fancy word for everything that’s in the frame of a single shot or scene. Visual artists, from painters to photographers to filmmakers, will often carefully compose a moment in order to make sure it conveys meaning, symbolism, metaphor, etc. In movies, there’s a lot of emphasis on the first and last shots. They tend to encapsulate the main concepts. 

For example, how does _Fight Club_ open? With the camera traveling through Jack’s brain before exiting out the pores of his forehead to the gun Tyler has in Jack’s mouth. The gun that acts as a bridge between the two men. So you have a brain which represents all the mental stuff. The gun which represents all the violence. And the connection between to the two men who are really the same man. That’s the whole movie, right? 

Then how does _Fight Club_ end? With Jack and Marla holding hands and looking at an empty sky after multiple buildings exploded and collapsed. 

![[a9239e67d54a4ea6151171a329af44da_MD5]]

There’s a ton to unpack about just these two details. Let’s start with the buildings. 

**The buildings**

The buildings are the headquarters of the major credit card companies. This was Tyler Durden’s plan—if you destroy these physical locations, you destroy the debt records (this is before cloud storage existed); if you destroy the debt records, then you free people from their financial burden; if people are free from their financial burden, they feel less financial pressure; if they feel less pressure, they can actively pursue their hopes and dreams; if you can pursue your hopes and dreams, you’re being your true self. 

Remember Raymond, the cashier Tyler holds up in the back parking lot of a convenience store? Tyler makes it seem like he’s going to off Raymond. But not before asking some questions. “What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?” The answer? A veterinarian! 

The problem with becoming a vet, according to Raymond, was too much school. While he doesn’t explicitly mention money, we see Raymond’s a convenience store cashier, and learn he lives in a, quote, “sh\*tty basement apartment.” It’s safe to assume Raymond probably has some financial issues. That’s what he meant by “too much school.” Too much tuition. Too much debt. 

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ID/hqdefault.jpg)

The scene ends with Tyler threatening Raymond. If Raymond’s not on the path to becoming a vet in 6 weeks, Tyler will hunt him down. Jack chastises Tyler. Why do that? What was the point of that? 

Tyler: “Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Raymond K. Hessel’s life. His breakfast will taste better than any meal you and I have ever tasted.” 

On the surface, what Tyler’s referring to is Raymond’s joy at still being alive. After a near-death experience, still being alive is pretty wonderful. But the beauty goes beyond that. Raymond had given into his own sense of obstruction. Becoming a vet involved “too much school.” But Raymond has to pursue becoming a vet or else. Tyler’s removed the obstruction. Meaning Raymond is finally able to commit to becoming a vet—it’s literally a matter of life or death. 

Think about that in terms of the last shot.

At the start of the final shot, the buildings dominate the skyline and clog the view out the window. But once destroyed? The view opens up. Instead of seeing only the physical representation of debt, you have miles of visual freedom. Just like that, the Raymonds of the world have new hope. 

Of course, the metaphor goes further than just financial freedom. As much as _Fight Club_ is about liberation from capitalism’s influence, it’s also about our own fears and limitations and traumas and ability to act and connect and relate. So much of the film’s first half gets into those negatives and restraints. We fall prey to capitalism because of damage and hang ups. We’re looking for someone or something to direct us, to guide us, because so many feel incapable of guiding themselves. 

Jack has insomnia, so he goes to the doctor for an answer. The doctor tells him to go to testicular cancer therapy to understand pain, so he goes, hoping to find an answer. Later in the movie, Tyler tells this story (which is actually Jack’s story): “My Dad never went to college, so of course it’s real important that I go. So I graduate, I call him up long-distance and say, ‘Now what?’ He says, ‘Get a job.’ So, I’m 25, I call again and say, ‘Now what?’ He says, ‘I dunno. Get married.'”

There’s a continued motif of these guides being imperfect. Whether it’s the doctor, the support group, the counselor, your dad, your boss, your cult leader—despite their wisdom, they aren’t you. Meaning they probably don’t know what’s best for you. So the buildings also represent the many disparate influences in our lives that keep us from thinking and seeing for ourselves. 

Jack didn’t need a doctor to tell him what was wrong. If he was being honest with himself, he’d admit that his insomnia and melancholy were a byproduct of hating his life because his life was nothing more than a cookie cutter existence. The proof being that when he changes his routine by adding in the grief groups—he finds relief. Then when he destroys his apartment—he gains confidence and even some joy. 

Hopefully you can see the escalation that’s taking place. A routine change is smaller in scope than an apartment change. And an apartment change is nothing compared to a societal change. But each time Jack makes a change, he finds a little bit more catharsis, a little bit more self-actualization. And that’s really the implication of the buildings falling down. It’s literal in that Jack and millions of others now have freedom from debt. But it’s also symbolic in that Jack has cleansed himself of his past influences and routines and way of life. And is, for the first time in a long time (or maybe ever), really thinking for himself. 

This contrasts really well with the beginning of the movie. The title sequence starts in Jack’s brain. The camera spends nearly a minute rushing by as the brain flashes with activity. It’s weird, closed in, intimate. At first, you probably don’t know where you are. Then the camera pulls out from a pore in Jack’s forehead, along the barrel of a .22, then comes into focus through the weapon’s sights (a visual joke): we see Jack’s terrified face. 

Art often works through contrasts. Especially when it comes to narrative and themes. It’s not interesting if a wealthy person gets wealthier. It’s interesting if a poor person becomes wealthy, or a wealthy person becomes poor. Look at most stories, and there’s a broad juxtaposition between two states of being. 

**Start**: Luke Skywalker is your average Tatooine moisture farmer.  
**End**: Luke is a war hero and potential Jedi.

**Start**: Michael Corleone is outside the mafia business, having nothing to do with his father’s empire.  
**End**: Michael becomes the new head of the Corleone crime family.

Often, this juxtaposition is external to the character. It’s about their circumstances. Whether they’re weak or powerful, no one or someone, good or bad, boring or adventurous, innocent or experienced. 

But you can have instances that are a little more existential or thematic. Internal. Which is where _Fight Club_ goes. 

**Start**: We’re literally in the cluttered, racing mind of the character.  
**End:** We’re outside the character, with the view of an open sky.

Sure, Jack’s circumstances have changed—he’s no longer another worker bee, another drone devoid of individuality. But that’s an external byproduct to the internal transformation he’s undergone. Those falling buildings represent the clearing out of all the mental clutter that had held him back. What did we just see happen with Tyler? His head blew open then he fell down. 

Instead of the claustrophobia of being stuck within Jack’s brain—the open sky and skyline summon the energy of liberty and potential. 

And if you need a little further convincing. Remember what song is playing over that final scene? It’s by the Pixies and appropriately titled: “Where is My Mind?”

With your feet on the air and your head on the ground  
Try this trick and spin it, yeah  
Your head will collapse, and there’s nothing in it  
And you’ll ask yourself

“Where is My Mind” – Pixies

“Your head will collapse, and there’s nothing in it” seems pretty appropriate. We started in that mental clutter. We end with mental emptiness. But in a good way. In a fresh start kind of way. Go back through _Fight Club_ and there are a ton of instances of Jack overthinking or being paralyzed by indecision. Of course, Tyler is the exact opposite. Decisive. Instinctual. Always prepared with something to say and what to do. 

Getting out of your head can be necessary.

**“You met me at a very strange time in my life”**

The opening shot is Tyler with a firearm in Jack’s mouth. The gun, a symbol of violence, literally serves as the bridge between these two men. Or, rather, between Jack and the version of himself he wishes he could be—his ideal man. 

The last scene is Jack holding hands with Marla. 

**Start**: Two men connected by a gun.  
**End**: A woman and a man connected by holding hands. 

There is so much you can analyze and discuss from this juxtaposition alone. About masculinity and femininity, about the influence of masculine vs feminine, about self-hatred, the power of love, vulnerability, and on and on. It’s the stuff of academic theses and textbooks. 

For our purposes, Jack switching from a connection with Tyler to a connection with Marla only reinforces our earlier discussion about Jack being inside his own head vs being able to look outside himself. For most of the movie, Jack couldn’t have a relationship with Marla because he was so focused on Tyler. Now that he’s worked through enough of his baggage to come to terms with himself and accept himself for who he is (rather than who he wished he could be): Jack can really see Marla and be present with her. 

This brings us back to the falling buildings, about banishing your unrealistic notions of how you thought life should be and who you need to be, both good and bad. Once you accept what your life is, who you are, and all the rest—you can actually live. 

There’s the one scene where Tyler’s driving Jack and two Project Mayhem members. 

Tyler**:** F\*ck what you know. You need to forget about what you know, that’s your problem. Forget about what you think you know about life, about friendship, and especially about you and me.

Jack: What is that supposed to mean?

Tyler: \[lets go of the steering wheel and let’s the car go across the yellow line to the wrong lane\]

Jack: What are you doing?

Tyler: Guys, what would you wish you’d done before you died?

Mayhem Guy 1: Paint a self-portrait.

Mayhem Guy 2**:** Build a house.

Tyler (to Jack): You?

Jack: I don’t know. Turn the wheel now, come on!

Tyler: You have to know the answer to this question! If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?

Jack: I don’t know, I wouldn’t feel anything good about my life, is that what you want to hear me say? Fine. Come on!

The car eventually crashes, as Tyler convinces Jack to stop trying to control everything and “just let go.” Two important quotes come out of the crash.

Jack \[in voice over\]: I’d never been in a car accident. This must have been what all those people felt like before I filed them as statistics in my reports.

Tyler: We just had a near-life experience!

In the intro, I mentioned how _Fight Club_ doesn’t want you to be a statistic. Jack’s a recall coordinator. He describes his job, through an early voice over: _A new car built by my company leaves somewhere traveling at 60 mph. The rear differential locks up. The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside. Now, should we initiate a recall? Take the number of vehicles in the field, A, multiply by the probable rate of failure, B, multiply by the average out-of-court settlement, C. A times B times C equals X. If X is less than the cost of a recall, we don’t do one._

While this description goes on, the camera flashes to Jack in a garage, looking at a burnt car, as two other company men explain what happened to the car. An infant went through the windshield. A teenager’s braces fused to the back ashtray. The father’s fat burned into the driver’s seat. The other guys make jokes about the deceased. Their behavior is not only disrespectful but disgusting. 

This is _Fight Club_ defining not only how corporations view people but how people steeped in capitalism view one another. 

Since Jack was part of that world, he had stopped seeing the humanity in others. Which led to him losing his own humanity. His relationship with Tyler is a brutal reawakening of that lost sense of self. And while individuality is clearly important to what _Fight Club_‘s saying about the human condition, it’s telling that the movie doesn’t simply end with Jack, alone and triumphant, having conquered Tyler. 

Ending with Jack and Marla takes the film beyond the self. It’s not just about the individual. But about the individual’s ability to have any relationship. Whether that’s with yourself, with someone else, with your work, with nature, etc. And what it means to have a relationship with anyone. We’re not only defined by how we view ourselves, but by how others view us. 

**“My eyes are open.”**

So this refers to a couple things. First, the fact that during the change overs, Jack would essentially fall asleep and Tyler would take over and run amok. So saying “My eyes are open” is a statement about who is in control of the body.  

But it’s also a callback to the lye-on-the-hand scene. Tyler gives Jack a chemical burn. The pain is immediate and intense. Jack’s first response is to recall his guided meditation. He closes his eyes and tries to focus on trees, a forest. 

Tyler: Stay with the pain. Don’t shut this out. Look at your hand. The first soap was made from the ashes of heroes, like the first monkey shot into space. Without pain, without sacrifice, we would have nothing. \[Jack closes his eyes and tries to think about something else\]. Stop it! This is your pain. This is your burning hand. It’s right here. 

Jack: I’m going to my cave. I’m going to my cave. I’m gonna find my power animal. \[Jack pictures Marla\]. 

Tyler: No! Don’t deal with it the way those dead people do! Come on! 

Jack: I get the pointOkayPlease!

Tyler: No! What you’re feeling is premature enlightenment. 

Jack pictures Marla again. Tyler smacks him. 

Tyler: This is the greatest moment of your life, man, and you’re off somewhere missing it. 

Jack: I am not—

Tyler: Shut up. Our fathers were our models for God. If our fathers bailed, what does that tell you about God? \[He smacks Jack again\]. Listen to me. You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you, and he never wanted you. In all probability, he hates you. This is not the worst thing that can happen.

Jack: It isn’t?

Tyler \[lunging so they’re face to face\]: We don’t need him.

Jack \[desperate\]: We don’t! I agree!

Tyler: F\*\*\* damnation, man. F\*\*\* redemption. We are God’s unwanted children? So be it! Listen! You can run water over your hand to make it worse, or—look at me!—or you can use vinegar to neutralize the burn. 

Jack: PleaseLetMeHaveIt!Please!

Tyler: First you have to give up. First you have to know—not fear, know—that someday you’re gonna die. 

Jack: You don’t know how this feels!

Tyler: \[Holds up a hand with a chemical burn scar\]. It’s only after we’ve lost everything that we’re free to do anything. 

Jack finally stops fighting the burn and accepts the moment, accepts the pain. So Tyler dumps vinegar and puts out the fire. 

So that whole conversation is about being in the moment rather than distracting yourself from what’s happening. Which gets back to everything we already discussed with the fallen buildings representing the clutter and obstruction in our lives. And how Jack at the beginning of the movie was purely a consumer and had filled his world with a bunch of stuff in order to distract from the fact he was miserable and wasting away. 

That’s what consumerism is. A distraction. We consume news, gossip, social media, sports, art, games, furniture, clothes, vehicles, and on and on often because it helps us avoid very real emotions. Fears, broken hopes, the fact that we’ll die. _Fight Club_ isn’t the only movie to talk about this kind of distraction. [_American Psycho_](https://filmcolossus.com/american-psycho-explained) does it. [_White Noise_](https://filmcolossus.com/white-noise-2022-explained) does it. [_Barbie_](https://filmcolossus.com/movie-explanations/barbie-2023) did it. What’s funny is that each specifically makes a point of tying existential dread to consumer spending.

So when Jack says his eyes are open, he means that he’s fully present in the moment. He doesn’t need his cave. He doesn’t need his stuff. He doesn’t need Tyler. Tyler was the chemical burn. And now he’s neutralized. 

## The themes, message, and meaning of _Fight Club_

### The pain, self-destruction, and the beauty of life. AKA: enlightenment

_Fight Club_’s main theme is enlightenment. In the Buddhist sense of liberation through awakening. Narrative is fluid in such a way that you can take this concept and tell the story through different frames. You start with the character in some kind of physical, emotional, social, or existential imprisonment. Then have a series of events bring about a reconsideration of the world. Ultimately leading to their escape from the previous life and the beginning of a new one (that includes a newfound sense of peace). _The Truman Show_ does this. _The Matrix_, of course. [_Blade Runner_](https://filmcolossus.com/blade-runner-1982-explained). _Good Will Hunting_. 

One of the final stages of achieving enlightenment in Buddhism is nirvana. It’s become common for people to think of nirvana in the noun sense. As a state of transcendent being. But it originates as a verb. The [Sanskrit](https://www.britannica.com/topic/nirvana-religion) translates to “becoming extinguished” or “blowing out”. It refers to the act of purging yourself of the things that cause you to suffer. Meaning you’re left with only the good. Which is how we arrive at the state of bliss that Western audiences associate the word with. 

_Fight Club_’s story begins with the introduction to The Narrator’s life. All of the things weighing him down. His consumerism. His job. His inability to sleep. His lack of a social life. Or any kind of life, really. What happens next? His apartment blows up. Thus begins nirvana. A clearing out. A fall to rock bottom in order to start anew. 

Jack, through Tyler, dismantles everything, working from the outside in. His apartment. His routine. His job. His view on the world. His inability to connect. His avoidance of emotion. We even have the big speech in the middle of the movie where Tyler gives Jack the chemical burn and specifically cites suffering leading to enlightenment. 

How does _Fight Club_ end? With Jack “blowing out” Tyler’s head then the buildings blowing up. The skyline goes from being completely blocked by skyscrapers owned by credit card companies to totally open and empty and clear. To continue to put things in a Buddhist lens—credit card debt is essentially the capitalist equivalent of negative karma. By destroying the credit card records, the debt records, Project Mayhem has given everyone a fresh start in terms of karma. 

### Consumerism and capitalism versus humanism: who you are versus who you think you should be

In the previous section, we mentioned the key narrative variables of an enlightenment story being the movement from imprisonment to gaining a new perspective to liberation. One story might choose the fashion world as the setting for imprisonment. The character is obsessed with that industry, only to begin to discover there’s more to the clothes than their form, or maybe that clothes don’t matter at all (if you want to go extreme), and their liberation is leaving the fashion world behind or joining a nudist colony. 

_Fight Club_ decided to focus on American consumerism. Or, if you want to be a bit broader, capitalism at the end of the 20th century. That’s the source of imprisonment that Jack has to work through in order to attain enlightenment. 

One of the most telling examples of this is the scene where Jack describes his job and we witness him and two others overviewing a car that had exploded due to a manufacturing error and killed an entire family. Instead of treating this as a serious matter, Jack’s coworkers make jokes about the dead. They don’t care. To them, the victims are merely statistics. And as Jack tells a woman on the plane next to him, the company only issues a recall if the cost of a recall is less than the expected lawsuits. There’s a mathematical formula for it. The company has literally put a price on each human life.  

That ties in to Jack’s existence at this point in the movie. He was doing the same thing with his own life. Measuring the value based on what he owned. The coffee table, the glasses, the couch, the wardrobe, the apartment. Not who he was or what he did with his time. Only what he had. 

Jack’s supposed to be representative of the average not-so-young-adult. The late-twenty-to-eary-thirty-somethings. Most people who hit 30 have felt some form of that consumer pressure. Especially now (2023) with the advent of social media. It’s not only what we own but also the life we present to our followers. People will take pictures not because they want the picture but because they want to show off where they were and what they were doing and who they were with so others will comment or envy in silence. In the 1960s, it was having the greenest front lawn in the neighborhood. In 1999, it’s what you could afford to buy. And now, it’s what you can post. 

All of that has a dehumanizing effect. Because there’s a tension between who you are and who you think you should be. There’s a scene where Jack and Tyler board a bus and Jack sees an ad for Gucci underwear. It’s a black and white photo of an athletic man in tight, black Gucci underwear. Jack’s voiceover says: “We all started seeing things differently. Everywhere we went, we were sizing things up. I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms, trying to look like how Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.” He then says out loud to Tyler: Is that what a man looks like?”

The “we” refers to the men who have joined Fight Club. The men beating the consumerism out of one another. But it’s the line about “trying to look like how Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger said they should” that’s most relevant here. Did Jack really want the yin-yang coffee table? Probably not. Did he buy it because he thought it was something he should have? Definitely. Were there people who bought Calvin Klein because they genuinely liked the look of the clothes? Absolutely. But you know there were more who bought it simply because it was the vogue thing to do. As someone who was in high school in the early 00s, I shopped at Abercrombie & Fitch because I thought it would make me cool. Did I want to spend $60 on a polo that cut off circulation to my arms? No. But I thought I needed to. 

The message to break away from that thinking is, I think most would agree, a good one. It’s just that Tyler takes it too far. In trying to free himself and others from consumerism, he simply creates another structure that dehumanizes its members. We’re told that members of Project Mayhem don’t have names. The members go from having companies tell them who they should be and what they should do to Tyler telling them who they should be and what they should do. Which makes the Brad Pitt idealized Tyler Durden kind of a hypocrite. He didn’t necessarily want freedom for all so much as power for himself. 

When the buildings came down and the debt records cleared, was he going to retire? No. He would probably continue to grow project mayhem. Creating a new kind of dystopia. 

But that’s plot. Thematically, symbolically, “what Tyler would have done next” or “what Tyler intended to do” don’t matter. Because Tyler was only ever a means to an end—the externalization of The Narrator’s desire for change. An attempt to reclaim the ego in a world that tries to deny your sense of self. 

So on the one extreme, you have dehumanization through consumerism. On the other hand, you have pure ego. And in the middle is a nice point where you know who you are and want the same for others. Jack can, at the end, be with Marla because he’s finally in control and knows what he wants and sees Marla for who she is rather than through the lens of societal expectations. And his ego is no longer getting in the way. He isn’t the manly man with manly plans who has no time for a woman. He is, like Chloe, someone who knows their time on Earth is limited and wants to share it, meaningfully, with someone else. 

We also see this with the death of Robert Paulson. Project Mayhem’s first choice is to get rid of the body. But Jack intervenes, saying this was a man who had a name and his name was Robert Paulson. The Project Mayhem members latch onto this because Tyler had dehumanized them so much. “But, sir, members of Project Mayhem have no name.” So they idealize the notion that in death, you do. In death, you become this individual. You gain back your humanity. 

Except that’s fully possible without physically dying. It’s what we see Jack go through. The messy existential experience of rejecting the insidious influences of consumerism, destroying that idea of who brands want you to be, experiencing nirvana, in order to awaken into who you are. As flawed and imperfect as that may be. That’s okay. In being you, you transcend being a statistic.  

**Note:**

On the original DVD, there was a hidden message that followed the copyright spiel before the start of the film. The text was barely a blip, meaning you had to notice it, rewind, then pause at the right time. This is what it said: _If you are reading this then this warning is for you. Every word you read of this useless fine print is another second off your life. Don’t you have other things to do? Is your life so empty that you honestly can’t think of a better way to spend these moments? Or are you so impressed with authority that you give respect and credence to all who claim it? Do you read everything you’re supposed to read? Do you think everything you’re supposed to think? Buy what you’re told you should want? Get out of your apartment. Meet a member of the opposite sex. Stop the excessive shopping and masturbation. Quit your job. Start a fight. Prove you’re alive. If you don’t claim your humanity you will become a statistic. You have been warned… Tyler”_

For the record, I didn’t know that existed until after the first draft of this piece. I had already written the line “In being you, you transcend being a statistic.” Always nice to get little confirmations like that. Randomly came across it when checking the [IMDB trivia page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/trivia/?tab=tr&item=tr0755959). 

### Marla Singer and staying true to yourself

Marla is one of the hot-button issues when it comes to how people feel about _Fight Club_. The movie is so masculine that it magnifies the role of the lone female character. And she doesn’t have a lot of screen time. According to “expert screen timer” [Matthew Stewart](https://twitter.com/MatthewAStewart/status/1323039410854744069?lang=en), Jack is on screen 1 hour 41 minutes and 23 seconds (72.92%). Tyler is 52:45 (37.94%) and Marla is 21:20 (15.34%). 

Not only is the time on-screen limited, much of it is sleeping with or being frustrated by her relationship status with Jack/Tyler. Her character is mostly in service to Jack rather than standing on her own. 

That can definitely be frustrating. And leans into notions of toxic masculinity and the ornamentation of women in narrative. 

But Marla is a very important part of _Fight Club_. Especially when you keep in mind that what’s happening in the movie is more symbolic about the journey toward enlightenment. And that comes through in the last shot. It’s not Jack looking out on the buildings falling. It’s Jack and Marla. If you reduce that to simply “she’s just a prize” then it’s certainly not inspiring. But Marla’s not just a prize. She’s a necessary part of the enlightenment Jack reaches, as she represents the bringing together of the masculine and the feminine. 

Remember the yin-yang table from The Narrator’s apartment? Here’s what the [Encyclopaedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/yinyang) says about yin and yang: _the two complementary forces that make up all aspects and phenomena of life. Yin is a symbol of earth, femaleness, darkness, passivity, and absorption. It is present in even numbers, in valleys and streams, and is represented by the tiger, the colour orange, and a broken line. Yang is conceived of as heaven, maleness, light, activity, and penetration. It is present in odd numbers, in mountains, and is represented by the dragon, the colour azure, and an unbroken line. The two are both said to proceed from the Great Ultimate, their interplay on one another (as one increases the other decreases) being a description of the actual process of the universe and all that is in it. In harmony, the two are depicted as the light and dark halves of a circle._

Yin and yang aren’t supposed to be thought of as oppositional or exclusive components. Note the words “complementary forces”. Yin and yang are co-dependent. Entwined. When out of balance, things become incongruous, discordant. With balance comes harmony. 

Look at Jack’s life when he’s neither truly masculine or feminine but a consumer, a statistic. Then look at his life when he’s ruled totally by Tyler’s masculine ego: madness, chaos, violence, anarchy. When Jack first started feeling some sense of balance in his life was when he was at the support groups. Why? Because they made him access parts of himself he had been denying. All of that yin. Until Marla showed up. 

The problem with Marla wasn’t that she was a she. There were other women in many of the support groups Jack attended. The problem was Marla wasn’t pretending like The Narrator was. 

Jack says: “This chick, Marla Singer, did not have testicular cancer. She was a liar. She had no diseases at all. I had seen her at Free and Clear, my blood parasites group Thursdays. Then at Hope, my bimonthly sickle-cell circle. And again at Seize the Day, my tuberculosis Friday night. Marla, the big tourist. Her lie reflected my lie, and suddenly, I felt nothing. I couldn’t cry. So once again—I couldn’t sleep.”

There’s even a shot of Jack watching her walk down the street and when he looks away Tyler flashes in her place. 

What’s that mean?

The support groups are microcosms. These little pocket worlds where Jack’s able to be someone other than who he had become. While he felt empty in his normal life. He felt seen and heard and like _someone_ when he was Cornelius and crying against Bob’s chest. He used a different name for every group. This dissociation empowered him. It was a mini-form of self-destruction that made his regular life less empty. 

Except Marla exposed his lie. She was herself no matter the microcosm. Nothing about her changed. Her name. Her behavior. She would attend lung cancer groups and smoke. She was authentically Marla. Why that mattered was that she was in scenarios where the expectation would be to conform. Like The Narrator had. He gladly pretended in order to fit in. Marla didn’t pretend, even if that meant not fitting in.

In this way, she’s an important part of the creation of the Brad Pitt version of Tyler Durden. Which is why we have that scene where Tyler flashes onto the screen where Marla had been. Jack wants to be himself. Needs to be himself. Except he doesn’t know how. So creates his version of Marla in order to try and be on her level. 

Marla is arguably the soul of the film. And we see how her deepening relationship with Jack helps her as well. There seems to be a shift from truly nihilistic to taking better care of herself because she has this other person in her life, even if it’s a very toxic relationship. The point isn’t the literal issues of the relationship rather what those issues represent—two people who care about one another but had baggage to work through before they could actually commit to a relationship. 

When Jack and Marla finally hold hands, it represents an achievement of balance. Of not only harmonizing the masculine with the feminine but achieving an equilibrium between the banality of being a cog in society and the wreckage that comes with not caring at all. There’s a way to be yourself and still enjoy shopping at a mall or driving a nice car. As long as you’re being true to yourself, you can own things and not be beholden to them. 

There’s an irony, then, to Tyler’s line in the middle of the film. “We are a generation of men raised by women. I’m beginning to wonder if another woman is what we really need?” It’s said at a time when Tyler’s at his most thoughtful and seductive, when Jack and so many others find Tyler’s words empowering and alluring. Except, by the end, we know how flawed Tyler’s outlook was. How hypocritical. We see what happens when the men are left to their own devices and the machismo boils up and over. The answer to Tyler’s question becomes a resounding: yes. If you deny the feminine, you deny a crucial part of yourself. 

## Why is the movie called _Fight Club_?

Let’s get the obvious out of the way: the title is directly from the Chuck Palahniuk novel the film adapts. 

A little more detail about the origin of _Fight Club_ comes from a _Guardian_ [article by Stuart Jeffries](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/may/12/fiction.chuckpalahniuk) that came out May of 2000: _The spark for Chuck Palahniuk’s novel,_ Fight Club_, came when the author got beaten up on holiday. “The other people who were camping near us wanted to drink and party all night long, and I tried to get them to shut up one night, and they literally beat the crap out of me. I went back to work just so bashed, and horrible looking. People didn’t ask me what had happened. I think they were afraid of the answer. I realized that if you looked bad enough, people would not want to know what you did in your spare time. They don’t want to know the bad things about you. And the key was to look so bad that no one would ever, ever ask. And that was the idea behind_ Fight Club_._” 

_Inspired by the camping trip, Palahniuk got into more fights. “I discovered that I’d never been in fights, and went, wow, that was sort of fun. That was a great release, and yeah, it hurts a little bit, but I lived through it. And it made me really curious about what I was capable of. And after that, if the opportunity arose, I didn’t hesitate to get in a fight. So through the writing of the book, there was a period where I was in fights pretty regularly. My friends never wanted to go out with me, because I was always looking._  

So fighting was a huge part of why the novel exists in the first place. And a huge part of the novel. It makes sense to use it in some capacity. 

In the novel and movie, the initial version of Project Mayhem is called Fight Club. It’s through Fight Club that Jack and the others first wake up from their consumer-driven identities. They start to reclaim some sense of their own inherent masculinity and identity that society had forced them to abandon. 

From a [_Salon_ article](https://www.salon.com/1999/11/24/faludi_4/) by Diana Abu-Jaber (published in 1999) that detailed the influence of Susan Faludi’s book _Stiffed_ on _Fight Club_: _Palahniuk said that_ Stiffed _had had an immediate, almost visceral importance in his own life. “I read it in one weekend,” he said enthusiastically, indicating that her depiction of modern male-ienation was right on target. Recently, the_ Fight Club _author had himself become a poster child for Faludi’s argument. Her observations on the male condition—that ratings, rankings and salaries have become the main measure of success for me, that men have become just as victimized by consumerism as women_ \[I believe this refers to the image-issues created by unrealistic beauty standards\]_, and that our society is imprisoned by the notion that victory is everything—all zinged home for Palahniuk._ 

So the idea of the Fight Club isn’t simply about the notion of violence but about what violence represents to men emasculated via consumerism and the struggle to regain some understanding of the self through something as primal and physical as combat. 

And then there’s the whole “The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club. The second rule of Fight Club is. You do not talk about Fight Club.” I doubt the irony was lost on Palahniuk or Fincher. Calling the thing _Fight Club_ despite the line “You do not talk about Fight Club.” It’s a transgressive act. Right up front, a denial of Tyler Durden’s rule. A rejection of it. 

So the title embodies these multiple energies. The whole strange social dynamics of fighting and people not wanting to know what happened. The state of masculinity at the end of the 20th century. And pushing back against the subjective expectations authority figures demand of us. 

## Important motifs in _Fight Club_

### Soap

Tyler talks about soap: _As the fat renders, the tallows float to the surface. Like in Boy Scouts. Once the tallow hardens, we skim off a layer of glycerin. If you were to add nitric acid, you got nitroglycerin. If you were then to add sodium nitrate and a dash of sawdust, you got dynamite. Yeah, with enough soap, one could blow up just about anything. Now, ancient peoples found that clothes got cleaner when they washed them at a certain point in the river. ‘Cause human sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river. Bodies burned. Water seeped through the wood and ashes to create lye. This is lye. The crucial ingredient. Once it mixed with the melted fat of the bodies, a thick, white, soapy discharge crept into the river. … The first soap was made from the ashes of heroes, like the first monkey shot into space. Without pain, without sacrifice, we would have nothing._ 

Soap gains this strange duality. It’s an agent of destruction. But also an agent of purification. It can blow up an apartment but also clean away the dirt and grime that coats someone. This fits the film’s character journey of self-destruction leading to a purification that allows for new beginnings. Jack’s blown up apartment was a sacrifice. Fight Club was the lye. And Tyler’s the soap. Through the pain and sacrifice of losing everything, Jack regains his sense of self and reclaims his future from the clutches of consumerism. 

### I am Jack’s complete lack of surprise

So Edward Norton is Tyler Durden. Except for most of the movie he’s not. Brad Pitt is Tyler Durden. So if you tried to refer to Edward Norton’s character as Tyler, it creates confusion. Early on, people started calling The Narrator “Jack” in reference to the stack of journals that The Narrator claims belonged to the previous tenant. 

_Listen to this. It’s an article written by an organ in the first-person. “I am Jack’s medulla oblongata. Without me, Jack could not regulate his heart rate, blood pressure or breathing.” There’s a whole series of these. “I am Jill’s nipples.” “I am Jack’s colon.”_ Tyler jumps in: _Yeah, I get cancer. I kill Jack_. 

Given that The Narrator had been the one occupying that house, using it as the home of the Paper Street Soap company, there’s an argument that he was the one who wrote the articles. Especially because The Narrator uses the lingo at other parts of the story. When he goes to “fight” his boss, the boss begins the conversation by listing off the reasons The Narrator’s up for review, on the brink of being fired. How does he respond? “I am Jack’s complete lack of surprise.” Which confuses the hell out of the boss. A few beats later,  before the Narrator throws the first punch to his own face, he says, via voice-over, “I am Jack’s smirking revenge.” 

So fans started calling The Narrator “Jack”. 

As to the origin of the journals, they do seem to dovetail with all the support groups Jack had attended. All of them were body-related afflictions. He wasn’t attending Alcoholics Anonymous or grieving widowers, but groups for people who had blood parasites, lung cancer, testicular cancer, etc. And it does fit with the Brad Pitt version of Tyler being this manifestation of Jack’s brain. The organs speaking as if they have their own personality isn’t too far off from what Brad Pitt is. 

## Questions & answers about _Fight Club_

### Are the events of _Fight Club_ all in Jack’s head?

No. Everything we see happen happened. It’s just Jack disassociates. Meaning that sometimes he “watches” Tyler do something instead of thinking he was the one doing it. But it’s not a “it was all the character’s head” movie. He really does build a cult. He really does sometimes beat himself up. He often “blacks out” and doesn’t remember what he did for the hours or days he wasn’t in control. 

### Why does Tyler flash on screen?

My theory is that he flashes on screen at crucial moments that lead to the creation of the Brad Pitt version of Tyler. 

The first flash is in the office, when talking about insomnia. During the line, “Everything’s a copy of a copy of a copy.” 

The second flash is behind the doctor who chastises Jack for saying “I’m in pain.” The doctor’s response: “You wanna see pain? Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights. See the guys with testicular cancer. That’s pain.” 

Third is at the testicular cancer meeting. The group leader thanks Thomas for sharing then says, “I look around this room, and I see a lot of courage, and that gives me strength. We give each other strength. It’s time for the one-on-ones. So let’s all follow Thomas’s good example, and really open ourselves up.” That’s when Tyler flashes. 

And last is after the introduction to Marla. That brief montage of how she interrupts all of his sessions. He walks out of the building, looking for her, but she’s off down the street. When he turns from looking at her, Tyler flashes right over top of Marla. 

To be clear, Jack had already been “Tyler”. He mentioned to the doctor about having narcolepsy, suddenly falling asleep but waking up in weird places. But I would contend that at that point the alter ego didn’t have a defined personality. But Jack knew he didn’t want to be like everyone else, not a copy of a copy. Then he admired the way the doctor chastised him (like a father would), the way the group leader inspired people, and the way Marla was completely Marla. Those things all amalgamated into Tyler Durden. 

By having Tyler literally flash on screen, it clues us in that those are key moments that we should pay attention to. 

### What mental illness is depicted in Fight Club? Is Tyler schizophrenic?

It’s not a grounded movie where there’s some literal and realistic mental illness. People like to say he has Dissociative Identity Disorder. As formal as that sounds, if you look into the formal medical discussion of DID, it’s pretty up in the air. It ranges from people having distinct personalities like in _Fight Club_ (or [_Primal Fear_](https://filmcolossus.com/primal-fear-explained-2/)) to something caused by certain therapy techniques to completely made up. 

While schizophrenia does involve hallucinations in the form of hearing voices and delusions, what happens in _Fight Club_ is not a portrayal of someone with the disorder.
