He is considered by critics and writers to be one of the most influential authors of the 20th century.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

## Biography\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marcel_Proust&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Biography")\]

Proust was born on 10 July 1871 at the home of his great-uncle in the Paris Borough of [Auteuil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auteuil,_Paris "Auteuil, Paris") (the south-western sector of the then-rustic [16th arrondissement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_arrondissement_of_Paris "16th arrondissement of Paris")), two months after the [Treaty of Frankfurt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Frankfurt_(1871) "Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)") formally ended the [Franco-Prussian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War "Franco-Prussian War"). His birth took place at the very beginning of the [French Third Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Third_Republic "French Third Republic"),<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> during the violence that surrounded the suppression of the [Paris Commune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Commune "Paris Commune"), and his childhood corresponded with the consolidation of the Republic. Much of _[In Search of Lost Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time "In Search of Lost Time")_ concerns the vast changes, most particularly the decline of the aristocracy and the rise of the middle classes, that occurred in France during the _[fin de siècle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin_de_si%C3%A8cle "Fin de siècle")._

Proust's father, [Adrien Proust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrien_Proust "Adrien Proust"), was a prominent French [pathologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathologist "Pathologist") and [epidemiologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology "Epidemiology"), studying [cholera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera "Cholera") in Europe and Asia. He wrote numerous articles and books on medicine and hygiene. Proust's mother, Jeanne Clémence (maiden name: Weil), was the daughter of a wealthy [German–Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Germany "History of the Jews in Germany") family from [Alsace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsace "Alsace").<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> Literate and well-read, she demonstrated a well-developed sense of humour in her letters, and her command of the [English language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language") was sufficient to help with her son's translations of [John Ruskin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ruskin "John Ruskin").<sup id="cite_ref-Tadié_6-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-Tadi%C3%A9-6">[6]</a></sup> Proust was raised in his father's [Catholic faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism "Catholicism").<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> He was baptized on 5 August 1871 at the [Church of Saint-Louis-d'Antin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Louis-d%27Antin "Saint-Louis-d'Antin") and later confirmed as a Catholic, but he never formally practised that faith. He later became an [atheist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism "Atheism") and was something of a [mystic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism "Mysticism").<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

By the age of nine, Proust had had his first serious [asthma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma "Asthma") attack, and thereafter he was considered a sickly child. Proust spent long holidays in the village of [Illiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illiers-Combray "Illiers-Combray"). This village, combined with recollections of his great-uncle's house in Auteuil, became the model for the fictional town of Combray, where some of the most important scenes of _[In Search of Lost Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time "In Search of Lost Time")_ take place. (Illiers was renamed Illiers-Combray in 1971 on the occasion of the Proust centenary celebrations.)

In 1882, at the age of eleven, Proust became a pupil at the [Lycée Condorcet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Condorcet "Lycée Condorcet"); however, his education was disrupted by his illness. Despite this, he excelled in literature, receiving an award in his final year. Thanks to his classmates, he was able to gain access to some of the salons of the upper [bourgeoisie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie "Bourgeoisie"), providing him with copious material for _In Search of Lost Time_.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

Marcel Proust (seated), [Robert de Flers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_de_Flers "Robert de Flers") (left), and [Lucien Daudet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucien_Daudet "Lucien Daudet") (right), c. 1894

In spite of his poor health, Proust served a year (1889–90) in the French army, stationed at Coligny Barracks in [Orléans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orl%C3%A9ans "Orléans"), an experience that provided a lengthy episode in _[The Guermantes' Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guermantes%27_Way "The Guermantes' Way")_, part three of his novel. As a young man, Proust was a [dilettante](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur "Amateur") and a [social climber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_climber "Social climber") whose aspirations as a writer were hampered by his lack of self-discipline. His reputation from this period, as a snob and an amateur, contributed to his later troubles with getting _[Swann's Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swann%27s_Way "Swann's Way")_, the first part of his large-scale novel, published in 1913. At this time, he attended the _salons_ of [Mme Straus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genevi%C3%A8ve_Hal%C3%A9vy "Geneviève Halévy"), widow of [Georges Bizet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Bizet "Georges Bizet") and mother of Proust's childhood friend Jacques Bizet, of [Madeleine Lemaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_Lemaire "Madeleine Lemaire") and of [Mme Arman de Caillavet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9ontine_Lippmann "Léontine Lippmann"), one of the models for Madame Verdurin, and mother of his friend [Gaston Arman de Caillavet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_Arman_de_Caillavet "Gaston Arman de Caillavet"), with whose fiancée (Jeanne Pouquet) he was in love. It is through Mme Arman de Caillavet, he made the acquaintance of [Anatole France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatole_France "Anatole France"), her lover.

Proust had a close relationship with his mother. To appease his father, who insisted that he pursue a career, Proust obtained a volunteer position at [Bibliothèque Mazarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblioth%C3%A8que_Mazarine "Bibliothèque Mazarine") in the summer of 1896. After exerting considerable effort, he obtained a sick leave that extended for several years until he was considered to have resigned. He never worked at his job, and he did not move from his parents' apartment until after both were dead.<sup id="cite_ref-Tadié_6-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-Tadi%C3%A9-6">[6]</a></sup>

His life and family circle changed markedly between 1900 and 1905. In February 1903, Proust's brother, [Robert Proust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Proust "Robert Proust"), married and left the family home. His father died in November of the same year.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> Finally, and most crushingly, Proust's beloved mother died in September 1905. She left him a considerable inheritance. His health throughout this period continued to deteriorate.

Proust spent the last three years of his life mostly confined to his bedroom of his apartment 44 rue Hamelin<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> (in [Chaillot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaillot "Chaillot")), sleeping during the day and working at night to complete his novel.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> He died of [pneumonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia "Pneumonia") and a [pulmonary abscess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_abscess "Lung abscess") in 1922. He was buried in the [Père Lachaise Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A8re_Lachaise_Cemetery "Père Lachaise Cemetery") in Paris.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

### Personal life\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marcel_Proust&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Personal life")\]

Proust is known to have been [homosexual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality "Homosexuality"); his sexuality and [relationships with men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_relationship "Same-sex relationship") are often discussed by his biographers.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> Although his housekeeper, [Céleste Albaret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9leste_Albaret "Céleste Albaret"), denies this aspect of Proust's sexuality in her memoirs,<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> her denial runs contrary to the statements of many of Proust's friends and contemporaries, including his fellow writer [André Gide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Gide "André Gide")<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> as well as his [valet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valet "Valet") Ernest A. Forssgren.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>

Proust never openly disclosed his homosexuality, though his family and close friends either knew or suspected it. In 1897, he even fought a duel with writer [Jean Lorrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Lorrain#Duel "Jean Lorrain"), who publicly questioned the nature of Proust's relationship with his (Proust's) lover<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> [Lucien Daudet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucien_Daudet "Lucien Daudet") (both duellists survived).<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> Despite Proust's own public denial, his romantic relationship with composer [Reynaldo Hahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynaldo_Hahn#Jean_Santeuil "Reynaldo Hahn"),<sup id="cite_ref-carter_22-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-carter-22">[22]</a></sup> and his infatuation with his chauffeur and secretary, Alfred Agostinelli, are well documented.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> On the night of 11 January 1918, Proust was one of the men identified by police in a raid on a [male](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_prostitution "Male prostitution") [brothel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothel "Brothel") run by Albert Le Cuziat.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> Proust's friend, the poet [Paul Morand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Morand "Paul Morand"), openly teased Proust about his visits to [male prostitutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_prostitution "Male prostitution"). In his journal, Morand refers to Proust, as well as Gide, as "constantly hunting, never satiated by their adventures ... eternal prowlers, tireless sexual adventurers."<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup>

The exact influence of Proust's sexuality on his writing is a topic of debate.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> However, _In Search of Lost Time_ discusses homosexuality at length and features several principal characters, both men and women, who are either homosexual or [bisexual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexuality "Bisexuality"): the [Baron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron "Baron") de Charlus, Robert de Saint-Loup, Odette de Crécy, and Albertine Simonet.<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> Homosexuality also appears as a theme in _[Les plaisirs et les jours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_plaisirs_et_les_jours "Les plaisirs et les jours")_ and his unfinished novel, _[Jean Santeuil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Santeuil "Jean Santeuil")_.

Proust inherited much of his mother's political outlook, which was supportive of the [French Third Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Third_Republic "French Third Republic") and near the [liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism "Classical liberalism") [centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism "Centrism") of French politics.<sup id="cite_ref-Hughes_28-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-Hughes-28">[28]</a></sup> In an 1892 article published in _Le Banquet_ entitled "L'Irréligion d'État", Proust condemned extreme [anti-clerical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-clericalism "Anti-clericalism") measures such as the expulsion of monks, observing that "one might just be surprised that the negation of religion should bring in its wake the same [fanaticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanaticism "Fanaticism"), intolerance, and persecution as religion itself."<sup id="cite_ref-Hughes_28-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-Hughes-28">[28]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> He argued that [socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism "Socialism") posed a greater threat to society than the Church.<sup id="cite_ref-Hughes_28-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-Hughes-28">[28]</a></sup> He was equally critical of the right, lambasting "the insanity of the conservatives," whom he deemed "as dumb and ungrateful as under [Charles X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_X_of_France "Charles X of France")," and referring to [Pope Pius X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_X "Pope Pius X")'s obstinacy as foolish.<sup id="cite_ref-Watson_30-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-Watson-30">[30]</a></sup> Proust always rejected the bigoted and illiberal views harbored by many priests at the time, but believed that the most enlightened clerics could be just as progressive as the most enlightened secularists, and that both could serve the cause of "the advanced liberal Republic".<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> He approved of the more moderate stance taken in 1906 by [Aristide Briand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristide_Briand "Aristide Briand"), whom he described as "admirable".<sup id="cite_ref-Watson_30-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-Watson-30">[30]</a></sup>

Proust was among the earliest [Dreyfusards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_Affair "Dreyfus Affair"), even attending [Émile Zola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Zola "Émile Zola")'s trial and proudly claiming to have been the one who asked [Anatole France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatole_France "Anatole France") to sign the petition in support of [Alfred Dreyfus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Dreyfus "Alfred Dreyfus")'s innocence.<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> In 1919, when representatives of the right-wing [Action Française](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Fran%C3%A7aise "Action Française") published a manifesto upholding [French colonialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_colonialism "French colonialism") and the [Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church") as the embodiment of civilised values, Proust rejected their nationalistic and chauvinistic views in favor of a [liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism "Classical liberalism") [pluralist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralism_(political_philosophy) "Pluralism (political philosophy)") vision which acknowledged [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_France "Christianity in France")'s [cultural legacy in France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_France "Culture of France").<sup id="cite_ref-Hughes_28-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-Hughes-28">[28]</a></sup> [Julien Benda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien_Benda "Julien Benda") commended Proust in _La Trahison des clercs_ as a writer who distinguished himself from his generation by avoiding the twin traps of nationalism and class sectarianism.<sup id="cite_ref-Hughes_28-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-Hughes-28">[28]</a></sup>

Proust was considered a [hypochondriac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypochondriasis "Hypochondriasis") by his doctors. His correspondence provides some clues on his symptoms.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="The text near this tag may need clarification or removal of jargon. (January 2024)">clarification needed</span></a></i>]</sup> According to [J. Yellowlees Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Yellowlees_Douglas "J. Yellowlees Douglas"), Proust suffered from the [vascular subtype of Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehlers%E2%80%93Danlos_syndromes#Vascular_EDS "Ehlers–Danlos syndromes").<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup>

## Early writing\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marcel_Proust&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Early writing")\]

Proust was involved in writing and publishing from an early age. In addition to the literary magazines with which he was associated, and in which he published while at school (_La Revue verte_ and _La Revue lilas_), from 1890 to 1891 he published a regular society column in the journal _Le Mensuel_.<sup id="cite_ref-Tadié_6-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-Tadi%C3%A9-6">[6]</a></sup> In 1892, he was involved in founding a literary review called _Le Banquet_ (also the French title of [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato")'s _[Symposium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium_(Plato) "Symposium (Plato)")_), and throughout the next several years Proust published small pieces regularly in this journal and in the prestigious _[La Revue Blanche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Revue_Blanche "La Revue Blanche")_.

In 1896 _[Les plaisirs et les jours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_plaisirs_et_les_jours "Les plaisirs et les jours")_, a compendium of many of these early pieces, was published. The book included a foreword by [Anatole France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatole_France "Anatole France"), drawings by Mme [Lemaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_Lemaire "Madeleine Lemaire") in whose _salon_ Proust was a frequent guest, and who inspired Proust's Mme Verdurin. She invited him and [Reynaldo Hahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynaldo_Hahn "Reynaldo Hahn") to her [château de Réveillon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9veillon,_Marne "Réveillon, Marne") (the model for Mme Verdurin's La Raspelière) in summer 1894, and for three weeks in 1895. This book was so sumptuously produced that it cost twice the normal price of a book its size.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (January 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

That year Proust also began working on a novel, which was eventually published in 1952 and titled _[Jean Santeuil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Santeuil "Jean Santeuil")_ by his posthumous editors. Many of the themes later developed in _In Search of Lost Time_ find their first articulation in this unfinished work, including the enigma of memory and the necessity of reflection; several sections of _In Search of Lost Time_ can be read in the first draft in _Jean Santeuil_. The portrait of the parents in _Jean Santeuil_ is quite harsh, in marked contrast to the adoration with which the parents are painted in Proust's masterpiece. Following the poor reception of _Les Plaisirs et les Jours_, and internal troubles with resolving the plot, Proust gradually abandoned _Jean Santeuil_ in 1897 and stopped work on it entirely by 1899.

Beginning in 1895 Proust spent several years reading [Thomas Carlyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Carlyle "Thomas Carlyle"), [Ralph Waldo Emerson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson "Ralph Waldo Emerson"), and [John Ruskin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ruskin "John Ruskin"). Through this reading, he refined his theories of [art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art "Art") and the role of the artist in society. Also, in _[Time Regained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Temps_retrouv%C3%A9 "Le Temps retrouvé")_ Proust's universal protagonist recalls having translated Ruskin's _Sesame and Lilies_. The artist's responsibility is to confront the appearance of nature, deduce its essence and retell or explain that essence in the work of art. Ruskin's view of artistic production was central to this conception, and Ruskin's work was so important to Proust that he claimed to know "by heart" several of Ruskin's books, including _[The Seven Lamps of Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Lamps_of_Architecture "The Seven Lamps of Architecture")_, _The Bible of Amiens_, and _Praeterita_.<sup id="cite_ref-Tadié_6-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-Tadi%C3%A9-6">[6]</a></sup>

Proust set out to translate two of Ruskin's works into French, but was hampered by an imperfect command of English. To compensate for this he made his translations a group affair: sketched out by his mother, the drafts were first revised by Proust, then by Marie Nordlinger, the English cousin of his friend and sometime lover<sup id="cite_ref-carter_22-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-carter-22">[22]</a></sup> [Reynaldo Hahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynaldo_Hahn "Reynaldo Hahn"), then finally polished by Proust. Questioned about his method by an editor, Proust responded, "I don't claim to know English; I claim to know Ruskin".<sup id="cite_ref-Tadié_6-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-Tadi%C3%A9-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> _The Bible of Amiens_, with Proust's extended introduction, was published in French in 1904. Both the translation and the introduction were well-reviewed; [Henri Bergson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Bergson "Henri Bergson") called Proust's introduction "an important contribution to the psychology of Ruskin", and had similar praise for the translation.<sup id="cite_ref-Tadié_6-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-Tadi%C3%A9-6">[6]</a></sup> At the time of this publication, Proust was already translating Ruskin's _Sesame and Lilies_, which he completed in June 1905, just before his mother's death, and published in 1906. Literary historians and critics have ascertained that, apart from Ruskin, Proust's chief literary influences included [Saint-Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Rouvroy,_duc_de_Saint-Simon "Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon"), [Montaigne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_de_Montaigne "Michel de Montaigne"), [Stendhal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stendhal "Stendhal"), [Flaubert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Flaubert "Gustave Flaubert"), [George Eliot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Eliot "George Eliot"), [Fyodor Dostoyevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoyevsky "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"), and [Leo Tolstoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy "Leo Tolstoy").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

In Proust’s 1904 article "La mort des cathédrales" (The Death of Cathedrals) published in _[Le Figaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Figaro "Le Figaro")_, Proust called [Gothic cathedrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_cathedrals_and_churches "Gothic cathedrals and churches") “probably the highest, and unquestionably the most original expression of French genius”.<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup>

1908 was an important year for Proust's development as a writer. During the first part of the year he published in various journals [pastiches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastiches "Pastiches") of other writers. These exercises in imitation may have allowed Proust to solidify his own style. In addition, in the spring and summer of the year Proust began work on several different fragments of writing that would later coalesce under the working title of _[Contre Sainte-Beuve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contre_Sainte-Beuve "Contre Sainte-Beuve")_. Proust described his efforts in a letter to a friend: "I have in progress: a study on the nobility, a Parisian novel, an essay on [Sainte-Beuve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Augustin_Sainte-Beuve "Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve") and [Flaubert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Flaubert "Gustave Flaubert"), an essay on women, an essay on [pederasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pederasty "Pederasty") (not easy to publish), a study on stained-glass windows, a study on tombstones, a study on the novel".<sup id="cite_ref-Tadié_6-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-Tadi%C3%A9-6">[6]</a></sup>

From these disparate fragments Proust began to shape a novel on which he worked continually during this period. The rough outline of the work centred on a [first-person narrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_narrative "First-person narrative"), unable to sleep, who during the night remembers waiting as a child for his mother to come to him in the morning. The novel was to have ended with a critical examination of Sainte-Beuve and a refutation of his theory that biography was the most important tool for understanding an artist's work. Present in the unfinished manuscript notebooks are many elements that correspond to parts of the _Recherche_, in particular, to the "Combray" and "Swann in Love" sections of Volume 1, and to the final section of Volume 7. Trouble with finding a publisher, as well as a gradually changing conception of his novel, led Proust to shift work to a substantially different project that still contained many of the same themes and elements. By 1910 he was at work on _À la recherche du temps perdu_.

## _In Search of Lost Time_\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marcel_Proust&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: In Search of Lost Time")\]

Begun in 1909, when Proust was 38 years old, _À la recherche du temps perdu_ consists of seven volumes totaling around 3,200 pages (about 4,300 in [The Modern Library's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Library "Modern Library") translation) and featuring more than 2,000 characters. [Graham Greene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Greene "Graham Greene") called Proust the "greatest novelist of the twentieth century, just as [Tolstoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy "Leo Tolstoy") was of the nineteenth"<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> and [W. Somerset Maugham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Somerset_Maugham "W. Somerset Maugham") called the novel the "greatest fiction to date".<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> [André Gide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Gide "André Gide") was initially not so taken with his work. The first volume was refused by the publisher Gallimard on Gide's advice. He later wrote to Proust apologizing for his part in the refusal and calling it one of the most serious mistakes of his life.<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup> Finally, the book was published at the author's expense by [Grasset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89ditions_Grasset "Éditions Grasset") and Proust paid critics to speak favorably about it.<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup>

Proust died before he was able to complete his revision of the drafts and proofs of the final volumes, the last three of which were published posthumously and edited by his brother [Robert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Proust "Robert Proust"). The book was translated into English by [C. K. Scott Moncrieff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._K._Scott_Moncrieff "C. K. Scott Moncrieff"), appearing under the title _Remembrance of Things Past_ between 1922 and 1931. Scott Moncrieff translated volumes one through six of the seven volumes, dying before completing the last. This last volume was rendered by other translators at different times. When Scott Moncrieff's translation was later revised (first by [Terence Kilmartin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Kilmartin "Terence Kilmartin"), then by [D. J. Enright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._J._Enright "D. J. Enright")) the title of the novel was changed to the more literal _In Search of Lost Time_.

In 1995, Penguin undertook a fresh translation of the book by editor Christopher Prendergast and seven translators in three countries, based on the latest, most complete and authoritative French text. Its six volumes, comprising Proust's seven, were published in Britain under the [Allen Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Lane "Allen Lane") imprint in 2002.
