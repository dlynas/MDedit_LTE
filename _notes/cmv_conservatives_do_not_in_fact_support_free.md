## CMV: Conservatives do not, in fact, support "free speech" any more than liberals do.

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17llow9/cmv_conservatives_do_not_in_fact_support_free/](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17llow9/cmv_conservatives_do_not_in_fact_support_free/)

> In the past few years (or decades,) conservatives have often touted themselves as the party of free speech, portraying liberals as the party of political correctness, the side that does cancel-culture, the side that cannot tolerate facts that offend their feelings, liberal college administrations penalizing conservative faculty and students, etc.
> 
> Now, as a somewhat libertarian-person, I definitely see progressives being indeed guilty of that behavior as accused. Leftists aren't exactly accommodating of free expression. The problem is, I don't see conservatives being any better either.
> 
> Conservatives have been the ones banning books from libraries. We all know conservative parents (especially religious ones) who cannot tolerate their kids having different opinions. Conservative subs on Reddit are just as prone to banning someone for having opposing views as liberal ones.  Conservatives were the ones who got outraged about athletes kneeling during the national anthem, as if that gesture weren't quintessential free speech. When Elon Musk took over Twitter, he promptly banned many users who disagreed with him. Conservatives have been trying to pass "don't say gay" and "stop woke" legislation in Florida and elsewhere (and also anti-BDS legislation in Texas to penalize those who oppose Israel). For every anecdote about a liberal teacher giving a conservative student a bad grade for being conservative, you can find an equal example on the reverse side. Trump supporters are hardly tolerant of anti-Trump opinions in their midst.

		Schools already limit content allowed in them. My local school librarian “banned” the Martian because it said fuck too many times. The school is also “banned” from showing PG-13 movies. Obviously if the school enforces its policy unevenly it’s an issue, but schools already prohibit content and it isn’t considered a violation of free speech. Public libraries and universities are different from k-12 libraries.

				Problem is conservatives are driving hard to have such knowledge reframed as inappropriate for minors because it's "pornographic".

					They tried to ban a set of books because the author's last name was Gay, so no deep thought is being taken in this course of action, just a book search for a keyword. Also they wanted to ban a book about a male seahorse giving birth (fun fact that's how seahorses work) and raising its kids (nothing about the birth, just pergo seahorse had kids now being a dad).
					
					Also the idea that sex ed is porn is a terrible idea for society. There are countless examples that show increased sexual education leads to decreases in teen pregnancy, leads to better outcomes for women in general, and leads to areas with less poverty.

							I wouldn’t say it’s the real motivation. I’m sure there’s some stretch of connection and there’s definitely a lot of fucked up conservative pundits that would use such tactics to get to that level but it’s mostly fear mongering and mob think.
							
							It’s less about a child’s recognition of abuse and more general autonomy. Conservatives generally wish to maintain control whilst relieving the “big government” of their power, which is inherently hypocritical.
							
							They want to control their children to be as “good” or better than they are. To maintain their power on the social and economic level. And they do that by suppressing anything that would require a change in the status quo and the liberation from free thinking. In a microcosmic sense then yes, to keep traditional cycles of abuse, but that isn’t the only reason and is a part of a greater issue on the right side of the scale in our politics.

					Intense sexual repression and lack of sexual education that leads to teen/young pregnancy, which both encourages procreation among secluded religious predominantly White communities and supports the trapping of uneducated women in marriages where they are forced into homemaker roles and one sided sexual relationships, is one of the core tenets of American White Evangelical Christianity.

		I agree that the two things are *legally* distinct, but the chilling effect can have a similar *practical* effect.
		
		If the law doesn't prohibit you from supporting LGBT, but you live in a hyper-conservative region and know that supporting LGBT will result in you being severely ostracized, fired from your job, maybe even physically attacked by people, you do not have de facto freedom of speech. You may have de jure freedom of speech, but it's rather meaningless.

			I would argue that businesses firing people because they don't want to be associated with their speech is literally the First Amendment right of any business, just as much as the individual having the right to be outspoken on whatever they wish to speak out about. Flipping the positions of the progressives and conservatives in the scenario doesn't change anything, which is the way it should be.
			
			Social pressure to adhere to social norms is as normal as human culture. The problem is when the government intervenes to enforce those norms.

				Employers hold a lot of power over workers. Businesses are practically run like miniature governments. The fact that the government is limiting your freedom doesn't have any significant difference to an individual limiting your freedom. The government is really just another organization. It just happens to be the most powerful organization in society. Someone limiting your freedom is acting as a governing body, as they're governing your body. Just because businesses have the right to be run like dictatorships doesn't mean they're not dictatorships.
				
				In this society, with hierarchy and unequal power structures, some people hold far more influence in pressuring others. A business owner controls private property, which is wealth and power in a capitalist society. With this, they can decide who lives or dies. If a capitalist privately owns all the world's water sources, they have control over who has access to water. The average person in a capitalist society has to rely on capital to survive. Who owns the majority of the capital?
				
				Being a well-known union organizer or revolutionary would likely get you blacklisted from getting a job. Hell, even having a condition, like autism or an addiction, would get you blacklisted. Capitalists are deciding who goes homeless and who gets a good paycheck. It's practically fascism.

				* 🟪 **[Cheeseisgood1981](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cheeseisgood1981)** ⬆️ 9 _(2023-11-01 22:46:04)_

					Yes. I would argue that if you have a problem with someone getting disciplined at their job because of something they said, your real problem is with the de facto employment contract in the US. At will employment is something that the left has been sounding the alarm on in this country for decades (at least as long as I can remember). It's definitely a problem that your boss can fire you for any reason or no reason at all in nearly every state. 
					
					That's not a quarrel one should have with some angry Twitter activists. It's a quarrel we should all have with the owner class. 
					
					>A business owner controls private property, which is wealth and power in a capitalist society.
					
					I would take this a step farther, even. "Freedom of speech" on social media platforms has been a big political lightening rod since at least 2016 or so. People keep throwing around phrases like "Twitter is the new Public Square". 
					
					That should be terrifying for anyone who has actually been paying attention for the last decade. People are so concerned about the government issuing takedown requests to Jack Dorsey that they've lost sight of the real problem. 
					
					Every tech journalist from every walk of life was warning us about the overbearing and exploitative language of the TOS of these sites since they began gaining real traction. I remember reading stories about this in the aughts. No one listened. Everyone just lined up to click "agree". 
					
					Without a thought, we apparently signed over the rights to govern the "public square" to private equity. I'm not sure why anyone ever thought free speech was ever possible on these platforms when we all literally signed over the rights to anything we posted on them to billionaires with the click of a mouse. 
					
					The "free speech" argument about social media has always been a red herring, and almost everyone falls for it uncritically.

						Most resources are under private control. It's honestly terrifying to know that a large corporation with a substantial share in the market for basic necessities, like food or water, can decide to just stop distributing to certain places and people. Many rural hospitals are closing in the US. This has a substantial impact on the health of people from those areas.
						
						The world's resources and public spaces are limited. If we give private entities control over those, we've given away our freedom.

			Public disapproval, common disapproval of speech does not equal free speech violations. The ACLU rather famously and controversially sued on behalf of the KKK to allow them to get a parade permit. If the KKK gets to have their parade and their appearance is drowned out by counter protests, well that’s free speech for you. Yes, it works the other way around too. A business in a conservative area might lose customers if they display a Pride flag. Taking a stance sometimes means being brave about the consequences. What is not acceptable is the government enforcing or granting preferential treatment to some speech over another. 
			
			And yes, First Amendment jurisprudence does allow for certain restrictions on the manner of speech, for example requiring parade permits itself is not a violation as long as the requirements are content neutral. If everyone from the Rotary Club to the high school battle of the bands to the KKK needs a similar permit, then free speech is not curtailed unduly.

			Oh well, we don't live in a country with "Freedom from Judgment" in our Bill of Rights. We have "Freedom of Speech" which specifically calls out that the government cannot punish you for you speech, specifically political speech. It means you can't get arrested for saying you hate the president. It doesn't mean that other people in society cannot judge you for your speech. The founding fathers were very specific, they knew that people were still going to disagree. At that time slavery was still a political issue. So the people that owned slaves would have absolutely been ostracized and shamed by the people fighting to end slavery. In today's world, LGBTQ rights are a political issue, and the people that don't want LGBTQ people to have equal rights will be ostracized and shamed by people that aren't homophobic pieces of shit.
			
			Freedom of Speech doesn't mean that anyone can say anything without facing any consequences from anyone, that's just not how that shit works. It just means the government can't make it a crime to be vocal about your political beliefs.

			What you are describing though is lack of freedom from the consequences of your actions, not lack of freedom of speech. Obviously we are talking about an idea that has failed to gain meaningful attraction in the competition of ideas. It’s unpopular, but the government is not stopping the person from saying it. However, their employer or other people are not liking what is being said and are taking action which is appropriate. There is meaningful detriment to a company if they lose a good employee, so it’s not a decision that isn’t without it’s own consequences, but it’s deemed better than keeping the person on and dealing with the community blowback.  Said person has a choice in their own actions and therefore should be accountable to the consequences and not protected from them.

		You are completely conflating free speech as a principle with the 1st amendment of the united states. Do you honestly think that free speech is just about the law? What kind of argument is this? How is this even upvoted? Free speech is about being able to freely express information and ideas. Your consitution did not create free speech, it simply prevents the government from getting in the way of it. That is not to say that other institutions or individuals cannot also get in the way or work against free speech as a principle.

If they don't like what you're saying they're exercising their freedom of speech to not hold and say those things by removing you.

	A quick google search has some statistics. Obviously not definitive cause it's only 1 survey, but I think it generally aligns with what I've experienced: [https://drt.cmc.ed[u/2023](https://www.reddit.com/user/2023)/09/25/survey-on-free-speech/](https://drt.cmc.ed[u/2023](https://www.reddit.com/user/2023)/09/25/survey-on-free-speech/)

	"Poll respondents were read this statement: “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.” Only 31% of Democratic voters “strongly agreed” with that sentiment, compared to 51% of Republicans."

	Republican voters (74%) and independents (61%) believe speech should be legal “under any circumstances, while Democrats are almost evenly divided. A bare majority of Democrats (53%) say speech should be legal under any circumstances, while 47% say it should be legal “only under certain circumstances.”

	Also it's worth noting that people generally don't live their values, as in they say one thing and do another, but I think it's still telling that there is a sizable conservative edge when it comes to at least the idea of free speech (regardless of the contents).

	I would call myself a centrist, and hold opinions on varying issues that would be considered left-wing and right-wing depending on the issue. I will say, when talking to liberal friends, I exclusively say what I agree with them on, because I'm afraid that people will call me a "bigot" and "hateful" before I even have a change to defend myself . I'm not joking that when I told a friend "If I move to the States I would go to Texas cause I like lower taxes ... and would buy a gun for self-defense" the next day, they called me out for being a "trump supporter".

	If I'm talking with conservative friends, I tell them exactly how I feel if I lean more left on a certain issue, cause I know we can actually talk about it. They'll try to change my minds, but generally it's still pretty respectful and they're not making all these assumptions about my character.

	This is obviously all anecdotal, but I do see this happening online, where people who are more liberal shut down opposing opinions for being "hate speech", equating an opposing opinion to "literal violence" ([https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/07/why-its-a-bad-idea-to-tell-students-words-are-violence/533970/](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/07/why-its-a-bad-idea-to-tell-students-words-are-violence/533970/)) , and the good'ol "If you disagree with me you're hitler" (I found this in 30 seconds on the first post I saw in r/politics: [https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/17lche7/comment/k7d5oqo/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/17lche7/comment/k7d5oqo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).)

	This definitely happens on both sides, but I can definitely feel it more on the liberal side, and the statistics that I cited support this.

	Examples of this would be:

	r/therewasanattempt's new rules: "No supporting Apartheid crimes against humanity", "No bootlicking cops - ACAB". (despite both of these being fairly controversial takes) among many other very prominent subreddits that I'm too lazy to list.

	All those protests at college campuses you see whenever a conservative figure has a speech. (seriously they spent like 600k on Ben Shapiro's security at UC Berkley) I certainly can't think of a liberal speaking being shut down. I personally would like to hear people who I disagree with talk, and hopefully hear their perspective, but hey that's just me I guess.

	The fact that the Twitter files, memes aside, actually did expose Twitter for shadowbanning conservatives. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/12/13/twitter-files-shadow-banning-conservatives-bari-weiss/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/12/13/twitter-files-shadow-banning-conservatives-bari-weiss/) (though I will say I don't use Twitter much so I'm less informed on this).

		You've already qualified your statements pretty well, but I would argue that there is a difference between saying that you defend free speech and actually defending free speech. It might just depend on where you are or what specifically you are saying, but I've had multiple conservatives snap at me and start to get violent because I ask them a critical question in good faith or espouse a certain view, though they would swear they support free speech and would defend it. Or for instance, there are polls like this: [https://news.gallup.com/poll/23524/public-support-constitutional-amendment-flag-burning.aspx](https://news.gallup.com/poll/23524/public-support-constitutional-amendment-flag-burning.aspx)
		
		And of course, it's not like conservatives don't have a history of censoring media as well: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship\_in\_the\_United\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_the_United_States)  
		
		
		They tend to want to ban anything that they view as decaying the moral fabric of America. The idea of a singular moral fabric is pretty uniquely conservative. Meanwhile, I can openly share my conservative opinions (like my views on gun ownership rights or rent control) with my colleagues who are very liberal without fear of violence, emotional outbursts or backlash.

		I will add that I think there can be a difference between "allowing speech" vs. "paying for speech using taxpayer dollars".
		
		As much as I dislike what is happening in Florida, it could be argued that they aren't actually banning these books full-stop, but are just removing them from public schools which kids are mandated to attend. Unless I'm misunderstanding the policy, I believe none of this applies to private schools or on sales of these books outside of school.
		
		It all depends on what exactly constitutes "free speech". Does it only apply in public areas only, or should private entities (like Twitter or the Christian Bakery in the gay wedding cake case) be compelled to host free speech as well? Are there exceptions for libel/slander/defamation or threats? Is hate speech still free speech as long as there are no threats?

			The book banning at schools is less about free speech, and more about revoking trust from teachers, librarians, folks who have curated content for children based on multiple degrees and many times decades of experience teaching. I have yet to hear of a child being harmed as leading to these bans, and also have not heard too much about a child being harmed from the bans. Because kids live in whatever world we choose to animate for them, and it’s the “parental choice” concept (about as specious as “states rights”) that seems to be animating the idea that the teachers and school systems they otherwise entrust their children for in so many other facets are suddenly the problem. 
			
			
			In short, it’s BS. It’s always about gay stuff, never do they bring up things like “I don’t want my child reading about graphic, gory details of history that may actually keep them up at night.” It’s always about CRT when that isn’t really built into the curriculum of kids so young then are incapable of forming their own opinions. The worst part for me is that *the real indoctrination* is parents convincing their children that certain types of education are going to be harmful, when there is not a lot of evidence that is true.

					Yup, obviously it gives you an in-depth instructional tutorial on how to setup a grinder account, and how to get hookups. Obviously it is a good idea to not teach LGBT kids basic dating skills and where to meet people. This way they can be lonely or they can ultimately meet people good old fashion way, like at a truck stop. /s

		The issue I have with that poll is it's too simplistic of a question. I value free speech, but I'm not willing to die so a racist can run around saying the N word. I would be willing to fight for free speech as a principle if needed, but that doesn't mean I'm willing to defend certain speech. It's a very complicated and nuanced topic.

			I’m not sure if it has anything to do with environmental upbringing, but those on the left/liberal sides tend to read that and immediately think of hate speech, or something of that nature. This could be due to having more diverse backgrounds, or having more diverse friend groups. 
			
			Where as when I speak to right leaning, conservative, or even alt-right people - it is often (but not always) related to something such as disapproval of the military, or some other benign issue that would not get you into any issues, typically. However, this value doesn’t seem to be lived because those same groups are up in arms over anti-police statements, pro gender ideologies, anti-racist statements etc.

			“Social consequences” or “canceling” is speech. I find it difficult to understand how either of those could be considered anti-speech. It sounds in all honesty like you are saying any social consequence is being inherently anti-speech.
			
			I think this is where some clever people have tricked others into thinking. Being fired by doing something your private sector employer finds offensive is NOT an example of silencing speech. It’s an example of your employer practicing their right of association. 
			
			The fact is, being anti-free speech is something that can only be done as a power of government, through laws, hiring practices, etc. In that vein being anti free speech is predominantly practiced by people who identify as conservative.
			
			Everything else, is just a social consequence. Which is just part of life. For example, don’t go to a party, tell the home owner his wife is ugly and then scream about being silenced when you are asked to leave.

				I am wary of the claim that “being anti-free speech is something that can only be done as a power of government.” If we think back to the 1950s, Hollywood executives were blacklisting actors on the mere suggestion that they were communist. This meant that actors had no way of making money through that profession whether they were communist or not. Although the government had a strong influence in the McCarthyism of the time, I am still not comfortable in allowing companies or corporations to limit or deny people of their livelihoods because of speech. In the age of social media, people can lose their primary platforms to make their voice heard at the whim of the executives of the companies. The power to censor is not limited to the government.
				
				That said, I do think you have a point with the idea of a person’s or business’s right to association. If a friend of mine were to call me or other people racial slurs, it is a fair social consequence for me to not want to be friends with that person. A similar logic applies to companies. Why would a company want someone who calls potential customers racial slurs to work for them? We somehow need to define what reasonable social consequences are for speech, and we need to determine how to best balance an individual’s right to free speech and another person’s or company’s right to association.

					The situation you present about Hollywood in the 1950’s already has a carve out in the form of defamation. Even if defamation can be hard to prove (rightfully so) if someone were to be lied about especially in a very public and career destroying manner we have that legal avenue they can go down to clear their name and get restitution.
					
					However, let’s keep using that communist example. If someone genuinely believes communism is evil and they don’t want to be ever be associated with someone who is communist or a communist sympathizer then they should have the right to not hire that person. 
					
					Lying about someone to prevent them from continuing a career is one thing, but not hiring them yourself because you find their beliefs or statements reprehensible should continue to be allowed.

			That is literally how you create a functional society.  Having a big chunk of your population spending time debating actual simple facts is not useful, and not thinking everyone deserves basic human rights.

			Liberals have very complex conversations about a ton of issues and how best to address them, and they can be very heated at times because issues are complicated when it comes to human beings.

			If you didn't have some religious leader telling you that gay people aren't natural there is no normal way to come to that conclusion, by every single historical documents that we have as far back as we have them the percentage of people that are not straight has been relatively consistent, it is obviously a natural state that has no negative impact on our world.

		I don't think that moderators are overwhelmingly leftist; even if there is a serious case of getting rid of conservative posts (I am dubious of this claim), there is another reason for it other than simply being leftist. A *bad* progressive opinion will probably fall into the level of "people who don't think about stuff the same way as me are dumb and should shut up".

And I won't deny that most of the popular subs have a serious leftward bent.

			Make the rules care more about the bad intend and protect classes of people where the defining trait of their class is either non-harm or usual victims of irrational hate.
			
			Sure there will be cases where you can feel like the judges go to far and sure there will cases where the letter of the law might overreach a bit. But overall it is better to have too much care and protection of the weakest than no protection.

		>There's also basic principles limiting free expression like 'don't shout 'fire' in a crowded theater'
		
		The fact that you've used this as an example shows you know little about constitutional law.
		
		*Schenck v. United States*, specifically, was the case that came up with the standard that you're referring to. It was used to suppress antiwar activists during the First World War, and was overturned by *Brandenburg v. Ohio* in 1969. Some state-level laws such as Colorado Revised Statute § 18-8-111 make this illegal but there is no federal law against it. There should not be a federal law against it.
		
		If there was, it would be all well and good that antivaxxers no longer get to spread their tripe, but then we start getting into the government deciding what people get to say about less black and white things and that's when it really gets bad.
		
		Let's say there's a war with China and the draft starts getting used again for whatever reason. You want to pass out flyers against that draft? Under the standard set by *Schenck v. United States* you'll get arrested for that if someone decides it's undermining the war effort.
		
		And let's hope you're not saying anything out loud in public that a police officer (who, as we all know, can *totally* be relied upon to be fair arbiters of the law) might think is dangerous or "feel threatened by", because with a little twisting and revising *Schenck v. United States* can probably be made to justify executing you on the spot if they think your speech is a threat to others. "I swear, Judge, I thought the person leading the protest was going to start a deadly riot!"
		
		Also, "don't shout fire in a crowded theater" specifically concerns speech the federal government is not allowed to suppress, as opposed to, for instance, the rights of private social media platforms to refuse to carry certain messages. There is a difference between governmental *law* and private *rights*. The government's ability to regulate free speech is restrained so that it cannot (in theory) be hijacked by some lunatic who uses it as a club against those they don't like. Those restrictions have no bearing on how people think people in general should behave or how private social media platforms should behave.

		Popper’s Paradox is flawed — not because of the reasons there’s here argue it (because intolerance is not actually as subjective as they misrepresent it as), but because it misses the point. 
		
		“Tolerance” is not acceptance. It is not agreement. It is a truce. 
		
		It is saying “I might not like your idea/difference/*thing*, but I will leave it alone and allow it to exist unharmed”
		
		Intolerance is a breach of the truce. 
		
		The problem with the “Gotcha!” nonsense regarding tolerance is (1) that it is made out to be things other than tolerance, and (2) that those who break the truce somehow believe the *other side* is still bound by the truce despite the violation or rejection of the truce. 
		
		The “tolerant left” stereotype is merely allowing everyone a chance to buy in and live unharmed… with the minutiae of harm one can stomach as unacceptable (and the consequential harm you accept causing to those harming others) increasing as you move further left. 
		
		It’s why it always seems to be the conservatives who openly break it — hierarchical systems (that rightwing ideologies are fundamentally based on) permit harm to those of lower “standing,” and argue in favor of privilege/power being used to safeguard access to scarce resources (which is often seen as “all of them”).

		The solution to Popper's paradox is to think of tolerance as a social contract instead of a moral principle: i.e. we collectively agree to treat each other decently in expectation of being treated decently in return. A person who is **not** treating others decently is in breach of the contract and therefore the rest of us are no longer bound by it with regards to them.

		At the risk of derailing the thread, Popper's Paradox of Intolerance is really just, "Whoever seizes this principle first and invokes it, wins." I've even known conservatives to embrace it - but from the right-wing side.
		
		It's similar to people of every political stripe saying "We are XYZ and we cannot allow anyone who has anti-XYZ views because it would undermine XYZ," just phrased differently.
		
		I could announce myself as a pro-Biden person, and then say that anyone who favors Buttigieg, Kamala, Bernie or any other candidate is "intolerant." Tolerance becomes whatever one defines it as.

			>At the risk of derailing the thread, Popper's Paradox of Intolerance is really just, "Whoever seizes this principle first and invokes it, wins."
			
			That's how literally every principle works, if you look only at the form and not the substance.
			
			It is fundamentally impossible for *any* form of reasoning or argument to *inherently* work any other way. Every form of persuasion can be applied in any direction. Every form of rhetoric can be applied in any direction. Every argument about A having property Y could be replaced with the exact same argument about B having property Z, and it would be fundamentally impossible to tell the difference just by looking at the *argument*.
			
			The only way you can ever make actual decisions is to look at which arguments correspond to actual reality - with the complication, of course, that you have decided how to look at "actual reality".
			
			A says "B punched me first". B says "A punched me first". The arguments are identical in every way. You cannot ever possibly make a decision among them unless you first decide which claims match reality.
			
			And yes, that leaves the difficult problem of how you decide what "actual reality" *is* in the first place, since you don't have eyes everywhere on the globe, and have to take other people's word for most things. I've literally never seen Joe Biden or Donald Trump in person; technically, they might not even exist in reality. I have to choose to rely on certain sets of testimony from others to reach the conclusion that, in reality, those people probably exist. I haven't personally seen the actions of either Joe Biden or Donald Trump, and different people say different things about those actions. I have to make actual decisions about which sets of people are more reliable, which is based essentially on a very long (lifetime-long) chain of observations, predictions, and claims, and how those sources' claims match (or don't match) my observations.
			
			In order to actually use Popper's Paradox - or any other such argument - in a meaningful way, you need to be able to set aside "these people are saying X" and take a stance on "X *is actually happening*" or "X *is not actually happening*".
			
			You risk being wrong, but you need to take such a risk in order to make any meaningful moral choices.

			I think what popper reveals is an example of a wider challenge to all principles of freedom - pure, unfettered freedom for all is logically impossible, because every (or at least, almost every) exercise of freedom can be viewed as an imposition on the freedom of another. 
			
			You are of course correct that the GOP have claimed ownership of the value of freedom for many years, but ultimately every political position advocates freedom - the devil is in the details of which freedoms, for whom.
			
			Speech is no different. Everyone has their exceptions to a principle of free speech. For the western left it's bigotry and intolerance, for the GOP it's protests and the liberal media.  I'm sure the CCP will tell you they have free speech with the simple exception of speaking against the state or its interests. 
			
			But speech doesn't live in a vacuum. The freedom to shout fire in a theatre restricts everyone else's freedom to enjoy a musical without interruption. The freedom to bear arms imposes on our freedom to go about our lives without the threat of mentally ill people with automatic weapons. The freedom to choose who you serve in your business imposes on others freedom to be open about their sexuality. 
			
			We are a social species who live together in communities. We are interdependent on each other. Freedom is an important principle to consider politically but it isn't a thing that exists without the context of which freedoms, for whom.
			
			That doesn't stop people from falling for it and voting for it, however, making it a great grift for populist politicians.
			
			In my view, the cultural obsession with freedom and rugged (brutal) individualism is antithetical to human nature and at the heart of many of the cultural issues in the US. That's another topic for another day!

				This right here is a perfect example of the sort of behavior the paradox warns against, ironically by the very same people who love to invoke it. And like 1984, it is a warning, *not* a manual to follow. The construing of dissent as a call to violence or dehumanizing or stripping people of rights is exactly what it is referring to. 
				
				It's not meant to justify, for example, ideas like "citing FBI statistics to highlight disparities in violent crimes is racist, and therefore intolerant, and thus we are right in not tolerating it and instead shutting it down."
				
				It is more often the liberals who embody the intolerance mentioned in the paradox by conflating intolerance with insensitivity. It's the labeling of a person's own beliefs as bigotry,  as violence, as deceptive, and shutting it down with censorship or force, rather than engaging with the rational argument regardless of how that argument may make you feel. The paradox is warning against tolerating ideologies that denounce argument and rise to this level of suppression, which liberals are very prone to do.
				
				It's not about intolerance of a race or religion or people  or sexuality or identity,  but intolerance of *ideas*.

					Nobody is shutting such conversation down. We’re saying, “that’s not the whole picture, there’s an entire iceberg you’re ignoring with those claims”.
					
					When you control for poverty and other negative correlated of poverty, violent crime statistics more or less are pretty equal.
					
					Saying, “herr derr blacks do X amount of violent crimes as opposed to whites” does come off as ignorant and bigoted because it’s essentially blaming people for things that are systemic.
					
					Like, most liberals/leftists are exasperated when dealing with such claims. It comes off like you’re saying black individuals are somehow intrinsically more likely to commit crime, and considering skin color is only a single trait - which can be paired with quite a variety of genetics (there’s greater biodiversity in individuals from Africa than elsewhere due to genetic bottlenecks in the Paleolithic) and the crime disappears when wealth level are controlled for, it just comes off as disingenuous.
					
					Like what is your goal here? What is the point of even saying it?
					
					Like yeah, of fucking course poverty leads to more crime. Doh??
					
					Have a group of people who are pretty much denied from wealth building for centuries, and yeah, more of them are going to be poor than groups who are not in that category, also doh.
					
					Like what is the value add here?
					
					That’s why I think you see a lot of liberals/leftists getting annoyed, because conservative talking points about these things come off as **facile**.

			You're mixing up intolerant speech with disagreement. Examples from a quick Google search that line up with my understanding.
			
			* Personal attacks: Insults, threats, and other forms of abuse directed at individuals or groups of people.
			* Stereotyping and prejudice: Making generalizations about people based on their race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or other group affiliation.
			* Disinformation and hate speech: Spreading false or misleading information about individuals or groups of people, or advocating for violence or discrimination against them.
			
			If someone calls all gay people pedophiles despite that being an empirically false statement and that statement leads to abuse or violence against homosexuals, why would we not consider that intolerant? How is society benefitted from tolerating that speech? Is the danger to the group being attacked outweighed by the loss of freedom of speech by the person being restricted from putting that group in danger?
			
			The part that is missing from a lot of this discourse is this: being held accountable for intolerant speech and action does not preclude you from continuing to hold the intolerant belief. You can believe in your heart of hearts all you want that drag queens are going to poison your children's minds. But what you cannot do is verbalize that notion in the public square to the detriment of the group or take action (physical, legal, commercial, legislative, etc.) that causes harm to others because of it without the possibility of consequences. That's what we don't tolerate.

				Free speech is not divided on the boundary of "empirically true" or "empirically false".
				
				The government's ability — *anyone's* ability — to determine what's empirically true is limited — because most epistemological questions are not as easy to figure out as "not all gay people are pedophiles", even for huge concentrations of power such as governments, because governments are made of falliable human beings and are not monoliths.
				
				But a government which cannot tell empirical truth from fiction and suppresses speech based on that is an existential crisis for society, whereas if, say, Twitter is unable to tell truth from fiction and censoring people based on that — especially the case since Musk took over — you can just unsubscribe. This is why, legally speaking, the government is almost always not allowed to censor people whereas private institutions are.
				
				>But what you **cannot do** is verbalize that notion in the public square to the detriment of the group or take action (physical, legal, commercial, legislative, etc.) that causes harm to others because of it without the possibility of consequences. That's what we don't tolerate.
				
				What you *should* not do, you mean.
				
				There is an important difference between descriptive statements and prescriptive statements. What we want (prescriptive) is not, unfortunately, reality (descriptive). Confusing how one thinks things should be with how things currently are stops one from making the world a better place and has been the death of many, many progressive movements.

				just as you say "you don't need the paradox of intolerance to say queer people shouldn't be harassed" you can similarly say, "you don't need to avoid the paradox of intolerance to say toxic people shouldn't be harassed."

				people who want to kill people will kill people - and they'll use any justification.  "he was a lawbreaker" "he was one of THEM" "he was intolerant and we cannot allow even one impure drop!"  
				
				
				the problem isn't "the paradox" because it's not a paradox.  like the rule that there are no rules - not a paradox, because the rule is there are no rules - so in the absence of the only rule - there are still no rules.  not a paradox.

						This is literally not the definition of murder. 
						
						I think you kind of just reiterated the point. The law is just language, and language is malleable. Lawyers are paid a lot of money to legally argue that "no" means "yes", "up" means "down", etc.
						
						The conclusion I draw from this is that when it comes down to it the practical meaning of any law is just about whose interests are represented in the systems that write and execute the laws. Universal rights are an [ideal](https://youtu.be/m9-R8T1SuG4?si=m9T-8n2A90Tuoo4u): there is no "neutral" way to write a law because laws are never neutral in practice.

	Hey, I'm not going to get many upvotes for this, because it's not how a lot of Redditors think, but in the interest of explaining why conservatives think they're more "free speech," here goes... 

	Conservatives don't mind you saying something they disagree with. They're going to say plenty that *you* disagree with. Where they draw the line is in being forced to agree with you. 

	They'll talk about library books, funded by taxes they had to pay. They don't mind you reading those books, but they're certainly not going to pay for them. That's what a library ban is: the library will not purchase them. You can still buy it and read it if you like. The community, however, decides what the community will make available. 

	Recently, there was an uproar about some hockey player not wanting to put rainbow tape on his stick. That would be forcing his speech, and he didn't want it. If we said he was a jerk and should've done it, that's our prerogative too. Tolerance means you don't agree, but you'll leave it at saying so if that's what the law requires. As such, he believed his actions were tolerant, and his critics' words would also be tolerant. 

	Instead he got death threats. That escalated things beyond words and became intolerance. It sounds weird to be calling defending gay rights intolerance, but remember this is about killing someone for not wearing fancy tape, not for beating up gay people or even trying to restrict their rights.  

	I can't say if conservatives truly are more about free speech. The closest comparison I can think of is when Colin Kaepernick refused to stand during the anthem, and most conservatives I knew kept it to speech, saying they didn't like it, but that was it. Then again, I know there was *some* kind of campaign against him. I just didn't hear about it in my circles. *And my circles aren't Trumpers, those guys are nuts.* Conservatives also tend to be more Kantian and less Consequentialist in their judgment, for what it's worth.

		The real issue pops up when just disagreeing with a Democrat or Leftist gets you tagged as spreading "hate" or "violence", and suddenly you're stamped with an "ist." On Reddit, it seems like there's a big crowd all nodding along to the same tune, making folks think they've got the moral high ground. But the truth? A lot of people who could stir the pot with some good arguments have already been kicked out. What's left is a cozy echo chamber, where everyone pats each other on the back, making real debate a no-show. I really enjoy a good debate, but it is a bummer I can't get into them as much as I used to.
		
		Conservatives know what they're getting into on r/conservative—it's right there in the name. The problem is when Democrats and Leftists hop onto r/politics or r/news thinking they'll dive into meaningful debates with different viewpoints. What they don't realize is that they're only seeing what the mods have let through the filter. It's not real engagement with alternate perspectives, just a moderated echo chamber.

	First, just want to point out that you are talking about our norms rather than our laws.  Neither side wants legal changes to the first amendment; both sides agree with the standards for limiting certain forms of speech, the difference is just in the assessment of the facts for when it's warranted or not.

	In terms of free speech norms (e.g. how we tolerate or value diverse opinions; how we impose social consequences for saying bad things; our willingness to engage in discourse with political opponents; etc.), I think conservatives are actually in a position where they have to value free speech more because they no longer occupy the moral center of our country.  The standard values now are moderate-left liberalism and conservative traditions are steadily losing ground.  Conservatives need to commit themselves to engaging with discourse because they stand to lose the most when people shut down conversations out of a sense of disgust.

	[Here's some polling showing that Republicans are more in favor of free speech than Democrats.](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/real_clear_opinion_research/poll_is_censorship_a_partisan_issue_149790.html)

	> Republican voters (74%) and independents (61%) believe speech should be legal “under any circumstances, while Democrats are almost evenly divided. A bare majority of Democrats (53%) say speech should be legal under any circumstances, while 47% say it should be legal “only under certain circumstances.”

	> Nearly one-third of Democratic voters (34%) say Americans have “too much freedom.” This compared to 14.6% of Republicans. Republicans were most likely to say Americans have too little freedom (46%), while only 22% of Democrats feel that way. Independents were in the middle in both categories.

	> Although majorities of Democrats, Republicans, and independents agree the news media should be able to report stories they believe are in the national interest, this consensus shifts when it comes to social media censorship. A majority of Democrats (52%) approve of the government censoring social media content under the rubric of protecting national security. Among Republicans and independents, this percentage is only one-third.

	   

	> Poll respondents were read this statement: “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.” Only 31% of Democratic voters “strongly agreed” with that sentiment, compared to 51% of Republicans.

	   

	> Fully three-fourths of Democrats believe government has a responsibility to limit “hateful” social media posts, while Republicans are more split, with 50% believing the government has a responsibility to restrict hateful posts. (Independents, once again, are in the middle.)

	   

	> Democrats are significantly more likely than Republicans to favor stifling the free speech rights of political extremists. Also, Republicans don’t vary by the group: Only about half of GOP voters favor censorship — whether asked about the Ku Klux Klan, Nazis, or the Communist Party.

	As a leftist I find it very unfortunate.  I'm old enough to remember when Democrats were more reliably on the side of free speech.  I thought it was a matter of principle, and for some people it was, but I'm now realizing that many Democrats are willing to suppress free speech because they feel ascendant and they no longer worry that that same power will be turned against them.

	I don’t disagree with you overall, but I think there’s a fundamental distinction in how the two groups think about freedom in general.

	I’m gonna make some generalizations about liberals and conservatives now so please forgive me in advance for that. I’m also gonna focus only on thought process, not anything legal, so I won’t distinguish private individuals vs the government, even though that is an important distinction. And I’ll also preface that I’m more liberal overall so I’m certainly biased. With that said…

	Liberals, in general, think of free speech as “freedom to.” Freedom to say hate speech, but also freedom to fire or “cancel” someone because of that. Freedom to read and learn about gay and trans issues, but also freedom to protest those issues (and again, freedom to “cancel” someone because of that protest). Freedom to have an abortion if that’s what you want. 

	Conservatives, on the other hand, have more of a “freedom from” mindset. Freedom from having to suffer consequences for objectionable speech. Freedom from having their kids learn about LGBT issues. Freedom from being forced to attend DEI trainings. Freedom from being exposed to viewpoints they find objectionable. Freedom from babies being aborted. 

	Personally I think “freedom from” is a bullshit way to look at freedom because it just means eliminating someone else’s “freedom to,” but I see where they are coming from.

	* 🟨 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 8 _(2023-11-01 21:03:22)_

		Conservatives don't use freedom arguments with abortion, that's a matter of determining when a human life matters or not. I don't think this "to" vs "from" distinction is very helpful because pretty much any of these things can be describe with either one without any difficulty. Examples:
		
		Freedom from having to listen to other opinions
		Freedom from punishment for public indecency
		Freedom from the consequences of sex
		Freedom to speak without becoming homeless
		Freedom to decide what your kids learn
		Freedom to leave if someone offends you
		Freedom from getting shot in school
		Freedom to arm yourself
		Freedom from covid
		Freedom to decline vaccination 
		
		I don't think progressives and conservatives view freedom differently, I think the LEFT and the RIGHT think of freedom differently. Leftists have a group mindset so they think of freedom along demographic lines rather than as individuals

	* 🟨 **[Verdeckter](https://www.reddit.com/user/Verdeckter)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-11-02 02:45:23)_

		This is very simple, surface level thinking. There is no "from" and "to" in any fundamental sense, these are nothing more than English words we use for certain phrases. Freedom is just the ability to do something without being punished or stopped (again "to" in this sentence is just the word English uses for an infinitive). For example:
		
		Freedom from consequences for speech = freedom to say what you want
		Freedom to learn read about LGBTQ issue = freedom from censorship
		
		When a business owner fires you for wearing a rainbow flag, why does a liberal think it's bad, a conservative good but when you're fired for wearing a MAGA hat, a liberal thinks it's good but a conservative bad? All just consequences for speech right? 
		
		Personally I would much rather have a democratic process where we decide what's unacceptable speech, for example for what exactly you can get fired and lose the ability to pay for food and shelter, than a process where it's decided arbitrarily by prolific tweeters and a handful of capitalists. I mean in other countries, there are labor laws, an employer can't just fire you because somebody filmed you making an "OK sign" or you posted a link to a study in Twitter. Is this anti free speech? Protection from private power was traditionally a progressive position. But I suspect "liberals" don't want this because it's likely to take power away from them.

	Most people in general do not support free speech, which is precisely why countries like the U.S. have built free speech into their Constitutions. It has to be enforced, otherwise people will try to censor one another. The only time free speech isn't an issue is when you have a monoculture and smaller populations (like tribes), where everyone thinks, believes and talks the same. The dissent in those cultures takes place within a very narrow concept window that doesn't rock the boat. Japan is like that. 

	Everyone else, especially multicultural places, require rules to protect basic liberties. 

	I think a lot of liberals and conservatives would love to see the end of liberal democracy. They want to see tyranny that enforces their point of view, without realizing that as soon as they get their choice tyrant in power they could easily be replaced with someone they don't like, and then they're screwed. 

	Any system you create to oppress others can be used to oppress you, down the road. This is what totally selfish people will never understand because they can't think beyond themselves. If you aren't willing to defend right of your enemy to speak, then you will lose your speech. But people are losing their sense of civic responsibility, so here we are.

		Nope, conservatives are also seeking to ban books from school libraries of all levels as well as public libraries.  [Here is a detailed breakdown](https://pen.org/report/banned-in-the-usa-state-laws-supercharge-book-suppression-in-schools/) of book banning efforts in the US including titles, where the bans are taking place, and who is behind them.
		
		>Florida does not have a don’t say gay bill.
		
		It absolutely does, it's known as Florida HB 1557, and everybody agrees it will chill discussion or mention of LGBTQ topics in school systems no matter how relevant or important they may be.  The conservatives who support it just won't admit that's the point.

		Are you really a Libertarian if you're banning books from a grade school library? Kids should be free to read any books that librarians deem have literary merit. 
		
		There's plenty in the Bible that I probably wouldn't want my child reading but I'd never be calling for the Bible to be banned from children's libraries.

		Yes, they've also tried to shut down public libraries.

		Categorically false.

		*Removed from circulation* means it's not available *at all*...which means it's *banned* at all grade levels.  That is just one indisputable example of hundreds.  
		
		>Get your facts straight first.
		
		You should take your own advice.  
		
		>Florida does not have a don’t say gay bill.
		
		The bill was written intentionally vague and with enough ambiguity that it most definitely could be applied in that manner.  It would then be up to the courts to determine the actual interpretation when challenges arise.  
		
		>Educate yourself
		
		Again, take your own advice.

	1. Gender Queer (as an example) is an illustrated story which shows two underage boys engaged in oral sex. In no other world besides the brains of leftists would such an illustration or content be deemed appropriate for middle school children to be exposed to without their parents consent. The state (through the school and local libraries) has no business providing content which could even be considered pornographic in nature. This isn’t a “free speech” issue. You can still got it he book store and buy all the copies of Gender Queer you want. You can set up a “little library” in front of your house and make them available. No one’s rights were infringed by saying “nah, no porn in the library.”

	2.  Every sub is a liberal sub on Reddit, and they will ban a conservative for the barest violation, while allowing literal death threats to remain. Don’t act like Reddit is anything but echo chambers on both sides. 

	3.  When conservatives were “outraged” by kneeling at football games, what did they do?  Did they demand that players be fired? Did they orchestrate a harassment campaign of front offices across the NFL and demand their desires be fulfilled? Did they call for the NFL’s monopoly to be ended? Not really. They just stopped watching NFL games. There is a huge difference between how the left and the right handles things they are “outraged” about. 

	4. The left loved to point out that Twitter was a private company while people were being banned for mentioning that maybe Covid came from a laboratory, or maybe the government shouldn’t be shutting down the entire economy. They were less excited about Twitter being a private company when NPR was labeled state media and Musk started wielding his ban hammer. 🤷‍♂️

	5. Tying back to the #1 issue, a teacher doesn’t need to talk about their personal life in any capacity whatsoever to do their job. You wouldn’t accept a heterosexual teacher coming into the classroom and talking about how they railed their wife at the local park over the weekend, but for some reason the left is perfectly fine with a gay teacher carrying on about their sexual identity and what they do with their partners. No one cares. Shut the fuck up and teach. Stop trying to be a 3 dimensional character. You are there to impart information not talk about yourselves. I can remember the names and faces of every single one of my teachers throughout primary and secondary school, and I couldn’t tell you if they were married or not, if they were gay, straight, or asexual. Because they didn’t talk about their personal lives. It had no place in school. Period.

	Both are guilty in some respects. But from a government involvement in speech perspective, the democrats are slightly worse imo.

	Schools are a unique case: each state heavily regulates curriculum and what teachers can/cannot say- in blue states and red states- so that's a wash to me. Especially when you see the bulk of book removals nationwide are a handful of titles with extremely sexual content

	The Biden admin was recently found guilty of strong arming social media to an extent it violated the 1st amendment

	https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/08/business/appeals-court-first-amendment-social-media.html

	Remember the disinformation governance board? That was such a scary thing that it was completely disbanded after mass outcry

	Recently some democrat members of Congress tried to pressure cable carriers to reconsider whether people should be allowed to watch Fox News and other networks. In a letter to cable carriers, House Democrats Anna Eshoo and Jerry McNerney appeared to mirror calls from activists to drop such networks from their lineups.

	Another example is liberals being in favor of masterpiece cake shop being punished for not producing products that conflict with the owners religious beliefs. This was my odd one because they largely applauded private companies choosing to not do business with someone they don't support(e.g. Twitter trump ban) but not when it came to the cake shop

	https://scholarship.law.duke.ed[u/djclpp_sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/user/djclpp_sidebar)/169/

	In terms of the overall electorate, democrats have fairly recently and rapidly changed their opiniona of free speech in favor of more government involvement vs. Republican voters

	https://www.bostonherald.com/2023/10/04/olson-more-dems-take-dim-view-of-right-to-free-speech/

	Also, look at how campuses react when a conservative speaker visits. Recall the large protests against Dave Chappelle for joking about trans people. Liberals can and do foster a very intolerant culture where free speech has difficulty in existing at times

	You should distinguish between banning speech on your own forum, which you own or are responsible for, and banning speech on someone else's platform by coercion.

	Nobody banned books by threatening librarians with violence. Politics in charge of school libraries exerted control over what they buy. If you oppose this, you use democracy to change the politicians.

	Ben Shapiro couldn't give a talk at a university which invited him, because violent protesters raised security costs to a level where the group couldn't afford the talk. This is something to oppose regardless of your opinion of Ben Shapiro.

	It's a shame that when people post that awful xkcd cartoon on this subject, they don't specify that it has to be your door, not someone else's.

	Now when the government is involved yes it gets more complicated, because it blurs the line of what is public speech and what is a private publication. But many of your examples don't have that issue.

		>awful xkcd cartoon
		
		i have never in my life heard anyone refer to an xkcd cartoon as awful.  
		
		
		you're talking about the one where "and they're showing you the door," right?  
		
		
		like, you've said your miserable piece, and we don't like it, so you can kindly leave.  but you're saying, "but it has to be Your door"  -- so yes, i agree, that you should be able to tell someone when they're not wanted at your event, but if it isn't your event, then you have no say.  
		
		
		but how does that resolve when it's a university event, the students and faculty don't OWN the space or the university - so they have no say.  ...so should the university be allowed to operate however they wish now that we've established it's a capitalist system where only the OWNER of the university can make those calls?  
		
		
		who invites these people?  can students and administrators put forward suggestions for who to invite?  can they put forward suggestions who Not to?  
		
		
		if the only recourse for protest is for students who don't like the talk is to entirely revoke their membership (and tuition) then do we believe Knowledge is a Privilege attained only by those who sacrifice their morals?  
		
		
		is it fair to say then that if the devil runs the school, and we must turn from god in order to chase success?  do you think this kind of thinking could be anti-intellectual and help America continue down it's road to doom?

			> i have never in my life heard anyone refer to an xkcd cartoon as awful.  you're talking about the one where "and they're showing you the door," right?
			
			Yes, I quite like xkcd. But that image has been used 1000 times to defend violence at university speeches.
			
			> the students and faculty don't OWN the space or the university - so they have no say
			
			It has little to do with OWNERSHIP in that case, but authority. THE STUDENTs aren't the ones protesting. The protesters IN NO WAY represent the student body, nor the faculty, nor anyone else.  Students and faculty *do* have input, I believe, in the process by which speakers can be invited.
			
			>who invites these people?
			
			It varies, but there's a process. The process was chosen by a system in which people get to be involved to decide how that works. 
			
			> can students and administrators put forward suggestions for who to invite?
			
			Yes
			
			> can they put forward suggestions who Not to?
			
			Yes, but a small group of them can not literally send people to the hospital to coerce the rest to disinvite someone. And that's what these protesters did. [Some of them not even students nor faculty, such as the guy who beat someone over the head with a bicycle lock at a protest at Berkeley](https://www.berkeleyside.org/2018/08/08/eric-clanton-takes-3-year-probation-deal-in-berkeley-rally-bike-lock-assault-case), or the person who sent [the professor who was debating Charles Murray at Middlebury to the hospital](https://www.sevendaysvt.com/OffMessage/archives/2017/03/03/mob-attacks-middlebury-prof-and-controversial-speaker-charles-murray), or the person that ~~beat~~ [pepper-sprayed the lesbian woman in the "make bitcoin great again" hat](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jun/7/kiara-robles-pepper-sprayed-trump-supporter-from-b/) ~~with a metal pole~~ (also at Berkeley).
			
			> if the only recourse for protest is for students who don't like the talk is to entirely revoke their membership
			
			WTF are you talking about?  All they need to do is not attend.  If they want to be involved, they can get involved in the process to decide by what means speakers can be invited.  But they don't like doing that, because other people also get a voice.
			
			edit: I believe there were pole-beatings as well at the protest with the red-hat woman. But I can't find references to whether she was beaten herself.

	>Conservatives have been the ones banning books from libraries. 

	I think the complaint there is that public funds are being used. But usually I hear about this in the context of public school libraries, when conservatives think the content is inappropriate. And, again, it's public funds.

	Strict Libertarians oppose both government-owned schools and government-owned libraries.

	I cannot recall ever hearing of a conservative advocating the banning of books in general.

	I think the vast majority don't care about speech, books, etc., if no public funds are used to publish, purchase, or promote them.

	>Conservatives have been trying to pass "don't say gay" 

	Except that it doesn't say that. Read the text of the law. Not even close. And the "stop woke" thing is also about publicly-funded speech.

	I find the anti-BDS legislation troubling from a constitutional perspective, even though I am anti-BDS myself.
