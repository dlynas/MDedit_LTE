## Was Checking Soviet Expansionism a Real Political Goal of the US in the Cold War?

	If you read something like Melvin Leffler’s Preponderance of Power or his later work Safeguarding Democratic Capitalism, he makes a pretty persuasive case that American leadership was well aware that the Soviets were not looking to engage in active expansion of their zone of influence after World War II.  Per, Leffler, thst didn’t mean that the leadership felt the Soviets wouldn’t take advantage of the weakness of Western European governments and the economic upheaval after the war as well as potentially exploiting anti-colonial nationalism.  So U.S. policy became a combination of creating a perception (at least) of potentially overwhelming power to deter the Soviets simultaneously with rebuilding Western Europe.  A major dilemma of thst policy choice was that Western European states needed (or felt they needed) access to the resciurces of their colonies at the same time those colonies were demanding the independence they felt that both the Americans and the Soviets were competing to provide them.  

	So if the question is was U.S. policy based on a fear of a “biggie commie plot” the answer is pretty much no.  If it’s whether there was a concern that the Soviets could spread communism in a way that ultimately threatened the U.S. if the U.S. didn’t take steps to promote global stability under something like free market auspices, the answer is yes.

	The weird part here for me is that everyone is bashing Kissinger for pursuing an amoral strategy (he did), but that strategy really wasn’t that far from the mainstream (Leffler points that out) AND the Nixon Administration was the first one to actually deal with the Soviets largely on the basis that they were a normal state, which you’d think certain members of the Left would appreciate.

		Maybe this would best be left for another thread, but could you elaborate on this? How was the US uniquely treating the Soviet Union before Nixon, and how is Nixon such a fundamental change?

			Kissinger and Nixon approached foreign policy from a great power-esque, realist perspective.  If you read Kissinger’s memoirs, he saw himself as something of a 20th century version of Metternich orchestrating balance of power politics across the globe.  For a brief period of Detente, the Soviets stopped being a collection of moral lepers who threatened the U.S. at every turn and became players in the same great game with the United States.  
			
			In part, this approach was forced on the U.S. as a result of Vietnam and the attendant relative decline in American power and prestige—together with growing Soviet power, it forced them to deal with the Soviets as equals. In part, it was a product of the fact that others wanted to pursue that kind of policy but only Nixon could do it because if anybody else did they’d have been attacked by none other than Richard Nixon, who had been a Cold Warrior par excellence.  
			
			The upshot, though, was that beginning in late 1969 through the early Carter years the U.S. took a lot of the moral condemnation of the Soviet Union off the table (Kissinger was most assuredly not and devotee of human rights) and engaged in detente.  That began to break down under Carter and finally snapped with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.  At that point, detente was dead and the U.S. was back to calling the Soviets the “Evil Empire.”  
			
			Kissinger himself probably overstates how dramatic the departure was (he wasn’t particularly modest, and no one ever got famous for “tinkering around the edges”), but the fact is an important tenet of U.S. policy was always that democratic capitalism and development were morally superior to communism.  By pivoting to an idea of great power politics, Kissinger to a fair degree abandoned that approach and treated the Soviet Union like a “normal state.”  My throw away point was just that the harder left at the time wanted exactly that and so criticism of Kissinger might be tempered by acknowledging that.

				I mean, are you speaking specifically to people critical of Kissinger's engagement with the USSR? If so, then sure, but there is just so much more to be critical of Kissinger for. Him treating China and the USSR like normal states in no way tempers my condemnation of him, and the belief that he should've been put on trial for war crimes like 5 different times. Although I am not a communist, so maybe I'm not the target you are referring to.

					It’s more the sense, after Kissinger’s death, that he was somehow uniquely evil among American foreign policy makers.  I mean, Eisenhower gets plaudits but was responsible for overthrowing Arbenz in Guatemala.  The Kennedys tried to overthrow Castro.  When Nixon passed, he was lauded as an elder statesman DESPITE Watergate and being at least as responsible for all the same stuff Kissinger pulled (ffs, George McGovern said nice things).  
					
					It is somewhat far afield from the original topic, but to go back to the work of Leffler he makes a persuasive case that Kissinger and Nixon didn’t depart all that much from the mainstream of post-World War II U.S. policy, which makes the vituperation heaped on Kissinger at his death all the more interesting.  Is Kissinger being singled out and, if so, why (it could just be longevity—most of his contemporaries are long dead).
