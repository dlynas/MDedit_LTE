The **Cambodian genocide**<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-2">[a]</a></sup> was the systematic persecution and killing of Cambodian citizens<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-4">[b]</a></sup> by the [Khmer Rouge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge "Khmer Rouge") under the leadership of [Prime Minister](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Cambodia "Prime Minister of Cambodia") of [Democratic Kampuchea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Kampuchea "Democratic Kampuchea"), [Pol Pot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Pot "Pol Pot"). It resulted in the deaths of 1.5 to 2 million people from 1975 to 1979, nearly 25% of Cambodia's population in 1975 (c. 7.8 million).<sup id="cite_ref-Heuveline,_Patrick_2001_5-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Heuveline,_Patrick_2001-5">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CAS_6-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-CAS-6">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Locard_7-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Locard-7">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-8">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-9">[7]</a></sup>

## Historical background [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cambodian_genocide&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Historical background")

### Rise of the Khmer Rouge [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cambodian_genocide&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Rise of the Khmer Rouge")

#### Cambodian Civil War [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cambodian_genocide&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Cambodian Civil War")

In 1968, the [Khmer Rouge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge "Khmer Rouge") officially launched a nation-wide [insurgency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency "Insurgency") across Cambodia. Even though the government of [North Vietnam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vietnam "North Vietnam") had not been informed about the Khmer Rouge's decision, its forces provided shelter and weapons to the Khmer Rouge after the insurgency began. North Vietnamese support for the Khmer Rouge's insurgency made it impossible for the Cambodian military to effectively counter it. For the next two years, the insurgency grew because [Norodom Sihanouk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norodom_Sihanouk "Norodom Sihanouk") did very little to stop it. As the insurgency grew in strength, the party openly declared itself to be the Communist Party of Kampuchea.<sup id="cite_ref-Frey_46-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Frey-46">[40]</a></sup>

Sihanouk was [deposed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_coup_of_1970 "Cambodian coup of 1970") in 1970 by Premier [Lon Nol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lon_Nol "Lon Nol"), with the support of the [National Assembly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_of_Cambodia "National Assembly of Cambodia"), establishing the pro-United States [Khmer Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Republic "Khmer Republic"). On the [Chinese Communist Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party "Chinese Communist Party") (CCP)'s advice, Sihanouk, who was in exile in [Beijing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing "Beijing"), formed an alliance with the Khmer Rouge, and became the nominal head of a Khmer Rouge–dominated government-in-exile (known by its French acronym, [GRUNK](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRUNK "GRUNK")) backed by China. Although thoroughly aware of the weakness of Lon Nol's forces and loath to commit American military force to the new conflict in any form other than air power, the [Nixon administration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_administration "Nixon administration") announced its support for the new Khmer Republic.<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-47">[41]</a></sup>

On 29 March 1970, North Vietnam launched an offensive against the Cambodian army. Documents which were uncovered from the [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")'s archives reveal that the invasion was launched at the Khmer Rouge's explicit request after negotiations were held with Nuon Chea.<sup id="cite_ref-Mosyakov_48-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Mosyakov-48">[42]</a></sup> A North Vietnamese force quickly overran large parts of eastern Cambodia, reaching within 15 miles (24 km) of [Phnom Penh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phnom_Penh "Phnom Penh") before being pushed back. By June, three months after Sihanouk's removal, they had swept government forces from the entire northeastern third of the country. After defeating those forces, the Vietnamese turned the newly won territories over to the local insurgents. The Khmer Rouge also established "liberated" areas in the southern and southwestern parts of the country, where they operated independently of the Vietnamese.<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-49">[43]</a></sup>

After Sihanouk demonstrated his support for the Khmer Rouge by visiting them in the field, their ranks swelled from 6,000 to 50,000 fighters. Many of the Khmer Rouge's new recruits were apolitical peasants who fought in support of the King, rather than for [communism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism "Communism"), of which they had little understanding.<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-50">[44]</a></sup>

By 1975, with Lon Nol's government running out of ammunition due to its loss of support from the U.S., it was clear that its collapse was imminent. On 17 April 1975, the Khmer Rouge [captured Phnom Penh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Phnom_Penh "Fall of Phnom Penh") and ended the civil war. Mortality estimates for the Cambodian Civil War vary widely. Sihanouk used a figure of 600,000 civil war deaths,<sup id="cite_ref-Sharp_51-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Sharp-51">[45]</a></sup> while [Elizabeth Becker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Becker "Elizabeth Becker") reported over a million civil war deaths, military and civilian included.<sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-52">[46]</a></sup> Other researchers were unable to corroborate such high estimates.<sup id="cite_ref-Tufts.edu_53-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Tufts.edu-53">[47]</a></sup> Marek Sliwinski notes that many estimates of the dead are open to question and may have been used for propaganda, suggesting that the true number lies between 240,000 and 310,000.<sup id="cite_ref-Sliwinski_54-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Sliwinski-54">[48]</a></sup> Judith Banister and E. Paige Johnson described 275,000 war deaths as "the highest mortality that we can justify".<sup id="cite_ref-Banister,_Judith_1993_55-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Banister,_Judith_1993-55">[49]</a></sup> Patrick Heuveline states that "Subsequent reevaluations of the demographic data situated the death toll for the \[civil war\] in the order of 300,000 or less".<sup id="cite_ref-Heuveline,_Patrick_2001_5-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Heuveline,_Patrick_2001-5">[3]</a></sup>

#### United States bombing campaign [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cambodian_genocide&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: United States bombing campaign")

From 1970 to 1973, a massive United States [bombing campaign](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Freedom_Deal "Operation Freedom Deal") against the Khmer Rouge devastated rural Cambodia.<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-56">[50]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Cultural_Survival_Quarterly_57-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Cultural_Survival_Quarterly-57">[51]</a></sup> An earlier U.S. bombing campaign of Cambodia began on 18 March 1969 with [Operation Breakfast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Menu "Operation Menu"), but U.S. bombing in Cambodia had commenced years before that.<sup id="cite_ref-Tufts.edu_53-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Tufts.edu-53">[47]</a></sup>

The number of Cambodian civilian and Khmer Rouge deaths caused by U.S. bombing is disputed and difficult to disentangle from the broader [Cambodian Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_Civil_War "Cambodian Civil War").<sup id="cite_ref-Sliwinski_54-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Sliwinski-54">[48]</a></sup> Estimates range from 30,000 to 500,000.<sup id="cite_ref-Valentino_58-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Valentino-58">[52]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-59">[53]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-60">[54]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-PBS_Frontline_61-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-PBS_Frontline-61">[55]</a></sup> Sliwinski estimates that approximately 17% of total civil war deaths can be attributed to U.S. bombing, noting that this is far behind the leading causes of death, as the U.S. bombing was concentrated in underpopulated border areas.<sup id="cite_ref-Sliwinski_54-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Sliwinski-54">[48]</a></sup> [Ben Kiernan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Kiernan "Ben Kiernan") attributes 50,000 to 150,000 deaths to the U.S. bombing.<sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-62">[56]</a></sup>

The relationship between the United States' massive bombing of Cambodia and the growth of the Khmer Rouge in recruitment and popular support has been a matter of interest to historians. Some scholars, including [Michael Ignatieff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ignatieff "Michael Ignatieff"), [Adam Jones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Jones_(Canadian_scholar) "Adam Jones (Canadian scholar)")<sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-63">[57]</a></sup> and [Greg Grandin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Grandin "Greg Grandin"),<sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-64">[58]</a></sup> have cited the United States intervention and bombing campaign from 1965 to 1973 as a significant factor that led to increased support for the Khmer Rouge among the Cambodian peasantry.<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-65">[59]</a></sup> According to Ben Kiernan, the Khmer Rouge "would not have won power without U.S. economic and military destabilization of Cambodia. ...

[Pol Pot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Pot "Pol Pot") in 1978

Since the 1950s, [Pol Pot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Pot "Pol Pot") had made frequent visits to the [People's Republic of China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China "People's Republic of China"), where he received political and military training—especially on the theory of the _[dictatorship of the proletariat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat "Dictatorship of the proletariat")_—from the personnel of the CCP.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_10-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:0-10">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:32_12-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:32-12">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:02_71-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:02-71">[65]</a></sup> From November 1965 to February 1966, high-ranking CCP officials such as [Chen Boda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Boda "Chen Boda") and [Zhang Chunqiao](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Chunqiao "Zhang Chunqiao") trained him on topics such as the [communist revolution in China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_revolution_in_China "Communist revolution in China"), [class conflicts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_conflict "Class conflict"), [Communist International](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_International "Communist International"), etc.<sup id="cite_ref-:02_71-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:02-71">[65]</a></sup> Pol Pot also met with other officials, including [Deng Xiaoping](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping "Deng Xiaoping") and [Peng Zhen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peng_Zhen "Peng Zhen").<sup id="cite_ref-:9_72-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:9-72">[66]</a></sup> He was particularly impressed by [Kang Sheng](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kang_Sheng "Kang Sheng")'s lecture on how to conduct a [political purge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purge "Purge").<sup id="cite_ref-:0_10-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:0-10">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:02_71-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:02-71">[65]</a></sup>

[Mao Zedong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong "Mao Zedong"), [Peng Zhen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peng_Zhen "Peng Zhen"), [Norodom Sihanouk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norodom_Sihanouk "Norodom Sihanouk") and [Liu Shaoqi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Shaoqi "Liu Shaoqi") (1965)

In 1970, Lon Nol overthrew Sihanouk, who fled to Beijing, where Pol Pot was also visiting. On the advice of the CCP, the Khmer Rouge changed its position, and in order to support Sihanouk, it established the [National United Front of Kampuchea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_United_Front_of_Kampuchea "National United Front of Kampuchea").

In June 1975, Pol Pot and other Khmer Rouge officials met with [Mao Zedong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong "Mao Zedong") in Beijing, where Mao lectured Pol Pot on his "Theory of Continuing Revolution under the Dictatorship of the Proletariat (无产阶级专政下继续革命理论)", recommending two articles which were written by [Yao Wenyuan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao_Wenyuan "Yao Wenyuan") and sending Pol Pot over 30 books which were authored by [Karl Marx](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx "Karl Marx"), [Friedrich Engels](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Engels "Friedrich Engels"), [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin"), and [Joseph Stalin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin") as gifts.<sup id="cite_ref-:32_12-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:32-12">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:2_14-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:2-14">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:9_72-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:9-72">[66]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:02_71-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:02-71">[65]</a></sup> During this meeting, Mao said to Pol Pot:<sup id="cite_ref-:32_12-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:32-12">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:2_14-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:2-14">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:42_75-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:42-75">[69]</a></sup>

> We agree with you! Much of your experience is better than ours. China is not qualified to criticize you. We committed errors of the political routes for ten times in fifty years—some are national, some are local…Thus I say China has no qualification to criticize you but to applaud you. You are basically correct…During the transition from the democratic revolution to adopting a socialist path, there exist two possibilities: one is socialism, the other is capitalism. Our situation now is like this. Fifty years from now, or one hundred years from now, the struggle between two lines will exist. Even ten thousand years from now, the struggle between two lines will still exist. When Communism is realized, the struggle between two lines will still be there. Otherwise, you are not a Marxist. This is unity existing among opposites. If one mentions only one side of the two, this is metaphysics. I believe in what Marx and Lenin have said, the that path \[of advance\] would be tortuous ... Our state now is, as Lenin said, a capitalist state without capitalists. This state protects capitalist rights, and the wages are not equal. Under the slogan of equality, a system of inequality has been introduced. There will exist a struggle between two lines, the struggle between the advanced and the backward, even when Communism is realized. Today we cannot explain it completely.

Pol Pot replied: "The issue of lines of struggle raised by Chairman Mao is an important strategic issue. We will follow your words in the future. I have read and learned various works of Chairman Mao since I was young, especially the theory on _[people's war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_war "People's war")_.

During the transition period, Pol Pot made an official visit to China in July 1977 and he was welcomed by chairman [Hua Guofeng](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hua_Guofeng "Hua Guofeng") and other high-ranking CCP officials, with the _[People's Daily](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Daily "People's Daily")_ calling him the "Comrade from Cambodia" (柬埔寨战友).<sup id="cite_ref-81"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-81">[75]</a></sup> Pot also toured around the agricultural production model of [Dazhai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dazhai "Dazhai"), a product of Mao's era. [Chen Yonggui](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Yonggui "Chen Yonggui"), [Vice Premier of China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_Premier_of_China "Vice Premier of China") and the leader of Dazhai, visited Cambodia in December 1977, commending the achievement of its movement towards communism.<sup id="cite_ref-82"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-82">[76]</a></sup>

In 1978, [Son Sen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_Sen "Son Sen"), a Khmer Rouge leader and the [Minister of National Defense](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_National_Defence_(Cambodia) "Ministry of National Defence (Cambodia)") of [Democratic Kampuchea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Kampuchea "Democratic Kampuchea"), visited China and obtained its approval for military aid.<sup id="cite_ref-:132_83-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:132-83">[77]</a></sup> In the same year, high-ranking CCP officials such as [Wang Dongxing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Dongxing "Wang Dongxing") and [Deng Yingchao](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Yingchao "Deng Yingchao") visited Cambodia to offer support.<sup id="cite_ref-:132_83-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:132-83">[77]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-84"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-84">[78]</a></sup>

In order to counter the power of the [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") and Vietnam in [Southeast Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia "Southeast Asia"), China officially condemned the Vietnamese invasion and continued its material support to the Khmer Rouge.

Deng was convinced by a conversation with Singapore's prime minister [Lee Kuan Yew](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew "Lee Kuan Yew") to limit the scale and duration of the war.

## Ideology [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cambodian_genocide&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Ideology")

[Ideology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology "Ideology") played an important role in the [genocide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide "Genocide"). Pol Pot was influenced by [Marxism–Leninism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism "Marxism–Leninism") and he wanted to transform Cambodia into an entirely [self-sufficient](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sustainability "Self-sustainability") [agrarian socialist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrarian_socialism "Agrarian socialism") society that would be free from foreign influences. Stalin's work has been described as a "crucial formative influence" on his thought. Also heavily influential was Mao's work, particularly _On New Democracy_. [Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau "Jean-Jacques Rousseau") was one of his favorite authors, according to historian David Chandler. In the mid-1960s, Pol Pot reformulated his ideas about Marxism–Leninism to suit the Cambodian situation with goals such as bringing Cambodia back to an alleged mythic past of the powerful [Khmer Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Empire "Khmer Empire"), eradicating influences he viewed as "corrupting", such as [foreign aid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_aid "Foreign aid") and [Western culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture "Western culture"), as well as restoring Cambodia's [agrarian society](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrarian_society "Agrarian society").<sup id="cite_ref-95"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-95">[89]</a></sup>

Pol Pot's strong belief that Cambodia needed to be transformed into an agrarian [utopia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia "Utopia") stemmed from his experience in Cambodia's rural northeast—where he developed an affinity for the agrarian self-sufficiency of the area's isolated tribes—while the Khmer Rouge gained power.<sup id="cite_ref-96"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-96">[90]</a></sup> Attempts to implement these goals (formed upon the observations of small, rural communes) into a larger society were key factors in the ensuing genocide.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAlvarez200150_97-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAlvarez200150-97">[91]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAlvarez200716_98-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAlvarez200716-98">[92]</a></sup> One Khmer Rouge leader said that the killings were meant for the "purification of the populace."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHannum198988–89_99-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHannum198988%E2%80%9389-99">[93]</a></sup> The Khmer Rouge virtually forced Cambodia's entire population to divide itself into mobile work teams.<sup id="cite_ref-Hunt_100-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Hunt-100">[94]</a></sup> Michael Hunt has written that it was "an experiment in social mobilization unmatched in twentieth-century revolutions."<sup id="cite_ref-Hunt_100-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Hunt-100">[94]</a></sup> The Khmer Rouge used a [forced labor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_labor "Forced labor") regime, starvation, [forced resettlement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_resettlement "Forced resettlement"), [land collectivization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_farming "Collective farming"), and [state terror](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_terror "State terror") to keep the population in line.<sup id="cite_ref-Hunt_100-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Hunt-100">[94]</a></sup> The Khmer Rouge's economic plan was named the "Maha Lout Ploh",<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Template_index/Translation#not_English-inline" title="Wikipedia:Template index/Translation">needs translation</a></i>]</sup> a direct allusion to the "[Great Leap Forward](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward "Great Leap Forward")" of China that caused tens of millions of deaths in the [Great Chinese Famine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine "Great Chinese Famine").<sup id="cite_ref-:0_10-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:0-10">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:5_101-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:5-101">[95]</a></sup>

Rooms of the [Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuol_Sleng_Genocide_Museum "Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum") contain thousands of photos taken by the Khmer Rouge of their victims

Ethnic [Vietnamese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_people "Vietnamese people"), ethnic [Thai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_people "Thai people"), ethnic [Chinese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Cambodians "Chinese Cambodians"), ethnic [Cham](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chams "Chams"), [Cambodian Christians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Cambodia#Christianity "Religion in Cambodia"), and other minorities were also targeted for persecution and genocide. The Khmer Rouge forcibly relocated minority groups and [banned their languages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_discrimination "Linguistic discrimination"). By decree, the Khmer Rouge banned the existence of more than 20 minority groups, which constituted 15% of Cambodia's population.<sup id="cite_ref-specter_121-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-specter-121">[115]</a></sup> While Cambodians in general were victims of the Khmer Rouge regime, the persecution, torture, and [killings committed by the Khmer Rouge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge_Killing_Fields "Khmer Rouge Killing Fields") are considered an act of genocide according to the United Nations as ethnic and religious minorities were systematically targeted by Pol Pot and his regime.<sup id="cite_ref-122"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-122">[116]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-123"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-123">[117]</a></sup>

Scholars and historians have varying opinions on whether the persecution and killings which occurred during the rule of the Khmer Rouge should be considered genocide. These conflicting opinions exist because scholars who conducted research in Cambodia immediately after the fall of the Khmer Rouge regime in 1979 claimed that the victims could have been killed due to the circumstances which they were living under. For instance, [Michael Vickery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Vickery "Michael Vickery") opined that the killings were "largely the result of the spontaneous excesses of a vengeful, undisciplined peasant army."<sup id="cite_ref-124"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-124">[118]</a></sup>

This point of view was also supported by [Alexander Hinton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hinton "Alexander Hinton"), who cited an account by a former Khmer Rouge cadre who claimed that the killings were acts of retribution for the atrocities which were perpetrated by Lon Nol's soldiers when they killed people who were known to be former [Viet Minh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Minh "Viet Minh") agents<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEEtcheson200545–47_125-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEtcheson200545%E2%80%9347-125">[119]</a></sup> before Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge's rise to power. Vickery—erroneously, as has been proven by the research which was more recently conducted by [Ben Kiernan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Kiernan "Ben Kiernan")—argued that the number of Cham victims who were killed during the Khmer Rouge's rule of Cambodia was around 20,000<sup id="cite_ref-126"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-126">[120]</a></sup> which would still be a substantial part of the Cham group and would thus constitute the crime of genocide by Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge. The killings were a centralized and bureaucratic effort which was undertaken by the Khmer Rouge regime, according to documents which were recently published by the [Documentation Center of Cambodia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation_Center_of_Cambodia "Documentation Center of Cambodia") (DC-Cam) as a result of the discovery of Khmer Rouge internal security documents which instructed the killings across Cambodia.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEEtcheson200578–79_127-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEtcheson200578%E2%80%9379-127">[121]</a></sup> However there were also instances of "indiscipline and spontaneity in the mass killings."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEEtcheson200584–85_128-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEtcheson200584%E2%80%9385-128">[122]</a></sup> On top of that, Etcheson has also proven that as a result of the systematic and mass killings which were based on political affiliations, ethnicity, religion, and citizenship, a third of Cambodia's population perished, so the Khmer Rouge is effectively guilty of committing genocide.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEEtcheson200510–11_129-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEtcheson200510%E2%80%9311-129">[123]</a></sup>

David Chandler has argued that, even though ethnic minorities fell victim to the Khmer Rouge regime, they were not specifically targeted by it because of their ethnic backgrounds, instead, they were targeted because they were considered enemies of the regime.<sup id="cite_ref-130"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-130">[124]</a></sup> Chandler also rejects the use of the terms "chauvinism" and "genocide" just to avoid drawing possible parallels to Hitler. This indicates that Chandler does not believe in the argument of charging the Khmer Rouge regime with the crime of genocide. Similarly, Michael Vickery holds a similar position to Chandler's, and refuses to acknowledge the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge regime as genocide; Vickery regarded the Khmer Rouge a "chauvinist" regime, due to its anti-Vietnam and anti-religion policies.<sup id="cite_ref-131"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-131">[125]</a></sup> Stephen Heder also believed that the Khmer Rouge were not guilty of genocide, stating that the atrocities of the regime were not motivated by [racism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism "Racism").<sup id="cite_ref-132"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-132">[126]</a></sup>

Ben Kiernan makes the argument that it was indeed a genocide and he disagrees with these three scholars, by bringing forth examples from the history of the Cham people in Cambodia, as did an international tribunal finding [Nuon Chea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuon_Chea "Nuon Chea") and Khieu Samphan guilty of 92 and 87 counts of said crime respectively.<sup id="cite_ref-133"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-133">[127]</a></sup>

#### Vietnamese [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cambodian_genocide&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Vietnamese")

The Khmer Rouge officially blamed minority groups, particularly the Cham and the Vietnamese, for the country's ills.<sup id="cite_ref-134"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-134">[128]</a></sup> The regime initially ordered the expulsion of ethnic Vietnamese from Cambodia but then conducted large scale massacres of large numbers of Vietnamese civilians who were being deported out of Cambodia.<sup id="cite_ref-135"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-135">[129]</a></sup> The regime then prevented the remaining 20,000 ethnic Vietnamese from fleeing, and much of this group was also executed.<sup id="cite_ref-:8_35-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:8-35">[29]</a></sup> The Khmer Rouge also used the media to support their goals of genocide. Radio Phnom Penh called on Cambodians to "exterminate the 50 million Vietnamese."<sup id="cite_ref-136"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-136">[130]</a></sup>

Additionally, the Khmer Rouge conducted many cross-border raids into Vietnam, where they slaughtered an estimated 30,000 Vietnamese civilians.<sup id="cite_ref-137"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-137">[131]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-138"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-138">[132]</a></sup> Most notably, during the [Ba Chúc massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba_Ch%C3%BAc_massacre "Ba Chúc massacre") in April 1978, the Khmer Rouge military crossed the border and entered the village, slaughtering 3,157 Vietnamese civilians.

#### Chinese [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cambodian_genocide&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Chinese")

The state of the Chinese Cambodians during the rule of the Khmer Rouge regime was alleged to be "the worst disaster ever to befall any ethnic Chinese community in Southeast Asia."<sup id="cite_ref-specter_121-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-specter-121">[115]</a></sup> Cambodians of Chinese descent were massacred by the Khmer Rouge under the justification that they "used to exploit the Cambodian people".<sup id="cite_ref-rpg_141-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-rpg-141">[135]</a></sup> The Chinese were stereotyped as traders and moneylenders associated with capitalism, while historically the group had attracted resentment due to their lighter [skin color](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_color "Skin color") and cultural differences.<sup id="cite_ref-Hinton_142-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Hinton-142">[136]</a></sup> Hundreds of Cham, Chinese and Khmer families were rounded up in 1978 and told that they were to be resettled, but were actually executed.<sup id="cite_ref-rpg_141-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-rpg-141">[135]</a></sup>

At the beginning of the rule of the Khmer Rouge regime in 1975, there were 425,000 ethnic Chinese in Cambodia. By the end of 1979, there were just 200,000, most of them were stuck in Thai refugee camps and the rest of them were stuck in Cambodia. 170,000 Chinese fled from Cambodia and moved to Vietnam, and others were repatriated.<sup id="cite_ref-143"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-143">[137]</a></sup> The Chinese were predominantly city-dwellers, making them vulnerable to the Khmer Rouge's revolutionary ruralism and its evacuation of city residents to farms.<sup id="cite_ref-specter_121-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-specter-121">[115]</a></sup> The government of the People's Republic of China did not protest against the killings of ethnic Chinese in Cambodia,<sup id="cite_ref-144"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-144">[138]</a></sup> despite its awareness of the atrocities and its simultaneous condemnation of the Vietnamese government's mistreatment of ethnic Chinese who lived in Vietnam.<sup id="cite_ref-145"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-145">[139]</a></sup>

#### Cham Muslims [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cambodian_genocide&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Cham Muslims")

According to Ben Kiernan, the "fiercest extermination campaign was directed against the ethnic [Chams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chams "Chams"), Cambodia's Muslim minority."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKiernan200330_146-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKiernan200330-146">[140]</a></sup> [Islam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam "Islam") was seen as an "alien" and "foreign" culture that did not belong in the new Communist system. Initially, the Khmer Rouge aimed for the "[forced assimilation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_assimilation "Forced assimilation")" of Chams through population dispersal. Pol Pot then began using intimidation efforts against the Chams that included the assassination of village elders, but he ultimately ordered the full-scale mass killing of the Cham people. American professor [Samuel Totten](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Totten "Samuel Totten") and Australian professor [Paul R. Bartrop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_R._Bartrop "Paul R. Bartrop") estimate that these efforts would have completely wiped out the Cham population were it not for the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge in 1979. In a Khmer Rouge official meeting took place in Sector 41, [Kampong Cham province](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kampong_Cham_province "Kampong Cham province") in 1977, a plan was proclaimed up to "smash enemies of the revolution", stating that "the enemies of the revolution are many, but our biggest enemy are Cham. So the Plan calls for the destruction of all the Cham people before 1980." In fact, more telegrams were sent from Pol Pot to local governments between 1978 to 1979 than usual hastily ordered the total eradication of the Cham must be achieved before 1980.<sup id="cite_ref-Totten_147-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Totten-147">[141]</a></sup>

The Cham began to rise in prominence when they joined the communists as early as the 1950s, with a Cham elder, Sos Man joining the [Indochina Communist Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indochinese_Communist_Party "Indochinese Communist Party") and rising through the ranks to become a major in the Party's forces. He then returned home to the Eastern Zone in 1970 and joined the [Communist Party of Kampuchea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Kampuchea "Communist Party of Kampuchea") (CPK), and he co-established the Eastern Zone Islamic Movement with his son, Mat Ly. Together, they became the mouthpiece of the Khmer Rouge and they encouraged the Cham people to participate in the revolution. Sos Man's Islamic Movement was also tolerated by the Khmer Rouge's leadership between 1970–1975. The Chams were gradually forced to abandon their faith and their distinct practices, a campaign which was launched in the Southwest as early as 1972.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKiernan2002258_148-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKiernan2002258-148">[142]</a></sup>

Ten Cham villages were taken over by the Khmer Rouge in 1972–1973, where new Cham leaders were installed, and they forced the villagers to work in the fields which were located away from their hometowns. A witness who was interviewed by Kiernan asserts that at that time, they were well-treated by the Khmer Rouge, and in 1974, they were allowed to return to their homes.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKiernan2002259_149-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKiernan2002259-149">[143]</a></sup> Moreover, the Cham were classified as "depositee base people", making them vulnerable to persecution.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Between 1972 and 1974, the Khmer Rouge intensified the enforcement of the restrictions which they imposed on the Cham because they believed that the Cham were a threat to their communist agenda due to the existence of their unique language, their culture, their beliefs, and their independent communal system. Additionally, the Cham were renamed "Islamic Khmers" in an attempt to disassociate them from their ancestral heritage and ethnicity and force them to assimilate into the larger and Khmer-dominated Democratic Kampuchea. The Khmer Rouge believed that the Cham would jeopardize their attempts to establish close-knit communities where everyone could be easily monitored. As a result, the regime decided to disperse the Cham by deporting them from their respective localities and forcing them to work as peasants across Cambodia, hence forcing them to directly contribute to the creation and maintenance of the new Cambodian economy. This move was undertaken in an attempt to ensure that the Cham would not congregate in an attempt to form their own community again, which would have undermined the regime's plan to establish centralized economic cooperatives. Slowly, those Cham who defied the restrictions which the Khmer Rouge imposed on them were arrested by the regime. Hence, in October 1973, Cham Muslims in the Eastern Zone demonstrated their displeasure with the Khmer Rouge's restrictions by beating their drums—they traditionally beat their drums in order to inform locals that it is time to recite the daily prayers—at local [mosques](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque "Mosque"). This act of communal defiance prompted the blanket arrest of many Cham Muslim leaders and religious teachers.<sup id="cite_ref-:18_153-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:18-153">[147]</a></sup>

In February 1974, the Cham who lived in Region 31, which was located in the Western Zone, protested against the Khmer Rouge's policy which required fishermen to register their daily catch with the local cooperative and sell it to the cooperative at a low price. At the same time, the locals were also forced to buy those fish from the cooperative at a higher price. This policy prompted the locals to confront the cooperative to express their discontent, the locals were shot at, "killing and wounding more than 100", as one account put it. By December 1974, a rebellion by the Cham in Region 21 of the Eastern Zone had broken out against the Khmer Rouge after community leaders were arrested. The rebellion was forcefully repressed by the regime and no records of casualties were documented.<sup id="cite_ref-:18_153-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:18-153">[147]</a></sup>

As much as there are records of these restrictions, resistance, and repressions, there are also accounts by members of the Cham community which deny the oppression which it was subjected to by the regime between 1970 and early 1975. While restrictions on certain activities like trade and travel were imposed during that period, they were understood to be the by-products of the ongoing civil war. Moreover, some Cham had also joined the revolution as soldiers and members of the Khmer Rouge. According to some local accounts, people had confidence in the Khmer Rouge when they first came to the village communities which assisted the locals by providing food and provisions to them, and there were no bans on local cultures or religions; even if restrictions were imposed, the consequences of them were not harsh.<sup id="cite_ref-154"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-154">[148]</a></sup> Many regarded the Khmer Rouge as heroes because they believed that the Khmer Rouge supported the peasantry during its war against the United States backed government.<sup id="cite_ref-Hinton_142-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Hinton-142">[136]</a></sup> Because the Cham communities could be found across Cambodia, various Cham communities might have experienced the effects of the Khmer Rouge's pre-1975 rule differently; some communities experienced the repressions and restrictions but other communities did not. When Pol Pot consolidated his power by the end of 1975, the persecution became more severe, and it indiscriminately affected all of the Cham people. This could well be one of the simpler reasons as to why the Cambodian government and the [Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraordinary_Chambers_in_the_Courts_of_Cambodia "Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia") (ECCC) have not prosecuted any Khmer Rouge members who perpetrated atrocities during the pre-1975 period, the period before Pol Pot consolidated his power. As a result, the accounts of those Cham who experienced the repressions prior to 1975 were not considered parts of the genocide because the case for the systematic annihilation of a people based on ethnic or religious profiling was not concrete enough.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (August 2021)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

In 1975, upon the victory of the Khmer Rouge over the Khmer Republic's forces, two brothers of Cham descent who had joined the Khmer Rouge as soldiers returned home to Region 21 within the [Kampong Cham Province](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kampong_Cham_Province "Kampong Cham Province"), where the largest Cham Muslim community could be found. The brothers then told their father about the adventures which they had experienced as participants in the revolution, adventures which included the killing of Khmers and the consumption of pork, in the hope that they would be able to convince their father to join the communist cause. The father, who had remained silent, was clearly not impressed by the accounts which were given by his sons. Instead, he grabbed a cleaver, killed his sons, and told his fellow villagers that he had killed the enemy. When the villagers pointed out that he had murdered his own sons, he recounted the stories which his sons had previously told to him, citing the Khmer Rouge's hatred for Islam and the Cham people. This event prompted the villagers to make a unanimous agreement, that night, they would kill all Khmer Rouge soldiers who were stationed in the area. The next morning, more Khmer Rouge soldiers descended upon the area with heavy weapons, and they surrounded the village, killing every single villager in it.<sup id="cite_ref-155"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-155">[149]</a></sup>

Similarly, in June or July 1975, the Khmer Rouge authorities in Region 21 of the Eastern Zone tried to confiscate all copies of the [Qur'an](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qur%27an "Qur'an") from the people, and at the same time, they tried to impose a mandatory short haircut on Cham women. The authorities encountered a mass demonstration which was staged by members of the local Cham community who were shot at by the regime's soldiers. The Cham forcefully retaliated with swords and blades, killing a few soldiers, only to be retaliated against by the regime's military reinforcements, which annihilated the villagers and their property.<sup id="cite_ref-156"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-156">[150]</a></sup> In another account which was given by Cham refugees in Malaysia, thirteen leading figures within the Cham Muslim community were killed by the regime in June 1975. The supposed reason for the killings was because some of them were "leading prayers instead of attending a CPK meeting", while the others were purportedly "petitioning for the permission on marriage ceremonies."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKiernan2002263_157-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKiernan2002263-157">[151]</a></sup>

The events went from bad to worse in mid-1976 due to the rebellion, when the ethnic minorities were only allowed to pledge allegiance to the Khmer nationality and religion: there were to be no other identities besides the Khmer identity. Consequently, the Cham language was not spoken, communal eating in which everyone eats the same food became mandatory, forcing Cham Muslims to violate their religious beliefs by raising pigs and consuming pork.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKiernan2002269_158-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKiernan2002269-158">[152]</a></sup> One reason for the occurrence of such rebellions which has been offered by locals is the fact that some of the Cham who were involved in the Khmer Rouge as soldiers were anticipating the acquisition of positions of power once Pol Pot consolidated his power. In 1975, these soldiers were dismissed from the Khmer Rouge's forces, deprived of their Islamic practices and robbed of their ethnic identity.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKiernan2002264_159-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKiernan2002264-159">[153]</a></sup>

The patterns were consistent throughout the killings of the Cham people: first, the communal structures were dismantled as a result of the murder of Cham Muslim leaders, including [muftis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mufti "Mufti"), [imams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imam "Imam"), and other learned men of influence. Second, the Cham's Islamic and ethnic identities were both dismantled when the practices that distinguished the Cham from the Khmers were restricted. Third, the Cham were dispersed from their communities, they were either forced to perform labour in the fields or they were accused of plotting to incite acts of resistance or rebellions against the Khmer Rouge and arrested.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (August 2021)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> During the Khmer Rouge's rule of Cambodia, all religions, including [Buddhism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism "Buddhism"), [Christianity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity"), and Islam, were banned and adherents of them were persecuted. According to Cham sources, 132 mosques were destroyed during the Khmer Rouge's rule, many other mosques were desecrated, and Muslims were not allowed to practice their faith. Muslims were forced to eat pork and they were murdered when they refused to eat it. Whole Cham villages were exterminated. Chams were not permitted to speak their language. Cham children were separated from their parents and raised as Khmers.<sup id="cite_ref-160"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-160">[154]</a></sup> Orders which were given by the Khmer Rouge government in 1979 stated: "The Cham nation no longer exists on Kampuchean soil belonging to the Khmer. Accordingly, Cham nationality, language, customs and religious beliefs must be immediately abolished. Those who fail to obey this order will suffer all the consequences for their acts of opposition to [Angkar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkar "Angkar")."<sup id="cite_ref-161"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-161">[155]</a></sup>

After the end of the Khmer Rouge's rule, all religions were restored. Vickery believes that about 185,000 Cham lived in Cambodia in the mid-1980s and he also believes that the number of mosques was about the same then as it was before 1975. In early 1988, there were six mosques in the Phnom Penh area and a "good number" of mosques also existed in the provinces, but Muslim dignitaries were thinly stretched; only 20 of the previous 113 most prominent Cham clergy in Cambodia survived the rule of the Khmer Rouge period.<sup id="cite_ref-162"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-162">[156]</a></sup>

According to Ben Kiernan, the racialization of the Cham during the colonial and post-colonial eras could be the main reason behind the Khmer Rouge's hatred of the Cham people. Misinformation and racial stereotypes were used to disconnect the Cham from their ancestral homelands, including the Cham extinction theory that was proposed by colonial scholars, according to that theory, the "real" Cham were extinct. Kiernan writes: "In the twentieth century, Chams have suffered from two myths: the glory of their "empire" has been exaggerated, and so has their present plight. A romanticized view of Cham doom helped deprive them of rights in 1975–79. They were called "Malays" by the French, and after Cambodia's independence, received a new, equally inaccurate label: "Islamic Khmers." Again their ethnic origin was denied, in the perverse sense, Chams became victims of History."<sup id="cite_ref-163"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-163">[157]</a></sup> Scholars also compare the denial of the Khmer Rouge's racist motivation for its genocide against the Cham to the [denial of the Holocaust](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_denial "Holocaust denial"), both forms of [genocide denial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide_denial "Genocide denial") are analogous narrational canards that seek to use victims' religions to justify the actions of genocide perpetrators but they ignore wider race and ethnic hatreds and discriminatory backgrounds.<sup id="cite_ref-164"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-164">[158]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-165"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-165">[159]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-166"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-166">[160]</a></sup>

### Religious groups [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cambodian_genocide&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Religious groups")

Under the leadership of Pol Pot, who was an ardent [Marxist atheist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist-Leninist_atheism "Marxist-Leninist atheism"),<sup id="cite_ref-167"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-167">[161]</a></sup> the Khmer Rouge enforced a policy of [state atheism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_atheism "State atheism"). According to Catherine Wessinger, "Democratic Kampuchea was officially an atheist state, and the persecution of religion by the Khmer Rouge was only matched in severity by the persecution of religion in the [communist states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state "Communist state") of [Albania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Socialist_Republic_of_Albania "People's Socialist Republic of Albania") (see [Religion in communist Albania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Albania#Communism "Religion in Albania")) and [North Korea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea") (see [Freedom of religion in North Korea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_North_Korea "Freedom of religion in North Korea"))."<sup id="cite_ref-Wessinger2000_168-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Wessinger2000-168">[162]</a></sup> All religions were banned, and the repression of adherents of Islam,<sup id="cite_ref-169"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-169">[163]</a></sup> Christianity,<sup id="cite_ref-170"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-170">[164]</a></sup> and Buddhism was extensive.

### Internal purges [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cambodian_genocide&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Internal purges")

In 1978, in order to purge the Eastern Military Zone of those he perceived to have been contaminated by the Vietnamese, Pol Pot ordered military units from the Southwest Zone to move into eastern Kampuchea and eliminate the "hidden traitors". Unable to withstand an attack from the Kampuchea Government, [So Phim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_Phim "So Phim") committed suicide while his deputy [Heng Samrin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heng_Samrin "Heng Samrin") defected to Vietnam. The series of massacres in the Eastern Zone were the most serious of all of the massacres which took place during the Pol Pot regime's genocide.<sup id="cite_ref-Ben_Kiernan_1987_173-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Ben_Kiernan_1987-173">[167]</a></sup>

## Use of children [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cambodian_genocide&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Use of children")

The Khmer Rouge exploited thousands of desensitized, conscripted children in their early teens to commit mass murder and other atrocities during and after the genocide. The indoctrinated children were taught to follow any order without hesitation.<sup id="cite_ref-:10_40-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:10-40">[34]</a></sup>

The organization continued to use children extensively until at least 1998, often forcibly recruiting them. During this period, the children were deployed mainly in unpaid support roles, such as ammunition-carriers, and also as combatants. Many children had fled the Khmer Rouge without a means to feed themselves and believed that joining the government forces would enable them to survive, although local commanders frequently denied them any pay.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_174-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:4-174">[168]</a></sup>

## Torture and human experimentation [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cambodian_genocide&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Torture and human experimentation")

The Khmer Rouge regime is also well known for practicing [torturous medical experiments](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation "Unethical human experimentation") on prisoners. People were imprisoned and tortured merely on suspicion of opposing the regime or because other prisoners gave their names under torture. Whole families (including women and children) ended up in prisons and were tortured because the Khmer Rouge feared that if they did not do this, their intended victims' relatives would seek revenge. Pol Pot said, "if you want to kill the grass, you also have to kill the roots".<sup id="cite_ref-175"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-175">[169]</a></sup> Most prisoners did not even know why they had been imprisoned and, if they dared to ask the prison guards, the guards would answer only by saying that [Angkar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkar "Angkar") (the Communist Party of Kampuchea) never makes mistakes, which meant that they must have done something illegal.<sup id="cite_ref-huyvannak2010_pp32-35_176-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-huyvannak2010_pp32-35-176">[170]</a></sup>

There are many accounts of torture in both the Security Prison 21 records and the documents of the trial; as told by the survivor [Bou Meng](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bou_Meng "Bou Meng") in his book (written by Huy Vannak), tortures were so atrocious and heinous that the prisoners tried in every way to commit suicide, even using spoons, and their hands were constantly tied behind their back to prevent them from committing suicide or trying to escape. When it was believed that they could not provide any further useful information, they were blindfolded and sent to the [Killing Fields](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Fields "Killing Fields"), which were mass graves where prisoners were killed at night with metal tools such as scythes or nails and hammers (since bullets were too expensive). Often times, their screams were covered with loudspeakers playing propaganda music of Democratic Kampuchea and noise from generator sets.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Inside S-21, a special treatment was given to babies and children; they were taken away from their mothers and relatives, and sent to the Killing Fields, where they were smashed against the so-called [Chankiri Tree](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chankiri_Tree "Chankiri Tree"). A similar treatment is supposed to have been given to babies of other prisons like S-21, spread all over Democratic Kampuchea. S-21 also had a few Westerners who had been captured by the regime. One was the British teacher [John Dawson Dewhirst](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dawson_Dewhirst "John Dawson Dewhirst"), captured by the Khmer Rouge while he was on a yacht. One guard of S-21, Cheam Soeu, said that one of the Westerners had been burned alive, but [Kang Kek Iew](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kang_Kek_Iew "Kang Kek Iew") ("Comrade Duch") denied that. He said that Pol Pot asked him to burn their corpses (after death) and that "nobody would dare to violate my order".<sup id="cite_ref-177"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-177">[171]</a></sup> Tortures were meant not only to force prisoners to confess but for the prison guards' amusement.

The previous doctors were killed or sent to the countryside to work as farmers during the Khmer Rouge and the library of the Medical Faculty in Phnom Penh was set on fire. The regime then employed child medics, who were just teenagers with no or very little training. They did not have any knowledge of Western medicine (which had been forbidden since it was considered a capitalist invention), and they had to practice their own medical experiments and make progress by themselves. They did not have Western medicines (since Cambodia, according to the Khmer Rouge, had to be self-sufficient) and all medical experiments were systematically conducted without proper anesthetics.<sup id="cite_ref-d.dccam.org_179-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-d.dccam.org-179">[173]</a></sup> A medic who worked inside S-21 said that a 17-year-old girl had her throat slit and her abdomen pierced before being beaten and put into water for an entire night.

Impact of the genocide on the country's average life expectancy

Ben Kiernan estimates that between 1.671 million to 1.871 million Cambodians died as a result of Khmer Rouge policy, or between 21% and 24% of Cambodia's 1975 population.<sup id="cite_ref-CAS_6-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-CAS-6">[4]</a></sup> A study by French demographer Marek Sliwinski calculated slightly fewer than 2 million unnatural deaths under the Khmer Rouge out of a 1975 Cambodian population of 7.8 million; 33.5% of Cambodian men died under the Khmer Rouge compared to 15.7% of Cambodian women.<sup id="cite_ref-Locard_7-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Locard-7">[5]</a></sup> According to a 2001 academic source, the most widely accepted estimates of excess deaths under the Khmer Rouge range from 1.5 million to 2 million, although figures as low as 1 million and as high as 3 million have been cited; conventionally accepted estimates of deaths due to Khmer Rouge executions range from 500,000 to 1 million, "a third to one half of excess mortality during the period."<sup id="cite_ref-Heuveline,_Patrick_2001_5-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Heuveline,_Patrick_2001-5">[3]</a></sup> However, a 2013 academic source (citing research from 2009) indicates that execution may have accounted for as much as 60% of the total, with 23,745 mass graves containing approximately 1.3 million suspected victims of execution.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESeyboltAronsonFischoff2013238_41-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-FOOTNOTESeyboltAronsonFischoff2013238-41">[35]</a></sup> While considerably higher than earlier and more widely-accepted estimates of Khmer Rouge executions, the Documentation Center of Cambodia (DC-Cam)'s Craig Etcheson defended such estimates of over one million executions as "plausible, given the nature of the mass grave and DC-Cam's methods, which are more likely to produce an under-count of bodies rather than an over-estimate."<sup id="cite_ref-Tufts.edu_53-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Tufts.edu-53">[47]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Sharp_51-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Sharp-51">[45]</a></sup> Demographer Patrick Heuveline estimated that between 1.17 million and 3.42 million Cambodians died unnatural deaths between 1970 and 1979, with between 150,000 and 300,000 of those deaths occurring during the civil war. Heuveline's central estimate is 2.52 million excess deaths, of which 1.4 million were the direct result of violence.<sup id="cite_ref-Heuveline,_Patrick_2001_5-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Heuveline,_Patrick_2001-5">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Tufts.edu_53-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Tufts.edu-53">[47]</a></sup> Despite being based on a house-to-house survey of Cambodians, the estimate of 3.3 million deaths promulgated by the Khmer Rouge's successor regime, the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), is generally considered to be an exaggeration;<sup id="cite_ref-Locard_7-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Locard-7">[5]</a></sup> among other methodological errors, the PRK authorities added the estimated number of victims that had been found in the partially-exhumed mass graves to the raw survey results, meaning that some victims would have been double-counted.<sup id="cite_ref-Tufts.edu_53-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-Tufts.edu-53">[47]</a></sup>

The tribunal's main building with the court room

The Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia ended the genocide by defeating and overthrowing the Khmer Rouge regime in January 1979. On 15 July 1979, the new Vietnamese installed government of Cambodia passed "Decree Law No. 1." This allowed for the trial of Pol Pot and Ieng Sary for the crime of genocide. They were given an American defense lawyer, [Hope Stevens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Stevens "Hope Stevens"),<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEEtcheson200514_186-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEtcheson200514-186">[180]</a></sup> and were [tried _in absentia_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_in_absentia "Trial in absentia") and convicted of genocide.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDonlon2012103_187-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDonlon2012103-187">[181]</a></sup>

The war continued until 1989 as an insurgency against the Vietnamese occupation by the Khmer Rouge and several other groups. Following the Vietnamese withdrawal, the [1991 Paris Peace Agreements](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Paris_Peace_Agreements "1991 Paris Peace Agreements") were signed to mark the official end of the war.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMayersan2013182_27-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMayersan2013182-27">[22]</a></sup> In order to include the Khmer Rouge in the agreement, the major powers agreed to avoid using the word "genocide" to describe their actions between 1975 and 1979.<sup id="cite_ref-188"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-188">[182]</a></sup> Nearly every major leader in Cambodia in 1991 had at one point allied themselves with the Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, so they were reluctant to advocate bringing him to trial. The United States had avoided describing Khmer Rouge atrocities as genocide until 1989, claiming it was "counterproductive to finding peace" and only approved capturing and holding a trial for Pol Pot in 1997. There was also speculation that a trial might examine the U.S. bombing of Cambodia during the Vietnam War.<sup id="cite_ref-189"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-189">[183]</a></sup>

In 1997, Cambodia's two Co-Prime Ministers wrote a letter to the [Secretary-General of the United Nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations "Secretary-General of the United Nations") requesting assistance to set up trial proceedings against the senior leaders of the Khmer Rouge. In January 2001, the [Cambodian National Assembly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(Cambodia) "National Assembly (Cambodia)") passed legislation to form a tribunal to try additional members of the Khmer Rouge regime.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStanton2013411_190-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStanton2013411-190">[184]</a></sup> Following lengthy negotiations, an agreement between the Royal Government of Cambodia and the United Nations was reached and signed on 6 June 2003.

### Denial of the genocide [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cambodian_genocide&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Denial of the genocide")

In 1979, some members of the [Canadian Workers' Communist Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_Communist_Party_(Canada) "Workers' Communist Party (Canada)") published a pamphlet after their visit to Cambodia. The pamphlet stated that reports of mass killings and other atrocities were made up by the USA and it also stated that the reports were then used by the Soviet Union and Vietnam. According to them, a part of the death toll was made up by the US embassy in Thailand and then, it was popularized by [François Ponchaud](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Ponchaud "François Ponchaud"). They also claimed that the reports and images of the Khmer Rouge's atrocities were made up by Thai intelligence and supporters of Lon Nol.<sup id="cite_ref-kww_202-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-kww-202">[196]</a></sup>

During the interview, he stated that he had a clear conscience and denied being responsible for the genocide. Pol Pot asserted that he "came to carry out the struggle, not to kill people." According to Alex Alvarez, Pol Pot "portrayed himself as a misunderstood and unfairly vilified figure".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAlvarez200156_204-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAlvarez200156-204">[198]</a></sup> In 2013, Cambodian Prime Minister [Hun Sen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hun_Sen "Hun Sen") unanimously passed legislation that prohibits the denial of the Cambodian genocide and other war crimes committed by the Khmer Rouge; a bill that mirrors [legislation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_Holocaust_denial "Legality of Holocaust denial") passed in European nations after the conclusion of the Holocaust.<sup id="cite_ref-205"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-205">[199]</a></sup>

Sokha stated that exhibits at the [Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuol_Sleng_Genocide_Museum "Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum") were fabricated and that the artifacts had been faked by the Vietnamese following their invasion in 1979.

### Denial of support of the Khmer Rouge by China [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cambodian_genocide&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Denial of support of the Khmer Rouge by China")

In 1988, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who was once a member of the Khmer Rouge, described China as "the root of everything that was evil" in Cambodia.<sup id="cite_ref-:11_11-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:11-11">[9]</a></sup> But after he ousted his domestic rivals in a bloody factional [coup d'état](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Cambodian_coup "1997 Cambodian coup") in July 1997, prompting outrage in the West, China immediately recognized the status quo and offered military aid.<sup id="cite_ref-:11_11-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:11-11">[9]</a></sup> New interests soon came into alignment. Then, in 2000, [Jiang Zemin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiang_Zemin "Jiang Zemin"), who was the [CCP General Secretary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party") and [Chinese President](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China "President of the People's Republic of China"), arrived in Cambodia for an official visit, the first by a Chinese leader since 1963.<sup id="cite_ref-:11_11-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:11-11">[9]</a></sup>

In December 2000, while Jiang was visiting Cambodia, the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_of_China "Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China") issued a statement in which it claimed that Beijing never supported the wrong policies of the Khmer Rouge while it was governing Cambodia and it refused to apologize.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_207-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:3-207">[201]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:20_208-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:20-208">[202]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:21_209-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:21-209">[203]</a></sup> Yang Yanyi (杨燕怡), then the Deputy Director of the Asian Department in the Foreign Ministry of China, claimed: "This is an internal affair to be addressed by the Cambodians themselves.

Even though the Cambodian government never mentioned the issue of the Khmer Rouge during Jiang's visit, protesters asked for an apology and they even asked for [restitution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restitution "Restitution") from China, and the said request still persists.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_207-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-:3-207">[201]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-210"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide#cite_note-210">[204]</a></sup> In 2015, Youk Chhang, the executive director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, pointed out that "Chinese advisers were there with the prison guards and all the way to the top leader.

As best as can now be estimated, over two million Cambodians died during the 1970s because of the political events of the decade, the vast majority of them during the mere four years of the 'Khmer Rouge' regime. This number of deaths is even more staggering when related to the size of the Cambodian population, then less than eight million. ... Subsequent reevaluations of the demographic data situated the death toll for the \[civil war\] in the order of 300,000 or less.

We may safely conclude, from known pre- and post-genocide population figures and from professional demographic calculations, that the 1975–79 death toll was between 1.671 and 1.871 million people, 21 to 24 percent of Cambodia's 1975 population.

Between 17 April 1975 and 7 January 1979 the death toll was about 25% of a population of some 7.8 million; 33.5% of men were massacred or died unnatural deaths as against 15.7% of the women, and 41.9% of the population of Phnom Penh. ... Since 1979, the so-called Pol Pot regime has been equated to Hitler and the Nazis. This is why the word 'genocide' (associated with Nazism) has been used for the first time in a distinctly Communist regime by the invading Vietnamese to distance themselves from a government they had overturned. This 'revisionism' was expressed in several ways. The Khmer Rouge were said to have killed 3.3 million, some 1.3 million more people than they had in fact killed. There was one abominable state prison, S–21, now the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum. In fact, there were more than 150 on the same model, at least one per district. ... For the United States in particular, denouncing the crimes of the Khmer Rouge was not at the top of their agenda in the early 1980s. Instead, as in the case of Afghanistan, it was still at times vital to counter what was perceived as the expansionist policies of the Soviets. The USA prioritised its budding friendship with the Democratic Republic of China to counter the 'evil' influence of the USSR in Southeast Asia, acting through its client state, revolutionary Vietnam. All the ASEAN countries shared that vision. So it became vital, with the military and financial help of China, to revive and develop armed resistance to the Vietnamese troops, with the resurrected KR at its core. ... \[France\] was instrumental in forcing the Sihanoukists and the Republicans to form an obscene alliance with its former tormentors, the KR, under the name of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK) in 1982. In so doing, the international community officially reintegrated some of the worst perpetrators of crimes against humanity into the world diplomatic sphere...

Retrieved 19 July 2019. On the higher end of estimates, journalist Elizabeth Becker writes that 'officially, more than half a million Cambodians died on the Lon Nol side of the war; another 600,000 were said to have died in the Khmer Rouge zones.' However, it is not clear how these numbers were calculated or whether they disaggregate civilian and soldier deaths. Others' attempts to verify the numbers suggest a lower number. Demographer Patrick Heuveline has produced evidence suggesting a range of 150,000 to 300,000 violent deaths from 1970 to 1975. In an article reviewing different sources about civilian deaths during the civil war, Bruce Sharp argues that the total number is likely to be around 250,000 violent deaths. ... Many attempts have been made to count or estimate the scale of deaths under the KR. While the KR officials claim that only around 20,000 civilians were killed, the true estimate likely falls somewhere between 1–3 million total deaths, with upper range estimates of those directly killed by the regime approaching 1 million. ... One of the more thorough demographic studies, conducted by Patrick Heuveline, also attempts to separate out violent civilian deaths from a general increase in mortality caused by famine, disease, working conditions, or other indirect causes. He does so by grouping deaths within different age and sex brackets and analyzing treatment of these age and sex groups by the Khmer Rouge and violent regimes in general. His conclusion is that an average of 2.52 million people (range of 1.17–3.42 million) died as a result of regime actions between 1970 and 1979, with an average estimate of 1.4 million (range of 1.09–2.16 million) directly violent deaths.

[L'Harmattan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Harmattan "L'Harmattan"). pp. 42–43, 48. Le bilan humain de cette périod de guerre civile est difficile à établir. Les chiffres avancés ne sont pas irréfutables, et ils peuvent bien avoir été lancés à des fins de propagande ou d'intoxication. Ils oscillent, pour le nombre des morts, entre 600 000 et 700 000, soit entre 7.7% et 9.6% de la population du pays selon les évaluations les plus extrêmes. La cause principale de ces pertes serait les bombardements massifs de l'aviation américaine dont le but principal était l'anéantissement des pistes Ho-Chi-Minh et la destruction d'un mythique Q.G. du Viêt-cong. A cet égard, il est intéressant de rappeler que la population de toutes les régions traversées par les pistes Ho-Chi-Minh, régions situées sur la rive gauche du Mékong, ne comptait au total qu'environ 1 165 000 personnes, et que les trois plus grandes provinces longeant la frontiére laotienne et vietnamienne, Stung Treng, Ratanakiri et Mondolkiri, étaient pratiquement inhabitées. L'impact des bombardments américains sur l'état de la population du Cambodge durant les années 1970–1975 ne paraît donc pas aussi évident que certain auteurs le supposent. Nos propres statistiques sur les causes précises des décés ne situent d'ailleurs les victimes des bombardments qu'à la troisiéme place, loin derriére les victimes des armes à feu portatives et des assassinats. ... Pour la période de guerre civile, l'augmentation totale de la mortalité est donc de 7.5% Si l'on considére que la mortalité naturelle frappe chaque anné quelque 132 000 personnes, on pourrait facilement en déduire que la surmortalité due à la guerre se chiffre par un nombre de décés ne dépassant pas 50 000 personnes durant la périod allant de mars 1970 à avril 1975. Toutefois, en tenant compte du fait que la guerre a eu une forte incidence tant sur la dimunution de la mortalité naturelle que sur l'agumentation de la mortalité infantile, on peut estimer la proportion annuelle des victimes elles-mêmes de cette guerre à 0,64% de la population du pays, soit, pour toutes ces années, 240 000 personnes environ.
