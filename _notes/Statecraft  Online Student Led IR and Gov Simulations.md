_You can add in active learning while being AI plagiarism proof and saving time with Statecraft. Our International Relations Simulation and Government Simulation are student run and unfold based on student choices, creations, and inputs like a butterfly effect. This makes it almost impossible for students to manufacture their foreign and domestic analysis and other Statecraft assignments through AI._

## "IT ILLUSTRATED SO MANY OF THE CONCEPTS"

I first used the IR Statecraft during a summer International Relations course. It was a great way to utilize some of the time out of an almost 3 hour long, 5 day a week course. The students were able to figure out the game easily. It illustrated for them so many of the concepts that we were reading about and discussing in class. And (most importantly) it was easy for me to set up, run, and keep track of. I’ve used Statecraft in every Intro to IR course, and Intro to International Security course I’ve taught since.

When I started teaching American Government classes, I immediately sought out some sort of simulation game for my students to play. I tried one or two other games before Statecraft came out with it’s American Government Sim. The other games were unwieldy and required a LOT of work on my part to set up and run the simulation. And students just didn’t get engaged. When I found out that Statecraft was working on an American Government Sim, I was so excited, I signed my next course up to beta test it! The American Government Sim has all the important hallmarks of the IR Sim. It’s easy for me to set up, run and keep track of. Students can get VERY invested in the game. And it helps illustrate things like separation of powers, checks and balances, and other important concepts that we discuss in class. Most importantly for me, the American Government Sim doesn’t go easy on the students. They come out of it realizing just how difficult it must be for our leaders in government, the media, and interest groups to do their jobs, and how competing interests can make what seems like a simple decision, much more complicated.

I 100% recommend the Statecraft sims to IR and American Government teachers and professors!

## Know student work is authentic; Statecraft Simulations promote academic honesty

The unique butterfly effect nature of the way Statecraft Simulations play out means every class is one-of-a-kind and that makes assignments AI plagiarism proof. It’s practically impossible to outsource an assignment to AI as the choices, actors, organizations, and scenarios are primarily student led and created. 

In the recent 2019 scholarly article _[The Statecraft Effect: Assessment, Attitudes, and Academic Honesty](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15512169.2018.1476253?forwardService=showFullText&tokenAccess=J7StGikmeSkmDFZDajIc&tokenDomain=eprints&doi=10.1080%2F15512169.2018.1476253&doi=10.1080%2F15512169.2018.1476253&journalCode=upse20)_, through a multimethod research design John Linantud & Joanna Kaftan concluded that Statecraft had a positive effect on academic honesty. They also noticed that students were so engaged and interested in the simulations that they actually wanted to share their personal experiences in assignments. Students even felt increased confidence in their ability to complete assignments and to succeed in the class. 

## Engage students for successful, effective classes through Government and International Relations Simulations

Using an online student led simulation allows you to demonstrate course concepts in an active learning environment. Students experience international relations and us government in a way that provides empathy for real world leaders and government positions decision making that they cannot gain without experiencing the dilemmas they face for themselves. 

-   More engagement inside and outside of class
-   Improved class attendance and course popularity
-   Students develop career skills like leadership that make them more employable
-   Teamwork fosters social connections, friendships and a sense of community

## AI Assignments

As your school navigates the best approach to work with AI Statecraft provides a unique way to ensure student’s work is authentic while also providing assignments that allow practice productively working with with tools like Chat GPT, Claude and others. 

## Simulation Lessons are applicable to real life situations

Students have more than enough resources and opportunities during the game play to make mistakes, learn from them and ultimately succeed in the simulation and class. That gives them a chance to learn important life lessons in a low-stakes environment and later apply their experience to truly important situations like the workplace.
