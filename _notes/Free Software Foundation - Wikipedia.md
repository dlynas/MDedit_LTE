The **Free Software Foundation** (**FSF**) is a [501(c)(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)#501(c)(3) "501(c)") [non-profit organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-profit_organization "Non-profit organization") founded by [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman "Richard Stallman")<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> on October 4, 1985, to support the [free software movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement "Free software movement"), with the organization's preference for [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software "Software") being distributed under [copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft "Copyleft") ("share alike") terms,<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> such as with its own [GNU General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License "GNU General Public License").<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> The FSF was incorporated in Boston,<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> [Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts "Massachusetts"), United States, where it is also based.<sup id="cite_ref-FSF_MACorpRegistry_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-FSF_MACorpRegistry-9">[9]</a></sup>

From its founding until the mid-1990s, FSF's funds were mostly used to employ software developers to write [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software "Free software") for the [GNU Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Project "GNU Project")<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> and its employees and volunteers have mostly worked on legal and structural issues for the free software movement and the free software community<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words"><span title="There are many distinct free software communities, many of which owe nothing to GNU or the FSF.

Consistent with its goals, the FSF aims to use only free software on its own computers.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

## History\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Free_Software_Foundation&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")\]

The Free Software Foundation was founded in 1985 as a [non-profit corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_corporation "Nonprofit corporation") supporting free software development. It continued existing [GNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU "GNU") projects such as the sale of manuals and [tapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_tape_data_storage "Magnetic tape data storage"), and employed developers of the free software system.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Since then, it has continued these activities, as well as advocating for the free software movement. The FSF is also the steward of several free software licenses, meaning it publishes them and has the ability to make revisions as needed.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

The FSF holds the copyrights on many pieces of the [GNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU "GNU") system, such as [GNU Compiler Collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection "GNU Compiler Collection"). As the holder of these copyrights, it has authority to enforce the [copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft "Copyleft") requirements of the GNU General Public License (GPL) when [copyright infringement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement "Copyright infringement") occurs.

From 1991 until 2001, GPL enforcement was done informally, usually by Stallman himself, often with assistance from FSF's lawyer, [Eben Moglen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eben_Moglen "Eben Moglen").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (September 2009)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Typically, GPL violations during this time were cleared up by short email exchanges between Stallman and the violator.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (September 2009)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> In the interest of promoting copyleft assertiveness by software companies to the level that the FSF was already doing, in 2004 [Harald Welte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_Welte "Harald Welte") launched [gpl-violations.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gpl-violations.org "Gpl-violations.org").

In late 2001, [Bradley M. Kuhn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_M._Kuhn "Bradley M. Kuhn") (then executive director), with the assistance of Moglen, David Turner, and [Peter T. Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_T._Brown "Peter T. Brown"), formalized these efforts into FSF's GPL Compliance Labs. From 2002–2004, high-profile GPL enforcement cases, such as those against [Linksys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linksys "Linksys") and OpenTV, became frequent.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>

GPL enforcement and educational campaigns on GPL compliance was a major focus of the FSF's efforts during this period.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>

In March 2003, [SCO filed suit against IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO_v._IBM "SCO v. IBM") alleging that IBM's contributions to various free software, including FSF's GNU, violated SCO's rights. While FSF was never a party to the lawsuit, FSF was [subpoenaed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena "Subpoena") on November 5, 2003.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> During 2003 and 2004, FSF put substantial advocacy effort into responding to the lawsuit and quelling its negative impact on the adoption and promotion of free software.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated2004_21-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-autogenerated2004-21">[21]</a></sup>

From 2003 to 2005, FSF held legal seminars to explain the GPL and the surrounding law.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> Usually taught by Bradley M. Kuhn and [Daniel Ravicher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ravicher "Daniel Ravicher"), these seminars offered [CLE credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_Legal_Education "Continuing Legal Education") and were the first effort to give formal legal education on the GPL.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated2004_21-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-autogenerated2004-21">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

In 2007, the FSF published the third version of the GNU General Public License after significant outside input.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>

In December 2008, FSF filed a lawsuit against [Cisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco "Cisco") for using GPL-licensed components shipped with [Linksys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linksys "Linksys") products. Cisco was notified of the licensing issue in 2003 but Cisco repeatedly disregarded its obligations under the GPL.<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> In May 2009, Cisco and FSF reached [settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation) "Settlement (litigation)") under which Cisco agreed to make a monetary donation to the FSF and appoint a Free Software Director to conduct continuous reviews of the company's license compliance practices.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>

In September 2019, [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman "Richard Stallman") resigned as president of the FSF after pressure from journalists and members of the [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source "Open source") community in response to him making controversial comments in defense of [Marvin Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky "Marvin Minsky") on [Jeffrey Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein "Jeffrey Epstein")'s sex trafficking scandal.<sup id="cite_ref-explains-why-hes-willing-to-quit_29-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-explains-why-hes-willing-to-quit-29">[29]</a></sup> Nevertheless, Stallman remained head of the GNU Project and in 2021, he returned to the FSF board of directors.<sup id="cite_ref-phoronix.com_30-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-phoronix.com-30">[30]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Stallman_31-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-Stallman-31">[31]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:0_32-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-:0-32">[32]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:1_33-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-:1-33">[33]</a></sup>

## High priority projects\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Free_Software_Foundation&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: High priority projects")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Parabola-openrc-lxde-2017.11.05-dual.iso.png/300px-Parabola-openrc-lxde-2017.11.05-dual.iso.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Parabola-openrc-lxde-2017.11.05-dual.iso.png)

[Parabola GNU/Linux-libre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola_GNU/Linux-libre "Parabola GNU/Linux-libre") is a distribution officially endorsed by the _FSF_.

The FSF maintains a list of "high-priority projects" to which the Foundation claims that "there is a vital need to draw the [free software community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_community "Free software community")'s attention".<sup id="cite_ref-highpriority_42-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-highpriority-42">[42]</a></sup> The FSF considers these projects "important because computer users are continually being seduced into using [non-free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-free_software "Non-free software"), because there is no adequate free replacement."<sup id="cite_ref-highpriority_42-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-highpriority-42">[42]</a></sup>

As of 2021, high-priority tasks include [reverse engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering "Reverse engineering") proprietary firmware, reversible debugging in [GNU Debugger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Debugger "GNU Debugger"); developing [automatic transcription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(service) "Transcription (service)") and [video editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_editing_software "Video editing software") software, [Coreboot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coreboot "Coreboot"), drivers for [network routers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_routers "Network routers"), a free [smartphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone "Smartphone") operating system and creating replacements for [Skype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype "Skype") and [Siri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri "Siri").<sup id="cite_ref-highpriority_42-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-highpriority-42">[42]</a></sup>

Previous projects highlighted as needing work included the [Free Java implementations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Java_implementations "Free Java implementations"), [GNU Classpath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Classpath "GNU Classpath"), and [GNU Compiler for Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_for_Java "GNU Compiler for Java"), which ensure compatibility for the Java part of [OpenOffice.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org "OpenOffice.org"), and the [GNOME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME "GNOME") desktop environment (see [Java: Licensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(Sun)#Licensing "Java (Sun)")).<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup>

The effort has been criticized by [Michael Larabel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Larabel "Michael Larabel") for either not instigating active development or for being slow at the work being done, even after certain projects were added to the list.<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup>

### Financial\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Free_Software_Foundation&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Financial")\]

Most of the FSF funding comes from patrons and members.<sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-72">[70]</a></sup> Revenue streams also come from free-software-related compliance labs, job postings, published works, and a [web store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_store "Web store"). FSF offers speakers and seminars for pay, and all FSF projects accept donations.

Revenues fund free-software programs and campaigns, while cash is invested conservatively in [socially responsible investing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socially_responsible_investing "Socially responsible investing"). The financial strategy is designed to maintain the Foundation's long-term future through economic stability.

The FSF is a tax-exempt organization and posts annual IRS Form 990 filings online.<sup id="cite_ref-IRS_Form_990_73-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-IRS_Form_990-73">[71]</a></sup>

## Criticism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Free_Software_Foundation&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Criticism")\]

### Position on DRM\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Free_Software_Foundation&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Position on DRM")\]

[Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds "Linus Torvalds") has criticized FSF for using [GPLv3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPLv3 "GPLv3") as a weapon in the fight against [DRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management "Digital rights management"). Torvalds argues that the issue of DRM and that of a software license should be treated as two separate issues.<sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-74">[72]</a></sup>

### _Defective by Design_ campaign\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Free_Software_Foundation&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Defective by Design campaign")\]

On June 16, 2010, Joe Brockmeier, a journalist at _[Linux Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Magazine "Linux Magazine")_, criticized the [Defective by Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defective_by_Design "Defective by Design") campaign by the FSF as "negative" and "juvenile" and not being adequate for providing users with "credible alternatives" to proprietary software.<sup id="cite_ref-75"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-75">[73]</a></sup> FSF responded to this criticism by saying "that there is a fundamental difference between speaking out against policies or actions and smear campaigns", and "that if one is taking an ethical position, it is justified, and often necessary, to not only speak about the benefits of freedom but against acts of dispossession and disenfranchisement."<sup id="cite_ref-76"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-76">[74]</a></sup>

### GNU LibreDWG license controversy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Free_Software_Foundation&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: GNU LibreDWG license controversy")\]

In 2009, a [license update](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relicensing "Relicensing") of LibDWG/[LibreDWG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreDWG "LibreDWG") to [version 3 of the GNU GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Version_3 "GNU General Public License") made it impossible for the free software projects [LibreCAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreCAD "LibreCAD") and [FreeCAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCAD "FreeCAD") to use LibreDWG legally.<sup id="cite_ref-phoronix_77-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-phoronix-77">[75]</a></sup> Many projects voiced their unhappiness about the GPLv3 license selection for LibreDWG, such as [FreeCAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCAD "FreeCAD"), [LibreCAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreCAD "LibreCAD"), [Assimp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assimp "Assimp"), and [Blender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software) "Blender (software)").<sup id="cite_ref-libredwg-gplv3-opinion_78-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-libredwg-gplv3-opinion-78">[76]</a></sup> Some suggested the selection of a license with a broader [license compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_compatibility "License compatibility"), for instance the [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_license "MIT license"), [BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license "BSD license"), or [LGPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGPL "LGPL") 2.1.<sup id="cite_ref-libredwg-gplv3-opinion_78-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-libredwg-gplv3-opinion-78">[76]</a></sup> A request went to the FSF to [relicense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_relicensing "Software relicensing") GNU LibreDWG as GPLv2, which was rejected in 2012.<sup id="cite_ref-79"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-79">[77]</a></sup>

The libDWG has stalled since 2011 for various reasons, including license issues.<sup id="cite_ref-80"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-80">[78]</a></sup>

### Accusations against Richard Stallman\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Free_Software_Foundation&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Accusations against Richard Stallman")\]

[Stallman resigned from the board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman#Resignation_from_MIT_and_FSF "Richard Stallman") in 2019 after making controversial comments about one of the victims of [Jeffrey Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein "Jeffrey Epstein"), but rejoined the board 18 months later.<sup id="cite_ref-81"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-81">[79]</a></sup> Several prominent organizations and individuals who develop free software objected to the decision, citing past writings on Stallman's blog which they considered antithetical to promoting a diverse community.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_82-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-:2-82">[80]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-83"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-83">[81]</a></sup> As a result of Stallman's reinstatement, prominent members of the Free Software Foundation quit in protest and [Red Hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat "Red Hat") announced that it would stop funding and supporting the Free Software Foundation.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_82-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-:2-82">[80]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-84"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_note-84">[82]</a></sup>

## Notes\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Free_Software_Foundation&action=edit&section=33 "Edit section: Notes")\]

1.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_ref-54 "Jump up")** The FSF annual filings with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for 1998 and 1999 show that De Icaza was not on the board on 1998-11-01 and was as of 1999-11-01, so he clearly joined sometime between those dates. Those documents further indicate that the 1999 annual meeting occurred in August; usually, new directors are elected at annual meetings.
2.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#cite_ref-59 "Jump up")** The FSF annual filings with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for 1999 and 2000 show that Moglen was not on the board on November 1, 1999, and was as of November 1, 2000, so he clearly joined sometime between those dates. Those documents further indicate that the 2000 annual meeting occurred on July 28, 2000; usually, new directors are elected at annual meetings.
