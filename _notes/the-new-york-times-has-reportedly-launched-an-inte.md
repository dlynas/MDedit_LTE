## The New York Times has reportedly launched an internal investigation of a freelance Israeli reporter after she liked multiple posts on social media advocating for violence against Palestinians, including one that called for turning Gaza into a "slaughterhouse." 

A newspaper spokesperson told The Daily Beast such social media activity constitutes an "unacceptable violations of our company policy."

In December, the reporter, Anat Schwartz, co-authored a widely criticized article for The New York Times alleging that members of Hamas committed widespread sexual violence on October 7. The Intercept recently reported that doubts over the accuracy of the article led the Times to shelving an episode about the issue on its podcast, “The Daily.”
