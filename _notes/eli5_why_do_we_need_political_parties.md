	A group of likeminded individuals has better chances of coordinating and getting things done than a whole load of random individuals. With a group, you can spread the work around, you can compensate for the weaknesses of some of your members with the strengths of others. Your individual members don't have to know everything about everything. Instead you can have some influences within your party that know a lot about X subject, and others that know a lot about Y and yet others that know about Z.

	For the people voting, political parties also mean some continuity and stability. If you vote for an individual, something could go wrong with that person (ill health, an accident) and then suddenly they cannot do what you elected them to do anymore and you are left with nothing. If you vote for a political party instead of an individual, the party can make sure someone else can step in to fill that open spot. (though this depends a little on the exact political system to what degree they can do this)

		Political parties do this all the time though. Get elected because they promised to do something...then just don't do it.

			Which, tbh, is another thing in favour of political parties. With political parties, it is usually much easier to research their history and past voting decisions. Do they carry out what they campaign on? How do the vote once they are in government? With an individual, especially those new to politics, you can only guess if they will actually do what they promise. (this can also be an issue with new and not yet established political parties, which is why not everybody likes voting for them) With a party, you can do your research.

	We don't need them per se, but history has shown that people who work with others of a similar point of view are more effective than those who go it alone and make one-off decisions for each issue.

	There's only so much you can do working individually.  If you're going to work together with a group, there's a benefit to making it more formal, even though it's not particularly binding.

	We don't. There's nothing formal in the US national set up (Constitution, laws, etc.) that requires them. They actually exist outside the government as independent entities with their own agendas.

		Fun fact, our current political parties were not the original 2 political parties. Those were republican democrat and the Federalist Party. The Federalist Party died in the 1820s and lead to the period referred to as the era of good feeling with a single political party controlling everything.

	Political parties help translate elections into meaningful choices.

	In parliamentary democracies you need political parties because you don't have a direct vote for the leader, just an indirect vote so you need to know who is effectively a delegate for that leadership platform.

	In Presidential democracies you need them less, but they still serve a useful function in providing an organisational mechanism behind a particular political choice.

	And even if we don't need them, they are very effective at winning elections, so they'd be hard to get rid of (and banning them doesn't work, if you have "non party political" elections all that happens is you still have the parties but they are hidden so there is less transparency and accountability (look at local elections in Pakistan, or Cuba).

	So that on average the country is spilt roughly 50/50 all the time and the interests of people with real power are protected while the masses argue about what bathroom transgender people pee in.

		Not every country has a 2 party system.

			obviously not, but for example here in finland were i live you can still get the 50/50 split with 8 parties, just not as apparent

	We don't *need* political parties, they are kinda like a tool to let things simpler, so instead of you having to waste a lot of time looking closely at every single politician, you can look at a whole group's beliefs and proposals instead.

	As noted by some already, political parties play a critical signaling role to voters. At the presidential level, voters have so much information about candidates that a party affiliation isn't really important anymore - but county commissioner? Eh, not so much. At least in the USA, where parties are ideologically based, a party affiliation gives the voter a *general* idea as to what a candidate will do if elected.

	Also as noted by others, political parties have no constitutional basis. The Founders evidently thought that parties would not be a thing. Regardless political parties began developing soon after the formation of the Republic because, although they play no formal role in the constitutional order, they are critical for the smooth operation of the governing process in the legislature. If all members of Congress were truly independents, there could never be stable majorities in the legislature. Every vote would also entail having to rebuild a coalition from scratch. It would be difficult even to elect leadership for the bodies (Speaker, Senate President Pro Tempore, etc.)

	Finally, parties are required for the organizational and financial resources they provide. This has become much less important over the past 30+ years as candidates have raised more of their own money and built their own parallel organizations (ie Organizing for America). However, parties still play a large role in this fashion. For example, there's nothing keeping me, Joshua Rosenblum, from running for president. I can declare at any time and file the paperwork. But in order to win, I need to get my name on the ballot in all 50 states (or most of them). That's an arduous process that has different requirements in every state. It would be extremely difficult for me as an individual to do that, but a party has a ready made organization of people who are experienced in this process and so can put that organization to work on a candidate's behalf.

	We don't.  But politicians are going to form alliances anyway.  If they formalize and publicize this, then the public sort of knows what they're getting into. 

	On the other hand, someone then has to "run" the party, and the party provides cover for fools who really couldn't get elected except via being a party member.  

	The Canadian Senate is moving away from having parties.  It will be an interesting experiment.

* 🟩 **[iwasadeum](https://www.reddit.com/user/iwasadeum)** ⬆️ 2 _(2017-04-02 09:40:38)_

	We don't. Go read about the founding fathers and their warnings about how a party system will ruin this country.

	Whether you're liberal or conservative, none can deny the worthlessness and uselessness of our elected officials. They only vote to improve their personal finances.

	We dont. Also the Democrat and Republican are new political parties. Im sure that just a before there will be new ones that spring up

	For the majority of people, they don't want to really learn the issues. So having a "team" to be on makes it easy for them to know who to support. 

	They usually take a handful of divisive topics that they have strong opinions on... Abortion, gay marriage, etc.  Then they say "I align more with *this* party".  Then they don't have to evaluate both sides of an argument or issue. They can just support their "home team".
