## Historian Matthew Restall writes that the modern world was built on ‚ÄúHolocaustic levels of slaughter and enslavement of non-European peoples‚Äù. Is this accurate or over-simplistic?

> In his book When Montezuma Met Cort√©s, the historian Matthew Restall has a memorable passage:
> 
> > Cort√©s‚Äôs thousands of indigenous slaves (V√°zquez de Tapia claimed it was over twenty thousand) may have been an exceptionally large number for one Spaniard, but they were a tiny percentage of the more than half a million enslaved across the Caribbean, Mesoamerica, Central America, and beyond, just in the early sixteenth century alone. And an even smaller percentage of those enslaved elsewhere in the Atlantic orbit. Holocaustic levels of slaughter and enslavement of non-European peoples marked the early modern genesis of our modern world. Cort√©s‚Äôs era was just the beginning. Over the successive centuries, between 10 and 20 million Africans and indigenous Americans would be forced into slavery. Tens of millions more would be displaced and forced into servitude, would die from epidemic diseases, would suffer the tearing apart of families and the brutal exploitation of colonialism and imperial expansion. Such experiences were the political, economic, and moral platforms upon which our world was constructed.

	Restall's statement isn't necessarily wrong, but it is a little simplistic. One important thing to keep in mind is the intention of the passage. I can't read Restall's mind, but also being academically trained in history I can assume the passage is meant to do two things: 1. Stick out to the reader using a term like "Holocaustic" (a parallel widely known to a general readership) and 2. Respond to the question every historian is required to answer "Why do we care about the history you are writing about?". The latter usually requires one to situate the history within a broader history (if it's a history meant for a broad audience, the answer to the question is much broader.) In this case, he is situating Montezuma and Cort√©s's meeting as the start of early modern colonialism/imperialism.

	This statement is not the main argument of his book, but it is a rather interesting passage. Restall is a top scholar in his field and I do not think the statement is necessarily wrong.  But the reason it is simplistic is the fact that although the Spanish conquest of the Mexica/Aztec was brutal and more complicated than historians have traditionally presented (the main point of his book). Saying the world was built by the Europeans slaughter of non-Europeans is overly simplistic. It ignores the fact shortly after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire Europe would be embroiled in a war among themselves. The Thirty Years' War would result in the slaughter of nearly 5-8 million people in Europe. This war would largely be funded by wealth brutally extracted from the Americas. Not to mention the many wars in Europe that would follow leading to the slaughter and displacement of millions throughout the early modern period.

	Finally, to answer your second question. You will find considerable debate regarding the use of "holocaustic." Many historians would make this argument and many would argue against it. Although it is true the Spanish engaged in slaughter and contributed to mass deaths for indigenous people, it is important to keep in mind that shortly after Cort√©s, the crown would create the "New Laws" that was meant to partly reign in conquistadors and the brutal nature of the previous era's conquest. Using the term holocaust might make it seem like it was the intention of the Spanish to engage in genocide (i.e. the Nazi's object against the Jews), thus reaffirming the Black Legend (something continuously problematized by historians). But if we use the term holocaust in its literal sense 'destruction/mass slaughter on a mass scale, it might not be totally wrong to use the term. The Spanish did engage in this at various times and their actions did lead to the deaths of millions, but this isn't a simple story of Europeans VS. Indigenous people. The Aztecs and many groups under the Spanish did not view themselves as conquered people and engaged extensively within the Spanish, even participating in subjugating neighboring Indigenous people (two works come to mind, part of Restall's New Conquest framework: Folsom, Yaquis and the Empire and Mathew, Memories of Conquest). Once again, not necessarily wrong but simplistic.

		...To add to this excellent assessment, I'd also note the other common criticism of using 'holocaust' as a synonym for 'genocide', that of timescale.
		
		The Holocaust is often used as something of a yardstick for other potentially genocidal events in history, and for many less specialised historians, it's this scale and notaritey that they're they're thinking of when they make this comparison.
		
		However, for many historians who specialise in studying the Shoa, what sets it apart isn't necessarily it's raw scale, but rather how *deliberately*, and how *quickly* that scale was 'achieved'. 11 million dead is extraordinary, but not necessarily unprecedented. 11 million systematically and deliberately murdered in just over half a decade is, which is what makes it so significant.
		
		Consequently, using holocaustic to simply mean 'a big genocide' misses the full significance of the shoa, and to some extent undermines and dilutes the popular understanding of that significance more generally. You can see the effect of this in the drumbeat of people asking, ingenuously or otherwise, why we care so much about the holocaust, when The USSR/British Empire/Conquistadors etc killed a similar number of people in total, as if raw scale was the sole reason for it's significance.
		
		As mentioned above, I don't suspect Restall is intentionally perpetuating this misconception or intending to draw any false comparison to his own area of work. Rather, I suspect he serves as an unfortunate case-study in the perils of making casual comparisons to areas outside of one's personal expertise

			> However, for many historians who specialise in studying the Shoa, what sets it apart isn't necessarily it's raw scale, but rather how deliberately, and how quickly that scale was 'achieved'.
			
			I fully understand why it is problematic to freely compare to the Holocaust, but based on your own words I don‚Äôt think this idea is lost here. Was the scale and speed through which Indigenous people subjugated and depopulated not prolific? 
			
			> why we care so much about the holocaust, when The USSR/British Empire/Conquistadors etc killed a similar number of people in total, as if raw scale was the sole reason for it's significance.
			
			Again, I understand the idea that in many ways they are not comparable. However, I think the point here is not that people care more about the Holocaust because it is unique among genocides although it is, but because it is far better documented, more recent, etc. It is more evocative to the modern audience thus, it is the standard of comparison to make people care about what happened in the Americas. Just to make it clear: lay people definitely care less about other genocides due to lack of proximity or popular media surrounding other events, rather than having a deep understanding of what makes the Holocaust unique.

				Restall is not alone in making this comparison either. In his recent book The Rediscovery of America, Ned Blackhawk writes the following:
				> But the Spanish conquistadors perpetrated horrors on a previously unimaginable scale. They brought with them deaths due to military campaigns, indiscriminate violence, animal attacks, slavery and forced labor, and above all European pathogens. Of the 3 million inhabitants of Hispaniola at the time of Columbus‚Äôs arrival in 1493, only five hundred remained fifty years later. The Spanish conquest was simultaneously a holocaust.
				
				And while he acknowledges the complexity of the conflicts and Indigenous-Spanish alliances, he still argues that Spanish colonialism ultimately 
				> brought death, disease, and devastation, and later dispossession to tens of millions of Indigenous peoples.

			One thing to keep in mind is that Hitler admired and wanted to emulate the way that the United States had destroyed the First Nations peoples in their regions, and Hitler's ambition was to do the same in Eastern Europe, but *much, much faster*, more deliberately, more thoroughly.  
			
			
			Hitler explicitly held up the USA as an example of a "successful" nation that could provide an extremely high quality of life for its people, independent from any other world power. This was influenced by Hitler's (and Germany's) experience during the First World War, when according to Hitler the "superior" Germanic race was sabotaged by a blockade on raw materials and food by Great Britain and the other Entente nations. The goal of the Holocaust and its associated killings was to, first, eliminate the Jews, and then to secure a vast hinterland that would provide food (especially) but also raw materials that would provide Germans with a lifestyle appropriate for their "superior" status among the races, immune to blockades and blackmail by other powers.   
			
			
			The difference is that the American conquest of the continent was accomplished over decades and centuries, and the deaths of most of the original inhabitants was the result of many factors aside from an explicit American policy of genocide, with disease being a major cause. The Holocaust, in contrast, was a centralized, industrialized killing-machine that deliberately sought to utterly wipe off the face of the Earth whole ethnic communities. It was accomplished in only a few years. That's why the Holocaust is "different".   
			
			
			The deaths of so many indigenous people in the New World is a horrible crime and a tragedy, but it's important to keep in mind the unprecedented nightmare-scenario of a modern, industrial nation using all of its resources to engage in a super-charged effort to kill as many men, women and children as they possibly could to the utmost of their capabilities.

		As others have pointed out, Matthew refers to the number enslaved and dead as ‚Äúholocaustic scale‚Äù. He does not refer to genocide at all in the passage besides this. I find it curious then that many of the answers in the thread seem to deeply discuss whether the Spanish enacted a 'true' holocaustic genocide in the Americas. As others have pointed out the timescales, motivations and historical contexts of the holocaust and the colonisation of the Americas were different, and I doubt very much Matthew would disagree.
		
		But it seems to me he is making a point about the role of slavery and indigenous slaughter in laying the foundations for the structure of the modern global economic and political landscape. Postcolonial theorists would argue strongly for both the political and economic influence of European colonialism on our modern world.
		
		Though it is arguable that the spanish did not benefit heavily from their American colonial holdings, inundated as they were with war in Europe, they did borrow heavily from bankers from other European countries, those same European bankers being payed with American silver. This system of borrowing can be seen as influencing later European imperial expansion. The perception of Spains colonial riches also fueled it's neighbors' (English and French) later colonial aspirations.
		
		The raw materials generated by enslaved populations on the land of displaced people played a significant role in the Industrial Revolution. Though this did not lead to immediate financial benefits for the majority of Europeans, the industrial revolution did influence later global economic inequality. Dutch finanancing of colonial ventures laid the foundations for modern banking systems. The postcolonial financial relations between countries and the colonial structure of financial institutions still influence income inequality across the world.
		
		With regards to the United States, it would not exist in it's current form without the mass displacement of Indigenous populations. Disruption and elimination of communities, tribes and the settlement of their land was deliberate. The Dawes act of 1887 is a good example of how US policy aimed specifically to disrupt traditional organisation and way of life in order to acquire and settle shared tribal lands.
		
		Though we could argue ad nausium about how clear cut the role European and American colonialsm played in defining later economic and political relations, the scale of the slaughter, enslavement and displacement are undeniably vast, as are their implications.

			Thanks for this reply! I agree that even if the conquest doesn't meet a very strict legal definition of genocide, that doesn't diminish its destructiveness.

		Restall actually discusses the topic of genocide later in the book. He acknowledges that while the Spanish crown didn‚Äôt seek the extermination of Indigenous peoples as a whole (hence the New Laws, though Restall also argues their effectiveness was limited), Spanish conquistadors were in many cases willing to annihilate certain Indigenous cities and communities as a terror tactic. He argues that this could be considered genocidal in effect, even if not in intent.
