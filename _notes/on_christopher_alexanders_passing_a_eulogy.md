## On Christopher Alexander's Passing: A Eulogy

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/architecture/comments/uvfmn0/on_christopher_alexanders_passing_a_eulogy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/architecture/comments/uvfmn0/on_christopher_alexanders_passing_a_eulogy/)

>  I learned that my great teacher has passed. My wife, who takes my sorrow seriously, gets to the heart: "It makes you think of the surprises and connections to come. It's a loss even just to know that the possibility is gone."
> 
> A public critic from the paper of record concludes that Mr. Alexander discovered no new science, even if we might quaintly accept his vision of a living world as a product of nostalgia and of places we no longer remember how to create. But Alexander explores the timeless and living structure of the universe, manifest in its infinite but patterned forms, swirling around us in pulsing tides and ebbs. Churning, churning, but always beautiful, always structured, always discrete and reliably shaped. 
> 
> His science defines the constrained qualities of the manifest, of That Which Is. Here is Nature. Here is The Universe. It yields myriad forms. The forms are not boundless in their shapes and arrangements. Chaos resolves into shape through discrete, generative principles. 
> 
> Chomsky discovers recursion in words. Salzer discovers recursion in counterpoint. Jacobs discovers recursion in urban form. Scientist Alexander discovers recursion in living structure, and architect Alexander asks, How may we apply recursion to the things we build? How may we channel recursion into living, built environments?  The stakes are high. Answers demand rigour and discipline. 
> 
> This looks like science. This looks like a world of forms that can be evaluated, whose shaping principles can be identified, proposed and predicted. This looks like a science that proves beauty as the organizing and useful force in the Universe. This looks like a specific process whereby the spirit of life shapes matter into shapes that we recognize as vital and beautiful. 
> 
> Beautiful, perhaps -- or, because humans choose, sometimes not. We stand unique among all known forces in the Universe, in our power to create a world of inert forms. The inert, too, is recognizable by its shapes. More precisely -- recognizable by its absence of shape, its lack of rigour. It's a new habit for us, this tolerance for the inert, less than one hundred years old. 
> 
> The surprise, Mr. Alexander's scientific wonder -- The matter which we moderns think 'inert' or lifeless, obeys the same shaping processes as that which we observe as 'living.' The Universe applies the same shaping rules to all matter, and autonomy to some certain matter. Some matter supplicant, some matter autonomous -- all matter shaped in space by the same principles, when Nature is in charge of its own design.
> 
> What if we can plug into Nature's shaping forces, my teacher asks? What if we could manifest our preference for a living world into actual built shapes? What would a house look like? What would a city block look like? What would a bookshelf look like? These are rigorously scientific questions, whose answers arise through disciplined study of the context of design, a quiet observation of the forces bearing down on the space identified for new growth. The question is so timeless and easy: What should we build here? I've watched city councils argue this question. I've watched marriages tested by this question. It matters to us. My teacher understood how much it mattered and sought solutions that satisfied the human soul. 
> 
> Who dares define God or the Divine? My teacher architect does. The Luminous Ground, that inescapably logical necessity, reveals Itself to him and through him. The undifferentiated Other against which all differentiation exists -- my words, not his, and only a more verbose restatement of his essential deduction. That Ground throbs as the ineffable outpouring of living energy, channeled into unfolding and meaningful shapes. The Ground can be read. It may be woven into. It may be molded into places that your neighbor wishes to sit and read a book.
> 
> If we matter, then living spaces that support our lives matter. Because humans choose, we sometimes choose the inert. Mr. Alexander laments that we've stumbled into a convenient tolerance of the inert. During a few short generations within living memory, our tolerance for the inert has metastasized into an amnesia that overthrows millennia of simple, human understanding of how to build a beautiful nest. We make it spiky and abstract, when the babes demand a simple cradle. 
> 
> Make different choices!, he insists. Choose beauty and life!, he implores, lest an inert environment stifle our human hearts and our longing for beautiful surroundings where we  experience our joys and travails. Is beauty testable? Is living nature true of us? Ask the question, he insists. 
> 
> May you rest in long peace, my teacher. May your Heaven unfold in unceasing vistas into places that sing with your heart and confirm that which you knew could exist even among the world of the living.

	even if you only incorporate one or two of his “rules” or ingredients, you’ve made something better than if you hadn’t

	His ideas on patterns and forces were so novel that they permanently changed the way, computer scientists think about software architectures. Probably without him even considering this kind of architecture.
