## Early life and education\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Judith_Butler&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Early life and education")\]

Judith Butler was born on February 24, 1956, in [Cleveland, Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland,_Ohio "Cleveland, Ohio"),<sup id="cite_ref-Duignan_2018_1-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-Duignan_2018-1">[1]</a></sup> to a family of [Hungarian-Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian-Jewish "Hungarian-Jewish") and [Russian-Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian-Jewish "Russian-Jewish") descent.<sup id="cite_ref-2001int_13-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-2001int-13">[12]</a></sup> Most of their maternal grandmother's family was murdered in the [Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust "Holocaust").<sup id="cite_ref-taught_14-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-taught-14">[13]</a></sup> Butler's parents were practicing [Reform Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Judaism "Reform Judaism"). Their mother was raised [Orthodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism "Orthodox Judaism"), eventually becoming [Conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Judaism "Conservative Judaism") and then [Reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Judaism "Reform Judaism"), while their father was raised [Reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Judaism "Reform Judaism"). As a child and teenager, Butler attended both [Hebrew school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_school "Hebrew school") and special classes on [Jewish ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_ethics "Jewish ethics"), where they received their "first training in philosophy". Butler stated in a 2010 interview with _[Haaretz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haaretz "Haaretz")_ that they began the ethics classes at the age of 14 and that they were created as a form of punishment by Butler's Hebrew school's [Rabbi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi "Rabbi") because they were "too talkative in class".<sup id="cite_ref-taught_14-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-taught-14">[13]</a></sup> Butler said they were "thrilled" by the idea of these tutorials, and when asked what they wanted to study in these special sessions, they responded with three questions preoccupying them at the time: "Why was [Spinoza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza "Baruch Spinoza") [excommunicated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza#Expulsion_from_the_Jewish_community "Baruch Spinoza") from the synagogue? Could [German Idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Idealism "German Idealism") be held accountable for [Nazism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism "Nazism")? And how was one to understand [existential theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_theology "Existential theology"), including the work of [Martin Buber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Buber "Martin Buber")?"<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-15">[14]</a></sup>

Butler attended [Bennington College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennington_College "Bennington College") before transferring to [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University "Yale University"), where they studied philosophy and received a [Bachelor of Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts "Bachelor of Arts") in 1978 and a [Doctor of Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy "Doctor of Philosophy") in 1984.<sup id="cite_ref-tanner_16-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-tanner-16">[15]</a></sup> Their studies fell primarily under the traditions of German Idealism and [phenomenology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy) "Phenomenology (philosophy)"),<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-17">[16]</a></sup> and they spent one academic year at [Heidelberg University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidelberg_University "Heidelberg University") as a [Fulbright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulbright "Fulbright") Scholar in 1979.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-18">[17]</a></sup> After receiving their PhD, Butler revised their doctoral dissertation to produce their first book, entitled _Subjects of Desire: Hegelian Reflections in Twentieth Century France_ (1987).<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-19">[18]</a></sup> Butler went on to teach at [Wesleyan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesleyan_University "Wesleyan University"), [George Washington University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_University "George Washington University"), and [Johns Hopkins University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University "Johns Hopkins University") before joining [University of California, Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley "University of California, Berkeley"), in 1993.<sup id="cite_ref-mellon_20-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-mellon-20">[19]</a></sup> In 2002, they held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the [University of Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Amsterdam "University of Amsterdam").<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-21">[20]</a></sup> In addition, they joined the department of English and Comparative Literature at [Columbia University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University "Columbia University") as Wun Tsun Tam Mellon Visiting Professor of the Humanities in the spring semesters of 2012, 2013 and 2014 with the option of remaining as full-time faculty.<sup id="cite_ref-chronicle_22-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-chronicle-22">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-capital_23-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-capital-23">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-24">[23]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-25">[24]</a></sup>

## Overview of major works\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Judith_Butler&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Overview of major works")\]

### _Performative Acts and Gender Constitution_ (1988)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Judith_Butler&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Performative Acts and Gender Constitution (1988)")\]

In the essay "[Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3207893?origin=JSTOR-pdf)" Judith Butler proposes that [gender is performative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_performativity "Gender performativity") - that is, gender is not so much a static identity or role, but rather comprises a set of acts which can evolve over time.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-29">[28]</a></sup> Butler states that because gender identity is established through behavior, there is a possibility to construct different genders via different behaviors.<sup id="cite_ref-Jones2018_30-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-Jones2018-30">[29]</a></sup>

> ...if gender is instituted through acts which are internally discontinuous, then the appearance of substance is precisely that, a constructed identity, a performative accomplishment which the mundane social audience, including the actors themselves, come to believe and to perform in the mode of belief. If the ground of gender identity is the stylized repetition of acts through time, and not a seemingly seamless identity, then the possibilities of gender transformation are to be found in the arbitrary relation between such acts, in the possibility of a different sort of repeating, in the breaking or subversive repetition of that style. <sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-31">[30]</a></sup>

Butler concludes their essay with a personal reflection on the strengths and limitations of widespread feminist theories which function on a solely binary perception of gender. Butler critiques what they call the "reification" of sexual difference within a heterosexual framework, and articulates their concern with how this framework affects the accurate presentation (or lack thereof) of "femaleness" across a diverse array of experiences, including those of women. <sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-32">[31]</a></sup>

> As a corporeal field of cultural play, gender is a basically innovative affair, although it is quite clear that there are strict punishments for contesting the script by performing out of turn or through unwarranted improvisations. Gender is not passively scripted on the body, and neither is it determined by nature, language, the symbolic, or the overwhelming history of patriarchy. Gender is what is put on, invariably, under constraint, daily and incessantly, with anxiety and pleasure, but if this continuous act is mistaken for a natural or linguistic given, power is relinquished to expand the cultural field bodily through subversive performances of various kinds.<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-33">[32]</a></sup>

Throughout this text, Butler derives influence from French philosophers such as [Simone de Beauvoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_de_Beauvoir "Simone de Beauvoir") and [Maurice Merleau-Ponty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Merleau-Ponty "Maurice Merleau-Ponty"), particularly de Beauvoir's _[The Second Sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Second_Sex "The Second Sex")_ and Merleau-Ponty's "The Body in its Sexual Being." Butler also cites works by [Gayle Rubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Rubin "Gayle Rubin"), [Mary Anne Warren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Anne_Warren "Mary Anne Warren"), and their own piece "[Sex and Gender in Simone de Beauvoir's _Second Sex_](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2930225)" (1986), among others.

### _Gender Trouble_ (1990)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Judith_Butler&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Gender Trouble (1990)")\]

_Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity_ was first published in 1990, selling over 100,000 copies internationally, in multiple languages.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-34">[33]</a></sup> Similar to "Performative Acts and Gender Constitution," _Gender Trouble_ discusses the works of [Sigmund Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud "Sigmund Freud"), [Simone de Beauvoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_de_Beauvoir "Simone de Beauvoir"), [Julia Kristeva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Kristeva "Julia Kristeva"), [Jacques Lacan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Lacan "Jacques Lacan"), [Luce Irigaray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luce_Irigaray "Luce Irigaray"), [Monique Wittig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monique_Wittig "Monique Wittig"), [Jacques Derrida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Derrida "Jacques Derrida"), and [Michel Foucault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault "Michel Foucault").<sup id="cite_ref-Direk-2020_35-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-Direk-2020-35">[34]</a></sup>

Butler offers a critique of the terms _gender_ and _sex_ as they have been used by feminists.<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-36">[35]</a></sup> Butler argues that feminism made a mistake in trying to make "women" a discrete, ahistorical group with common characteristics. Butler writes that this approach reinforces the binary view of gender relations. Butler believes that feminists should not try to define "women" and they also believe that feminists should "focus on providing an account of how power functions and shapes our understandings of womanhood not only in the society at large but also within the feminist movement."<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-37">[36]</a></sup> Finally, Butler aims to break the supposed links between sex and gender so that gender and desire can be "flexible, free floating and not caused by other stable factors" (David Gauntlett).<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-38">[37]</a></sup> The idea of identity as free and flexible and gender as a performance, not an essence, has become one of the foundations of [queer theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer_theory "Queer theory").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-39">[38]</a></sup>

### _Imitation and Gender Insubordination_ (1991)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Judith_Butler&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Imitation and Gender Insubordination (1991)")\]

_Inside/Out: Lesbian Theories, Gay Theories_ is a collection of writings of gay and lesbian social theorists. Butler's contribution argues that no transparent revelation is afforded by using the terms "gay" or "lesbian" yet there is a political imperative to do so.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-40">[39]</a></sup> Butler employs "the concepts of play/performance, drag, and imitation" to describe the formation of gender and sexuality as continually created subjectivities always at risk of dissolution from non-performance."<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-41">[40]</a></sup>

### _Bodies That Matter_ (1993)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Judith_Butler&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Bodies That Matter (1993)")\]

_Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex_ seeks to clear up readings and supposed misinterpretations of performativity that view the enactment of sex/gender as a daily choice.<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-42">[41]</a></sup> As such, Butler aims to answer questions of this vein that may have been raised from their previous work _Gender Trouble_. Butler emphasizes the role of repetition in performativity, making use of [Derrida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Derrida "Jacques Derrida")'s theory of iterability, which is a form of [citationality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citationality "Citationality"):

> Performativity cannot be understood outside of a process of iterability, a regularized and constrained repetition of norms. And this repetition is not performed _by_ a subject; this repetition is what enables a subject and constitutes the temporal condition for the subject. This iterability implies that 'performance' is not a singular 'act' or event, but a ritualized production, a ritual reiterated under and through constraint, under and through the force of prohibition and taboo, with the threat of ostracism and even death controlling and compelling the shape of the production, but not, I will insist, determining it fully in advance.<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-43">[42]</a></sup>

Butler also explores how gender can be understood not only as a performance, but also as a "constitutive constraint," or constructed character. They ask how this conceptualization of an individual's gender contributes to notions of bodily intelligibility, or comprehension, by other individuals. Butler continues to discuss bodily intelligibility by means of sex as a "materialized" entity, upon which cultural, collective ideals of gender can be built. From this angle, Butler interrogates value conscription upon various bodies as determined theories and practices of heterosexual predominance. <sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-44">[43]</a></sup>

> If gender consists of the social meanings that sex assumes, then sex does not accrue social meanings as additive properties but, rather, is replaced by the social meanings it takes on; sex is relinquished in the course of that assumption, and gender emerges, not as a term in a continued relationship of opposition to sex, but as the term which absorbs and displaces "sex," the mark of its full substantiation into gender or what, from a materialist point of view, might constitute a full de-substantiation. <sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-45">[44]</a></sup>

While continuing to draw upon sources such as those of [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato"), [Irigaray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luce_Irigaray "Luce Irigaray"), [Lacan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Lacan "Jacques Lacan"), and [Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud "Sigmund Freud") (as they did for _Gender Trouble_), Butler also draws upon pieces of documentary film and literature for _Bodies That Matter_. Such pieces include the film _[Paris is Burning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Is_Burning_(film) "Paris Is Burning (film)")_, short stories by [Willa Cather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willa_Cather "Willa Cather"), and the novel _[Passing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passing_(novel) "Passing (novel)")_ by Nella Larsen.

### _Excitable Speech_ (1997)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Judith_Butler&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Excitable Speech (1997)")\]

In _Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative_, Butler surveys the problems of [hate speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech "Hate speech") and censorship. They argue that censorship is difficult to evaluate, and that in some cases it may be useful or even necessary, while in others it may be worse than tolerance.<sup id="cite_ref-Jagger_46-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-Jagger-46">[45]</a></sup>

Butler argues that hate speech exists retrospectively, only after being declared such by state authorities. In this way, the state reserves for itself the power to define hate speech and, conversely, the limits of acceptable discourse. In this connection, Butler criticizes feminist legal scholar [Catharine MacKinnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharine_MacKinnon "Catharine MacKinnon")'s argument against pornography for its unquestioning acceptance of the state's power to censor.<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-47">[46]</a></sup>

Deploying [Foucault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault "Michel Foucault")'s argument from the first volume of _[The History of Sexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_Sexuality "The History of Sexuality")_, Butler states that any attempt at censorship, legal or otherwise, necessarily propagates the very language it seeks to forbid.<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-48">[47]</a></sup> As Foucault argues, for example, the strict sexual mores of 19th-century Western Europe did nothing but amplify the discourse of sexuality they sought to control.<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-49">[48]</a></sup> Extending this argument using [Derrida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrida "Derrida") and [Lacan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Lacan "Jacques Lacan"), Butler says that censorship is primitive to language, and that the linguistic "I" is a mere effect of a primitive censorship. In this way, Butler questions the possibility of any genuinely oppositional discourse; "If speech depends upon censorship, then the principle that one might seek to oppose is at once the formative principle of oppositional speech".<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-50">[49]</a></sup>

### _Precarious Life_ (2004)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Judith_Butler&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Precarious Life (2004)")\]

_Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence_ opens a new line in Judith Butler's work that has had a great impact on their subsequent thought, especially on books like _Frames of War: When Is Life Grievable?_ (2009) or _Notes Toward a Performative Theory of Assembly_ (2015), as well as on other contemporary thinkers.<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-51">[50]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-52">[51]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-53">[52]</a></sup> In this book, Butler deals with issues of precarity, vulnerability, grief and contemporary political violence in the face of the [War on terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_terror "War on terror") and the realities of [prisoners at Guantanamo Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp "Guantanamo Bay detention camp") and similar detention centers. Drawing on Foucault, they characterize the form of power at work in these places of "indefinite detention" as a convergence of [sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty "Sovereignty") and [governmentality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governmentality "Governmentality"). The "[state of exception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_exception "State of exception")" deployed here is in fact more complex than the one pointed out by [Agamben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Agamben "Giorgio Agamben") in his _Homo Sacer_, since the government is in a more ambiguous relation to law —it may comply with it or suspend it, depending on its interests, and this is itself a tool of the state to produce its own sovereignty.<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-54">[53]</a></sup> Butler also points towards problems in [international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law "International law") treatises like the [Geneva Conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions "Geneva Conventions"). In practice, these only protect people who belong to (or act in the name of) a recognized state, and therefore are helpless in situations of abuse toward [stateless people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statelessness "Statelessness"), people who do not enjoy a recognized citizenship or people who are labelled "terrorists", and therefore understood as acting on their own behalf as irrational "killing machines" that need to be held captive due to their "dangerousness".<sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-55">[54]</a></sup>

Butler also writes here on vulnerability and precariousness as intrinsic to the human condition. This is due to our inevitable interdependency from other precarious subjects, who are never really "complete" or autonomous but instead always "dispossessed" on the Other. This is manifested in shared experiences like [grief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grief "Grief") and loss, that can form the basis for a recognition of our shared human (vulnerable) condition.<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-56">[55]</a></sup> However, not every loss can be mourned in the same way, and in fact not every life can be conceived of as such (as situated in a condition common to ours).<sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-57">[56]</a></sup> Through a critical engagement with [Levinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Levinas "Emmanuel Levinas"), they will explore how certain representations prevent lives from being considered worthy of being lived or taken into account, precluding the mourning of certain Others, and with that the recognition of them and their losses as equally human.<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-58">[57]</a></sup> This preoccupation with the dignifying or dehumanizing role of practices of framing and representations will constitute one of the central elements of _Frames of War_ (2009).

### _Undoing Gender_ (2004)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Judith_Butler&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Undoing Gender (2004)")\]

_Undoing Gender_ collects Butler's reflections on gender, sex, sexuality, psychoanalysis and the medical treatment of intersex people for a more general readership than many of their other books. Butler revisits and refines their notion of performativity and focuses on the question of undoing "restrictively normative conceptions of sexual and gendered life".<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Butler discusses how gender is performed without one being conscious of it, but says that it does not mean this performativity is "automatic or mechanical". They argue that we have desires that do not originate from our personhood, but rather, from social norms. The writer also debates our notions of "human" and "less-than-human" and how these culturally imposed ideas can keep one from having a "viable life" as the biggest concerns are usually about whether a person will be accepted if their desires differ from normality. Butler states that one may feel the need of being recognized in order to live, but that at the same time, the conditions to be recognized make life "unlivable". The writer proposes an interrogation of such conditions so that people who resist them may have more possibilities of living.<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-59">[58]</a></sup>

In Butler's discussion of intersex issues and people, Butler addresses the case of [David Reimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer "David Reimer"), a person whose sex was medically [reassigned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_assignment#Assignment_in_cases_of_infants_with_intersex_traits,_or_cases_of_trauma "Sex assignment") from male to female after a botched [circumcision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision "Circumcision") at eight months of age. Reimer was "made" female by doctors, but later in life identified as "really" male, married and became a stepfather to his wife's three children, and went on to tell his story in _[As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_Nature_Made_Him:_The_Boy_Who_Was_Raised_as_a_Girl "As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl")_, which he wrote with [John Colapinto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Colapinto "John Colapinto"). Reimer died by suicide in 2004.<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-60">[59]</a></sup>

### _Giving an Account of Oneself_ (2005)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Judith_Butler&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Giving an Account of Oneself (2005)")\]

In _Giving an Account of Oneself_, Butler develops an ethics based on the opacity of the subject to itself; in other words, the limits of self-knowledge. Primarily borrowing from [Theodor Adorno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Adorno "Theodor Adorno"), [Michel Foucault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault "Michel Foucault"), [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche "Friedrich Nietzsche"), [Jean Laplanche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Laplanche "Jean Laplanche"), [Adriana Cavarero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriana_Cavarero "Adriana Cavarero") and [Emmanuel Levinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Levinas "Emmanuel Levinas"), Butler develops a theory of the formation of the subject. Butler theorizes the subject in relation to the social – a community of others and their norms – which is beyond the control of the subject it forms, as precisely the very condition of that subject's formation, the resources by which the subject becomes recognizably human, a grammatical "I", in the first place.

Butler accepts the claim that if the subject is opaque to itself the limitations of its free ethical responsibility and obligations are due to the limits of narrative, presuppositions of language and projection.

> You may think that I am in fact telling a story about the prehistory of the subject, one that I have been arguing cannot be told. There are two responses to this objection. (1) That there is no final or adequate narrative reconstruction of the prehistory of the speaking "I" does not mean we cannot narrate it; it only means that at the moment when we narrate we become speculative philosophers or fiction writers. (2) This prehistory has never stopped happening and, as such, is not a prehistory in any chronological sense. It is not done with, over, relegated to a past, which then becomes part of a causal or narrative reconstruction of the self. On the contrary, that prehistory interrupts the story I have to give of myself, makes every account of myself partial and failed, and constitutes, in a way, my failure to be fully accountable for my actions, my final "irresponsibility," one for which I may be forgiven only because I could not do otherwise. This not being able to do otherwise is our common predicament (page 78).

Instead Butler argues for an ethics based precisely on the limits of self-knowledge as the limits of responsibility itself. Any concept of responsibility which demands the full transparency of the self to itself, an entirely accountable self, necessarily does violence to the opacity which marks the constitution of the self it addresses. The scene of address by which responsibility is enabled is always already a relation between subjects who are variably opaque to themselves and to each other. The ethics that Butler envisions is therefore one in which the responsible self knows the limits of its knowing, recognizes the limits of its capacity to give an account of itself to others, and respects those limits as symptomatically human. To take seriously one's opacity to oneself in ethical deliberation means then to critically interrogate the social world in which one comes to be human in the first place and which remains precisely that which one cannot know about oneself. In this way, Butler locates social and political critique at the core of ethical practice.<sup id="cite_ref-61"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-61">[60]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-62">[61]</a></sup>

In _The Force of Nonviolence: An Ethico-Political Bind_, Butler connects the ideologies of nonviolence and the political struggle for social equality. They review the traditional understanding of "nonviolence," stating that it "is often misunderstood as a passive practice that emanates from a calm region of the soul, or as an individualist ethical relation to existing forms of power."<sup id="cite_ref-Force_of_Nonviolence_64-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-Force_of_Nonviolence-64">[63]</a></sup> Instead of this understanding, Butler argues that "nonviolence is an ethical position found in the midst of the political field."<sup id="cite_ref-Force_of_Nonviolence_64-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-Force_of_Nonviolence-64">[63]</a></sup>

## Reception\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Judith_Butler&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Reception")\]

Butler's work has been influential in feminist and queer theory, [cultural studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_studies "Cultural studies"), and [continental philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_philosophy "Continental philosophy").<sup id="cite_ref-aranguiz_65-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-aranguiz-65">[64]</a></sup> Their contribution to a range of other disciplines, such as [psychoanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis "Psychoanalysis"), literary, film, and [performance studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_studies "Performance studies") as well as visual arts, has also been significant.<sup id="cite_ref-kearns_4-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-kearns-4">[4]</a></sup> Their theory of gender performativity as well as their conception of "critically queer" have heavily influenced understandings of gender and queer identity in the academic world, and have shaped and mobilized various kinds of political activism, particularly queer activism, internationally.<sup id="cite_ref-aranguiz_65-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-aranguiz-65">[64]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-66"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-66">[65]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-67">[66]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-68"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-68">[67]</a></sup> Butler's work has also entered into contemporary debates on the teaching of gender, gay parenting, and the depathologization of transgender people.<sup id="cite_ref-69"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-69">[68]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-70"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-70">[69]</a></sup>

Some academics and political activists see in Butler a departure from the sex/gender dichotomy and a non-essentialist conception of gender—along with an insistence that power helps [form the subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectification "Subjectification")—an idea whose introduction purportedly brought new insights to feminist and queer praxis, thought, and studies.<sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-71">[70]</a></sup> [Darin Barney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darin_Barney "Darin Barney") of [McGill University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGill_University "McGill University") wrote that:

> Butler's work on gender, sex, sexuality, queerness, feminism, bodies, political speech and ethics has changed the way scholars all over the world think, talk and write about identity, subjectivity, power and politics. It has also changed the lives of countless people whose bodies, genders, sexualities and desires have made them subject to violence, exclusion and oppression.<sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-72">[71]</a></sup>

Postmodern feminism's major departure from other branches of feminism is perhaps the argument that [sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex "Sex") is itself [constructed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_construction "Social construction") through [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse "Discourse"), a view notably propounded in Butler's 1990 book, _[Gender Trouble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_Trouble "Gender Trouble")_.<sup id="cite_ref-73"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-73">[72]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-74">[73]</a></sup> Consequently, Butler's work is passible of criticism by [modernist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment") and [anti-relativist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factual_relativism "Factual relativism") [critics of postmodernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_postmodernism "Criticism of postmodernism") who deplore the idea that categories spoken about in the natural sciences (e.g., sex) are socially constructed.

In 1998, [Denis Dutton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Dutton "Denis Dutton")'s journal _[Philosophy and Literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_and_Literature "Philosophy and Literature")_ awarded Butler first prize in its fourth annual "Bad Writing Competition", which set out to "celebrate bad writing from the most stylistically lamentable passages found in scholarly books and articles", which Butler [responded to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Dutton#Criticism_of_academic_prose "Denis Dutton").<sup id="cite_ref-bad_75-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-bad-75">[74]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-76"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-76">[b]</a></sup>

[Susan Bordo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Bordo "Susan Bordo"), for example, has argued that Butler reduces gender to language and has contended that the body is a major part of gender, in opposition to Butler's conception of gender as performative.<sup id="cite_ref-83"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-83">[81]</a></sup> A particularly vocal critic has been feminist [Martha Nussbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Nussbaum "Martha Nussbaum"), who has argued that Butler misreads [J. L. Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._L._Austin "J. L. Austin")'s idea of [performative utterance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performative_utterance "Performative utterance"), makes erroneous legal claims, forecloses an essential site of resistance by repudiating pre-cultural agency, and provides no "normative theory of social justice and human dignity."<sup id="cite_ref-The_Professor_Parody_84-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-The_Professor_Parody-84">[82]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-85"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-85">[83]</a></sup> Finally, [Nancy Fraser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Fraser "Nancy Fraser")'s critique of Butler was part of a famous exchange between the two theorists. Fraser has suggested that Butler's focus on performativity distances them from "everyday ways of talking and thinking about ourselves. ... Why should we use such a self-distancing idiom?"<sup id="cite_ref-86"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-86">[84]</a></sup> Butler responded to criticisms in the preface to the 1999-edition _Gender Trouble_ by asking suggestively whether there is "a value to be derived from...experiences of linguistic difficulty."<sup id="cite_ref-interview2001_87-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-interview2001-87">[85]</a></sup>

For example, Timothy Laurie notes that Butler's use of phrases like "gender politics" and "gender violence" in relation to assaults on transgender individuals in the United States can "\[scour\] a landscape filled with class and labour relations, racialized urban stratification, and complex interactions between sexual identity, sexual practices and sex work", and produce instead "a clean surface on which struggles over 'the human' are imagined to play out".<sup id="cite_ref-89"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-89">[87]</a></sup>

German feminist [Alice Schwarzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Schwarzer "Alice Schwarzer") speaks of Butler's "radical intellectual games" that would not change how society classifies and treats a woman; thus, by eliminating female and male identity Butler would have abolished the discourse about sexism in the queer community. Schwarzer also accuses Butler of remaining silent about the oppression of women and homosexuals in the Islamic world, while readily exercising their right to [same-sex-marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage "Same-sex marriage") in the United States; instead, Butler would sweepingly defend [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam "Islam"), including [Islamism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism "Islamism"), from critics.<sup id="cite_ref-90"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-90">[88]</a></sup>

Butler states that this weaponization can result in widespread misuse of the accusation "[antisemitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism "Antisemitism")", which may in fact trivialize the accusation's gravity and weight.<sup id="cite_ref-100"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-100">[97]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-101"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-101">[98]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-102"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-102">[99]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Derstandard15_103-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-Derstandard15-103">[100]</a></sup>

On September 7, 2006, Butler participated in a faculty-organized [teach-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teach-in "Teach-in") against the [2006 Lebanon War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Lebanon_War "2006 Lebanon War") at the University of California, Berkeley.<sup id="cite_ref-104"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-104">[101]</a></sup> Another widely publicized moment occurred in June 2010, when Butler refused the Civil Courage Award (Zivilcouragepreis) of the [Christopher Street Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Street_Day "Christopher Street Day") (CSD) Parade in Berlin, Germany at the award ceremony. They cited racist comments on the part of organizers and a general failure of CSD organizations to distance themselves from racism in general and from anti-Muslim excuses for war more specifically. Criticizing the event's commercialism, Butler went on to name several groups that they commended as stronger opponents of "homophobia, transphobia, sexism, racism, and militarism".<sup id="cite_ref-105"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-105">[102]</a></sup>

In October 2011, Butler attended [Occupy Wall Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street "Occupy Wall Street") and, in reference to calls for clarification of the protesters' demands, they said:

> People have asked, so what are the demands? What are the demands all of these people are making? Either they say there are no demands and that leaves your critics confused, or they say that the demands for social equality and economic justice are impossible demands. And the impossible demands, they say, are just not practical. If hope is an impossible demand, then we demand the impossible – that the right to shelter, food and employment are impossible demands, then we demand the impossible. If it is impossible to demand that those who profit from the recession redistribute their wealth and cease their greed, then yes, we demand the impossible.<sup id="cite_ref-106"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-106">[103]</a></sup>

Butler receives the [Theodor W. Adorno Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_W._Adorno_Award "Theodor W. Adorno Award") in 2012

When Butler received the 2012 [Adorno Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_W._Adorno_Award "Theodor W. Adorno Award"), the prize committee came under attack from Israel's Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman; the director of the [Simon Wiesenthal Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Wiesenthal_Center "Simon Wiesenthal Center")'s office in Jerusalem, [Efraim Zuroff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efraim_Zuroff "Efraim Zuroff");<sup id="cite_ref-109"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-109">[106]</a></sup> and the German Central Council of Jews. They were upset at Butler's selection because of Butler's remarks about Israel and specifically Butler's "calls for a boycott against Israel".<sup id="cite_ref-110"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-110">[107]</a></sup> Butler responded saying that "\[Butler\] did not take attacks from German Jewish leaders personally".<sup id="cite_ref-JTA-2012_111-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-JTA-2012-111">[108]</a></sup> Rather, they wrote, the attacks are "directed against everyone who is critical against Israel and its current policies".<sup id="cite_ref-JTA-2012_111-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-JTA-2012-111">[108]</a></sup>

In a letter to the _[Mondoweiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondoweiss "Mondoweiss")_ website, Butler wrote that they developed strong ethical views on the basis of Jewish philosophical thought and that it is "blatantly untrue, absurd, and painful for anyone to argue that those who formulate a criticism of the State of Israel is anti-Semitic or, if Jewish, self-hating".<sup id="cite_ref-mondoweiss_107-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-mondoweiss-107">[104]</a></sup>

### Comments on Hamas, Hezbollah and the Israel–Hamas war\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Judith_Butler&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Comments on Hamas, Hezbollah and the Israel–Hamas war")\]

Butler was criticized for statements they had made about [Hamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas "Hamas") and [Hezbollah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah "Hezbollah"). Butler was accused of describing them as "social movements that are progressive, that are on the Left, that are part of a global Left."<sup id="cite_ref-112"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-112">[109]</a></sup> They were accused of defending "Hezbollah and Hamas as progressive organizations" and supporting their tactics.<sup id="cite_ref-113"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-113">[110]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-114"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-114">[111]</a></sup>

Butler responded to these criticisms by stating that their remarks on Hamas and Hezbollah were taken completely out of context and, in so doing, their established views on non-violence were contradicted and misrepresented. Butler describes the origin of their remarks on Hamas and Hezbollah in the following way:

> I was asked by a member of an academic audience a few years ago whether I thought Hamas and Hezbollah belonged to "the global left" and I replied with two points. My first point was merely descriptive: those political organizations define themselves as anti-imperialist, and anti-imperialism is one characteristic of the global left, so on that basis one could describe them as part of the global left. My second point was then critical: as with any group on the left, one has to decide whether one is for that group or against that group, and one needs to critically evaluate their stand.<sup id="cite_ref-mondoweiss_107-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-mondoweiss-107">[104]</a></sup>

After the start of the 2023 [Israel–Hamas war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_war "Israel–Hamas war"), Butler published an essay titled "The Compass of Mourning", in which they "condemn without qualification" the "terrifying and revolting massacre" while at the same time argued that Hamas' attacks should be seen in the context of the "horrors of the last seventy years".<sup id="cite_ref-115"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-115">[112]</a></sup> The article was criticized several times in German newspapers. Christian Geyer-Hindemith wrote in the [FAZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurter_Allgemeine_Zeitung "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung") that Butler "makes individual atrocities disappear" through contextualization, Thomas E. Schmidt spoke in the [Die Zeit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Zeit "Die Zeit") about "reversal of guilt", Anna Mayr also wrote in the Die Zeit: "\[...\] countless the same thing goes on for paragraphs: Nothing can justify the violence, and you still have to see the violence of the occupying power, Israel. It becomes clear that \[they\] (understandably) doesn't know where to think next."<sup id="cite_ref-116"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-116">[113]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-117"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-117">[114]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-118"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-118">[115]</a></sup> Writing for [Haaretz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haaretz "Haaretz"), Chaim Levinson rejected Butler's framing of the matter within a context of [colonialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism "Colonialism") saying that term "is the emptiest word in Western intellectual discourse today".<sup id="cite_ref-119"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-119">[116]</a></sup>

Speaking at a public event in Paris on March 3, 2024, Butler stated that the [2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel "2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel") was an uprising, an instance of armed resistance, rather than an act of terrorism.<sup id="cite_ref-120"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-120">[117]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-121"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-121">[118]</a></sup>

### \[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Judith_Butler&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Comments on Black Lives Matter")\]

In a January 2015 interview with [George Yancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Yancy "George Yancy") of _[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")_, Butler discussed the [Black Lives Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter "Black Lives Matter") movement. They said:

> What is implied by this statement \[Black Lives Matter\], a statement that should be obviously true, but apparently is not? If black lives do not matter, then they are not really regarded as lives, since a life is supposed to matter. So what we see is that some lives matter more than others, that some lives matter so much that they need to be protected at all costs, and that other lives matter less, or not at all. And when that becomes the situation, then the lives that do not matter so much, or do not matter at all, can be killed or lost, can be exposed to conditions of destitution, and there is no concern, or even worse, that is regarded as the way it is supposed to be...When people engage in concerted actions across racial lines to build communities based on equality, to defend the rights of those who are disproportionately imperiled to have a chance to live without the fear of dying quite suddenly at the hands of the police. There are many ways to do this, in the street, the office, the home, and in the media. Only through such an ever-growing cross-racial struggle against racism can we begin to achieve a sense of all the lives that really do matter.

The dialogue draws heavily on their 2004 book _Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence._<sup id="cite_ref-123"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-123">[120]</a></sup>

### Avital Ronell sexual harassment case\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Judith_Butler&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Avital Ronell sexual harassment case")\]

On May 11, 2018, Butler joined a group of scholars in writing a letter to [New York University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University "New York University") following the sexual harassment suit filed by a former NYU graduate student against his advisor [Avital Ronell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avital_Ronell "Avital Ronell"). The signatories acknowledged not having had access to the confidential findings of the investigation that followed the [Title IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX "Title IX") complaint against Ronell. Nonetheless, they accused the complainant of waging a "malicious campaign" against Ronell. The signatories also wrote that the presumed "malicious intention has animated and sustained this legal nightmare" for a highly regarded scholar. "If she were to be terminated or relieved of her duties, the injustice would be widely recognized and opposed."<sup id="cite_ref-124"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-124">[121]</a></sup> Butler, one of the signatories, invoked their title as President Elect of the [Modern Language Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Language_Association "Modern Language Association"). James J. Marino, a professor at Cleveland State University and a member of the MLA, started a petition to demand Butler's resignation or removal from their post. He argued that "Protesting against one instance of punishment is only a means to the larger end of preserving senior faculty's privilege of impunity. ... \[Butler\] was standing up for an old, corrupt, and long-standing way of doing business. The time for doing business that way is over. We should never look back."<sup id="cite_ref-125"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-125">[122]</a></sup> Some three months later, Butler apologized to the MLA for the letter. "I acknowledged that I should not have allowed the MLA affiliation to go forward with my name," Butler wrote to the _[Chronicle of Higher Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicle_of_Higher_Education "Chronicle of Higher Education")_. "I expressed regret to the MLA officers and staff, and my colleagues accepted my apology. I extend that same apology to MLA members."<sup id="cite_ref-126"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler#cite_note-126">[123]</a></sup>

Similarly, MacKinnon's appeal to the state to construe pornography as performative speech and, hence, as the injurious conduct of representation, does not settle the theoretical question of the relation between representation and conduct, but collapses the distinction in order to enhance the power of state intervention over graphic sexual representation.

Butler clarifies that instead of a kind of voluntary theatricality donned and doffed by a pre-existing agent, gender performance is constitutive of the agent itself.

I will proceed backwards, from present to past, from critiques and interpretations to Beauvoir's own writing. My starting point is the recent criticism presented by Judith Butler in her _Gender Trouble_ (1990a). In this work, Butler contrasts her own "performative theory of gender" to Beauvoir's\[...\]  
    \[...\]the notion that Butler presented a voluntarist theory of gender. \[...\] Judith Butler bases her voluntarist reading on [Le Doeuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mich%C3%A8le_Le_D%C5%93uff "Michèle Le Dœuff")'s work. \[\[fi:Sara Heinamaa\]\]

Hence, Probyn argues that according to Butler's theory of gender performativity "we can have whatever type of gender we want \[...\] " \[...\] Butler herself does not criticize [Beauvoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_de_Beauvoir "Simone de Beauvoir") for \[...\] a voluntaristic framework \[...\] \[Butler\] mentions Michele Le Doeuff and other feminists who accuse of Beauvoir for resurrecting "a classical form of voluntarism which insidiously blames the victims of oppression for 'choosing' their situation"
