**Avraham "Avrum" Burg** ([Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language"): אברהם בורג; born 19 January 1955) is an Israeli author, politician and businessman.<sup id="cite_ref-businessman_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-businessman-1">[1]</a></sup> He was a member of the [Knesset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset "Knesset"), chairman of the [Jewish Agency for Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Agency_for_Israel "Jewish Agency for Israel"), [Speaker of the Knesset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Knesset_speakers "List of Knesset speakers"), and Interim President of Israel. He was the first Speaker of the Knesset to have been [born in Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_(person) "Sabra (person)") after its declaration of [independence in 1948](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Declaration_of_Independence "Israeli Declaration of Independence"). A member of the [Labor Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Labor_Party "Israeli Labor Party") when he was a member of the Knesset, Burg announced in January 2015 that he had joined [Hadash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadash "Hadash").<sup id="cite_ref-hadash_2-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-hadash-2">[2]</a></sup>

From the 2000s onwards he has expressed views described as [post-Zionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Zionist "Post-Zionist"), a label he self-identified with in 2011. He is in favor of Israel negotiating with [Hamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas "Hamas"), and has called to abandon [Herzelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herzel "Herzel") [Zionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism "Zionism") (calling it a [scaffolding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding "Scaffolding") that should be removed) in favor of a form of [Cultural Zionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Zionism "Cultural Zionism"), also citing the [civic nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_nationalism "Civic nationalism") [of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people#Multiculturalism_versus_universalism "French people") as an example to follow.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

## Early life\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Avraham_Burg&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Early life")\]

He was born and raised in [Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem "Jerusalem")'s [Rehavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehavia "Rehavia") neighborhood. His father was [Yosef Burg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Burg "Yosef Burg"), a German-born Israeli politician and longtime government minister for the [National Religious Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Religious_Party "National Religious Party"). His mother was Rivka (née Slonim) who was born in [Hebron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebron "Hebron") and a survivor of the [1929 Hebron massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Hebron_massacre "1929 Hebron massacre").<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

In the [Israel Defense Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces "Israel Defense Forces"), Burg served as a platoon commander with the rank of lieutenant in the paratroopers brigade. He graduated from the [Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_University_of_Jerusalem "Hebrew University of Jerusalem") with a degree in the social sciences.

Burg married Yael, and they had six children. He lives in [Nataf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nataf "Nataf"), a rural community, on the outskirts of [Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem "Jerusalem").<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

## Political career\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Avraham_Burg&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Political career")\]

Burg was an activist in left-wing organizations and the [Peace Now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Now "Peace Now") movement. He was injured in the grenade attack on a [Peace Now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Now "Peace Now") demonstration in Jerusalem in February 1983 which killed [Emil Grunzweig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Grunzweig "Emil Grunzweig").<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> In 1985, he served as advisor on [Diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora "Diaspora") affairs to Prime Minister [Shimon Peres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Peres "Shimon Peres"). In 1988, he was elected to the [Knesset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset "Knesset") as a member of the [Alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(political_party) "Alignment (political party)").

In 1992, when the Alignment became the [Labor Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Labor_Party "Israeli Labor Party"), he was reelected to Knesset. He served as chairman of the Education Committee.

In 1995, he was appointed Chairman of the [Jewish Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Agency_for_Israel "Jewish Agency for Israel") and the [World Zionist Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Zionist_Organization "World Zionist Organization"), and resigned from the Knesset. As head of the Jewish Agency, he worked to recover Jewish property lost during [The Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust "The Holocaust") and in the transfer of approximately half a million predominantly Jewish citizens from the [Commonwealth of Independent States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States "Commonwealth of Independent States") (the former [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")) to Israel. After his term as chairman of the Jewish Agency, Burg continued to use a car and driver provided by the agency for 10 years.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> When it was cut he sued to continue to receive these benefits, but lost the court case, with the judge saying, "Burg didn't explain the fact that he also uses the car for his own personal business."<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

In 1999, Burg returned to domestic politics, and was elected to the Knesset on [Ehud Barak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehud_Barak "Ehud Barak")'s [One Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Israel "One Israel") list (an alliance of Labor, [Meimad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meimad "Meimad") and [Gesher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesher_(political_party) "Gesher (political party)")). Although Prime Minister Barak backed another candidate, Burg was elected Speaker of the Knesset, a position he held until early 2003. In his capacity as speaker of the Knesset he served as interim [President of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Israel "President of Israel") for 20 days, from 12 July until 1 August 2000 when the presidency was vacant following [Ezer Weizman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezer_Weizman "Ezer Weizman")'s resignation.

Following Barak's defeat in the [2001 election for Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Israeli_prime_ministerial_election "2001 Israeli prime ministerial election") and his subsequent resignation, Burg ran for the Labor Party leadership, and won amid accusations of voter fraud. In a revote he lost to [Binyamin Ben-Eliezer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binyamin_Ben-Eliezer "Binyamin Ben-Eliezer"). Burg called for cancellation of this second vote, a move supported by Labor Party chairman [Ra'anan Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra%27anan_Cohen "Ra'anan Cohen").<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> Nevertheless, Burg retained his seat in the Knesset in the [2003 elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Israeli_legislative_election "2003 Israeli legislative election").

Also in 2003, Burg published an article in _[Yedioth Ahronoth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yedioth_Ahronoth "Yedioth Ahronoth")_ in which he declared, "Israel, having ceased to care about the children of the Palestinians, should not be surprised when they come washed in hatred and [blow themselves up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_suicide_bombers_in_the_Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict "Child suicide bombers in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict") in the centers of Israeli [escapism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapism "Escapism")."<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

## After retirement\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Avraham_Burg&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: After retirement")\]

In 2004, Burg resigned from the Knesset and public life. He became a businessman. In 2007, a Burg-led consortium won the rights to purchase [Ashot Ashkelon Industries](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ashot_Ashkelon_Industries&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ashot Ashkelon Industries (page does not exist)"), but the sale was cancelled by the Israeli government. Burg's attorney said that if it was cancelled since the government wanted to sell it together with [Israel Military Industries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Military_Industries "Israel Military Industries") (IMI), "we may bid for IMI." There had also been a review by the State Comptroller and the Israeli Police "into suspicions that \[Burg\] was a straw-man for Ian Nigel Davis and Aviv Algor. (Davis and Algor have been indicted in a securities case, on charges of fraudulently obtaining the approval of Middle East Tube Ltd. shareholders for a 250,000-shekel monthly management fee.) The prosecutor closed the file against Burg for lack of evidence."<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>

Burg has lectured at international events and served on the board of directors of Vita Pri Hagalil.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> Burg was embroiled in a controversy over an "alleged missing 270,000,000 New Israel Shekels," money lent to Vita Pri Hagalil. Burg referred to the banks involved as being "hypocritical" since according to Burg, the banks had received substantial interest payments on the loan. However, a senior banker questioned this, saying "had the owners demonstrated serious intent to use the capital injection to rescue the company, there's no question that we'd contribute to the rescue effort. The owners' abandonment of responsibility is what forced us to ask for the appointment of a receiver. We had no choice."<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

In 2007, Burg published a book called _Defeating Hitler_ in which he claimed that Israeli society is fascist and violent by the continuing trauma over the Holocaust.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

In an interview in _[Haaretz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haaretz "Haaretz")_ in June 2007, Burg suggested abolishing the [Law of Return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Return "Law of Return") and stated that "to define the State of Israel as a Jewish state is the key to its end. A Jewish state is explosive. It's dynamite." He also called on all Israelis to obtain foreign citizenship if possible. Burg himself had acquired [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France") citizenship in 2004, as part of his campaign in Israel calling "on everyone who can to obtain a foreign passport."<sup id="cite_ref-define_16-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-define-16">[16]</a></sup> In response to public criticism of the interview, however, he published a retraction, recommending that Israel be defined not as a "Jewish State" but as a "State of the Jews."<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> In 2021 he stated that he was preparing to appeal to the Supreme Court to have the Interior Ministry erase from its records that his nationality is Jewish.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>

In April 2008, Burg signed a letter of support for the recently created [J Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Street_(advocacy_group) "J Street (advocacy group)") American left-wing lobby group.<sup id="cite_ref-guardian_20-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-guardian-20">[20]</a></sup> On 14 November 2008, he joined a new left-wing movement intending to support the [Meretz-Yachad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meretz-Yachad "Meretz-Yachad") party in the 2009 national elections.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>

In 2011, Burg wrote an op-ed in _Haaretz_ claiming that there was a reasonable chance of a [one-state solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-state_solution "One-state solution") coming to pass. On the possibility of one state, he wrote, "It is likely to be a country with nationalist, racist and religious discrimination and one that is patently not democratic, like the one that exists today. But it could be something entirely different. An entity with a common basis for at least three players: an ideological right that is prepared to examine its feasibility; a left, part of which is starting to free itself of the illusions of "Jewish and democratic"; and a not inconsiderable part of the Palestinian intelligentsia. The conceptual framework will be agreed upon - a democratic state that belongs to all of its citizens. The practicable substance could be fertile ground for arguments and creativity. This is an opportunity worth taking, despite our grand experience of missing every opportunity and accusing everyone else except ourselves."<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

In 2012, Burg endorsed a boycott of [Israeli settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement "Israeli settlement") products and said that he personally boycotts all products produced in the settlements and does not cross the [Green Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Line_(Israel) "Green Line (Israel)"). He also called Israel "the last colonial occupier in the Western world."<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>

In 2012, Burg became a senior fellow of [Molad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molad "Molad") – The Center for Renewal of Democracy, a "new think tank committed to leftist renewal." According to an article in Haaretz, "the center is funded by left-liberal foundations and groups from the U.S. associated with the Democratic party."<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

In early December 2013, he confirmed the existence of [Israel's nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_and_Israel "Nuclear weapons and Israel") during a speech at a conference aimed at denuclearising the Middle East. He stated that national policy of neither confirming or denying the existence of such weapons as "outdated and childish."<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup>

Burg joined the leftist Jewish-Arab [Hadash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadash "Hadash") Party in January 2015.<sup id="cite_ref-hadash_2-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-hadash-2">[2]</a></sup> In a subsequent interview, he criticized Israel for continuing to follow Zionism as a national ideology and calling for the Law of Return to be reduced to a minimum. He also stated that Israel's future was a choice between becoming a fundamentalist Jewish state or as a binational Jewish-Arab confederation with [open borders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_borders "Open borders") and part of a regional union.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>

Burg has been a devoted athlete, running marathons and participating in a few ironmen competitions.

He is [vegan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegan "Vegan").<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>

In April 2015, after Jewish immigration to Israel from European countries had significantly increased after several incidents involving Jews in Europe, Burg published an op-ed in _[Haaretz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haaretz "Haaretz")_ dissuading anti-Semitism allegations and calling on Jews to remain in Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>

In August 2023, Burg was one of more than 1,500 U.S., Israeli, Jewish and Palestinian academics and public figures who signed an open letter stating that Israel operates "[a regime of apartheid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_and_apartheid "Israel and apartheid")" and calling on US Jewish groups to speak out against the occupation in Palestine.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Burg#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>
