**Left Forum** brings together grassroots groups, activists, academics, and countless people who are trying to understand and improve their roles in transforming our world. Through our collaborations with [**Democracy at Work**](https://www.democracyatwork.info/), [**The Institute for the Radical Imagination**](https://radicalimagination.institute/)**,** and [**The Marxist Education Project**](https://marxedproject.org/events)**,** we plan to grow an intensified and ongoing project of educating each other and debating strategies while building solidarity!
