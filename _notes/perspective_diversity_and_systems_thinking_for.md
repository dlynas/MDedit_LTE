## Perspective Diversity and Systems Thinking for Perception of Ambiguous Phenomena

I am very interested about applying multiple interpretations to logical systems. Many physical phenomena can be considered to be **AMBIGUOUS** in terms of multiple senses (e.g. sight and sound).

However, Dewan-Herrick is a practicing clinician, not a systems theorist. However, he seemed to be drawing on systems theory as studied by psychologists. He discussed perception and interpretation; he mentioned the need for a systems theory perspective but he did not cite any textbooks on systems theory.

	If you produce a many-to-one mapping (a classic example being reducing a probability distribution in one variable to a single variable), then it may be possible to find an orthogonal reduction that contains none of the information contained in the other.

	So if you have a joint probability distribution over two variables, you can reduce it by integrating over the first or second variable, producing two different probability distributions, and how they are related will depend on their mutual dependence. This can be seen when you look at the entropy for the total distribution, which is the sum of the entropies for these reduced distributions, with a subtractive term based on how they are correlated, which is called the mutual information.

	If you consider the shape which has different views from different sides, there isn't a direct parallel between the reduced probability distributions and the two views, as although variation in the x direction will not be visible when observing the yz plane, both views will share z information. Add in the xy plane view from below, and you have an extremely constrained form that can only have particular configurations to meet all of these constraints.

	But nevertheless, when you are looking at only one side, you can imagine that there are various possibilities to arrange something in the x direction such that this yz plane view remains the same.

	Strangely, these highly constrained versions of ambiguity can sometimes be the worst examples to investigation the phenomenon in general, as they are often artefacts carefully tuned to find those exact combinations of phenomena that can be slotted in.

	Though there are many other situations in which we are able to combine phenomena so that they map to multiple things simultaneously. You can for example create an image that has the texture of a potato, but is in the shape of a phone. Under different categories of judgement, we can recognise that as being like a potato, in terms of its texture, and like a phone, in terms of its square shape, but this effect becomes notable when we are dealing with phenomena we expect to be mutually exclusive, such as the Yanny/Laurel sound, or the spinning dancer illusion. The phenomenon is compatible with two versions simultaneously, but our habits of perception encourage us to choose one over another, rather than recognising that both possibilities are compatible with the same image.

	As far as your main question, on finding books is concerned, I'm not sure I can help you, though trying to investigate many-to-one maps may be helpful. I've also sometimes seen these called "homeomorphisms" metaphorically, by people working in a cybernetic context.

		I was busy for a few days and just saw your answer for the first time today. Thanks for jogging my memeory. Some years ago I took a probability course that had some calculus problems for probability distributions and I think I can still find my old notes.

		Actually, you may have helped me quite a bit! Thank you!
