> Here’s 32 things I’ve learned that I hope help you in your journey:
> 
> 1. It’s usually better to be nice than right.
> 2. Nothing worthwhile comes easy. 
> 3. Work on a passion project, even just 30 minutes a day. It compounds.
> 4. Become a lifelong learner (best tip).
> 5. Working from 7am to 7pm isn’t productivity. It’s guilt.
> 6. To be really successful become useful.
> 7. Like houses in need of repair, problems usually don’t fix themselves.
> 8. Envy is like drinking poison expecting the other person to die.
> 9. Don’t hold onto your “great idea” until it’s too late.
> 10. People aren’t thinking about you as much as you think. 
> 11. Being grateful is a cheat sheet for happiness. (Especially today.)
> 12. Write your life plan with a pencil that has an eraser. 
> 13. Choose your own path or someone will choose it for you.
> 14. Never say, I’ll never…
> 15. Not all advice is created equal.
> 16. Be the first one to smile.
> 17. The expense of something special is forgotten quickly. The experience lasts a lifetime. Do it.
> 18. Don’t say something to yourself that you wouldn’t say to someone else. 
> 19. It’s not how much money you make. It’s how much you take home.
> 20. Feeling good is better than that “third” slice of pizza.
> 21. Who you become is more important than what you accomplish. 
> 22. Nobody gets to their death bed and says, I’m sorry for trying so many things.
> 23. There are always going to be obstacles in your life. Especially if you go after big things.
> 24. The emptiest head rattles the loudest.
> 25. If you don’t let some things go, they eat you alive.
> 26. Try to spend 12 minutes a day in quiet reflection, meditation, or prayer.
> 27. Try new things. If it doesn’t work out, stop. At least you tried.
> 28. NEVER criticize, blame, or complain.  
> 29. You can’t control everything. Focus on what you can control.
> 30. If you think you have it tough, look around.
> 31. It's only over when you say it is.
> 32. One hand washes the other and together they get clean. Help someone else.
> 
> If you're lucky enough to get up to my age, the view becomes more clear. It may seem like nothing good is happening to you, or just the opposite. Both will probably change over time. 
> 
> I'm still working (fractionally), and posting here, because business and people are my mojo. I hope you find yours. 
> 
> Onward!

	At 47 I've learned that being kind is a bit of a super power. It's always good to make someone else feel seen and heard. 

	Happy birthday Louie! I hope it's a great one.

	* 🟨 **[no_1_knows_ur_a_dog](https://www.reddit.com/user/no_1_knows_ur_a_dog)** ⬆️ 744 _(2024-03-17 10:00:14)_

		I still remember this guy at a tiny punk show in a basement, like 20 people were there in total. I didn't really know anyone and after the show there was this circle of around 8 people hanging out after, waiting for the bands to pack up so we could chat with them. And one guy made a point of including me in the conversation, making space for me when it seemed like I was about to say something, etc. I've forgotten his name, all of the bands playing, basically everything else about that night or week or month of my life, but I remember him! I've learned how powerful it is to make someone feel seen and included and I practice doing that in social situations myself now.

			This story reminds me of one of my favorite quotes: “people will forget what you said or what you did, but they will never forget how you made them feel”. It’s so true!

			* 🟦 **[RearExitOnly](https://www.reddit.com/user/RearExitOnly)** ⬆️ 58 _(2024-03-17 12:07:32)_

				Everyone wants to feel like they have worth, and it you treat them like they do, they'll remember you.

			* 🟦 **[Reverse_Empath](https://www.reddit.com/user/Reverse_Empath)** ⬆️ 27 _(2024-03-17 17:02:17)_

				Yes. So true

			* 🟦 **[A_BetterVanishedTime](https://www.reddit.com/user/A_BetterVanishedTime)** ⬆️ 16 _(2024-03-18 02:32:20)_

		Being kind is a super power especially when someone isn’t kind back. I’m going to work on this.

		* 🟧 **[YoungerElderberry](https://www.reddit.com/user/YoungerElderberry)** ⬆️ 407 _(2024-03-17 10:03:33)_

		* 🟧 **[OnErrorResumeLies](https://www.reddit.com/user/OnErrorResumeLies)** ⬆️ 38 _(2024-03-17 10:33:19)_

			I was going to say something very similar - it's easy to be kind when everything is going your way. When you perceive that you've been wronged by someone? That's when you find out who you really are, and others find out too.

			* 🟦 **[beetlejuicemayor](https://www.reddit.com/user/beetlejuicemayor)** ⬆️ 30 _(2024-03-17 11:41:08)_

				Exactly this. I’m kind then I’ll snap after being pushed. For me I have a couple of family members who LOVE to fight with others…I’m kind until I snap…lol You can only poke the bear so many times. My new thing is someone says something off color is “ are you okay” “is that something you meant to say out loud” in a concerned way to let them know I know what’s up.

				* 🟪 **[maeryclarity](https://www.reddit.com/user/maeryclarity)** ⬆️ 10 _(2024-03-17 18:12:21)_

					There are some people who mistake kindness for weakness and you can't gracious your way out of interactions with these folks. They will continue to push until you have to sigh and break out the stick.

		* 🟧 **[Colejohnley](https://www.reddit.com/user/Colejohnley)** ⬆️ 232 _(2024-03-17 10:04:52)_

			I’m not a Christian and don’t believe in the Bible in a religious sense, but it does have some really solid advice. One is something like, “heap coals of kindness upon their head”. That always stuck with me as an example of how to live in a world with shitty people. Be nice, even when they’re not. It’s not weakness. It’s power.

			* 🟦 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 35 _(2024-03-17 10:24:17)_

				Let's say you're out and about walking and minding your own business. Someone you don't know starts verbally berating you in a completely inappropriate manner and you don't know if things are going to get violent or if this person is taking their bad day out on you or what.
				
				How do you behave kindly towards them?
				
				And how do you not get riled up with them?

				* 🟪 **[Bleu_Rue](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bleu_Rue)** ⬆️ 110 _(2024-03-17 10:35:45)_

					By remembering that getting riled up only hurts yourself in the long run. Being nonreactive not only helps you keep your cool, it might actually defuse the situation. 
					
					(edit to correct a misspelling)

				* 🟪 **[drizzrizz](https://www.reddit.com/user/drizzrizz)** ⬆️ 56 _(2024-03-17 10:36:47)_

					“Seems like you are having a tough day, I’ll be going now.”

				* 🟪 **[Fail-Silent](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fail-Silent)** ⬆️ 31 _(2024-03-17 10:35:51)_

					You behave kindly by smiling, nodding your head in acknowledgement and then continue walking. It's best not to engage at all. It takes years to not feel yourself get riled up with the person, but practice helps. I was raised Christian and my mom often quoted "heap coals on their head" to me when I'd been hurt or bullied. It's a tough one to live out, but so fucking worth it. And! Karma wins out every single time. I don't believe in god, but I do believe in the power of karma.

					* 🟥 **[daft_monk](https://www.reddit.com/user/daft_monk)** ⬆️ 24 _(2024-03-17 11:49:21)_

						For anyone interested in getting paid to practice this skill, I highly recommend teaching high school.

				* 🟪 **[AggravatingBobcat574](https://www.reddit.com/user/AggravatingBobcat574)** ⬆️ 28 _(2024-03-17 10:51:18)_

					You wait for a pause and say “Are you okay. Is there something I can help you with?” This is a person having a hard time. An offer of help could defuse the whole situation. Remember, if it’s a random person, they aren’t berating YOU. They don’t even know you. They feel helpless or afraid. Think of them that way, and it’s hard to get angry at them.

				* 🟪 **[homba](https://www.reddit.com/user/homba)** ⬆️ 16 _(2024-03-17 10:36:10)_

					There is a preferred method for dealing with the threat of violence-run away. It’s better to run than hurt; hurt rather than maim; maim rather than kill. For all life is precious and none can be replaced.
					
					De-escalate as best you can

	* 🟨 **[Positive-Froyo-1732](https://www.reddit.com/user/Positive-Froyo-1732)** ⬆️ 75 _(2024-03-17 10:37:11)_

		It's taken me a long time to learn that I like people who are smart, funny, talented, capable, etc. But the people I truly respect/admire are kind. And that's what matters.

	* 🟨 **[BlackPhoenix1981](https://www.reddit.com/user/BlackPhoenix1981)** ⬆️ 80 _(2024-03-17 10:32:08)_

		I'm 43 and I've noticed that common sense is no longer common. I think that's my biggest takeaway from the last 43 on years on Earth.

		* 🟧 **[Holiday-Living-3938](https://www.reddit.com/user/Holiday-Living-3938)** ⬆️ 18 _(2024-03-17 11:02:16)_

			Sad but true… critical thinking is another trait /skill in short supply I’m afraid.

	* 🟨 **[Aggleclack](https://www.reddit.com/user/Aggleclack)** ⬆️ 41 _(2024-03-17 10:35:51)_

		Nice =/= kind. Kindness is imperative. Niceness is meaningless and temporary.

		* 🟧 **[RegularDegularWoman](https://www.reddit.com/user/RegularDegularWoman)** ⬆️ 48 _(2024-03-17 22:11:36)_

			My father who died in Jan told me that niceness is a social contract, while kindness is a spiritual contract. I don’t know where he got that from but I miss his brilliance so abundantly.

			* 🟦 **[ArcticWolf81](https://www.reddit.com/user/ArcticWolf81)** ⬆️ 6 _(2024-03-18 00:39:21)_

				Sounds like a pretty great man! I’m sorry for your loss ❤️

	* 🟨 **[hallelujasuzanne](https://www.reddit.com/user/hallelujasuzanne)** ⬆️ 15 _(2024-03-17 09:24:43)_

		And makes them react with kindness in response, too. It’s the only way I’ve ever found to manage uncomfortable social interactions. And yep, listening is the biggest part of that. 

	* 🟨 **[weedemnreap](https://www.reddit.com/user/weedemnreap)** ⬆️ 22 _(2024-03-17 10:19:54)_

		I would edit #1 from "nice" to "kind" as you state. Nice is fake kindness and usually used as a "social mask" whereas kind is pouring good or into someone/the world.

* 🟩 **[furcryingoutloud](https://www.reddit.com/user/furcryingoutloud)** ⬆️ 2k _(2024-03-17 09:18:32)_

	I'm 60. And I would only add two things to this list.

	1- Learn to control your expectations. Misplaced expectations cause more problems than people think.

	2- Learn to control your emotions. If you don't, someone else always will.

	Thank you Lou. Your effort on this list is a thing of beauty.

	* 🟨 **[VestEmpty](https://www.reddit.com/user/VestEmpty)** ⬆️ 514 _(2024-03-17 10:43:52)_

		And to add, controlling your emotions does not mean hiding them deep inside.

		* 🟧 **[its_all_one_electron](https://www.reddit.com/user/its_all_one_electron)** ⬆️ 151 _(2024-03-17 12:55:50)_

			For anyone reading this, writing is a great way to "control" your emotions, though I don't like this word. "De-escalate" or "take the sting out of them" perhaps.
			
			
			
			Take the situation you're in and write about it. Make a story about it. Try different outcomes. Take your characters and put them through the same shit you are going through, or worse. See what they are made of.
			
			
			It's the most therapeutic thing I've done I've my life (besides medication).

			* 🟦 **[saladet](https://www.reddit.com/user/saladet)** ⬆️ 48 _(2024-03-17 13:05:21)_

				I sometimes try to draft reddit posts about my emotional triggers (ex my family). Then after writing it out I realize, yeah, I'm the asshole or yeah, this is just not really the big deal I'm making it. None of it gets posted . Very therapeutic !

		* 🟧 **[DaughterEarth](https://www.reddit.com/user/DaughterEarth)** ⬆️ 80 _(2024-03-17 12:01:09)_

			I have the opposite problem, I live in my feelings, so I had to learn how to stay in control. But my therapist explained that people opposite to me need to do what I'm doing naturally. We have to trade skills! 
			
			So I have a period of time each day I'm allowed to feel everything, especially grief but works for all emotions, then I pack it up until tomorrow. Packing up is hard for me. Other people are always packed up and they need time every day too, but they use it to make themselves think about how things affected them. 
			
			There are many free cognitive behavior guides to help learn how to identify and connect with your feelings, then use them rationally

			* 🟦 **[linsilou](https://www.reddit.com/user/linsilou)** ⬆️ 10 _(2024-03-17 14:54:02)_

				I'm the same way, living in my feelings. So was my dad, but he was better at controlling it. I say "controlling", but really he just learned to mask them well. Almost everyone else in our immediate family is the opposite, and the ones who aren't have conditioned themselves to act aloof for fear of being seen as weak. I was/am consistently told to "get over it" "don't dwell" etc by everyone except my dad. Sometimes it felt like me &amp; him against the world. Ever since he died, I've felt incredibly alone in this family &amp; world at-large. I've tried to work on a healthy way to even it out, but it feels like I'd be fundamentally changing who I am.

		* 🟧 **[Amazoncharli](https://www.reddit.com/user/Amazoncharli)** ⬆️ 32 _(2024-03-17 18:12:55)_

			Feelings are important but they’re not good decision makers.

	* 🟨 **[turboflake](https://www.reddit.com/user/turboflake)** ⬆️ 91 _(2024-03-17 11:32:07)_

		* 🟧 **[furcryingoutloud](https://www.reddit.com/user/furcryingoutloud)** ⬆️ 30 _(2024-03-17 10:06:51)_

			There is definitely a lot to unpack. Most people spend their whole lives reacting to circumstances or other people's words. Never knowing that their reaction is completely up to them. You own your emotions, why would you let anyone dictate how you will react?

	* 🟨 **[iWriteYourMusic](https://www.reddit.com/user/iWriteYourMusic)** ⬆️ 14 _(2024-03-17 11:33:48)_

		I prefer Ram Dass’s quote, “The quieter you become, the more you can hear.”
		
		Which is a bit different than Louie’s quote — as it promotes quieting of the mind over intellectualism. It’s amazing how many intellectually intelligent people lack the emotional intelligence to quiet the mind. Which is a superpower in my book.

			Bless you, brother. What you say hits home. I'm 53 and have found myself haunted by all the regrets. Every day a new one would form, based on the years-asyou say- where life has taken me. I finally realized that I must stop dwelling on the past. Literally telling myself to stop. Stop the dwelling. Now when those thoughts try to creep in, I consciously choose to stop lingering and I move forward and let go. I feel like I've escaped a trap. And looking forward while being present in the now gives me so much joy. All the best to you.

				They say that living in the past is depression. Living in the future is anxiety. Living in the present is peace. I hope to attain peace one day. I have a beautiful wife, a nice house, a good job, I make a comfortable living, even in these times. I have nothing to be ashamed of, nothing to be afraid of. But here I am. Could I have had a better job, A beautifuler wife, nicer house? Or would I have completely fucked everything up? I try to live by "I'm a leaf on the wind" mentality, I go where I feel life is taking me. I've changed jobs 4 times since COVID started, but I've gotten a pay raise each time and now make probably 30k more than I did when it started. The breeze has been very good to me. BUT? Does my wife love me? Do my kids hate me? Do my coworkers ignore me? Invasive thoughts are a bitch.

					You're succeeding by every worldly measure, even still self-doubt prevails? I too struggle with self confidence. Robbed from me at an early age I face it daily and wish to regain it. You said something important that I needed to hear, and now I want to repeat it to you: I resonate with being a leaf in the wind. It does not make me impervious. Rather it is the realization, now, that as a leaf I came from something more. Something like a tree, whose being is deeply rooted into the earth. A tree that has grown strong with branches long and wide. A tree bearing fruit which implies wholeness. A tree that can afford to shake off its leaves yet still remain, strong, vital, and abundant.
					
					This imagery makes sense to me and thank you for your words.

She suggested that those activities were also a form of meditation/mindfulness, which I hadn't considered before. But she's right. If what you're doing works, you're not doing it wrong.

	I like 24.. The loudest individuals can be some of the stupidest.

	My tip is that politics is extremely important. It effects every aspect of our lives and people treat it like an inconvenience. The more politically literate you are, the less likely you are to fall for the lies and talking points these politicians commonly use. People have more power in their local government than on the federal scale, so involving yourself in this stuff can make a difference. You'd be surprised how much a change you can make on the local scale if you and your friends involve yourself correctly. It just takes some knowledge on how and what that is. You might not succeed, but if you don't try, you will never know.

	28 and 30 are wrong though. If you never complain, nothing ever changes.. You need to acknowledge the problem to solve it. Just because others have it worse, doesn't mean your struggles are invalid.

			I would argue even that isn't perfect.
			
			Sometimes, people just need to get it out there. Complaining can be therapeutic and help you to let go of something you've been hanging on to that's eating you up. Sometimes there isn't a solution, it's something that happened, you need to piss on it for a bit. Someone hit your car, a loved one died, you got fired from a project you were passionate about, your favorite TV show got cancelled, there are ways to move on from all of these, but none of them have a real solution. You can't unmake them, you can't go back to before they happened. But sometimes, you need to cry about it without trying to say, "Here's how to make it better." The crying does make it better.
			
			The problem comes when that's **all** you're doing. If you're complaining and complaining and complaining endlessly about things you *can* change without ever putting thought into fixing them, if you're given possible solutions and ignore them, then it becomes a problem. But there are plenty of cases where it's fine to just be upset for a moment when it's not going to hurt anyone (I mean, don't yell at the water but it's fine to say you had a bad time on the ride home sort of thing) so long as you don't fall into doing that for everything or even just the most important things.
			
			And sometimes, you don't know how to make things better. There are plenty of problems that most of us aren't qualified to fix. Sometimes complaining can be seeking advice as well. You may not have the solution, but maybe someone else does. And it's a way or asking for that help.

		If you look at some of the greatest leaders or most inspirational speeches their approach was not to attack but to show a different way. MLK’s I have a dream speech was so powerful because he articulated a way in which the world could be made better. 
		
		JFK’s most inspiring and famous speech encouraged Americans to make sure that they were individually contributing. 
		
		When you criticize, blame or complain you are solely focusing on the problem. That’s not how you generate solutions and that’s not how you influence anyone. At times it may be cathartic but it can also just create a victim mentality and anger. Avoiding this allows you to focus on the solutions which engender positive change.

	Re: #8, envy: I really needed to hear this today. I went to a friend’s house yesterday for dinner and came home feeling dejected by how lovely her home is compared to mine, even though I love my apartment and am doing it alone while she has a partner. But the envy does me no good. I’m happy for her and I need to be happy for me as well. I have a good home and I need to remember to be grateful for it because someone will always have something “nicer” or “better” and that’s okay.

	All good ways to go by- 28yo gal here. 

	The only one I disagree with, at least partially, is 30; yes, people very much can and do have it harder than you, but that doesn't mean you aren't having a tough time.

	I spent a year out of work, not doing much. A lot of the people on the outside looking in might think I was lazy, day in day out... meanwhile I'd been applying to work, no callbacks, so deeply entrenched in depression that I went to bed 4+ hours early often because I didn't want to be awake. Days and days feeling exhausted. None of my godawful amount of hobbies were interesting anymore. The suicidal thoughts from the job I was fired from (I loved the job, coworker got me fired) never went away. I also don't have friends to spend time with; the only one actually near me has a baby and the rest are in Houston. (I'm in Pennsylvania)

	Yeah, there are folks that have it harder than me- yet, I spent a year thinking dying was a better alternative- and it was invisible to almost everyone in my life. That's a very hard fight. Don't downplay your own pain, it doesn't do you any good to not take it seriously. Dig in your heels, by all means, but don't ignore it. Having thick skin can become suffocating. 

	Don't downplay others by saying you or others have it worse either- even if it's true. Helping is the answer. You can't know what's going on in someone else's head, they live and think and feel just like you do. Don't compare yourself to someone else because you aren't them. 

	Thankfully, tomorrow I go in for training at a new job.

	I once had a neighbor that fought with his wife all the time. The wife was NUTS. We saw them fight in the street and I watched her throw her sons PlayStation to the pavement breaking it in front of him as punishment. My son and I used to play basketball in the driveway and when this kid was outside, he would ask if he could play. He was about 5 years younger than my son at the time so maybe 8-9 years old. 

	Wife and I were in a local bar a year ago (My son is in his late twenties now), and were approached by a muscled young man we didn't know. He said he name and literally thanked us for letting him play ball with us. He said it made his childhood so much brighter than it was otherwise. He also said his Mom is still nuts which was an unnecessary bonus for us. 

	Choose kindness and inclusivity. The kid sucked at basketball but we always let him play with us. A lesson for me and my son to be sure. I nearly cried when he thanked us. I think of him often and how he taught me all these years later that you truly don't know the effect your kindness may have on someone who needs it.

	I'm 21. Here's my thoughts on yours, and some additions at the end.

	1. Sometimes it's kinder to speak the truth than to be nice and lie.

	2. I'd say worthwhile things may take effort, but you shouldn't judge a thing's worth by the ease of getting it. Sometimes you get lucky, or have skills that make something easy for you. I've seen people slaving away to this notion, when they could stop for a moment and simply look at their problem for a second, and the solution becomes crystal clear. The virtue of hard work can't be denied, but humans are innovative, we figure things out and make it easy.

	3. Agreed wholeheartedly.

	4. Also agreed, if the message was about being curious.

	5. You can work on something for a long time for many reasons. It can also be love. Some fathers work that long because they love their kids and want to provide security, others work as long because they are passionate.

	6. Being useful to become successful sounds correct, but not right. I'd rather be capable, not useful. I imagine people who try to be useful lick boots more often.

	7. Yessir, agreed. To add to that, inaction is also an action. Stop overthinking, take action. If you can't bring yourself to do it, make the actions smaller till it's no longer impossible.

	8. Sort of agree. Humans wouldn't have evolved envy if it wasn't aiding in survival. It's a tool in your arsenal, understand it and use it for good, rather than run from it.

	9. Yes. Similarly, don't hold onto anything unless you know it'll be there forever, like savings. My mentor held onto the dregs of a research grant for too long, saving it for later, and it became void after a few years. Of course, don't apply this to things like relationships!

	10. Agreed. People who spend a lot of time thinking about themselves are the unhappiest lot.

	11. Agreed. Goes very well with being kind without expecting others to be grateful.

	12. Good advice. In fact, probably don't write down the most important things. Expressing an idea takes its potency away.

	13. Ties in with the action-inaction tip. Good idea, louie.

	14. Good advice, but not for someone with shaky boundaries.

	15. I don't understand this one.

	16. This one's really good, actually. I'm usually someone who only smiles back, if at all. Thanks, Louie :)

	17. Agreed.

	18. People shout slurs in traffic, so maybe not quite. I like the idea though. Don't treat yourself in a way you wouldn't treat a close family member. 

	19. Fair enough, does sound like reasonably good advice.

	20. Not sure about what the idea is here.

	21. I would agree if I was 72, but I don't know man. Applying for jobs is all resume and cover letter. They use machines to sort them, not even a human. There's no room for who you are. Dating is all about what you have. Are you 6', rich, good looking or not.

	22. I believe that.

	23. Agreed.

	24. Agreed. I would say that someone who is an expert would also speak about their expertise, but those rare people are easy to spot.

	25. Agreed. I would extend that to include things that you've let go for too long, or are too scared to face.

	26. This is excellent advice, especially these days. Technology makes it harder to keep your mind still for even a second. Meditation is extremely underrated.

	27. Fair enough, I'd agree 

	28. I personally don't buy into this. It's what they teach us as men so that we don't go against the wishes of an overlord. Speak your mind, if it doesn't cause harm.

	29. Agreed. Practical advice for all ages.

	30. This is a comparison, which I don't agree with. Probably better to look within yourself and get a perspective on your position in life. If you're in a tough spot, admit it. Climbing out of the hole might become easier then.

	31. Agreed. Wisdom is when to say it's over.

	32. Agreed!

	Additions:

	33. "Don't do what you can't undo, until you've considered what you can't do once you've done it." -King Shrewd, a fictional character

	34. Sometimes the grass is only greener on the other side because you forgot to water your lawn.

	35. Rudeness is a weak person's imitation of strength.

	36. Closed mouths don't get fed.

	37. Impress yourself before impressing others.

	38. Can't put old heads on young shoulders.

	39. "If you want the game, you must stalk it, that is all. You cannot say, "to stalk this takes too long, I wish to simply eat." It is all one. The stalking is the beginning of the eating." -Nighteyes, a fictional wolf

	40. If there is a problem, there already exists a solution. You simply need to look for it.

	41. Spend your life loving, not seeking love.

	42. Forget about the future, who are you going to be today?

	43. Learning can only begin when you're able to admit your ignorance.

	Honestly this made me cry a little. I've been struggling greatly and I am trying so hard to do right. For myself the girl I love but all of its building up and I won't lie I've sat on the suicide hotline quite a few nights so far this year. I'm trying to do good for the ones I love especially the one I've found. She is absolutely stunning and found her way into my heart. I'm just not sure if she feels the same. I don't want to ruin how I look to her with my depressed suicidal thoughts. She's been the whole reason I've been fighting to make something for myself the past year I'm sure if she hadn't come around I probably would be long gone. I guess most of this is due to my own feelings and insecurities when I don't hear from her for a day. It's done turned into my life revolving around her id do anything to make her happy. Idk why I'm saying all this guess I'm just in my feelings and seeing such a wholesome post just made me break down. I di hope I can make it to 72 but I didn't even think I'd make it to 24. Here's to hoping everything works out!

		I didn’t wasn’t sure I was going to find the love of my life. I thought it was too late. But at 35 I did. We have been happily married for almost 25 years and have two wonderful children. 
		
		So don’t give up. Keep moving forward. Keep thinking positive thoughts. Push the negative ones out of your mind. The road of your life will have many ups and downs but they are all experiences which is what life is all about.
