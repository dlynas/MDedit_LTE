![](kanafani_talk_about_what.mp4)
Original post: [https://v.redd.it/fiid4e7b5bsc1](https://v.redd.it/fiid4e7b5bsc1)

> Hear Palestinian revolutionary, Ghassan Kanafani, school a western reporter on the Palestinian liberation struggle , saying talks with Israel are a "conversation between the sword and the neck".
> 
> Kanfani was a prolific writer and leading member of the revolutionary resistance group the Palestinian Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). 52 years ago, he and his 17-year-old niece were assassinated in a car bombing by the Israeli Mossad in Beirut.
> 
> As Israel continues its bloody campaign of ethnic cleansing, occupation and apartheid, Kanafani's words in this 1970 interview with Australian Middle East correspondent Richard Carleton, continue to resonate.

			the interviewer pretty much represents a lot of those so called "neutral/only for peace" idiots.

	The razor sharp responses. Goodness! 🔥

	I’m ashamed to admit I’d not heard of Kanafani! Need to read some of his work…immediately.

	Thanks for sharing OP!!!

	I think the worst thing about it is that he talked about “Palastenian people thrown in the camps, living in starvation, killed for 20 years,” 

	and now, unfortunately, we have reached the 75th year, and the situation is getting worse.

	Free Palestine!!

	Notice that the IDF assassinated Kanafani  (car bomb, and they admitted responsibility) despite that he wasn't a combatant.  Which is illegal, but hey.

	The interviewer's seriously saying that stopping death is better than liberation? As if the ideal of "live free or die" doesn't exist in the West... (State motto of New Hampshire, by the way). What a moron

	RIP Ghassan Kanafani! what a hero!

	My God, this actually makes me so sad. Because I feel in some ways, we’ve gone backwards. Now no one is even asking Hamas why they’re fighting. They’re merely labeled terrorists and told to give the hostages back to make it stop. In other ways however, I suppose some progress has been made as more and more people become aware of what has been happening for the past 75 years. They could not have been clearer about why, and yet no one listened ever.

	He was assassinated by Mossad car bomb 2yrs later.

	Along with his 17yr old niece.

	The interviewer was just dumb.  He wasn't even following.
