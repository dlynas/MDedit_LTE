## While I wouldn’t call our relationship “toxic”, I deeply resonate with this. 

I have moments when I become aware of how much my relationship with my soon-to-be ex-husband fucked me up. Especially as I try to show up to healthy relationships with others. And this is not an indictment on who he is because I know he’s having those same moments about me. The shit is just mind-blowing to me because I believe we genuinely loved each other, genuinely tried to care for each other to the best of our ability, and had a good marriage for the most part. And yet, this other thing is still true. Wild shit.
