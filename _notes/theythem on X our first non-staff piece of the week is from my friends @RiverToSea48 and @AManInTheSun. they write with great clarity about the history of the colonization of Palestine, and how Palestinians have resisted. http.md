## Conversation

.

launched our Abolition Week today, themed “The Bars We Can’t See.” we received so many submissions that we had to extend abo week by an extra week. this week & next, we’ll be publishing EXCLUSIVELY from (formerly) incarcerated writers, including Palestinian writers!

to start, our editors (

, @trapteas,

, and myself) wrote an introduction to the week. to ground the reader in an understanding and an abolitionist politic that clarifies exactly how widespread and pervasive carcerality is. [scalawagmagazine.org/2023/06/abolit](https://t.co/ArB61IkQf5)

Carcerality is oft believed to look only like the bars that cage, or the cells that enclose; it's thought to be impossible to disentangle from the barbed wire intended to disrupt attempts at freedom. But what if carcerality is more than the iron?

Afro-Palestinians and Africans in Occupied Palestine teach us that there is no nation in the world wherein antiblack violence is not present, and as such, carcerality cannot be confined to or solely defined by a border, walls, or locked doors. [scalawagmagazine.org/2023/06/abolit](https://t.co/ArB61IkQf5)

In a world wherein police, surveillance, and imperialism are commonplace, Gaza and black presence teach us that the air is no more an escape from carceral techniques and practices than a home long sought-after. [scalawagmagazine.org/2023/06/abolit](https://t.co/ArB61IkQf5)

As such, the abolitionist understands carcerality and the prison as world-making, world-defining, and death-dealing designs. Carcerality is/as antiblackness: an imprisoning force that functions on both a global and metaphysical terrain.

It is our hope that by putting Palestinians from the Gaza Strip or the West Bank in conversation with people locked behind North American prison bars, our audience will connect the ways these violences—and the domestic and Global South—are indivisible from one another.

our first non-staff piece of the week is from my friends

and

. they write with great clarity about the history of the colonization of Palestine, and how Palestinians have resisted.



In the 1936-39 revolts, over 19,000 Palestinians were wounded or killed. This amounts to 1mil Americans killed, 3mil wounded, and over 6mil arrested. This scale of loss turned Palestine into an open-air prison.

i’m excited to welcome y’all to

’s Abolition Week 2023. this week and next, follow closely as incarcerated and formerly incarcerated writers from the US South to Palestine expand Abolitionist discourse to reveal the bars we can’t see. 

Thank you Da’Shaun for inviting us to be a part of this and for all the work you do, we’re excited to follow along over the next couple of weeks!

y’all’s piece is INCREDIBLE! i’m so so so thankful for y’all!!
