1.  I got this weird feeling you can grow a macro environment from micro initial conditions using a cellular automata model.
    
    If there are any econohackers out there with CA experience, I'd like to hear your input.

    If you're thinking of utilizing elementary CAs: it will depend on what particular set of CA rules that you populate your initial rule space with. If you can suffer through it, read some of Wolfram's work. Just make you sure you disregard the bits where he claims to have invented an entirely new science.

    In other words, OP wants to avoid all the parts of the problem that make it an economics problem rather than a physics problem with unthinking particles. f\*\*k off, destined-to-be-ULRM undergread.

    Don't I wish. I'm published and believe you me, ignorance is bliss.

    The devil is in the details; or in the case of CA, the initial rules.

    There's a whole book you can read: Handbook of Computational Economics, Vol. 2.  
    First chapter will get you excited. Then you see there's not much in the other chapters. And finally, if you think too hard about it, you'll realize it's not that different than what you usually do in any economic model, except that you make much more arbitrary choices and/or make your agents be very, very dumb.  
    The parts on trading rules/noise traders were interesting to me, but probably because I don't know much about finance.

    The inherent trade-off I'm curious about overcoming is aggregating idiosyncratic agents versus computational power required to do so: how dumb and how few do the agents need to be to get an equilibrium in a reasonable amount of time, polynomial time maybe?

    If you're thinking equilibrium, you didn't get the idea. The idea is to simulate and observe the behavior. There is no equilibrium. What you can do is simulate many times, under different conditions, and detect emergent patterns. But there's no recipe.
    
    I actually bought another book called "Generative Social Science" to see examples. It is VERY lame if you compare with standard economic modelling.

    But what about growing a macroeconomic environment by aggregating thousands or more microeconomic equilibria (initial rules) in a CA setting? Maybe it would be a constantly shifting point, but wouldn't the resulting macro world be a macro "equilibrium?"

    If you're really interested in that, I think you'll learn more reading the handbook. You can find chapters on the web with no paywalls if you try.
    
    In any case, I also got the impression (as others have) that you lack the required foundations to evaluate new ideas and do groundbreaking contributions yet. I would recommend learning more about traditional stuff -- advanced micro and macro -- before delving into CA, especially if you're an undergrad and want to get to a PhD program.
    
    Also you should play Darwin Pond.

    There is something on this by Albin and Foley, MSS, I think.
