## This is exactly why unions are so important. The explicit greed and disregard for workers by these @applebees franchise executives is disgusting.

LEAKED EMAIL: Applebee’s franchise exec says that rising gas prices are great for business because the chain can offer workers lower wages.

The CEO of Dine Brands, which owns Applebee’s, took home an estimated $6.7 million in 2021. This is 1000 times the median compensation of what workers at the chain receive. Dine Brands is part of the National Restaurant Association, which lobbied heavily against a minimum wage.

According to One Fair Wage, the National Restaurant Association contributed $125,000 to lawmakers who opposed the Raise The Wage Act.
