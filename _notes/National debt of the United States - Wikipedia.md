The **national debt of the United States** is the total [national debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt "Government debt") owed by the [federal government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States "Federal government of the United States") of the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") to [Treasury security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security "United States Treasury security") holders. The national debt at any point in time is the [face value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_value "Face value") of the then-outstanding Treasury securities that have been issued by the [Treasury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury "United States Department of the Treasury") and other [federal agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_agencies_in_the_United_States "List of federal agencies in the United States"). The terms "national deficit" and "national surplus" usually refer to the federal [government budget balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_balance "Government budget balance") from year to year, not the cumulative amount of [debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt "Debt"). In a deficit year the national debt increases as the government needs to borrow funds to [finance the deficit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deficit_spending "Deficit spending"), while in a surplus year the debt decreases as more money is received than spent, enabling the government to [reduce the debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deficit_reduction_in_the_United_States "Deficit reduction in the United States") by buying back some Treasury securities. In general, government debt increases as a result of [government spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending_in_the_United_States "Government spending in the United States") and decreases from [tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States "Taxation in the United States") or other receipts, both of which fluctuate during the course of a [fiscal year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year "Fiscal year").<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> There are two components of gross national debt:<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>

-   "Debt held by the public" – such as Treasury securities held by investors outside the federal government, including those held by individuals, [corporations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation "Corporation"), the [Federal Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve "Federal Reserve"), and foreign, [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_the_United_States "State governments of the United States") and [local governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_the_United_States "Local government in the United States").
-   "Debt held by government accounts" or "[intragovernmental debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intragovernmental_debt "Intragovernmental debt")" – is non-marketable Treasury securities held in accounts of programs administered by the federal government, such as the [Social Security Trust Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Trust_Fund "Social Security Trust Fund"). Debt held by government accounts represents the cumulative surpluses, including interest earnings, of various government programs that have been invested in Treasury securities.

The amount of U.S. public debt, measured as a percentage of GDP, held by the public since 1900

Historically, the U.S. public debt as a share of [gross domestic product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product "Gross domestic product") (GDP) increases during wars and [recessions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession "Recession") and then subsequently declines. The [ratio of debt to GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-GDP_ratio "Debt-to-GDP ratio") may decrease as a result of a government surplus or via [growth of GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth "Economic growth") and [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation "Inflation"). The [Congressional Budget Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office "Congressional Budget Office") (CBO) estimated in February 2024 that Federal debt held by the public is projected to rise from 99 percent of GDP in 2024 to 116 percent in 2034, and would continue to grow if current laws generally remained unchanged. Over that period, the growth of interest costs and mandatory spending outpaces the growth of revenues and the economy, driving up debt. Those factors persist beyond 2034, pushing federal debt higher still, to 172 percent of GDP in 2054.<sup id="cite_ref-CBO_budgetOutlook2024_3-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-CBO_budgetOutlook2024-3">[3]</a></sup> In recent decades, aging [demographics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States "Demographics of the United States") and rising [healthcare costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_prices_in_the_United_States "Health care prices in the United States") have led to concern about the long-term sustainability of the federal government's [fiscal policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy_of_the_United_States "Fiscal policy of the United States").<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> The aggregate, gross amount that Treasury can borrow is limited by the [United States debt ceiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt_ceiling "United States debt ceiling").<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

## History\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_debt_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")\]

The [United States federal government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government "United States federal government") has continuously had a fluctuating [public debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt "Government debt") since its formation in 1789, except for about a year during 1835–1836, a period in which the nation, during the presidency of [Andrew Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson "Andrew Jackson"), completely paid the national debt. To allow comparisons over the years, public debt is often expressed as a ratio to [GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP "GDP"). The United States public debt as a percentage of GDP reached its highest level during [Harry Truman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman "Harry S. Truman")'s first presidential term, during and after [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"). Public debt as a percentage of GDP fell rapidly in the [post-World War II period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post%E2%80%93World_War_II_economic_expansion "Post–World War II economic expansion") and reached a low in 1974 under [Richard Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon "Richard Nixon"). Debt as a share of GDP has consistently increased since then, except during the presidencies of [Jimmy Carter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter "Jimmy Carter") and [Bill Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton "Bill Clinton").

Public debt rose sharply during the 1980s, as [Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan "Ronald Reagan") negotiated with [Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress") to cut tax rates and increase [military spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_United_States "Military budget of the United States"). It fell during the 1990s because of decreased military spending, increased taxes and the [1990s boom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s_United_States_boom "1990s United States boom"). Public debt rose sharply during [George W. Bush's presidency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_George_W._Bush "Presidency of George W. Bush") and in the wake of the [2007–2008 financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008 "Financial crisis of 2007–2008"), with resulting significant tax revenue declines and spending increases, such as the [Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008 "Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008") and the [American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009 "American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009").<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

As of July 20, 2020, debt held by the public was $20.57 trillion, and [intragovernmental holdings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intragovernmental_holdings "Intragovernmental holdings") were $5.94 trillion, for a total of $26.51 trillion.<sup id="cite_ref-treasurydirect.gov_19-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-treasurydirect.gov-19">[19]</a></sup> Debt held by the public was approximately 77% of GDP in 2017, ranked 43rd highest out of 207 countries.<sup id="cite_ref-cia.gov_20-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-cia.gov-20">[20]</a></sup> The CBO forecast in April 2018 that the ratio will rise to nearly 100% by 2028, perhaps higher if current policies are extended beyond their scheduled expiration date.<sup id="cite_ref-CBO_BOE2018_21-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-CBO_BOE2018-21">[21]</a></sup>

The national debt can also be classified into marketable or non-marketable securities.

Under normal accounting rules, fully owned companies would be consolidated into the books of their owners, but the large size of [Fannie Mae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fannie_Mae "Fannie Mae") and [Freddie Mac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mac "Freddie Mac") has made the U.S. government reluctant to incorporate them into its own books. When the two mortgage companies required bail-outs, White House Budget Director Jim Nussle, on September 12, 2008, initially indicated their budget plans would not incorporate the [government-sponsored enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government-sponsored_enterprise "Government-sponsored enterprise") (GSE) debt into the budget because of the temporary nature of the conservator intervention.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> As the intervention has dragged out, pundits began to question this accounting treatment, noting that changes in August 2012 "makes them even more permanent wards of the state and turns the government's preferred stock into a permanent, perpetual kind of security".<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>

The federal government controls the [Public Company Accounting Oversight Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Company_Accounting_Oversight_Board "Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"), which would normally criticize inconsistent accounting practices, but it does not oversee its own government's accounting practices or the standards set by the [Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Accounting_Standards_Advisory_Board "Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board"). The on- or off-[balance sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet "Balance sheet") obligations of those two independent GSEs was just over $5 trillion at the time the conservatorship was put in place, consisting mainly of mortgage payment guarantees and [agency bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_debt "Agency debt").<sup id="cite_ref-agencies_28-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-agencies-28">[28]</a></sup> The confusing _independent but government-controlled_ status of the GSEs resulted in investors of the legacy common shares and preferred shares launching various activist campaigns in 2014.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>

### Guaranteed obligations excluded\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_debt_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Guaranteed obligations excluded")\]

U.S. federal government guarantees were not included in the public debt total as they were not drawn against.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="The text near this tag may need clarification or removal of jargon.

The guarantee program lapsed at the end of 2012, when Congress declined to extend the scheme. The funding of direct investments made in response to the crisis, such as those made under the [Troubled Asset Relief Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubled_Asset_Relief_Program "Troubled Asset Relief Program"), was included in the debt totals.

A timeline showing projected debt milestones from the CBO

The U.S. federal government is obligated under current law to make mandatory payments for programs such as [Medicare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States) "Medicare (United States)"), [Medicaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid "Medicaid") and Social Security. The [Government Accountability Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Accountability_Office "Government Accountability Office") (GAO) projects that payouts for these programs will significantly exceed tax revenues over the next 75 years. The Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) payouts already exceed program tax revenues, and social security payouts exceeded payroll taxes in fiscal year 2010. These deficits require funding from other tax sources or borrowing.<sup id="cite_ref-GAOCitiz_30-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-GAOCitiz-30">[30]</a></sup> The present value of these deficits or unfunded obligations is an estimated $45.8 trillion. This is the amount that would have had to be set aside in 2009 in order to pay for the unfunded obligations which, under current law, will have to be raised by the government in the future. Approximately $7.7 trillion relates to Social Security, while $38.2 trillion relates to Medicare and Medicaid. In other words, health care programs will require nearly five times more funding than Social Security. Adding this to the national debt and other federal obligations would bring total obligations to nearly $62 trillion.<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> However, these unfunded obligations are not counted in the national debt, as shown in monthly Treasury reports of the national debt.<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup>

### Measuring debt burden\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_debt_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Measuring debt burden")\]

[![Public debt percent of GDP. Federal, State, and Local debt and a percentage of GDP chart/graph](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Public_debt_percent_of_GDP.pdf/page1-500px-Public_debt_percent_of_GDP.pdf.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Public_debt_percent_of_GDP.pdf "Public debt percent of GDP. Federal, State, and Local debt and a percentage of GDP chart/graph")

GDP is a measure of the total size and output of the economy. One measure of the debt burden is its size relative to GDP, called the "[debt-to-GDP ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-GDP_ratio "Debt-to-GDP ratio")". Mathematically, this is the debt divided by the GDP amount. The Congressional Budget Office includes historical budget and debt tables along with its annual "Budget and Economic Outlook". Debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP rose from 34.7% GDP in 2000 to 40.5% in 2008 and 67.7% in 2011.<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> Mathematically, the ratio can decrease even while debt grows if the rate of increase in GDP (which also takes account of inflation) is higher than the rate of increase of debt. Conversely, the debt to GDP ratio can increase even while debt is being reduced, if the decline in GDP is sufficient.

According to the _[CIA World Factbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Factbook "The World Factbook")_, during 2015, the U.S. debt to GDP ratio of 73.6% was the 39th highest in the world. This was measured using "debt held by the public."<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> However, $1 trillion in additional borrowing since the end of FY 2015 raised the ratio to 76.2% as of April 2016 \[See Appendix#National debt for selected years\]. Also, this number excludes state and local debt. According to the OECD, general government gross debt (federal, state, and local) in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $22.5 trillion (125% of GDP); subtracting out $5.25 trillion for intragovernmental federal debt to count only federal "debt held by the public" gives 96% of GDP.<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup>

The ratio is higher if the total national debt is used, by adding the "intragovernmental debt" to the "debt held by the public." For example, on April 29, 2016, debt held by the public was approximately $13.84 trillion (~$17.2 trillion in 2023) or about 76% of GDP. Intra-governmental holdings stood at $5.35 trillion, giving a combined total public debt of $19.19 trillion. U.S. GDP for the previous 12 months was approximately $18.15 trillion, for a total debt to GDP ratio of approximately 106%.<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup>

### Calculating the annual change in debt\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_debt_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Calculating the annual change in debt")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Deficit_to_Change_in_Debt_Comparison_-_2008.png/400px-Deficit_to_Change_in_Debt_Comparison_-_2008.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Deficit_to_Change_in_Debt_Comparison_-_2008.png)

Comparison of deficits to change in debt in 2008

Conceptually, an annual deficit (or surplus) should represent the change in the national debt, with a deficit adding to the national debt and a surplus reducing it. However, there is complexity in the budgetary computations that can make the deficit figure commonly reported in the media (the "total deficit") considerably different from the annual increase in the debt. The major categories of differences are the treatment of the Social Security program, Treasury borrowing, and supplemental appropriations outside the budget process.<sup id="cite_ref-CBO_2009_37-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-CBO_2009-37">[37]</a></sup>

Social Security payroll taxes and benefit payments, along with the net balance of the [U.S. Postal Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service "United States Postal Service"), are considered "off-budget", while most other expenditure and receipt categories are considered "on-budget". The total federal deficit is the sum of the on-budget deficit (or surplus) and the off-budget deficit (or surplus). Since FY1960, the federal government has run on-budget deficits except for FY1999 and FY2000, and total federal deficits except in FY1969 and FY1998–FY2001.<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup>

For example, in January 2009 the CBO reported that for FY2008, the "on-budget deficit" was $638 billion, offset by an "off-budget surplus" (mainly due to Social Security revenue in excess of payouts) of $183 billion, for a "total deficit" of $455 billion. This latter figure is the one commonly reported in the media. However, an additional $313 billion was required for "the Treasury actions aimed at stabilizing the financial markets," an unusually high amount because of the [subprime mortgage crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis "Subprime mortgage crisis"). This meant that the "debt held by the public" increased by $768 billion ($455B + $313B = $768B). The "off-budget surplus" was borrowed and spent (as is typically the case), increasing the "intra-governmental debt" by $183 billion. So the total increase in the "national debt" in FY2008 was $768B +$183B = $951 billion.<sup id="cite_ref-CBO_2009_37-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-CBO_2009-37">[37]</a></sup> The Treasury Department reported an increase in the national debt of $1,017B for FY2008.<sup id="cite_ref-TreasuryDirect_2008_39-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-TreasuryDirect_2008-39">[39]</a></sup> The $66 billion difference is likely from "supplemental appropriations" for the [War on Terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_terror "War on terror"), some of which were outside the budget process entirely until President Obama began including most of them in his FY2010 budget.<sup id="cite_ref-Politifact_Suppl_40-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-Politifact_Suppl-40">[40]</a></sup>

In other words, spending the "off budget" Social Security surplus adds to the total national debt (by increasing the intragovernmental debt) while the "off-budget" surplus reduces the "total" deficit reported in the media. Certain spending called "supplemental appropriations" is outside the budget process entirely but adds to the national debt. Funding for the [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War "Iraq War") and [Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%93present) "War in Afghanistan (2001–present)") wars was accounted for this way prior to the Obama administration.<sup id="cite_ref-Politifact_Suppl_40-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-Politifact_Suppl-40">[40]</a></sup> Certain stimulus measures and [earmarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earmark_(politics) "Earmark (politics)") were also outside the budget process. The federal government publishes the total debt owed (public and intragovernmental holdings) daily.<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup>

Estimated ownership each year

Because a large variety of people own the notes, bills, and bonds in the "public" portion of the debt, the Treasury also publishes information that groups the types of holders by general categories to portray who owns United States debt. In this data set, some of the public portion is moved and combined with the total government portion, because this amount is owned by the Federal Reserve as part of United States monetary policy. (See [Federal Reserve System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System "Federal Reserve System").)

As is apparent from the chart, a little less than half of the total national debt is owed to the "Federal Reserve and intragovernmental holdings". The foreign and international holders of the debt are also put together from the notes, bills, and bonds sections. To the right is a chart for the data as of June 2008:

Foreign holders of Treasury Securities  
April 2021 - April 2022

As of October 2018, foreigners owned $6.2 trillion of U.S. debt, or approximately 39% of the debt held by the public of $16.1 trillion and 28% of the total debt of $21.8 trillion.<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> In December 2020, foreigners held 33% ($7 trillion out of $21.6 trillion) of publicly held US debt; of this $7 trillion, $4.1 trillion (59.2%) belonged to foreign governments and $2.8 trillion (40.8%) to foreign investors. Including both private and public debt holders, the top three December 2020 national holders of American public debt are [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan") ($1.2 trillion or 17.7%), [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China") ($1.1 trillion or 15.2%), and the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") ($0.4 trillion or 6.2%).<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup>

Historically, the share held by foreign governments had grown over time, rising from 13% of the public debt in 1988<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup> to 34% in 2015.<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> In more recent years, foreign ownership has retreated both in percent of total debt and total dollar amounts.

### CBO ten-year outlook 2018–2028 (pre–COVID-19 pandemic)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_debt_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: CBO ten-year outlook 2018–2028 (pre–COVID-19 pandemic)")\]

The CBO estimated the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and separate spending legislation over the 2018–2028 period in their annual "Budget & Economic Outlook", released in April 2018:

-   The budget deficit in fiscal 2018 (which runs from October 1, 2017, to September 30, 2018, the first year budgeted by President Trump) is forecast to be $804 billion, an increase of $139 billion (21%) from the $665 billion in 2017 and up $242 billion (39%) over the previous [baseline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(budgeting) "Baseline (budgeting)") forecast (June 2017) of $580 billion for 2018. The June 2017 forecast was essentially the budget trajectory inherited from President Obama; it was prepared prior to the Tax Act and spending increases under President Trump.
-   For the 2018–2027 period, CBO projects the sum of the annual deficits (i.e., debt increase) to be $11.7 trillion, an increase of $1.6 trillion (16%) over the previous baseline (June 2017) forecast of $10.1 trillion.
-   The $1.6 trillion debt increase includes three main elements:
    1.  $1.7 trillion less in revenues due to the tax cuts;
    2.  $1.0 trillion more in spending; and
    3.  Partially offsetting incremental revenue of $1.1 trillion due to higher economic growth than previously forecast.
-   Debt held by the public is expected (Congressional Budget Office Outlook) to rise from 78% of GDP ($16 trillion) at the end of 2018 to 96% GDP ($29 trillion) by 2028. That would be the highest level since the end of World War II.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2020)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
-   CBO estimated under an alternative scenario (in which policies in place as of April 2018 are maintained beyond scheduled initiation or expiration) that deficits would be considerably higher, rising by $13.7 trillion over the 2018–2027 period, an increase of $3.6 trillion over the June 2017 baseline forecast. Maintaining current policies for example would include extending the individual Trump tax cuts past their scheduled expiration in 2025, among other changes.
-   The debt increase of $1.6 trillion represents approximately $12,700 per household (assuming 126.2 million households in 2017), while the $3.6 trillion represents $28,500 per household.<sup id="cite_ref-CBO_BOE2018_21-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-CBO_BOE2018-21">[21]</a></sup>

The CBO estimated that the budget deficit for fiscal year 2020 would increase to $3.3 trillion or 16% GDP, more than triple that of 2019 and the largest as % GDP since 1945, because of the impact of the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States "COVID-19 pandemic in the United States"). CBO also forecast the debt held by the public would rise to 98% GDP in 2020, compared with 79% in 2019 and 35% in 2007 before the [Great Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession "Great Recession").<sup id="cite_ref-CBO_Aug2020_12-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-CBO_Aug2020-12">[12]</a></sup>

Spending for mandatory programs is projected to rise relative to GDP, while discretionary programs decline.

The CBO reports its _Long-Term Budget Outlook_ annually, providing at least two scenarios for spending, revenue, deficits, and debt. The 2019 Outlook mainly covers the 30-year period through 2049. The CBO reported:

> Large budget deficits over the next 30 years are projected to drive federal debt held by the public to unprecedented levels—from 78 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019 to 144 percent by 2049. That projection incorporates CBO's central estimates of various factors, such as productivity growth and interest rates on federal debt. CBO's analysis indicates that even if values for those factors differed from the agency's projections, debt several decades from now would probably be much higher than it is today.<sup id="cite_ref-cbo2019LTO_49-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-cbo2019LTO-49">[49]</a></sup>

Furthermore, under alternative scenarios:

> If lawmakers changed current laws to maintain certain major policies now in place—most significantly, if they prevented a cut in discretionary spending in 2020 and an increase in individual income taxes in 2026—then debt held by the public would increase even more, reaching 219 percent of GDP by 2049. By contrast, if Social Security benefits were limited to the amounts payable from revenues received by the Social Security trust funds, debt in 2049 would reach 106 percent of GDP, still well above its current level.

Over the long-term, the CBO projects that interest expense and mandatory spending categories (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security) will continue to grow relative to GDP, while discretionary categories (e.g., Defense and other Cabinet Departments) continue to fall relative to GDP. Debt is projected to continue rising relative to GDP under the above two scenarios, although the CBO did also offer other scenarios that involved austerity measures that would bring the debt to GDP ratio down.<sup id="cite_ref-cbo2019LTO_49-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-cbo2019LTO-49">[49]</a></sup>

## Ways to reduce debt\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_debt_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Ways to reduce debt")\]

### Negative real interest rates\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_debt_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Negative real interest rates")\]

Since 2010, the U.S. Treasury has been obtaining [negative real interest rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_interest_rate#Negative_real_interest_rates "Real interest rate") on government debt, meaning the inflation rate is greater than the interest rate paid on the debt.<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup> Such low rates, outpaced by the [inflation rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation "Inflation"), occur when the market believes that there are no alternatives with sufficiently low risk, or when popular institutional investments such as insurance companies, [pensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension "Pension"), or bond, money market, and balanced [mutual funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund "Mutual fund") are required or choose to invest sufficiently large sums in Treasury securities to hedge against risk.<sup id="cite_ref-liquidation_51-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-liquidation-51">[51]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> Economist [Lawrence Summers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers "Lawrence Summers") states that at such low interest rates, government borrowing actually saves taxpayer money and improves creditworthiness.<sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup>

In the late 1940s through the early 1970s, the U.S. and UK both reduced their debt burden by about 30% to 40% of GDP per decade by taking advantage of negative real interest rates, but there is no guarantee that government debt rates will continue to stay this low.<sup id="cite_ref-liquidation_51-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-liquidation-51">[51]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup> Between 1946 and 1974, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio fell from 121% to 32% even though there were surpluses in only eight of those years which were much smaller than the deficits.<sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup>

Two economists, Jaromir Benes and Michael Kumhof, working for the [International Monetary Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund"), published a working paper called _[The Chicago Plan Revisited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_plan "Chicago plan")_ suggesting that the debt could be eliminated by raising bank [reserve requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_requirement "Reserve requirement") and converting from [fractional-reserve banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking "Fractional-reserve banking") to [full-reserve banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking "Full-reserve banking").<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup> Economists at the [Paris School of Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_School_of_Economics "Paris School of Economics") have commented on the plan, stating that it is already the _status quo_ for coinage currency,<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> and a [Norges Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norges_Bank "Norges Bank") economist has examined the proposal in the context of considering the [finance industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services "Financial services") as part of the [real economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_economy "Real economy").<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup> A [Centre for Economic Policy Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_Economic_Policy_Research "Centre for Economic Policy Research") paper agrees with the conclusion that "no real liability is created by new [fiat money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money "Fiat money") creation and therefore public debt does not rise as a result."<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup>

### CBO risk factors\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_debt_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: CBO risk factors")\]

The CBO reported several types of risk factors related to rising debt levels in a July 2010 publication:

-   A growing portion of savings would go towards purchases of government debt, rather than investments in productive capital goods such as factories and computers, leading to lower output and incomes than would otherwise occur;
-   If higher marginal tax rates were used to pay rising interest costs, savings would be reduced and work would be discouraged;
-   Rising interest costs would force reductions in government programs;
-   Restrictions to the ability of policymakers to use fiscal policy to respond to economic challenges; and
-   An increased risk of a sudden fiscal crisis, in which investors demand higher interest rates.<sup id="cite_ref-Huntley,_Jonathan_2010_61-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-Huntley,_Jonathan_2010-61">[61]</a></sup>

### Credit default\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_debt_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Credit default")\]

The U.S. has never fully defaulted.<sup id="cite_ref-cnbc_62-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-cnbc-62">[62]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup> In April 1979, however, the U.S. may have technically defaulted on $122 million (~$413 million in 2023) in [Treasury bills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security "United States Treasury security"), which was less than 1% of U.S. debt.

The United States debt ceiling is a legislative constraint on the amount of national debt that can be incurred by the [U.S. Treasury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Treasury "U.S. Treasury"). It limits how much money the federal government may pay on the debt it already has by borrowing even more money. The debt ceiling applies to almost all federal debt, including accounts owned by the public and intra-government funds for [Medicare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States) "Medicare (United States)") and [Social Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States) "Social Security (United States)").<sup id="cite_ref-fpc_68-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-fpc-68">[68]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-69"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup>

In 2009 the [Government Accountability Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Accountability_Office "Government Accountability Office") (GAO) reported that the United States was on a "fiscally unsustainable" path because of projected future increases in Medicare and Social Security spending.<sup id="cite_ref-GAOCitiz_30-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-GAOCitiz-30">[30]</a></sup> According to the Treasury report in October 2018, summarized by _[Business Insider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider "Business Insider")'_s Bob Bryan, the U.S. federal budget deficit rose as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017<sup id="cite_ref-WSJ_Davidson_2018_1T_15-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-WSJ_Davidson_2018_1T-15">[15]</a></sup> signed into law by President [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump") on December 22, 2017<sup id="cite_ref-Fortune_70-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-Fortune-70">[70]</a></sup> and the [Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Appropriations_Act,_2018 "Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018") signed into law on March 23, 2018.<sup id="cite_ref-WaPo_Werner_2018_71-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-WaPo_Werner_2018-71">[71]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-businessinsider_Bryan_2018_779B_72-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-businessinsider_Bryan_2018_779B-72">[72]</a></sup>

### Risks to economic growth\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_debt_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Risks to economic growth")\]

Debt levels may affect economic growth rates. In 2010, economists [Kenneth Rogoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Rogoff "Kenneth Rogoff") and [Carmen Reinhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Reinhart "Carmen Reinhart") reported that among the 20 developed countries studied, average annual GDP growth was 3–4% when debt was relatively moderate or low (i.e., under 60% of GDP), but it dips to just 1.6% when debt was high (i.e., above 90% of GDP).<sup id="cite_ref-house.gov_73-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-house.gov-73">[73]</a></sup> In April 2013, the conclusions of Rogoff and Reinhart's study came into question when a coding error in their original paper was discovered by Herndon, Ash and Pollin of the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst "University of Massachusetts Amherst").<sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-75"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup> Herndon, Ash and Pollin found that after correcting for errors and unorthodox methods used, there was no evidence that debt above a specific threshold reduces growth.<sup id="cite_ref-76"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup> Reinhart and Rogoff maintain that after correcting for errors, a negative relationship between high debt and growth remains.<sup id="cite_ref-77"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup> However, other economists, including [Paul Krugman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krugman "Paul Krugman"), have argued that it is low growth which causes national debt to increase, rather than the other way around.<sup id="cite_ref-krugman.blogs.nytimes.com_78-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-krugman.blogs.nytimes.com-78">[78]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-79"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-80"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup>

Commenting on [fiscal sustainability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sustainability "Fiscal sustainability"), former Federal Reserve Chairman [Ben Bernanke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Bernanke "Ben Bernanke") stated in April 2010 that "Neither experience nor economic theory clearly indicates the threshold at which government debt begins to endanger prosperity and economic stability. But given the significant costs and risks associated with a rapidly rising federal debt, our nation should soon put in place a credible plan for reducing deficits to sustainable levels over time."<sup id="cite_ref-81"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup>

2023 Interest on federal debt

Interest expense on the public debt was approximately $678 billion in FY2023. During FY2023, the government also accrued a non-cash interest expense of $197 billion for intra-governmental debt, primarily the Social Security Trust Fund, for a total interest expense of $875 billion. This accrued interest is added to the Social Security Trust Fund and therefore the national debt each year and will be paid to Social Security recipients in the future. However, since it is a non-cash expense it is excluded from the budget deficit calculation.<sup id="cite_ref-GAO_2023_Report_82-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-GAO_2023_Report-82">[82]</a></sup>

The federal debt at the end of the 2018/19 fiscal year (ended September 30, 2019) was $22.7 trillion (~$27.1 trillion in 2023). The portion that is held by the public was $16.8 trillion. Neither figure includes approximately $2.5 trillion owed to the government.<sup id="cite_ref-83"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup> Interest on the debt was $404 billion.<sup id="cite_ref-84"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup>

The cost of servicing the U.S. national debt can be measured in various ways. The CBO analyzes net interest as a percentage of GDP, with a higher percentage indicating a higher interest payment burden. During 2015, this was 1.3% GDP, close to the record low 1.2% of the 1966–1968 era. The average from 1966 to 2015 was 2.0% of GDP.<sup id="cite_ref-85"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup> However, the CBO estimated in 2016 that the interest amounts and % GDP will increase significantly over the following decade as both interest rates and debt levels rise: "Interest payments on that debt represent a large and rapidly growing expense of the federal government. CBO's baseline shows net interest payments more than tripling under current law, climbing from $231 billion in 2014, or 1.3% of GDP, to $799 billion in 2024, or 3.0% of GDP—the highest ratio since 1996."<sup id="cite_ref-86"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup>

According to a study by the [Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_a_Responsible_Federal_Budget "Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget") (CRFB), the U.S. government will spend more on servicing their debts than they do for their national defense budget by 2024.<sup id="cite_ref-87"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup>

In October 2023, yields for 10-year [Treasury notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security#Treasury_note "United States Treasury security") breached 5% as traders adjusted their assessment of United States' fiscal position and lowered their expectation that Congress or the White House would take any action to improve it. The impact was felt by homebuyers, with 30-year mortgage rate at its highest in two decades, and corporations facing higher costs of borrowing. Interests paid by the federal government jumped by $184 billion during the 2022 fiscal year and are still climbing.<sup id="cite_ref-88"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-88">[88]</a></sup>

### Chinese holdings of U.S. debt\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_debt_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Chinese holdings of U.S. debt")\]

According to a 2013 [Forbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes "Forbes") article, many American and other [economic analysts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_analyst "Financial analyst") have expressed concerns on the amount of United States government debt the People's Republic of China is holding.<sup id="cite_ref-99"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-99">[99]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-cnn_100-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-cnn-100">[100]</a></sup> as part of their reserves. The [National Defense Authorization Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act "National Defense Authorization Act") of FY2012 included a provision requiring the [Secretary of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense "United States Secretary of Defense") to conduct a "national security risk assessment of U.S. federal debt held by China." The department issued its report in July 2012, stating that "attempting to use U.S. Treasury securities as a coercive tool would have limited effect and likely would do more harm to China than to the United States.” <sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Since 2018, China had been gradually decreasing its holdings of U.S. federal debt, bringing the total to $1.07 trillion in June 2020, behind Japan who became the biggest foreign creditor of the United States. Stephen Nagy, a professor at the [International Christian University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Christian_University "International Christian University"), said a sell-off by China "might damage the United States in the short term" but also cause "critical economic instability" in the Chinese and global economy. [Jeff Kingston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Kingston "Jeff Kingston"), a professor and director of Asian Studies at [Temple University, Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_University,_Japan_Campus "Temple University, Japan Campus"), echoed the view, adding that dumping would lower the price of U.S. bonds, making it more attractive to other countries. According to an [institutional investor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_investor "Institutional investor"), however, it may be difficult for Japan to boost its already large holdings of U.S. government debt, as such a move could be seen as "currency manipulation".<sup id="cite_ref-105"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-105">[105]</a></sup>

### Definition of public debt\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_debt_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Definition of public debt")\]

Economists also debate the definition of public debt. Krugman argued in May 2010 that the debt held by the public is the right measure to use, while Reinhart has testified to the President's Fiscal Reform Commission that gross debt is the appropriate measure.<sup id="cite_ref-krugman.blogs.nytimes.com_78-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-krugman.blogs.nytimes.com-78">[78]</a></sup> The [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_on_Budget_and_Policy_Priorities "Center on Budget and Policy Priorities") (CBPP) cited research by several economists supporting the use of the lower debt held by the public figure as a more accurate measure of the debt burden, disagreeing with these Commission members.<sup id="cite_ref-cbpp.org_106-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-cbpp.org-106">[106]</a></sup>

There is debate regarding the economic nature of the intragovernmental debt, which was approximately $4.6 trillion in February 2011.<sup id="cite_ref-107"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-107">[107]</a></sup> For example, the CBPP argues: that "large increases in \[debt held by the public\] can also push up interest rates and increase the amount of future interest payments the federal government must make to lenders outside of the United States, which reduces Americans' income. By contrast, intragovernmental debt (the other component of the gross debt) has no such effects because it is simply money the federal government owes (and pays interest on) to itself."<sup id="cite_ref-cbpp.org_106-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-cbpp.org-106">[106]</a></sup> However, if the U.S. government continues to run "on budget" deficits as projected by the CBO and OMB for the foreseeable future, it will have to issue marketable Treasury bills and bonds (i.e., debt held by the public) to pay for the projected shortfall in the Social Security program. This will result in "debt held by the public" replacing "intragovernmental debt".<sup id="cite_ref-108"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-108">[108]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-109"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-109">[109]</a></sup>

### Intergenerational equity\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_debt_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Intergenerational equity")\]

One debate about the national debt relates to intergenerational equity. For example, if one generation is receiving the benefit of government programs or employment enabled by deficit spending and debt accumulation, to what extent does the resulting higher debt impose risks and costs on future generations? There are several factors to consider:

-   For every dollar of debt held by the public, there is a government obligation (generally marketable Treasury securities) counted as an asset by investors. Future generations benefit to the extent these assets are passed on to them.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_110-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-ReferenceA-110">[110]</a></sup>
-   As of 2010, approximately 72% of the financial assets were held by the wealthiest 5% of the population.<sup id="cite_ref-111"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-111">[111]</a></sup> This presents a wealth and income distribution question, as only a fraction of the people in future generations will receive principal or interest from investments related to the debt incurred today.
-   To the extent the U.S. debt is owed to foreign investors (approximately half the "debt held by the public" during 2012), principal and interest are not directly received by U.S. heirs.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_110-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-ReferenceA-110">[110]</a></sup>
-   Higher debt levels imply higher interest payments, which create costs for future taxpayers (e.g., higher taxes, lower government benefits, higher inflation, or increased risk of fiscal crisis).<sup id="cite_ref-Huntley,_Jonathan_2010_61-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-Huntley,_Jonathan_2010-61">[61]</a></sup>
-   To the extent the borrowed funds are invested today to improve the long-term productivity of the economy and its workers, such as via useful infrastructure projects or education, future generations may benefit.<sup id="cite_ref-112"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-112">[112]</a></sup>
-   For every dollar of intragovernmental debt, there is an obligation to specific program recipients, generally non-marketable securities such as those held in the Social Security Trust Fund. Adjustments that reduce future deficits in these programs may also apply costs to future generations, via higher taxes or lower program spending.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (September 2016)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Krugman wrote in March 2013 that by neglecting public investment and failing to create jobs, we are doing far more harm to future generations than merely passing along debt: "Fiscal policy is, indeed, a moral issue, and we should be ashamed of what we're doing to the next generation's economic prospects. But our sin involves investing too little, not borrowing too much." Young workers face high unemployment and studies have shown their income may lag throughout their careers as a result. Teacher jobs have been cut, which could affect the quality of education and competitiveness of younger Americans.<sup id="cite_ref-113"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-113">[113]</a></sup>

## COVID-19 pandemic and aftermath\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_debt_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: COVID-19 pandemic and aftermath")\]

The [COVID-19 pandemic in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States "COVID-19 pandemic in the United States") impacted the economy significantly beginning in March 2020, as businesses were shut-down and furloughed or fired personnel. About 16 million persons filed for [unemployment insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_benefits "Unemployment benefits") in the three weeks ending April 9. It caused the number of unemployed persons to increase significantly, which is expected to reduce tax revenues while increasing [automatic stabilizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_stabilizer "Automatic stabilizer") spending for unemployment insurance and [nutritional support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program "Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program"). As a result of the adverse economic impact, both state and federal budget deficits will dramatically increase, even before considering any new legislation.<sup id="cite_ref-114"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-114">[114]</a></sup>

To help address lost income for millions of workers and assist businesses, Congress and President Trump enacted the [Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARES_Act "CARES Act") (CARES Act) on March 27, 2020. It included loans and grants for businesses, along with direct payments to individuals and additional funding for unemployment insurance. The act carried an estimated $2.3 trillion price tag, with an expectation that some or all of the loans would ultimately be paid back including interest. While the law would have almost certainly increased budget deficits relative to the January 2020 10-year CBO baseline (completed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic), in the absence of the legislation, a complete economic collapse could have occurred.<sup id="cite_ref-115"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-115">[115]</a></sup> However, as of 2023, many of these loans have been forgiven.<sup id="cite_ref-116"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-116">[116]</a></sup>

CBO provided a preliminary score for the CARES Act on April 16, 2020, estimating that it would increase federal deficits by about $1.8 trillion over the 2020-2030 period. The estimate includes:

-   A $988 billion increase in mandatory outlays;
-   A $446 billion decrease in revenues; and
-   A $326 billion increase in discretionary outlays, stemming from emergency supplemental appropriations.

CBO reported that not all parts of the bill will increase deficits: “Although the act provides financial assistance totaling more than $2 trillion, the projected cost is less than that because some of that assistance is in the form of loan guarantees, which are not estimated to have a net effect on the budget. In particular, the act authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to provide up to $454 billion to fund emergency lending facilities established by the [Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Board_of_Governors "Federal Reserve Board of Governors"). Because the income and costs stemming from that lending are expected to roughly offset each other, CBO estimates no deficit effect from that provision.”<sup id="cite_ref-CBO_Score1_117-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-CBO_Score1-117">[117]</a></sup>

The [Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_a_Responsible_Federal_Budget "Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget") estimated that the budget deficit for fiscal year 2020 would increase to a record $3.8 trillion (~$4.41 trillion in 2023), or 18.7% GDP.<sup id="cite_ref-CRFB_CARES1_118-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-CRFB_CARES1-118">[118]</a></sup> For scale, in 2009 the budget deficit reached 9.8% GDP ($1.4 trillion nominal dollars) in the depths of the [Great Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession "Great Recession"). CBO forecast in January 2020 that the budget deficit in FY2020 would be $1.0 trillion (~$1.16 trillion in 2023), prior to considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or CARES.<sup id="cite_ref-119"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-119">[119]</a></sup> CFRB further estimated that the national debt would reach 106% of U.S. GDP in September 2020, a record since the aftermath of World War II.<sup id="cite_ref-120"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-120">[120]</a></sup>

[President Biden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Biden "President Biden") also allocated significant amounts of money towards relief of the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic "COVID-19 pandemic"). According to a May 2021 report, Biden has or plans to spend $5.72 (~$6.35 trillion in 2023) trillion dollars toward this effort and others such as climate change including providing stimulus checks and serving schools and low-income children.<sup id="cite_ref-121"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-121">[121]</a></sup> Many economists have agreed that this unprecedented level of spending from the [Biden Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden "Presidency of Joe Biden") has, in part, contributed to the [inflation surge from 2021 to 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%932023_inflation_surge "2021–2023 inflation surge") as a result of increasing the money supply in the economy.<sup id="cite_ref-122"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-122">[122]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-123"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-123">[123]</a></sup>

On July 29, 2021, the BEA revised its GDP figures in a comprehensive update and figures back to FY1970 were revised accordingly.

On July 27, 2018, the BEA revised its GDP figures in a comprehensive update and figures back to FY2013 were revised accordingly.<sup id="cite_ref-130"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#cite_note-130">[130]</a></sup>

On June 25, 2014, the BEA announced: "\[On July 30, 2014, i\]n addition to the regular revision of estimates for the most recent 3 years and for the first quarter of 2014, GDP and select components will be revised back to the first quarter of 1999.

Fiscal years 1940–2009 GDP figures were derived from February 2011 Office of Management and Budget figures which contained revisions of prior year figures due to significant changes from prior GDP measurements. Fiscal years 1950–2010 GDP measurements were derived from December 2010 Bureau of Economic Analysis figures which also tend to be subject to revision, especially more recent years. Afterwards the OMB figures were revised back to 2004 and the BEA figures (in a revision dated July 31, 2013) were revised back to 1947.

Regarding estimates recorded in the GDP column (the last column) marked with a "~" symbol, absolute differences from advance (one month after) BEA reports of GDP percent change to current findings (as of November 2013) found in revisions are stated to be 1.3% ± 2.0% or a 95% probability of being within the range of 0.0–3.3%, assuming the differences to occur according to standard deviations from the average absolute difference of 1.3%. E.g. with an advance report of a $400 billion increase of a $10 trillion GDP, for example, one could be 95% confident that the range in which the exact GDP dollar amount lies would be 0.0 to 3.3% different than 4.0% (400 ÷ 10,000) or within the range of $0 to $330 billion different than the hypothetical $400 billion (a range of $70–730 billion). Two months after, with a revised value, the range of potential difference from the stated estimate shrinks, and three months after with another revised value the range shrinks again.

Fiscal years 1940–1970 begin July 1 of the previous year (for example, Fiscal Year 1940 begins July 1, 1939, and ends June 30, 1940); fiscal years 1980–2010 begin October 1 of the previous year. Intragovernmental debts before the Social Security Act are presumed to equal zero.

On July 29, 2016, the BEA released a revision to 2013–2016 GDP figures. The figures for this table were corrected the next week with changes to figures in those fiscal years.

On July 30, 2015, the BEA released a revision to 2012–2015 GDP figures. The figures for this table were corrected on that day with changes to FY 2013 and 2014, but not 2015 as FY 2015 is updated within a week with the release of debt totals for July 31, 2015.

On June 25, 2014, the BEA announced a 15-year revision of GDP figures would take place on July 31, 2014. The figures for this table were corrected after that date with changes to FY 2000, 2003, 2008, 2012, 2013 and 2014. The more precise FY 1999–2014 debt figures are derived from Treasury audit results. The variations in the 1990s and FY 2015 figures are due to double-sourced or relatively preliminary GDP figures respectively. A comprehensive [revision](https://bea.gov/national/pdf/2013briefingslides%20for%20web.pdf) GDP revision dated July 31, 2013, was described on the Bureau of Economic Analysis website. In November 2013 the total debt and yearly debt as a percentage of GDP columns of this table were changed to reflect those revised GDP figures.
