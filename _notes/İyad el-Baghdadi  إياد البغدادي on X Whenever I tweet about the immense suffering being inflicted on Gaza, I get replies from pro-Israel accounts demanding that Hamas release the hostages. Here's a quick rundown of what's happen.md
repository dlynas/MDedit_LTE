Whenever I tweet about the immense suffering being inflicted on Gaza, I get replies from pro-Israel accounts demanding that Hamas release the hostages. Here's a quick rundown of what's happening on that front. Tl;dr: Netanyahu doesn't care about the hostages



Hamas has already offered to release all hostages weeks ago. An "everyone for everyone" deal was placed on the table via Qatari mediation (all Palestinians held by Israel in return for all Israelis held by Hamas). But Netanyahu never accepted it

Afaik another deal was offered to release all women & children in return for a few days ceasefire that could be extended, but Netanyahu has also been very reluctant to accept it. It's not only that his extremist allies don't want a deal, it's also that he has his own calculus

Here's the thing: As soon as the fighting stops, Netanyahu is \*gone\*. He knows this. So he doesn't want the fighting to stop. And he thinks that a ceasefire & hostage release deal would mean that Hamas will release hostages in batches over time, in order to extend the cease fire

Hamas probably would do that, calculating that a long enough cease fire will: - Give them a chance to regroup - Give the entire Gaza strip a chance to breathe - Make renewing fighting politically costly for Israel - Foment a political crisis in Israel that could see Bibi ousted

Meanwhile, Netanyahu's current government coalition allies also don't want a deal for their own reasons. The extremists (Ben Gvir and Smotrich) see the war as an opportunity. The defense minister (Gallant) wants to avenge "the honor of the IDF", etc.

Meanwhile the Israeli hostage families have organized a march from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and are garnering supporters. They're demanding a hostage release deal and many are calling for Netanyahu's resignation.

Families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza arrive at their 4th night camp at Ein Hemed. Yuval Haran of Beeri, seven of whose relatives are captive, addresses the group.

Meanwhile Hamas released a video of an elderly hostage, which they say has died due to bombardment. The video first shows him alive but very frail, then cuts to show his still body (presumed dead). It appears that as time passes, fewer and fewer hostages will return alive.

Beyond that, nobody (not even Bibi) believes that increasing military pressure on Hamas will get them to release the hostages, or that Hamas is on the verge of collapsing or surrendering. Bibi doesn't seem to have a plan for "winning", or a plan for what comes after Israel "wins"

So this is the situation: - Bibi knows that the end of fighting is the end of his political career - He calculates that accepting a release deal can potentially end the fighting long enough for his career to be threatened - Nobody in his government is prioritizing the hostages

Netanyahu is stuck, and with him Israel is stuck. It's almost certain that IDF bombardment has killed some of the hostages (and this is what Hamas has claimed, and it wouldn't be surprising given the scale of devastation). Summary: Netanyahu doesn't care about the hostages

(If I made factual mistakes, or if I missed some details, or if some of my info is outdated, please feel free to correct me)

Necessary clarification: Hamas is asking for the release of all Palestinians held by Israel. The majority of those are \*not\* Hamas, and 2000+ were held without any charge (so-called "administrative detention") even before Oct 7

People are asking why Bibi is politically in trouble. Multiple reasons: - He's a divisive figure and was politically & legally in trouble before Oct 7 - Oct 7 happened on his watch - Strengthening & funding Hamas was his own explicit policy (see below)

Btw, the point about how Netanyahu's policy was to strengthen Hamas, a lot more can be said about this failure but here's a good place to start: haaretz.com/israel-news/20
