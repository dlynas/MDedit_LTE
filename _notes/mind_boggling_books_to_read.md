			This post just popped up in my feed no more than 60 seconds ago. I bought The Library at Mount Char at this exact point in the comments...
			
			That's all 
			
			Just wanted to see what people think of that.

		* 🟧 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-02-09 08:22:54)_

			I don’t know what to read that’s like Char. I loved that book

	* 🟨 **[tacocat-_-tacocat](https://www.reddit.com/user/tacocat-_-tacocat)** ⬆️ 4 _(2024-02-09 08:44:44)_

		I tried to start this a couple times and could not get going at all.  Is that a sign it’s just not for me, or does it take a bit to click?

		* 🟧 **[ArizonaMaybe](https://www.reddit.com/user/ArizonaMaybe)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-02-09 11:14:19)_

			It takes a bit to get going.  I remember thinking this book might not be for me at first.  Then after it got going I couldn’t put it down.

			* 🟦 **[tacocat-_-tacocat](https://www.reddit.com/user/tacocat-_-tacocat)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-09 21:02:52)_

				Helpful, thanks!  It will stay on the to-do list!

	* 🟨 **[Sauceoppa29](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sauceoppa29)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-02-08 19:30:42)_

		read this and it was good but it wasn’t great. Felt like the ending was trying too hard to explain itself. it’s a solid 7/10 fho

* 🟩 **[TSwag24601](https://www.reddit.com/user/TSwag24601)** ⬆️ 35 _(2024-02-08 15:34:12)_

	Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison

	* 🟨 **[-IndigoMist-](https://www.reddit.com/user/-IndigoMist-)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-09 08:36:26)_

		Didn’t think this book would have as big of an impact on me as it did. Absolutely recommend it to everyone.

* 🟩 **[No_Mud_No_Lotus](https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Mud_No_Lotus)** ⬆️ 50 _(2024-02-08 16:49:51)_

	Ted Chiang’s short stories are like a workout for the mind, I swear I felt my brain actually grow after reading them.

	* 🟨 **[thgttu](https://www.reddit.com/user/thgttu)** ⬆️ 9 _(2024-02-08 23:56:03)_

		I read Hell is the Absence of God last year and I still think about it often. Ditto for Tower of Babylon. His stuff really sticks with you.

		* 🟧 **[No_Mud_No_Lotus](https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Mud_No_Lotus)** ⬆️ 6 _(2024-02-08 23:59:42)_

			There is really no one else quite like him. Ken Liu is in a similar vein but not quite as heady/dense/intellectual. If you have any recommendations too, I’d love to hear them.

			* 🟦 **[kindall](https://www.reddit.com/user/kindall)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-09 08:54:05)_

				Greg Egan is the closest I can think of, especially if you stick to his shorter works.

	* 🟨 **[ModerateExtremism](https://www.reddit.com/user/ModerateExtremism)** ⬆️ 5 _(2024-02-09 08:47:25)_

		I’ll second this. I read A LOT for my job…the equivalent of at least one book + a day. Ted Chiang’s work has stopped me in my tracks a few times - love the kind of stories that make you want to stop and just spend time reflecting on what you just read. Immense talent.

		* 🟧 **[-IndigoMist-](https://www.reddit.com/user/-IndigoMist-)** ⬆️ 4 _(2024-02-09 09:44:06)_

	Man a lot of these reccs are like messed up mind boggling, but taking tbe approach of more maybe hard to get your mind to wrap around in terms of the world's/ stories timelines/physical properties is Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell. Its written trying to put into practical terms rhe idea that since time and space are relative and bendable, that technically something that happens in tbe future could affect something that happened in tbe past. So the book is written as if you're travelling in a line across a frozen ripple, with each ripple being a different time line.

	* 🟨 **[bmlander](https://www.reddit.com/user/bmlander)** ⬆️ 6 _(2024-02-08 17:40:18)_

		There is a theory that all of Mitchell’s books are, in fact, one meta book.

	There's a book called *Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes* by Daniel Everett. It's nonfiction. He's a linguist and was sent to a remote area in the Amazon Jungle by some Baptists (?) who wanted him to learn the language of the natives, translate the bible to their language, and try to convert them all. The people, called the Pirahã, are fascinating. They don't have words for numbers. They believe that what happens to you in your dreams is every bit as important and relevant as what happens to you in your waking life. If you're telling them a story, they only want to hear about people you know personally or people known by the people you know, so like only 2 degrees of separation. Otherwise, they don't really care. You can imagine how his proselytizing goes. After a while, he brings his wife and kids down there to live, too. Since he's a linguist, there's lots of info about how languages work and how the Pirahã language is so freaking different than most other languages. I read this book years ago, and I still think about it all the time.

		* 🟧 **[steezalicious](https://www.reddit.com/user/steezalicious)** ⬆️ 7 _(2024-02-08 20:04:42)_

			I would say no. I’ve read and liked both but if you didn’t like Recursion, you’re probably not going to like Dark Matter either

		* 🟧 **[caulf](https://www.reddit.com/user/caulf)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-02-08 20:50:09)_

			I would. I loved Dark Matter and was pumped for Recursion. I could not get into Recursion and dropped it after a few chapters.

			* 🟦 **[Suitable-Bus-4488](https://www.reddit.com/user/Suitable-Bus-4488)** ⬆️ 4 _(2024-02-08 21:06:55)_

				Is he the Colleen hoover of Sci fi?  I honestly felt like he wrote the most shallow characters I've ever read in recursion lol idk if this is a blasphemous question

				* 🟪 **[djavaman](https://www.reddit.com/user/djavaman)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-02-09 17:02:27)_

					He's 'written' the same book 3 times.  Same concept.  Same trope.
					
					His characters are lightweight cutouts.
					
					Not one single original or interesting idea.
					
					I swear he has hired an army of people to comb reddit for any mention and go nuts.

	Motherfucking “House of Leaves” by Mark Z Danielewski. I’ve been reading it for the past 5 days or so and it is a masterpiece and brilliant and mind boggling and incredibly frustrating.

		* 🟧 **[rubix_cubin](https://www.reddit.com/user/rubix_cubin)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-08 21:10:28)_

			Yeah none of those are terribly light reads but they all pay off in huge ways if you can push through and digest them. Definitely have to be in the right mind set to tackle them but it's worth it!

	* 🟨 **[CatPaws55](https://www.reddit.com/user/CatPaws55)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-02-08 22:05:17)_

	* 🟨 **[PrimalHonkey](https://www.reddit.com/user/PrimalHonkey)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-09 07:38:22)_

		Seconded from a fellow Pynchon sub follower. I will add against the day as possibly my fave novel of all time.

		* 🟧 **[KieselguhrKid13](https://www.reddit.com/user/KieselguhrKid13)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-09 09:10:15)_

			Same! I basically alternate between GR and AtD as my favorite depending on which I read last. I think AtD might have the upper hand just on the strength of the ending.

			* 🟦 **[PrimalHonkey](https://www.reddit.com/user/PrimalHonkey)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-09 10:18:06)_

				I know exactly the feeling. The only reason AtD might edge out GR as a desert island book is the adventurous nature of it. It almost made me feel like a kid again, in the best of ways. All the spies, scientists, pilots, cowboys, and druggies crisscrossing so many locales in such an evocative time. Not to mention the chums and their travels. It’s quite heartwarming as well, which GR is a bit less so😂

	A Fire Upon The Deep

	Mind blowing for its exceptional world building, utter believability, and high concepts (the opening paragraph of the prologue had me hooked: "How to explain? How to describe? Even the omniscient viewpoint quails.")

	A Deepness in the Sky

	A prequel to the first book, in the sense that both books technically share a character, but this one takes place more than thirty thousand years earlier. In my opinion this is the more thought-provoking of the two. Hard choice. At any rate, you will not be disappointed by either.

	Both by Vernor Vinge, available as a single volume called The Zones of Thought.

	I am so fond of these books it almost makes my cry (sometimes I do 🙈)

	Two I don't see mentioned yet that blew my mind:

	Cloud Cuckoo Land, by Anthony Doer (not the right spelling)

	The Country of Ice Cream Star by Sandra Newman (Neuman?)

	Clearly I am bad at names but don't let that stop you from these epic stories. The Ice Cream Star book has it's own vernacular that I think not everyone "gets". It did take me about 20 ish pages to really understand the grammar but then I became so engrossed in the story that I forgot what normal speech was like and would always have some speech discombobulation moving between the book and reality. I mean this in the absolute best possible way.
