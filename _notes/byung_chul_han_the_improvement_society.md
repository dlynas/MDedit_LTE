## Byung Chul Han - The Improvement Society

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/DecodingTheGurus/comments/1bumswc/byung_chul_han_the_improvement_society/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DecodingTheGurus/comments/1bumswc/byung_chul_han_the_improvement_society/)

> The whole gurusphere made so much more sense after reading him. He is a highly-regarded leftists philosopher writing about tech and it‚Äôs affect on the subject. This ten min video is well worth a watch. Rogan et al suddenly made a hell of a lot more sense after watching this and reading his work. Stick with it, first few mins are a bit stodgy but he moves on to influencer culture after that.

	hmm... i watched the video. thanks for the warning to push through the initial stodge-factor.

	my take-away was that by making ourselves focus on "cleaning our room" or starting with working on ourselves, the gurus (be they buddha or the self-help world), take attention away from social action

	i recently traveled to thailand, a country with a strong buddhist tradition. i was very impressed by the culture of buddhism interwoven into the social fabric there. some central buddhist values are: acceptance, mindfulness, calmness

	yet there were many social ills: e.g. corruption, pollution.

	it seems to me that we not only need to be committed to "cleaning our rooms" or following the 5 Buddhist precepts on an individual level, but also committed to doing this on a national and earth-based level. Peterson or Mark Manson or Sadhguru say: take responsibility. Yet we must also, as a country or humanity, take responsibility. 

	I think it's a case for the idea of BOTH/AND. Yes, taking personal responsibility is good AND working at the collective level is also good. Doing only the first leads to the trap of this video. Doing only the second leads to perhaps being an angry activist that dissociates from their own life by engaging in causes (something the psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman calls pseudotranscendance). 

	Thanks for the food for thought!

		I think he questions the idea of "individual wills" in the first place,  but then you'd have to explore his heideggarian/zen/catholic metaphysics themselves, which he puts to one side in the video. But you're right in that it's very hard *not* to take on a conventional sense of responsibility and agency. But that's only a small part of the story.

			I love the idea of "interbeing" that thich naht hanh talks about -- that we are all connected and are empty of separate self.  This gives me a sense of spiritual expansiveness.
			
			From a practical perspective, though, I also find it helpful / useful / energizing to think of myself as having agency and to think of "what can I do today that would make me proud of myself?"
			
			Both/And, again.

				Yes. "Emptiness has form and form has emptiness". Byung Chul Had is smart enough (and well versed enough in Zen and Heidegger) to knwo this. He is a left wing mystic, in my view, with conservative strands.
				
				Heidegger puts it in almost terrifying clarirty: "we don't come to thought. Thought comes to us."  And he doesn't mean just some thoughts, some of the time. He means everythign that we have *ever* thought. So if you agree, and I do, they are saying our problems really *are* social in nature. All of them. Down to the tiniest, quickest thought. Now the social can be interchangable with the absoloute/void/divine/Schopheneur's will etc but it's still the opposite direction to what we are taught and told (especially by the grifters that saturate our culture).

				thought buddhist teachers such naht hanh are sadly more of teh same. Get rid of your stress! Never question the thing that is causing teh stress in teh first place. Perfect for greedy landlords and the like. Just meditate it all away. All that guilt. It's just more ideology that fits perfectly within the neoliberal machine. It's important to be truly awake to "interdependance" which is glossed over and not given political meaning by most of these teachers.

					interesting... is there a book / source that could give a good entry-point into your political lens on the world?
					
					i'm pretty unfamiliar with a lot of the philosophy you reference. i have done my stint in anarchist bookstores (reading stuff like WORK by Crimethinc and lots of zines and a magazine called Commune).
					
					i get that there is a system that is keeping the status quo going, and appreciate the perspective that the focus on meditation, therapy, self-improvement is in many ways a good thing for those in power
					
					AND
					
					sometimes, it's true that we benefit when we see the "second arrow of suffering." e.g. I'm sick with a cold right now. It's helpful for me to accept this and use this time for cocooning and reading rather than feeling sorry for myself. 
					
					So I don't think the Gurus are all bad. I still like my Thich and Ram Dass and Sadhguru. I think this sub is helping me not attach to them and hold them lightly. For that I'm grateful.

						well depends how far you're into buddhism. I have gone in, got deep, and come out the otherside. Buddhism and nondual philosophy will always be important to me and i still practice daily. But it is not for me shot through with transcendental signifiers. I do not believe really in enlightement any more. Byung Chul Han's book on Zen is a great start. Glen Wallis's Speculative Non Buddhism blog is also great, if you want the radical implications of "interdependance" and a mroe post modern critical theory lens in which to view buddhism. Read also Tom Pepper's Unfaithful Buddhist. And then all the usual - marx, lacan, althusser, heidegger, the list goes on and on. These will not be in conflict with any nondual philosophy you may have.

							Thank you, reading BCH's wikipedia now. You've given me a lot of readings to look into!

						and yes agree that they aren't all bad. not at all. It's impossible not to give or take advice, lol. The problem is not that, the problem is ideology and how it creates suffering. And people like Rogan etc are a pervayors of a particular, absoloute ideology: neoliberalism.

							had to look up neoliberalism on chat gpt and yes, i would agree with that. idk how conscious this ideology peddling is. we are all swimming in neoliberalism, it seems. it's the water, and also, these talking internet heads are part of the water. thanks for your thoughtful comments!

								Yep. "We think we are free". WE are not, nearly all our desires themselves are neoliberal formations, for example. Freedom and survellance, now, are indistinguishable. Apple even knows how much you sleep, etc.

	Byung Chul-Han is the man.    Philosophize This has a nice two parter on his books "The burnout society" and "Disappeance of rituals"  

	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm56nQ31kBk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm56nQ31kBk)  

	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXGvIGqZSuI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXGvIGqZSuI)

	  

	Both offer good insight into the modern condition, some of which lends itself to why people seek out gurus imo.

			Oh yea Philsophize This/Stephen West are awesome.  One of the few podcasts I genuinely get excited for.

				If you like that I can recommend you to also try _History of Philosophy without any gaps_. It's not as hype, but more well researched and thorough.

		Love his podcast, he does a great job of summarizing philosophy without sounding like a book report. I also enjoyed his episodes on Simone weil, Zizek, and the Society of the Spectacle¬†

	I'm glad I discovered your thread because I've only recently been introduced to him. I read excerpts from his book, "The Burnout Society" and his whole outline of the digital panopticon (all seeing eye), rise of narcissism, criticism on society's emphasis on productivity and technology that's compounding to the increased in mental health cases like ADHD, Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and burnout syndrome. It really is quite fascinating the way he's framed it. Because I'm noticing these trends myself and I live in Bangkok. 

	It isn't just limited to the western world like some may think. 

	Also, I read some of your replies and your interest into Buddhism is wonderful. I'm a Thai myself and have always thought Buddhism to be one of the religion that complements science the most. Its focus on the basics of human nature primarily is what makes it so real and applicable for me. 

	I want to add though - to your point about corruption and pollution - I agree that it's awful. The popularity of Buddhism here is either for ceremonial purpose, merits for the next life, or some monks being ordained to escape sentencing. We're definitely not taught it like how philosophy is taught in the Netherlands. It's a very repressed culture and we're not encouraged to search inside yourself. Even worse, it's kinda 'discouraged' because it's considered "kid mark" (think too much).
