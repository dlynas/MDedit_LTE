## Help me find my book club’s next read.

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/1awcvbc/help_me_find_my_book_clubs_next_read/](https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/1awcvbc/help_me_find_my_book_clubs_next_read/)

> We are a group of almost 30 year old guys who’ve started a book club. Some are non readers while some of us have read for a few years. The only stipulation is that the book is under 300 pages long. Could be any genre. The most upvoted comment will be my suggestion to the club!

			In case you don't know the full saying is : "Great minds think alike but the minds of fools rarely differ."
			
			It's a warning that just because you agree with someone it doesn't mean the idea you agree upon is wise/correct.
			
			It's one of those sayings where it shortened over time and now means the exact opposite as it meant in it's longer form.

	I am ignoring your rules.  I apologise profusely.  But...'The Sellout'.  My book club read this.  We meet in a pub at six in the evening.  They threw us out at 11:00 (closing time UK).  Debate still ongoing.  This was the book club for people that don't read books.  Also, 'The Goldfinch'.  Thick book.  Everyone debating.

	* 🟨 **[Iloveflea](https://www.reddit.com/user/Iloveflea)** ⬆️ 10 _(2024-02-21 18:38:37)_

		I love the goldfinch

				I saw that one but it's under 300 pages so i wasn't sure what rule it broke lol

	* 🟨 **[J_PZ_](https://www.reddit.com/user/J_PZ_)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-02-21 21:30:18)_

		The Sellout is a great recommendation. Another wild read in that vein (that also now has a well-received movie tie-in) is Erasure by Percival Everett.

	* 🟨 **[leafcomforter](https://www.reddit.com/user/leafcomforter)** ⬆️ 4 _(2024-02-21 13:33:56)_

		Second “The Goldfinch”.

	Trevor Noah's: Born A Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood  

	It's easy to read, has a good pace and he does well in weaving the highs and lows together

	* 🟨 **[gacchow](https://www.reddit.com/user/gacchow)** ⬆️ 10 _(2024-02-21 15:05:02)_

		totally agree! trevor noah is a phenomenal storyteller, and he has such intriguing stories to share in his memoir. this just reminded me that i would love to reread this again :)

		Agree! Great starter book for a book club!

	* 🟨 **[_marinara](https://www.reddit.com/user/_marinara)** ⬆️ 15 _(2024-02-21 10:30:30)_

		And for those in the book club who are just getting / getting back into reading, they might enjoy the audiobook! I don’t listen to a lot of audiobooks, and tend to prefer to actually read a book, but this one was absolutely fabulous as an audiobook.

		* 🟧 **[whodat-whodat](https://www.reddit.com/user/whodat-whodat)** ⬆️ 9 _(2024-02-21 13:33:32)_

			I loved the audiobook too! Should also mention it's narrated by Trevor Noah himself which was a big plus

		* 🟧 **[61mems](https://www.reddit.com/user/61mems)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-21 13:01:04)_

			Yes it is, I thought of that book first, but it is longer than 300 pages . I just finished Into the Wild, also excellent and only around 200 pages.

			* 🟦 **[fraurodin](https://www.reddit.com/user/fraurodin)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-02-21 13:17:02)_

				It is a bit thick, but I remember being so engrossed i couldn't put it down.  Maybe after everyone feels more secure or ready they can pick it up

	* 🟨 **[Huldukona](https://www.reddit.com/user/Huldukona)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-02-21 13:20:10)_

		Great book

* 🟩 **[Bartendinglibrarian](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bartendinglibrarian)** ⬆️ 13 _(2024-02-21 14:46:09)_

	I think horror is a good genre. Really pulls people in especially if it has a fast moving plot.  I recommend World War Z by Max Brooks. I KNOW THE MOVIE STUNK. The book is completely different. Tbh I’m shocked they share copyrights. It is a completely different story. It tells the story of a reporter documenting people’s personal accounts of the zombie apocalypse. Excellent read and I’m sure a great conversation starter.

	* 🟨 **[lennybriscoforthewin](https://www.reddit.com/user/lennybriscoforthewin)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-02-21 17:12:58)_

		This book messed me up. It’s so realistic I thought maybe there had been a zombie apocalypse and I forgot. I learned so many ways to protect myself from zombies that I still remember. It is an awesome book.

	* 🟨 **[DancingDrammer](https://www.reddit.com/user/DancingDrammer)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-21 19:32:14)_

		This is a great shout! Always rave about how incredible this book is and how thoroughly disappointing the film was.

	* 🟨 **[tomsprigs](https://www.reddit.com/user/tomsprigs)** ⬆️ 6 _(2024-02-21 12:55:03)_

* 🟩 **[ImcalledCaeneus](https://www.reddit.com/user/ImcalledCaeneus)** ⬆️ 11 _(2024-02-21 11:33:07)_

	Technically this book has 326 pages but The eyes of the dragon by Stephen King is a fantastic read and a great introduction to King

	* 🟨 **[ModerateThistle](https://www.reddit.com/user/ModerateThistle)** ⬆️ 5 _(2024-02-21 09:51:11)_

		This was the first book our book club read! It was very polarizing, which led to great discussion.

	* 🟨 **[Intelligent-Ask-3264](https://www.reddit.com/user/Intelligent-Ask-3264)** ⬆️ 5 _(2024-02-21 10:47:41)_

		You should definitely read this and follow up with The Graveyard Book and  Stardust.

	* 🟨 **[WinterFirstDay](https://www.reddit.com/user/WinterFirstDay)** ⬆️ 5 _(2024-02-21 09:56:35)_

		Somehow, I feel like reading it in book club of 30-something and then *sharing experiences* from it may or may not turn said book club into bastion or wasteland...
		
		This one is epitome of coin flip.

* 🟩 **[PuffMaddy](https://www.reddit.com/user/PuffMaddy)** ⬆️ 21 _(2024-02-21 10:19:35)_

		Oh my book club just read this! It’s short and really moves. It’s written by one of the showrunners of Game of Thrones.

* 🟩 **[dankchic](https://www.reddit.com/user/dankchic)** ⬆️ 9 _(2024-02-21 11:48:49)_

	Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury! Great book, easy to read and very thought provoking!

* 🟩 **[Software-Flimsy](https://www.reddit.com/user/Software-Flimsy)** ⬆️ 38 _(2024-02-21 10:23:06)_

	Piranesi by Susanna Clarke! One of my favorite of all time books, 272 pages. I wish I had a book club to discuss this when I read it

	* 🟨 **[WildPinata](https://www.reddit.com/user/WildPinata)** ⬆️ 10 _(2024-02-21 16:16:28)_

		I wouldn't recommend it for people who have been away from reading for a while though. It's very thought-provoking, but it's slow.

	* 🟨 **[Mavises](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mavises)** ⬆️ 8 _(2024-02-21 15:27:16)_

		Really? It just did not work for me. I *adored* Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell, and I do normally love the more ‘out-there’ fiction, but I really ended up actively disliking Piranesi.

		* 🟧 **[Catsandscotch](https://www.reddit.com/user/Catsandscotch)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-21 16:28:59)_

			This was exactly my experience.

	* 🟨 **[MGaCici](https://www.reddit.com/user/MGaCici)** ⬆️ 4 _(2024-02-21 11:58:22)_

		Same. I would love a discussion group.

	* 🟨 **[OrthogonalSloth](https://www.reddit.com/user/OrthogonalSloth)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-21 12:25:58)_

		Came here to say this. Loved it.

* 🟩 **[Wild_Preference_4624](https://www.reddit.com/user/Wild_Preference_4624)** ⬆️ 55 _(2024-02-21 09:52:54)_

	Holes by Louis Sachar! It really does appeal to all ages, even though it's also accessable to younger readers. (It's one of my mom's favorites, and my 28 year old best friend just—very skeptically—read it on my mom's rec and afterwards texted me after finishing it to say that it was amazing.)

	* 🟨 **[leafcomforter](https://www.reddit.com/user/leafcomforter)** ⬆️ 4 _(2024-02-21 13:30:19)_

		Agree. Over 60.

	Dungeon Crawler Carl

	* 🟨 **[wellitriedkinda](https://www.reddit.com/user/wellitriedkinda)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-21 12:35:37)_

		Seconding this, but it is about 450 pages. Superfast read though.

		* 🟧 **[Efficient-Damage-449](https://www.reddit.com/user/Efficient-Damage-449)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-21 12:36:46)_

			Good point. Maybe the first two books

	* 🟨 **[Corpsefeet](https://www.reddit.com/user/Corpsefeet)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-21 18:19:40)_

		I wanted to suggest this, even though its 444 pages - we are doing rhe audio books and flying through them.  You know 5 pages in that you are finishing the book in one sitting.
		
		Funny, action packed, thought provoking.... amazing read.

* 🟩 **[unstuckbilly](https://www.reddit.com/user/unstuckbilly)** ⬆️ 15 _(2024-02-21 11:43:03)_

	Dark Matter by Blake Crouch! 

	It’s a SciFi thriller, first published in 2016, so maybe some in your group have already read it. If not, definitely stick it on your list.

	* 🟨 **[cornflower4](https://www.reddit.com/user/cornflower4)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-21 14:45:26)_

		Just finished this one last night. Couldn’t put it down!

	Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes it's a novella so nice and short, it's written in a diary style, it's easy reading, and it's one of the greatest books ever written. 

	It's about a mouse and a man who both go through an experiment to boost their intelligence, the effects upon both of them are thought-provoking, capturing your imagination. 

	I suggested it to my book vlub a few years ago, it was one of our top scorers.

	* 🟨 **[SeparateOcelot2110](https://www.reddit.com/user/SeparateOcelot2110)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-02-21 12:49:29)_

		This was the first book that was recommended to me a couple of years ago when I asked a friend who is an avid reader what I should try, I was a mess by the end of it. Great recommendation

	* 🟨 **[CampLow1996](https://www.reddit.com/user/CampLow1996)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-21 20:15:35)_

		If this book doesn’t move grown men- they are a heartless bunch! I’m 42. I read this in 8th or 9th grade and have read hundreds of books since. I still think about it frequently. It will leave a mark.

* 🟩 **[coffee_cats_trucrime](https://www.reddit.com/user/coffee_cats_trucrime)** ⬆️ 13 _(2024-02-21 09:59:39)_

	These three are all under 300 pages and I found them to be thought-provoking without being boring. 

	- FantasticLand by Mike Bockoven. It's attention-grabbing for sure. Amusement park turns apocalyptic after a natural disaster leaves the staff marooned for weeks.

	- Level Up by Craig Anderson. Akin to Ready Player One, but more coming of age. A boy and alien switch positions in life and learn about the other species in the process. It's an enjoyable read.

	- 1984 by George Orwell. When you want a classic that isn't absolutely mind-numbing. This book is still on my mind after years of reading it. Tons of discussion opportunities here!

	* 🟨 **[Bookwormkatie](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bookwormkatie)** ⬆️ 14 _(2024-02-21 11:26:21)_

		1984 is fantastic

	{Before the Coffee Gets Cold
 by Toshikazu Kawaguchi}

	224 pages.  Translated from Japanese.  Accessible writing to suit first timers.  Broken into 4 interwoven stories, so easy to follow (no need to hold a complex plot in head; or even finish the book if people run out of time), but covers all sorts of themes, challenges and characters that would raise good questions &amp; ideas for a book club to discuss.

	In a particular cafe, 4 patrons have the chance to go back in time to another point in their lives..but time is limited and they have to make the most of it.

	It's a popular book for book clubs, so you'll be able to find some good questions / discussion points online.

	* 🟨 **[01134_01134](https://www.reddit.com/user/01134_01134)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-21 12:06:18)_

		I read this for a book club recently. It did lead to a good discussion but I’d say 3/4 of the group didn’t actually like the book with a few not even finishing it due to lack of interest.

* 🟩 **[Capybara_99](https://www.reddit.com/user/Capybara_99)** ⬆️ 11 _(2024-02-21 09:41:42)_

	“The Trees” by Percival Everett

	* 🟨 **[J_PZ_](https://www.reddit.com/user/J_PZ_)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-21 21:31:41)_

		I'm so glad you recommended this. I suggested Erasure above as another option that is somewhat similar to *The Sellout* by Paul Beatty. I really loved *The Trees* and Everett's range as an author is incredible

		* 🟧 **[Capybara_99](https://www.reddit.com/user/Capybara_99)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-22 02:04:18)_

			I love “The Sellout” too.  Everett is one of my favorite authors and you are right about his range.  The first book of his I read was “I Am Not Sidney Poitier.”  A very funny book.  About a guy named Not Sidney Poitier.  But now, anyway, “The Trees” is my favorite.

	* 🟨 **[EvilSoporific](https://www.reddit.com/user/EvilSoporific)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-02-21 11:46:26)_

* 🟩 **[Team_bhip](https://www.reddit.com/user/Team_bhip)** ⬆️ 15 _(2024-02-21 10:04:46)_

	The Martian by Andy Weir. Extremely accessible and readable. Page turner. Good for discussion.

	* 🟨 **[quirky_yolo1](https://www.reddit.com/user/quirky_yolo1)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-21 22:02:09)_

		I agree, this was great. If they like The Martian (and seem inclined to Sci Fi) then I Project Hail Mary could be even better received !

* 🟩 **[Fine_Cryptographer20](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fine_Cryptographer20)** ⬆️ 5 _(2024-02-21 10:27:16)_

	Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson is 330 pages and heart thumping.

	Old Man’s War (Scalzi); even the non-sci-fi folks in my book club liked this one (It’s 318 but reads fast, trust me).

* 🟩 **[unlovelyladybartleby](https://www.reddit.com/user/unlovelyladybartleby)** ⬆️ 11 _(2024-02-21 09:38:34)_

	Devolution by Max Brooks. It has techno-hippies, a localized apocalypse, a pack of bloodthirsty cryptids, and it teaches you how to make lethal weapons out of lamps and kitchenware.

* 🟩 **[Gretchen_Wieners_](https://www.reddit.com/user/Gretchen_Wieners_)** ⬆️ 24 _(2024-02-21 09:40:10)_

	I was going to recommend "The Beach" by Alex Garland, which is one of the few books I've read narrated by a character who doesn't seem like they care about books, which I thought would be a plus for a group that has some non-readers. But it's a little over 300 pages, so how about "The Grifters" by Jim Thompson. Both were made into movies, so that could be a backup for people who get bogged down in the books, and it's always entertaining to talk about how films are different from the novels they were based on.

	Starship Troopers. The first movie was fun, but except for the title bore almost no resemblance to the book.  The book was better.  Not as bad as High School literature class with the teacher Miss Rottencrouch, but read the book and then watch the film. Both the book and film are a little old so it might be new stuff for guys in their late 20s. 

	The movie used actual blank ammo, so with CGA now, it was probably the last movie made with hundreds of thousands of blanks.

	Kings of the Wyld by Nicholas Eames.  

	A bunch of retired mercenaries getting the band back together. It's a great book to lure the non-readers back into reading.

	My bookclub is currently reading Wise Blood, Flannery O'Connor's first novel. It's been a pretty good read and lends itself well to discussion, assuming no one in your group is particularly sensitive about religion and race in the Jim Crow era South.

	As a fan of hers in general it's been really interesting to see her less mature and her idea of what passes for a comedy.

	Speaking beyond the author it's been an interesting reversal to follow a character desperately trying and failing to rid themselves of religion rather than cling to it. And there's mummies and gorilla costumes. Who doesn't like a book with mummies and gorilla costumes.

	Moon of the Crusted Snow, by Waubgeshig Rice. It’s post-kind-of-apocalypse story of an Anishinaabe community up north, inspire by the blackout of 2003. Great characters, well-paced… and he just published a sequel!

	The Marrow Thieves by Cherie Dimaline. 

	Technically it’s YA which is sometimes easier to get into for newer readers! 

	But it’s got such an interesting storyline - dystopian future, post-apocalyptic Canada. Indigenous people/youth are being hunted by government representatives for their bone marrow which has special properties, aka the ability to dream which no one else has. 

	It’s a book that has really stayed with me years after I read it. (Also available as an audiobook in case some of you prefer that format which is nice.)
