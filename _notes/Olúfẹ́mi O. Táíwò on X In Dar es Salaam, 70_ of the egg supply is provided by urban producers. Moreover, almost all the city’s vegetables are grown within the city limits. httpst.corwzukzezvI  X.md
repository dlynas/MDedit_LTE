"In Dar es Salaam, 70% of the egg supply is provided by urban producers. Moreover, almost all the city’s vegetables are grown within the city limits."



consistent with Malekela and Nyomora here: "In the surveyed local markets about 47% of food products were sourced from UPA\[urban+peri-urban ag\], also, 60-80% of vegetables and 57.1% of the eggs sold in the surveyed supermarkets were sourced from UPA."

Very cool. Unfortunately the original article is very unclear - nowhere do they geographically define "urban and peri-urban" in the context of Dar, and the only resident-level data they have is of farmers, who are of course more dependent on urban agriculture.

rodney was onto something

That’s incredible! Had no idea, thanks for tweeting this

Does this include processed/packaged food?

It was like this when I lived in Guilin China twenty plus years ago. Refrigeration wasn’t much of a thing back then either.

I live in Baltimore and have a neighbor a block away with a dozen chickens. She gets about 4 dozen eggs a week.

Total inversion of the "tragedy of the commons" - vegetable patches spontaneously occupy medians and boulevards across the city, it's delightful.

I feel like a lot antigardening people are just trying to make upzoning arguments indirectly. Go for it - apartment towers are good imo. Single family home zoning into multifamily homes and ADUs - great. Doesn't contradict urban farming at all.
