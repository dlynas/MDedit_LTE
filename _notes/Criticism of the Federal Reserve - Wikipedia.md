The [Federal Reserve System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve "Federal Reserve"), commonly known as "the Fed," has faced various criticisms since its establishment in 1913. Critics have questioned its effectiveness in managing inflation, regulating the banking system, and stabilizing the economy. Notable critics include Nobel laureate economist [Milton Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman "Milton Friedman") and his fellow monetarist [Anna Schwartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Schwartz "Anna Schwartz"), who argued that the Fed's policies exacerbated the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression_in_the_United_States "Great Depression in the United States"). More recently, former Congressman Ron Paul has advocated for the abolition of the Fed and a return to a gold standard.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>

Critics have also raised concerns about the Fed's role in fractional reserve banking, its contribution to economic cycles, and its transparency. The Fed has been accused of causing economic downturns, including the 2007-2008 financial crisis,<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> and of being influenced by private interests. Despite these criticisms, the Federal Reserve remains a central institution in the United States' financial system, with ongoing debates about its role, policies, and the need for reform.

## Creation\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Creation")\]

An early version of the [Federal Reserve Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Act "Federal Reserve Act") was drafted in 1910 on [Jekyll Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_Island "Jekyll Island"), [Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state) "Georgia (U.S. state)"), by [Republican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States) "Republican Party (United States)") [Senator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate "United States Senate") [Nelson Aldrich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Aldrich "Nelson Aldrich"), chairman of the [National Monetary Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Monetary_Commission "National Monetary Commission"), and several Wall Street bankers. The final version, with provisions intended to improve public oversight and weaken the influence of the New York banking establishment, was drafted by [Democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States) "Democratic Party (United States)") [Congressman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Congress "Member of Congress") [Carter Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Glass "Carter Glass") of [Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia "Virginia").<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> The structure of the Fed was a compromise between the desire of the bankers for a central bank under their control and the desire of [President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States") [Woodrow Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson "Woodrow Wilson") to create a decentralized structure under public control.<sup id="cite_ref-boshistory_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-boshistory-4">[4]</a></sup> The Federal Reserve Act was approved by Congress and signed by President Wilson in December 1913.<sup id="cite_ref-boshistory_4-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-boshistory-4">[4]</a></sup>

## Inflation policy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Inflation policy")\]

In _[The Case Against the Fed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Case_Against_the_Fed "The Case Against the Fed")_, [Murray Rothbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard "Murray Rothbard") argued in 1994 that, although a supposed core function of the Federal Reserve is to maintain a low level of [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation "Inflation"), its policies (like those of other [central banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank "Central bank")) have actually aggravated inflation. This occurs when the Fed creates too much [fiat money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money "Fiat money") backed by nothing. He called the Fed policy of [money creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_creation "Money creation") "legalized [counterfeiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfeiting "Counterfeiting")" and favored a return to the [gold standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard "Gold standard").<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> He wrote:

> \[I\]t is undeniable that, ever since the Fed was visited upon us in 1914, our inflations have been more intense, and our depressions far deeper, than ever before. There is only one way to eliminate chronic inflation, as well as the booms and busts brought by that system of inflationary credit: and that is to eliminate the counterfeiting that constitutes and creates that inflation. And the only way to do that is to abolish legalized counterfeiting: that is, to abolish the Federal Reserve System, and return to the gold standard, to a monetary system where a market-produced metal, such as gold, serves as the standard money, and not paper tickets printed by the Federal Reserve.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

## Effectiveness and policies\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Effectiveness and policies")\]

The Federal Reserve has been criticized as not meeting its goals of greater stability and low inflation.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> This has led to a number of proposed changes including advocacy of different [policy rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy "Monetary policy")<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> or dramatic restructuring of the system itself.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-:2-9">[9]</a></sup>

[Milton Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman "Milton Friedman") concluded that while governments do have a role in the monetary system<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> he was critical of the Federal Reserve due to its poor performance and felt it should be abolished.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Friedman believed that the Federal Reserve System should ultimately be replaced with a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program").<sup id="cite_ref-:2_9-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-:2-9">[9]</a></sup> He favored a system that would automatically buy and sell [securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance) "Security (finance)") in response to changes in the money supply.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> This proposal has become known as [Friedman's k-percent rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedman%27s_k-percent_rule "Friedman's k-percent rule").<sup id="cite_ref-Salter,_A._W._2014_14-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-Salter,_A._W._2014-14">[14]</a></sup>

Others have proposed [NGDP targeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_income_target "Nominal income target") as an alternative rule to guide and improve central bank policy.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> Prominent supporters include [Scott Sumner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Sumner "Scott Sumner"),<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> David Beckworth,<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> and [Tyler Cowen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Cowen "Tyler Cowen").<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>

## Congress\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Congress")\]

Several members of Congress have criticized the Fed. Senator [Robert Owen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Latham_Owen "Robert Latham Owen"), whose name was on the Glass-Owen [Federal Reserve Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Act "Federal Reserve Act"), believed that the Fed was not performing as promised. He said:

> The Federal Reserve Board was created to control, regulate and stabilize credit in the interest of all people. . . . The Federal Reserve Board is the most gigantic financial power in all the world. Instead of using this great power as the Federal Reserve Act intended that it should, the board . . . delegated this power to the banks.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>

Representative [Louis T. McFadden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_T._McFadden "Louis T. McFadden"), Chairman of the [House Committee on Banking and Currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Financial_Services "United States House Committee on Financial Services") from 1920 to 1931, accused the Federal Reserve of deliberately causing the Great Depression. In several speeches made shortly after he lost the chairmanship of the committee, McFadden claimed that the Federal Reserve was run by Wall Street banks and their affiliated European banking houses. In one 1932 House speech (that has been criticized as bluster<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>), he stated:

> Mr. Chairman, we have in this country one of the most corrupt Institutions the world has ever known. I refer to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks; . . . This evil institution has impoverished and ruined the people of the United States . . . through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it.<sup id="cite_ref-Congressional_Record,_June_10,_1932_23-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-Congressional_Record,_June_10,_1932-23">[23]</a></sup>

Many members of Congress who have been involved in the House and [Senate Banking and Currency Committees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Banking,_Housing,_and_Urban_Affairs "United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs") have been open critics of the Federal Reserve, including Chairmen [Wright Patman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_Patman "Wright Patman"),<sup id="cite_ref-times_24-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-times-24">[24]</a></sup> [Henry Reuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Reuss "Henry Reuss"),<sup id="cite_ref-nyt_25-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-nyt-25">[25]</a></sup> and [Henry B. Gonzalez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_B._Gonzalez "Henry B. Gonzalez"). Representative [Ron Paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Paul "Ron Paul"), Chairman of the Monetary Policy Subcommittee in 2011, is known as a staunch opponent of the Federal Reserve System.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> He routinely introduced bills to abolish the Federal Reserve System,<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> three of which gained approval in the House but lost in the Senate.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>

Congressman Paul also introduced H.R. 459: Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2011,<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> This act required an audit of the Federal Reserve Board and the twelve regional banks, with particular attention to the valuation of its securities. His son, Senator [Rand Paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_Paul "Rand Paul"), has introduced similar legislation in subsequent sessions of Congress.<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>

## Great Depression (1929)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Great Depression (1929)")\]

[![CPI 1914-2022](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/CPI_1914-2022.webp/400px-CPI_1914-2022.webp.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CPI_1914-2022.webp)

Money supply decreased significantly between [Black Tuesday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Tuesday "Black Tuesday") and the [Bank Holiday in March 1933](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Banking_Act "Emergency Banking Act") when there were massive [bank runs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_runs "Bank runs") across the United States

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Crowd_outside_nyse.jpg/220px-Crowd_outside_nyse.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Crowd_outside_nyse.jpg)

Crowd gathering on [Wall Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street "Wall Street") after the [1929 crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929 "Wall Street Crash of 1929").

[Milton Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman "Milton Friedman") and [Anna Schwartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Schwartz "Anna Schwartz") stated that the Fed pursued an erroneously restrictive monetary policy, exacerbating the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression"). After the [stock market crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_crash "Stock market crash") in 1929, the Fed continued its contraction (decrease) of the [money supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply "Money supply") and refused to save banks that were struggling with [bank runs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_runs "Bank runs"). This mistake, critics charge, allowed what might have been a relatively mild recession to explode into catastrophe. Friedman and Schwartz believed that the depression was "a tragic testimonial to the importance of monetary forces."<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> Before the establishment of the Federal Reserve, the banking system had dealt with periodic crises (such as in the [Panic of 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1907 "Panic of 1907")) by suspending the convertibility of deposits into currency. In 1907, the system nearly collapsed and there was an extraordinary intervention by an ad-hoc coalition assembled by [J. P. Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Morgan "J. P. Morgan"). In the years 1910–1913, the bankers demanded a central bank to address this structural weakness. Friedman suggested that a similar intervention should have been followed during the banking [panic at the end of 1930](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1930 "Panic of 1930"). This might have stopped the vicious circle of forced liquidation of assets at depressed prices, just as suspension of [convertibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convertibility "Convertibility") in 1893 and 1907 had quickly ended the [liquidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity "Market liquidity") crises at the time.<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup>

Essentially, in the monetarist view, the Great Depression was caused by the fall of the money supply. Friedman and Schwartz note that "\[f\]rom the cyclical peak in August 1929 to a cyclical trough in March 1933, the stock of money fell by over a third."<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> The result was what Friedman calls "The [Great Contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Contraction "Great Contraction")"—a period of falling income, prices, and employment caused by the choking effects of a restricted [money supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply "Money supply"). The mechanism suggested by Friedman and Schwartz was that people wanted to hold more money than the Federal Reserve was supplying. People thus hoarded money by consuming less. This, in turn, caused a contraction in employment and production, since prices were not flexible enough to immediately fall. Friedman and Schwartz argued the Federal Reserve allowed the money supply to plummet because of ineptitude and poor leadership.<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup>

Many have since agreed with this theory, including [Ben Bernanke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Bernanke "Ben Bernanke"), [Chairman of the Federal Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman_of_the_Federal_Reserve "Chairman of the Federal Reserve") from 2006 until 2014, who, in a speech honoring Friedman and Schwartz, said:

> Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve. I would like to say to Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression, you're right. We did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again.<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup>

Friedman has said that ideally he would prefer to "abolish the Federal Reserve and replace it with a computer."<sup id="cite_ref-friedman_38-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-friedman-38">[38]</a></sup> He preferred a system that would increase the money supply at some fixed rate, and he thought that "leaving monetary and banking arrangements to the market would have produced a more satisfactory outcome than was actually achieved through government involvement".<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup>

In contrast to Friedman's argument that the Fed did too little to ease after the crisis, [Murray Rothbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard "Murray Rothbard") argued that the crisis was caused by the Fed being too loose in the 1920s in the book _[America's Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Great_Depression "America's Great Depression")_.

## Global financial crisis (2007–08)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Global financial crisis (2007–08)")\]

Some economists, such as [John B. Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Taylor "John B. Taylor"),<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> have asserted that the Fed was responsible, at least partially, for the [United States housing bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_housing_bubble "United States housing bubble") which occurred prior to the 2007 recession. They claim that the Fed kept interest rates too low following the [2001 recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_2000s_recession "Early 2000s recession").<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> The housing bubble then led to the [credit crunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_crunch "Credit crunch"). Then-Chairman [Alan Greenspan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Greenspan "Alan Greenspan") disputes this interpretation. He points out that the Fed's control over the long-term interest rates (to which critics refer) is only indirect. The Fed did raise the short-term interest rate over which it has control (i.e., the federal funds rate), but the long-term interest rate (which usually follows the former) did not increase.<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup>

The Federal Reserve's role as a supervisor and regulator has been criticized as being ineffective. Former U.S. Senator [Chris Dodd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Dodd "Chris Dodd"), then-chairman of the [United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Banking,_Housing,_and_Urban_Affairs "United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs"), remarked about the Fed's role in the 2007-2008 economic crisis, "We saw over the last number of years when they took on consumer protection responsibilities and the regulation of bank holding companies, it was an abysmal failure."

## Fractional reserve banking\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Fractional reserve banking")\]

The [Federal Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve "Federal Reserve") does not actually control the money supply directly and has [delegated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegated_authority "Delegated authority") this authority to banks. If a bank has a [reserve requirement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_requirement "Reserve requirement") of 10% and they have 10 million dollars in [bank deposits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_deposit "Bank deposit"), they can create 100 million dollars to loan out to borrowers, or make other investments if it is an [investment bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_banking "Investment banking"). It is essentially going on [margin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_(finance) "Margin (finance)") 10:1 without having to pay interest on the margin, because it is in effect money that they created themselves. According to this critique, this is the primary cause of [credit cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_cycle "Credit cycle") or [business cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cycle "Business cycle"), because money supply creation is not under any single entity's control and is [decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized "Decentralized") among many banks that are trying to maximize profits individually.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (November 2022)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The Federal Reserve indirectly controls this process by manipulating the [Federal Funds Rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Funds_Rate "Federal Funds Rate") that sets the tone for interest rates on new debt throughout the economy, and intentionally puts the economy into a [recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession "Recession") (hard landing) or slow the economy without a recession (soft landing) to tame [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation "Inflation").<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup>

## Republican and Tea Party criticism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Republican and Tea Party criticism")\]

During several recent elections, the [Tea Party movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_movement "Tea Party movement") has made the Federal Reserve a major point of attack, which has been picked up by [Republican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States) "Republican Party (United States)") candidates across the country. Former Congressman [Ron Paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Paul "Ron Paul") (R) of Texas and his son Senator [Rand Paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_Paul "Rand Paul") (R) of Kentucky have long attacked the Fed, arguing that it is hurting the economy by devaluing the dollar. They argue that its monetary policies cause booms and busts when the Fed creates too much or too little [fiat money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money "Fiat money"). Ron Paul's book _[End the Fed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_the_Fed "End the Fed")_ repeatedly points out that the Fed engages in [money creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_creation "Money creation") "out of thin air."<sup id="cite_ref-Ron_Paul_2009_45-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-Ron_Paul_2009-45">[45]</a></sup> He argued that interest rates should be set by market forces, not by the Federal Reserve.<sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup> Paul argues that the booms, bubbles and busts of the business cycle are caused by the Federal Reserve's actions.<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup>

In the book Paul argues that "the government and its banking cartel have together stolen $0.95 of every dollar as they have pursued a relentlessly inflationary policy." David Andolfatto of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis said the statement was "just plain false" and "stupid" while noting that legitimate arguments can be made against the Federal Reserve.<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> University of Oregon economist [Mark Thoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Thoma "Mark Thoma") described it as an "absurd" statement which data does not support.<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup>

Surveys of economists show overwhelming opposition to abolishing the Federal Reserve or undermining its independence.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_50-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-:1-50">[50]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:0_51-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-:0-51">[51]</a></sup> According to Princeton University economist Alan S. Blinder, "mountains of empirical evidence support the proposition that greater central bank independence produces not only less inflation but superior macroeconomic performance, e.g., lower and less volatile inflation with no more volatility in output."<sup id="cite_ref-:0_51-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-:0-51">[51]</a></sup>

Ron Paul's criticism has stemmed from the influence of the [Austrian School of Economics.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School "Austrian School")<sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> More specifically, economist [Murray Rothbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard "Murray Rothbard") was a vital figure in developing his views. Rothbard attempted to intertwine both political and economic arguments together in order to make a case to abolish the [Federal Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve "Federal Reserve"). When first laying out his critiques, he writes "The Federal Reserve System is accountable to no one; it has no budget; it is subject to no audit; and no Congressional committee knows of...its operations."<sup id="cite_ref-:3_53-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-:3-53">[53]</a></sup> This argument from Rothbard is outdated, however, as the Federal Reserve presently does report its balance sheet weekly as well as get audited by outside third parties.<sup id="cite_ref-federalreserve.gov_54-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-federalreserve.gov-54">[54]</a></sup>

Rothbard also heavily critiques the Federal Reserve being independent from politics despite the Federal Reserve being given both private and public qualities.<sup id="cite_ref-federalreserve.gov_54-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-federalreserve.gov-54">[54]</a></sup> The acknowledgment of the Federal Reserve being a part of government that exists outside of politics inevitably becomes a "self-perpetuating oligarchy, accountable to no one."<sup id="cite_ref-:3_53-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-:3-53">[53]</a></sup> This ignores the fact that the Federal Reserve Board of Governors is a federal agency, appointed by the president and Senate.

## Money supply should be controlled by Congress\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Money supply should be controlled by Congress")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/CharlesCouglinCraineDetroitPortrait.jpg/220px-CharlesCouglinCraineDetroitPortrait.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CharlesCouglinCraineDetroitPortrait.jpg)

[Father Charles Coughlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_Charles_Coughlin "Father Charles Coughlin")

In the 1930s, American [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church") priest [Charles Coughlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Coughlin "Charles Coughlin") called on [Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_congress "Us congress") to take back control of the [money supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply "Money supply"), as it is given authority under [Article I, Section 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_8:_Powers_of_Congress "Article One of the United States Constitution"), in the [Enumerated Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_of_the_United_States_Congress#Enumerated_powers "Powers of the United States Congress"), to [coin money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Mint "United States Mint") and regulate the value thereof.<sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup>

> "There is written in the Constitution of the United States that Congress has the right to coin, issue, and regulate the value of money."

## Private ownership or control\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Private ownership or control")\]

According to the [Congressional Research Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Research_Service "Congressional Research Service"):

> Because the regional Federal Reserve Banks are privately owned, and most of their directors are chosen by their stockholders, it is common to hear assertions that control of the Fed is in the hands of an elite. In particular, it has been rumored that control is in the hands of a very few people holding "class A stock" in the Fed.
> 
> As explained, there is no stock in the _system_, only in each regional Bank. More important, _individuals do not own stock_ in Federal Reserve Banks. The stock is held only by banks who are members of the system. Each bank holds stock proportionate to its capital. Ownership and membership are synonymous. Moreover, _there is no such thing as "class A" stock_. All stock is the same.
> 
> This stock, furthermore, does not carry with it the normal rights and privileges of ownership. Most significantly, member banks, in voting for the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of which they are a member, do not get voting rights in proportion to the stock they hold. Instead, each member bank regardless of size gets one vote. _Concentration of ownership of Federal Reserve Bank stock, therefore, is irrelevant to the issue of control of the system_ (italics in original).<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup>

According to the web site for the Federal Reserve System, the individual [Federal Reserve Banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank "Federal Reserve Bank") "are the operating arms of the central banking system, and they combine both public and private elements in their makeup and organization."<sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup> Each of the 12 Banks has a nine-member board of directors: three elected by the commercial banks in the Bank's region, and six chosen – three each by the member banks and the Board of Governors – "to represent the public with due consideration to the interests of agriculture, commerce, industry, services, labor and consumers."<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> These regional banks are in turn controlled by the [Federal Reserve Board of Governors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Board_of_Governors "Federal Reserve Board of Governors"), whose seven members are nominated by the [president of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States") and confirmed by the Senate.<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup>

Member banks ("about 38 percent of the nation's more than 8,000 banks")<sup id="cite_ref-factcheck_60-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-factcheck-60">[60]</a></sup> are required to own capital stock in their regional banks.<sup id="cite_ref-factcheck_60-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-factcheck-60">[60]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-61"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup> Until 2016, the regional banks paid a set 6% dividend on the member banks' paid-in capital stock (not the regional banks' profits) each year, returning the rest to the [US Treasury Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Treasury_Department "US Treasury Department").<sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup> As of February 24, 2016, member banks with more than $10 billion in assets receive an annual dividend on their paid-in capital stock (Reserve Bank stock) of the lesser of 6% percent and the highest yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the last auction held prior to the payment of the dividend. Member banks with $10 billion or less in assets continue to be paid a set 6% annual dividend. This change was implemented during the [Obama administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obama_administration "Obama administration") in order "to implement the provisions of section 32203 of the [Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixing_America%27s_Surface_Transportation_Act "Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act") (FAST Act)".<sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup> The Fed has noted that this has created "some confusion about 'ownership'":

> \[Although\] the Reserve Banks issue shares of stock to member banks...owning Reserve Bank stock is quite different from owning stock in a private company. The Reserve Banks are not operated for profit, and ownership of a certain amount of stock is, by law, a condition of membership in the System. The stock may not be sold, traded, or pledged as security for a loan….<sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup>

In his textbook, _Monetary Policy and the Financial System_, Paul M. Horvitz, the former Director of Research for the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation "Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation"), stated,

> ...the member banks can exert some rights of ownership by electing some members of the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank \[applicable to those member banks\]. For all practical purposes, however, member bank ownership of the Federal Reserve System is merely a fiction. The Federal Reserve Banks are not operated for the purpose of earning profits for their stockholders. The Federal Reserve System does earn a profit in the normal course of its operations, but these profits, above the 6% statutory dividend, do not belong to the member banks. All net earnings after expenses and dividends are paid to the Treasury.<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup>

In the _American Political Science Review_, Michael D. Reagan<sup id="cite_ref-66"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> wrote,

> ...the "ownership" of the Reserve Banks by the commercial banks is symbolic; they do not exercise the proprietary control associated with the concept of ownership nor share, beyond the statutory dividend, in Reserve Bank "profits." ...Bank ownership and election at the base are therefore devoid of substantive significance, despite the superficial appearance of private bank control that the formal arrangement creates.<sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-68"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup>

## Transparency issues\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Transparency issues")\]

One critique is that the [Federal Open Market Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee "Federal Open Market Committee"), which is part of the Federal Reserve System, lacks transparency and is not sufficiently audited.<sup id="cite_ref-secrecy_69-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-secrecy-69">[69]</a></sup> A report by [Bloomberg News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News "Bloomberg News") asserts that the majority of Americans believes that the System should be held more accountable or that it should be abolished.<sup id="cite_ref-bloomberg-2010-poll_70-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-bloomberg-2010-poll-70">[70]</a></sup> Another critique is the contention that the public should have a right to know what goes on in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings.<sup id="cite_ref-transparency_71-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-transparency-71">[71]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-transp_greenspan_72-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-transp_greenspan-72">[72]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-transp_ferguson_73-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-transp_ferguson-73">[73]</a></sup>
