				Those loopholes are actually how you get policy. Think child tax credit, savers credit. You are blaming the tool for the bad work rather than the carpenter you hired. Vote in a new carpenter. Problem is most people don't vote and those who do are typically older. Add to that the special interest that have congress by the short-haires. Just go watch subcommittee hearings. It is like an audition for their highest donors and nothing to do with overseeing the agencies.

					Or, how about social policies run through the social agencies and not through the IRS? Tax everyone the same, then give to the people in need.
					
					To ride on the carpenter analogy, the fact you can nail the board in place doesn't mean you shouldn't be using glue instead sometimes...

						What about a solar tax credit? In my state you can only get a federal tax credit of up to 30% so if someone doesn’t have a large tax bill would they even qualify for a credit? Sure you can roll it over to the next year but if you are a household that usually gets money back how would this affect your taxes?

						* 🟫 **[HucHuc](https://www.reddit.com/user/HucHuc)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-04-22 00:33:09)_

							Did I stutter?
							
							The main problem of the tax authorities is to get money into the system by collecting taxes. Handing out childcare money or incentivizing certain types of consumption (i.e. solar panels, electric cars, etc.) should NOT be their problem.
							
							You can always instead have a system where you go to your local municipality and apply for a refund immediately based on program A/B/C.
							
							The whole idea of "how will this affect your taxes" for individuals exists pretty much only in the USA.

						* 🟫 **[slightlythorny](https://www.reddit.com/user/slightlythorny)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-04-21 20:48:24)_

							Not an expert, but If you’re getting a refund that means you paid federal taxes throughout the year. You don’t have to pay federal taxes until April of the next year, so if you adjust your w-4 to deduct zero federal, couldnt the credit go towards that payment?

					* 🟥 **[lifetake](https://www.reddit.com/user/lifetake)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-04-22 00:50:02)_

						So tax the needy more. So that the government can give it back to them, but less because it had to run through a system that costs money? Sounds a bit dumb

					Whoever ascends into office is entrenched with the interests of billionaires.
					
					Often an analysis can arrive so near to recognizing the necessary course, yet also keep from it such an obvious distance.
					
					Meanwhile, a social wage for children would ensure easily, without excessive paperwork or red tape, families being able to afford appropriate care. Wealthy families would return such payments back to the public through their taxes.
					
					Unfortunately, such simple measures are generally blocked from attracting widespread support from among the public, due to the permeation of hyperindividualist dogma, such as in concerns about paying for other people's children, or in encouraging certain people even to have children.

					I do not want social policy hidden in an infinite number of tax exemptions.  I want policy in the open, and in a social policy department, and taxes simple and separate.
					
					You seem to be assuming we don't know why.
					
					We know why.
					
					The how sucks.
					
					Separating the tax code from the social policy improves both, and addresses your other concerns.

				* 🟪 **[bigdon802](https://www.reddit.com/user/bigdon802)** ⬆️ 4 _(2024-04-21 19:26:54)_

					Why have a child tax credit? Give domestic caregivers state funding(funding that applies to social security.) Pay parents to care for their children. It simplifies every aspect of childcare and should appeal to a wide range of interests.

						A) in the 1940s-60s, the US government rolls out a system of tax incentives and favorable loan programs for individual homeownership
						
						B) in the 1940s-60s, the US government rolls out a system of laws and welfare programs that mandate every citizen needs to be housed in some way or another

				* 🟪 **[AlarmedSnek](https://www.reddit.com/user/AlarmedSnek)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-04-22 21:02:00)_

					The loopholes were literally baked into the tax code when it was rolled out, to appease the wealthy donors.  Those donors are what primarily funds the candidates to get elected, which leads to what we have today; a body electorate that only cares about appeasing their donors.   A progressive flat tax would fix that situation.

				* 🟪 **[cpeytonusa](https://www.reddit.com/user/cpeytonusa)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-04-23 16:08:35)_

					Your argument is making his point. None of those tax loopholes is necessary for achieving any of those objectives, they can all be implemented more effectively and efficiently on the spending side. The only problem is that it takes leverage away from Congressional candidates looking to extract campaign contributions.

			There's nothing wrong with the Laffer Curve. It's true that there must be an optimal tax rate that maximizes revenue. It's when people assume that that rate must be lower than the current rate without any reason besides self serving ones that you get into trouble.

			* 🟦 **[nobecauselogic](https://www.reddit.com/user/nobecauselogic)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-04-21 23:31:12)_

				That theoretical maximum is so far away from anything we have ever seen in the US. This paper estimates that maximum in the US to be 24% of GDP. The highest we ever have gotten is 19.8% in 1945. 
				
				https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w17862/revisions/w17862.rev0.pdf
				
				Anyone who brings up the Laffer Curve as an important consideration in US tax policy is either ignorant or intentionally misleading. 

				* 🟪 **[PeaceLoveorKnife](https://www.reddit.com/user/PeaceLoveorKnife)** ⬆️ 6 _(2024-04-22 09:48:15)_

					The whole point of the Laffer curve is that policies rise into effectiveness and decline out of effectiveness, the maximum is not the point of decline or even the point of failure. Mosts systems would fail long before they ever got to the maximum.

			* 🟦 **[lurker_cant_comment](https://www.reddit.com/user/lurker_cant_comment)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-04-22 16:15:32)_

				The Laffer Curve isn't the actual relationship though. Laffer pulled the particular relationship out of his ass and used it to justify dropping tax rates.
				
				It may be true that there is a tax rate that optimizes for maximum revenue. A moving target to be sure, and one that is way higher than anyone who used this graph to justify dropping taxes would ever have considered as viable brackets.

		* 🟧 **[orthros](https://www.reddit.com/user/orthros)** ⬆️ 14 _(2024-04-21 15:13:55)_

			But it's not. The exemptions he's discussing is key.
			
			The proposal floated would have a married couple with two kids who make $55K would owe zero taxes, then a flat 16% on all dollars after $55K
			
			So if they made $70K their tax owed would be ($70K - $55K) x 16% = $2,400 for an effective federal tax rate of just over 3%
			
			No dog in this fight since the proof of concept will depend on the numbers, but the amount spent on H&amp;R Block, CPAs, etc. is just mind-boggling and it's all waste vs a simplified 1 page tax system
			
			Which is why we'll never ever ever get there

				It turns out that it's a great conservative discussion topic, but it isn't based on reality. 
				
				The best experiment of the tax policy of the Laffer Curve was done by Laffer himself as a tax advisor to Kansas governor Brownback between 2012-2017. The lowering of taxes resulted in a stunted economic growth and a large reduction of tax revenue. 
				
				The Laffer Curve should be an signal to laugh at someone when it's brought up.

				* 🟪 **[dagmarski](https://www.reddit.com/user/dagmarski)** ⬆️ 8 _(2024-04-21 14:55:50)_

					The laffer curve is as real as the decrease in incentive to exchange goods at higher taxations. It’s a phenomenon. If you laugh at that it signals you have no clue what you’re talking about.
					
					Kansas cut taxes and increased spending. That ended in disaster because most of those taxes didn’t fall beyond the laffer point, and therefore did decrease government income.
					
					Most people such as Friedman, Hayek etc would argue decreasing spending is the way to go. Ultimately what a government spends is what it needs to raise trough taxation.

						It's just I've never heard of it used as an argument to increase a tax. The peak Laffer efficiency is always lower

				It is complete fiction.  They literally wrote it on a napkin and it has no data to back it up.  Not to mention we have done tons of tax cuts that didn't 'pay for themselves'.  Its a joke.

					Do you know what the Laffer curve is?  It doesn't say that all tax cuts are good.  It just says there's an optimum level of taxation, from which either increasing or decreasing taxation will reduce revenue.

					* 🟥 **[DualActiveBridgeLLC](https://www.reddit.com/user/DualActiveBridgeLLC)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-04-21 21:21:44)_

						The Laffer curve is supposed to be the conservative economic justification for tax cuts.  And yes, equilibrium will be obtained in lots of systems, but the curve isn't based on empirical data.  It's an idea, not something backed by evidence.  Even the shape of being a circle isn't backed by anything.

			That's how every Scandanavian country with free university, healthcare, childcare, paid maternity leave funds their system.

			They're not as good at hiding income. They don't have that many resources for fight when the government tells them to pay more.

		* 🟧 **[JohnBosler](https://www.reddit.com/user/JohnBosler)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-04-21 19:09:06)_

			We have the highest business tax rate in the world. There is 70,000 pages of tax code. Only someone who is wealthy can afford the tax lawyers to get them all the tax breaks available a small business can't take much of any tax breaks. So effectively what happens is the small business pays 40% taxes in a large multinational corporation with all their tax lawyers accountants and lobbyists effectively pay zero.
			
			So by being a good magician and making things appear like the wealthy pay more taxes keeps it to where the average person doesn't revolt at the unfairness that they are unaware of. In reality there's not much more they can do to make this tax system more reggressive I than it already is. They would literally have to start giving wealthy people a paycheck to make the system more regressive.

		* 🟧 **[Chabubu](https://www.reddit.com/user/Chabubu)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-04-21 14:50:46)_

				* 🟪 **[ApatheticAbsurdist](https://www.reddit.com/user/ApatheticAbsurdist)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-04-21 17:56:54)_

					In theory... if they were really talking about a flat tax, capital gains would become income and carried interest would not be a thing. That said... if you sold your house, you'd owe 16% (or whatever the flat income tax is) that same flat tax on how much the value of your house increased over the time you owned it (and would not be able to deduct mortgage interest paid or anything like that).

		* 🟧 **[squidwurrd](https://www.reddit.com/user/squidwurrd)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-04-21 19:35:14)_

			This is an over simplified rebuttal. The idea is you save more money overall for everyone because the tax system is simplified. Meaning everything gets cheaper for the consumer. This in theory will make up for any marginal increase in taxes.
			
			Also the idea that a regressive tax being bad is on its face also thinking of things too simply. If you have more money at the end of the day is that not a better place to be even if you are paying more than rich people? This is letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.

		* 🟧 **[Slowmaha](https://www.reddit.com/user/Slowmaha)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-04-22 08:49:55)_

			How do you mean that a flat (income) tax rate is regressive? I would argue that a flat tax rate and a regressive (or progressive) tax rate are mutually exclusive - by definition, a flat tax rate cannot be regressive or progressive.

		Funny he says that the tax system doesn't generate any equity but in the times of 70% tax rate he's talking about was 1965 to 1981. Before that, the top marginal rate was higher. Weirdly, in the 70's productivity became decoupled from wages and wages started to stagnate.
		
		It would seem this idea of a 15% tax rate would really just hurt the poor and let the rich keep more of their money pushing greater class divide.
		
		This seems like a bunch of hooey from someone that is looking to take a bigger slice of the pie for less work.

People like Milton because his manner of oration is like that of a father to his naive children. One who reductively presents complicated systems with "simple" singular truths.

That is why he had to make it 1:1 with velocity being the magic number.  But it isn't even close with historical data.  That means the relationship is much weaker than 'it is related'.  Like much much weaker.  And sometimes the inflation changes counter to the money supply like during the great recession.
