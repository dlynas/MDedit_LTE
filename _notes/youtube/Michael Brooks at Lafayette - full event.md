Transcript:
(00:02) welcome to the mill series my name is Sayid Melanie and I am the student director of the mill series those of you whose your first time here basically the mill series the student students run slash faculty run series that's organized to sort of create respectful and constructive conversation that would lead to the intellectual development of students at Lafayette professor Van Dyke will do the introduction at this point I'll just let him handle that okay so it's like you guys are like alright so
(00:46) the mill series is delighted to welcome Michael Brooks to Lafayette Michael Brooks is the face that Dave Rubin sees in his nightmares seriously I would highly recommend that you check out his Dave his copious Dave Rubin commentary whether you like Dave Rubin or not that  is hilarious okay anyway so but in all seriousness Michael Brooks is host of the of the very fast-growing Michael Brooks show and he is author of the forthcoming book against the web the cosmopolitan socialist answer to the IDW and the new right he's gonna discuss the
(01:33) book the 2020 Democratic primaries in which he is a passionate supporter of Bernie Sanders consider yourselves lucky you're about to hear some of his most important high-level ideas only those of you who know his show understand okay one quick thing um so so Michael is going to talk for a sort of unspecified amount of time 15 20 30 40 minutes not not positive that's fine and then after that we have four to five students who are gonna ask him some questions about his opinions on various issues and about
(02:05) the 2020 election so without further ado please join me in welcoming Michael Brooks the laughing  it's really good to be here can everybody hear me without a mic yeah all right I've only seen this in the movies but I feel like I'm gonna like lean on the on the board and get the chalk all over my jacket does that actually happen all right so I'm okay so I'll keep these opening remarks pretty relatively brief because I think it's always more interesting and fun if we can actually
(02:43) talk to and engage with each other and unless you're calling in to my show in which case I keep the clothes time so I want to hit on three themes I'll talk a little bit about myself and how I came to be where I am briefly it might be interesting what this book is about how it fits into the larger project and I guess I will make a few minutes case four for the candidate that I strongly prefer in this election cycle so I have a pretty unusual background in some ways which I guess is appropriate for unusual times I my
(03:25) parents were hippies and they left New York when I was very little they were totally broke to be honest and we sort of fled to Massachusetts and the kind of middle of nowhere and I felt like the middle of nowhere it's not actual middle nowhere but that's what I thought as a little kid like why though can I swear and why the  are we leaving New York this is so boring and and they were very influenced by the counterculture and I was home-schooled and it was very a self-directed so I won't get too much into that I think
(04:07) there's advantages and disadvantages to going that route but one advantage I did have was I was able to do a lot of reading and a lot of very self-directed reading in any area that interested me and I happen to be very particularly interested in when I was middle-school teenage age I got very entranced with politics specifically movements in the 60s around civil rights and how they connected to global rights and that led to my interest in international relations Latin America and and so on I ended up going to beit's college and studied
(04:48) international relations and I spent time in the Middle East and studied in Turkey and studied the relationship between the European Union and Turkey and then I worked in brand strategy and taught meditation for a minute try to make my parents happy and and was unemployed because this was after 2008 financial crash and I ended up getting a job as a producer on a show called the majority report which when I started I thought honestly I would do for a year and then I would bag it and go to graduate school and then I started subbing on the show
(05:27) and hosting and I realized this is what I'd like to do I never thought I could do it I never thought there was any path to making a living in media let alone in television hosting I didn't have the resources to go do a bunch of summer internships I didn't even know how one did this you know I'd look at like Chris Matthews on TV and I'd be like where did this come from how does one do this you sit around you know Capitol Hill and beg people for internships and I guess a couple decades later you're literally
(05:57) perched on TV talking nonsense a lot of opinions so I launched my own show a couple of years ago and I focus a lot on International Affairs and I definitely would call myself and am a Democratic Socialist which is you know a trendy term now and we try to actually bridge that with some very very important kind of Marxist frame for understanding the world it's an interesting dynamic because I think these ideas are really important and the moment is super opportune and same time I also like I want us to be what we call sometimes the pre
(06:43) mainstream right like I don't want to be in the margins I want us to win I think we have the best program so I'm not interested in being on the outside protesting that's important but I want us to actually implement and I want us to communicate with this broader variety of people as possible if you do online politics especially a couple of years ago you all of a sudden encountered this group of twerps I guess hey wait there's the civility principle not apply to the speaker I was kidding I love everybody
(07:24) I don't like everybody but I try to love everybody right and they called themselves the intellectual dark web this group of twerps and what I noticed was that one it was a lot of hiding of the ball most of these things were just traditional conservative or and I want to be really clear when I say conservative guys I don't just mean Republican I mean conservative how many people are familiar with the New Republic in the 1990s not today 1990s 1980s New Republic no reason you should be that means you guys are all having great college lives
(08:07) and I encourage that but in the 1990s the New Republic in the new 1980s they used to say it was considered to be somewhat liberal but the the line that they would say was that it was even the New Republic was the joke and that was because they always would find a way to either support Reagan administration foreign policy or demonize african-americans or wage a war on poor people but it was always I mean look we're not one of these conservatives we're not like that we're enlightened liberals here's why we
(08:40) have to do it all the conservatives why and so the IDW struck me as very much in that name and and so I did videos and I debunked and I you know had to listen to Sam Harris kind of drooly talk about Islam and you know and Jordan Peterson has this for a guy who talks a lot about like traditional gender roles and whatnot why does he sound like a 50s housewife evade we're here you know in Brooklyn being like yeah we're socialist to support transgender rights but we're not crying every two seconds so this is a little
(09:24) trying to present what happens on the show so we did that content and and Dave Rubin was I mean come on right it's just I almost feel bad at this point you know he was just this kind of like I don't know how many of you familiar I hope actually how many how do you are generally familiar with these kinds of figures yeah so it's really Italy you're lucky so it's really sort of inundated in this environment and you know Dave would just sort of stand you know just sort of stare blankly into space and you
(10:01) know Sam Harris Sabula quits really you know it's like Nazi Germany because blah blah blah you just think wow like Nazi Germany okay and and then people would come with you and they go these ideas are so important and what's interesting is in the process of writing this book because you have to make it bigger than these people like this particular scene and act of self branding is already almost over and I didn't write the book in time for it to be in the zeitgeist that way but the arguments that they're
(10:35) using this is what you're gonna see from every single right-wing movement in the future or center-right movement in the future that does not explicitly identify as nationalists or all right the arguments that they're making about why capitalism just is that's science why we're not promoting racism or sexism but we are very interested in some extremely antiquated ideas about scientific differences quote-unquote right so what you're seeing in these arguments and I'm just gonna bring in two other things cuz
(11:14) there's a lot to cover here and I can I can kind of get lost in the weeds a basic difference I would say between left and right is the difference between historicizing and naturalizing if you're on the left broadly speaking you look at things and you say what are the historical material reasons why that is happening if you're on the right you say that is what it is now paradoxically this is actually a reason why right now there's a lot of conflict between people who are more socialistic and people who are more like
(11:50) woke quote-unquote because their moral dimension is better look America is a racist society is correct acknowledging that truth versus denying that truth is a major difference no question however if you read Adolf Reid who's one of my intellectual heroes I really hope everybody is reading him he will tell you why racism and white supremacy is a multi-generational project in America that depends on economic conditions that manifests in different geographies that is inseparable for how we produce and do capitalism and actually it might become
(12:33) separable right where is some people who have awoke discourse it just is it's the religious foundation of America there's no difference between any different historical periods it's just this moral black statement does that make sense so some of these critiques can get really subtle and that's actually what started to occur to me with the ID W in dealing with the right because these guys work exploiting a lot of weaknesses they were coming in and they were seeing people you know look if your pop culture diet and you and and
(13:11) let's say you're an alienated young man which is the primary audience for these guys that's just market demographic like not a moral statement I did some brand work this is just like you're looking at year you're looking at your demos you're alienated you don't feel powerful you probably have a lot of actually very valid complaints in your life you flip open say some you know mediocre bougie web site that you think is the left and what do you have Seinfeld's actually problematic and you
(13:45) suck and shut the  up and this is a problem and that's a problem and this is this and that and then Jordan Peterson comes along goes no actually you're great and you should have a government-provided wife to massage you now and you didn't have people coming and saying why why do you feel that you do right so because even even in terms of relative privilege becomes in macro questions like in your personal behavior yes it's relevant if you're walking around thinking the most victimized
(14:18) person in the world and you're not it's obnoxious and it's problematic sure but in the big picture nobody outside of an incredible my new fraction of the population is doing better right now yes you can talk about aggregate numbers and people have more washing machines and cell phones and blah blah blah I know all of that so please do save those questions and comments let's let's go more interesting but inequality is rising alienation from the work you do is rising your ability to govern your own life is decreasing
(14:50) radically and so you had people who were giving reactionary but constructive proactive answers and also empowering people's individual agency which is funny as a socialist I think it's super important we need a socialism that also has room for people's personal aspirations and ambitions and sense of making room for themselves in the world we cannot make that wrong and in fact the only people that I really see making that wrong are usually very upper middle class bougie people and I don't make
(15:25) that as like a moral comment I'm talking like literally that's their position they don't have to do that yeah I could tell you as someone and I don't you know I don't want to melodrama my own experience but it's like you know I know what it's like to be pretty broke at times and have like the heat turned off or whatever so you understand why you might want to read some type of Horatio Alger narrative right so the IDW had answers and the Wright had answers and the left had a lot of the
(15:52) quote-unquote left had a lot of moralism and condemnation and not even that much nutrition I think that is why among many other things including the really powerful social movements we have in the world today and the very important ones on race and economic equity and so on this is actually also why Bernie Sanders matters Bernie Sanders is running a campaign that should be really basic and really obvious but it's not because we're not in basic and obvious we are at a level of extreme radical and systemic
(16:32) inequality and that's also where we are in terms of our phase of capitalism like yeah with a more liberal approach you could juice it a little bit you can in fact you could do a lot of what he's talking about you can D commodify health care you can make it a public good you can say that the concentration of wealth cannot be this exactly extreme and ludicrous but in the big picture the room for new markets is shrinking I mean take away the morals of it when we were going through the Industrial Revolution
(17:07) or the consumer goods revolution someone came along said hey can you give me an investment because I want you know all of a sudden America is gonna have a middle class which was absolutely generated by government spending let's be real you know in the post-world War two and I want you know but I want to sell people dishwashers can I have some capital for it okay and then millions of people buy dishwashers what phase of capitalism we're in now we work was mark market value Softbank put millions of dollars into a it's like a place where
(17:39) you commune and that's partially because really there is a shrinking amount of untapped like primitive accumulation right so what you have in Bernie Sanders is someone who has an inkling of a recognition of that and he by going out and talking about your student loans and how you're objectively materially  is doing more to Deer Attica lies people in that discourse about online than almost anybody else anybody else in the modern scene I also think foreign policy is really important and in him I see the
(18:19) only candidate who's willing to speak somewhat clearly about the Middle East some are clearly about India he called for freeing president Lula who people should really look up he was an extraordinary president who led Brazil lifted 40 million people out of poverty and he almost certainly would have been reelected president in 2018 if there was not an illegitimate process that put him in jail he was recently freed because the prosecutorial team was humiliated I'm always happy to talk about that so and I had the honor of interviewing him
(18:52) recently in San Paolo so that's it guys I'm ready to talk I just wanted to give you a little bit of sense of where I was coming from yeah thanks for having me thanks for having me where do you feel you'd end up if you had have been dropped into your situation say today like if because I think you know a lot of people particularly like these alienated young men YouTube is kind of your University it's where do you find your way so I would still be cool yeah no no that's a really good question and I and I think
(19:32) there's a huge amount of value like we need to compete in that terrain and so I do it like shows like mine are actually important in that and you know your professor will like that I say this and I don't know like whatever we'll see but I'm really glad that I spent hours reading books instead of watching YouTube commentary like and that's not because I'm you know that's just cuz that was what the environment was right so that's better I think it's fading for a variety of reasons I mean one it's being answered
(20:10) it's also super repetitious these guys have this same but I mean I all of them right like it's funny because like the guy who's most associated with them who's got serious popularity is Joe Rogan and Joe Rogan does a lot of different things on a show the branded products inside that space it's like okay because we can't say anything anymore and that's the thing and then this is bad because we can't say anything and the left won't let you say anything isn't this amazing that we're
(20:42) saying things to each other you know it's it's it's pretty dead it's it's flat I think the weaknesses they exploited in the left are still there which is part of what I'm concerned about answering because I think these things will be more than get rebranded in more interesting ways so I was curious um I'm just watching an episode of yours earlier today and something that kind of came up for me was big man thank you thank you and something that came up for me was a big tech in particular
(21:11) especially with this election cycle and how social media plays such an integral role to information being spread during elections and you would raised issue with Elizabeth Warren's plan to try to regulate social media where you said that if she's trying to prosecute those that are believed to be spreading misinformation that it could open the sort of Pandora's box for regulating this type of material and so I was wondering what you think the the role of the federal government should be in trying to regulate this
(21:43) misinformation and it's just as an example as well if you think that companies should follow the example of for instance Twitter which decided to simply just do a blanket ban of all political advertisements so ok I'll work I'll go in the flow you ask that's a really good question so and this is the this isn't a direct answer but this is I feel like my work so what I was trying to do in that segment 2 is 2 again historicized this I see people on social media and on television let me make it really
(22:20) specific have you guys ever heard of and I doubt you have ever heard of a guy named Joe Lockhart ok he's a CNN pundit he was Bill Clinton's press secretary he co-founded a firm called Glover Park group now Glover Park Group is a major major political consulting firm they've done work for Verizon for the Saudi royal family for films that you've seen for camp astroturf campaigns to try to convince people to cut Medicare and Social Security there's a lot of firms like this Dewey Square group is a firm
(22:52) like this there's and so you have people and I'm not even talking morally although you could make a moral objection but they have set the whole stage for what we call fake news they have set the whole stage for what people don't believe information they have manipulated science they have generated campaigns like Dewey Square group it was reported was a masters of and this is like they were very big in the 90s so this is even he harder to track without the Internet they were supposedly masters of hiring people who had
(23:29) community and this is very Mike blue berg territory i think that your professor is i i'm said i'm in a school board and I think that he's a community activist who's concerned about kids in the community and improving their outcomes because I know of his work I've decided we as a district or a state more likely should ban soft drinks in the schools because they're terrible for kids health and all of a sudden he comes in and is like no it's actually a really bad idea and it affects these different
(23:59) student outcomes and I'm like what sounds bizarre but I think this person is credible he's working for Dewey Square group right that's the type of thing that they did okay so in the last couple of years you have people who have wanted to reduce the result of the 2016 election to fake news or memes or whatever nonsense there's major major historical and macroeconomic trends behind that and if you want to have a conversation of fake news and propaganda and misinformation this is not a plot in Russia that was hatched the modern PR
(24:33) industry goes back to I I guess the 30s or the 20s with Edward Bernays and is a global product that has affected how we campaign how kids get exposed to different foods and so on so I have a problem philosophically out of the gate with this kind of liberal control freaky like well there are things that are wrong and we're kind of told them that they're right and partially because I disagree with it also because it's a  loser you know like great yeah go up against Donald Trump to tell him that his facts
(25:07) are wrong good luck you know I mean so when I see a kind of like when I see that approach to a problem I just I have a huge allergy to it now specifically one of the things that I saw that she said was that she would make it illegal as an example to post fake voting information now I I in that totally specific instance I agree I don't think that that's a so that that has been happening for decades people have put Flyers on the on the Billboard right don't forget to vote on Saturday like that should be
(25:45) part of a proposal on voting rights and protecting the ballot in an era of massive voter suppression now to me I think things like Google and Twitter and so on meets become publicly absorbed utilities and that will mean that the First Amendment will protect them and you're gonna have to deal with it but I'm also confident that if we actually deal with material concentrations of wealth behind propaganda efforts and we have a bit more of an equitable playing field that I actually trust people's intelligence
(26:22) and capacity to figure things out on their own so I hope that answers some of it yeah of course yeah okay so now we transition to the question is Bernie electable your one-word answer is yes correct yeah so where's Dan the hammer Markovitz Dan what I just made it yeah but but his answer is No Oh Dan while you talk I'm gonna Pat this dog okay that's a fair trade I understand you're a big supporter of Bernie said I am but you're also someone who's talked a lot about how awful krump is you compared him to
(27:11) felt like half dozen populist right-wingers who are eroding democracy I think you recognize that him winning another term would be pretty catastrophic Lee bad and so Magga what I'm actually a big Trump supporter I'm not we are I think you might be acting as one that's the question that was that was a very you're watching too many CNN segment sir it's that type of well absolutely humor that's what's gonna lose Trump by the way but y'all don't like that my first question I guess is
(27:43) can you just give like a one-minute why Bernie can win the general pitch well I mean I don't know what so in a minute all gets you to why anybody beating Trump is actually gonna be extremely hard and we need to be real about it but the why Bernie specifically why Bernie more than someone else well he pulls the best against Trump which we have according to every single poll that we've ever seen he does the best in the specific segment of states that you need to win in order to beat Trump we also see that from the
(28:21) polls he has a higher personal approval rating than any other candidate he has a Nevada really underlines he's crushing it with the Hispanic population which is the way you open up the Sunbelt to win and also because there's absolutely zero proof of concept in anybody else and this is the really critical point a vague atmosphere so some people say it'll be no problem Bernie will be nominated everybody will love him we'll win we'll win we'll win nonsense it's gonna be incredibly hard however every
(29:03) time I talk to somebody like you I say okay great where's Obama where's Bill Clinton you are comparing him to candidates who are losing right now who have terrible head-to-head matchups with Donald Trump who have so many vulnerabilities in terms of like I would be salivating to be able to run if I was Donald Trump's campaign manager the idea of being able to run against a border can I just be blunt a borderline senile person but I can attack from the right on civil rights a charisma free oligarch
(29:44) who wants to take away your soda and your guns and cut Social Security and we don't do this in the Democratic primary because it's very mean or whatever he is going to dime off of the Native American thing with mid Elizabeth Warren the whole time and you might not like it but in terms of reality and if you talk to any who is not part of some little liberal bubble the only thing they are aware of her is that that is off-putting so here's the here I feel like Warren now here's the thing so here's the thing
(30:19) Donald Trump has a forty nine percent approval rating right now the Democratic Party has done a terrible job of going on offense against him and the economy is doing well there's gonna be unlimited amount of money against him and anybody going up against him is gonna have a hard time I would go with the person who has an actual base who has actual fundraising who has actual coalition who has actual approval ratings and who pulls the best against him and if all you have in response is a generic fear about socialism as a word look at the
(30:54) data for progress numbers which are terrifying even for me because I do think it's important we beat Trump those numbers were fascinating generic person against Trump fill in the blank whatever somebody against Trump beats Trump I forget the specific numbers the Democrat against Trump shrunk a socialist against Trump a bigger margin than the Democrats because if there's one brand in modern America people hate more than this word socialist it's the Democratic Party so there's no I I'm not I mean this is just
(31:30) reality so if there was one person as an example I would still be look Bernie can win and there's no reason other than just dogma and repetitions it's just he can't but but people would be in a much stronger position if one of these other candidates like they all all these other candidates who say people say well I think if Warren had this opportunity she would X I think if people listen to Pete no Pete is a Miracle Whip candidate that's it done so if there was one candidate that you had if Joe Biden of
(32:07) 2016 you have a case right there Bernie would absolutely be Trump it could happen but you would have a candidate who had enough functioning happening and had a certain popularity amongst bases and can handle himself at times he might be able to beat Donald Trump that doesn't exist in the primary so you're asking me to go into a hypothetical universe about what might happen with the candidate who has by far the strongest campaign to take a gamble on people that I know are gonna lose and in fact if I was super narcissistic and
(32:46) being makaveli in I would say go ahead steal it from Bernie lose and I'll be even more vindicated in four years of my argument because none of these other people and I did not think that a year ago I thought there were a couple of candidates that had paths to beat Trump today none and if you think Mike Bloomberg can be Trump you need serious treatment you know if you think Peabody judge would lose in any I mean you're starting to talk about candidates who would lose by margins to trump that are the closest mathematically we could get
(33:19) to losing in a polarized country so you know yes he can win is it gonna be difficult yes is there anybody who you could say with a straight face has a better position to do it than him no the first thing you talked about the polling first of all national polling this far out is completely useless it's like throwing darts it's so is your hypothetical life about what might or might not happen because no no I've got to be really clear about this okay sure yeah but okay so though is your potential concerns in
(33:51) their head so so I think this far out the polling the country of continent of Europe is falling on someone but the the polling is pretty non predictive and I think your point is right that there's not really another great alternatives but let's take half senile Joe Biden right who's maybe a few years past his prime in national polling he still does about as well as Bernie in there was a recent study by researchers I believe it Yale and Stanford they serve at 40,000 people they found there's a solid two
(34:18) percent of people who would otherwise vote for any other Democratic candidate who would flip to Crump if it was against Bernie Sanders or against Elizabeth Warren and they found that Bernie would make up for this with according to the polls on President did you turn out that has shown really no sign of materializing you mentioned the mobilization of Latinos in Nevada Bernie certainly doing really well in the primary he's got an impressive organization there's very few new voters right in in New Hampshire the person who
(34:44) turned out new voters was and this surprises me as much as anyone Pete bootie Jegs but I can surprise them the boss a suburb Boston suburb vote nope open primary there's plenty of younger people in New Hampshire there's plenty of no actually not anyway there are young people everywhere they didn't vote in shocking numbers so look oh sorry well do you want to finish all your new yeah sure I'll finish for five more seconds but so throughout these three states Bernie's done pretty well he's won plurality winning he's won all
(35:15) three let's just be really clear yeah he's won all three states has won all three state I was referred I do not agree with the boutique edge campaign yes but the point is there's really no evidence he's turning out new voters he's mobilizing his 2016 coalition incredibly effective but especially okay well no no I mean know that the numbers no you're you're right about increased turnout and that's one of the reasons that I said it's we need to be real about the challenge yeah you're wrong
(35:40) about the coalition the makeup of his vote is radically more diverse than it was in 2006 but in line out that's because he's white all has fallen further in all senses his vote in and it was amazing because I and so forgive me for taking some of my frustration with people who do this professionally that I deal with out on you before Iowa and New Hampshire when it was clear who's gonna win it's like well is the same white vote that we always see I said actually he'll underperform there he's gonna
(36:10) crush everybody in Nevada well then he crushes everybody in Nevada well where's the white folk going I mean look here's my point to you I think several years ago with Joe Biden my argument would have to stop at well you're citing polls too so polls are either and player they're not in play if you want to cite a poll that I'm gonna cite all the polls that support my case which are like 10 to 1 against your pulse but in terms in terms of you you that's where we're at so but that being said
(36:44) this argument would be a draw four years ago cuz I would just be saying with you yes I think Bernie can win and yes I think Biden can win and here's why I think Bernie actually I think there there's landmines with Biden which I'll get to in a second but I think they both can win so let's pick a good president that would be the argument in today's world I'm telling you and and I and actually and you can I hope I don't know specifically where a reference to you but I was somebody definitely
(37:13) particularly my circles who was much more like you guys don't get it I get you all hate Biden but this person is formidable as hell watching this go on for a year and seeing how Donald Trump operates you're gonna put somebody against him who and I again I don't care I don't have any moral judgments Ukraine trade deals bankruptcy bill and if you look at Trump they're brilliantly running ads on criminal justice if they take two percent of african-american voters done so if you want a guy who cannot even
(37:53) make it through a whole debate without like having a tantrum or getting exhausted who's got landmines that can be attacked from the right and left throughout his whole career and a symbolic campaign that resembles like elder abuse at this point I mean I know seriously I actually think it's terrible I don't enjoy watching it you know I mean we used to joke we said yeah if it's Trump and Biden they'll do the debate and the questions will be at the bottom of jell-o cups and it will be at 12 o'clock in the afternoon but so my
(38:25) point is is that yes there's risks with all of them but don't get to in your head deal with what's actually happening what's happening is that one person is winning one person has a coalition one person has millions of people that will do anything to get them elected the other person has an extraordinarily pot of extraordinarily problematic record maybe it'll change on Saturday but it's never even won a primary and three attempts at running for president and mainly has residual popularity because
(38:56) of being Obama's vice president and that couldn't carry through Hillary Clinton he's a better politician than Hillary Clinton but he's also not a historical first like she is and they both have exactly the same problem sets for a now not gameshow  but incumbent president so if Biden is nominated we lose all right so yeah the final part of this is and I take your point Biden is a little past his prime shall we say but the question I want to ask is you talk about you talk I want to be not like that when
(39:28) I'm past my prime you talk about socialism and without getting into the merits of anything here you're really excited about Bernie Sanders a lot of people on this side of the political spectrum are because he's breaking barriers right he's introducing in an ideology that was sort of banished from American politics but in polls most Americans say they won't vote for socialists the vast majority of Americans okay so what we doing polls are not doing pulse I think we're doing polls that are so doing well that help
(39:56) with you I think we're doing polls that have such overwhelming they're not gonna keep doing it again it's no we're gonna do polls yeah Bernie wins winning heads so that's it and also and also socialism is changing radically in polls and that certainly not even just under 35 even in the 40s changing significantly and if you look at um just even today John Zink a congresswoman Dingell from Michigan she came out she's like people need to calm down this is what my grandfather was trying to do I believe when he was
(40:29) in Congress this is obvious is gonna do well in Michigan so I think what you're finding is that yes for some people it'll be a triggering word but frankly for a lot of people Democrat is a triggering word but you're just watching like I would I would implore you to not just sit with steady cliches because it's a fluid and dynamic situation if we want to use numbers there on the Bernie side if you want to look at it in terms of the historical barrier there is to overcome it's a historical barrier
(41:07) that's worth overcoming and it's a better bet then fatally flawed candidates who we know will lose and depress turnout so that's all I got all right well one last thing Oh the second the second half of the socialism question is and I think this is changing because people might have noticed the global economy's teetering people are getting sick all over the world but I I think my argument isn't really the Bernese unelectable it's that he's the candidate who's most dependent on some sort of economic disaster
(41:36) happening because a big part of his argument is that you talk about these like economically populist slightly socially conservative voters and those are most voters yes and no like obviously he's gonna bring them home right bring them back to the Democratic Party he needs to bring about 80,000 I just want to be really skeptic I'm not trying this people get mad at me but I got to be really specific 80,000 votes distributed across Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin wins the election a lot of them right here
(42:04) right but I mean that assumes also he doesn't lose any other voters all right Chester but yeah II got this supper of the ready city okay but so I potentially the economy is gonna collapse and I think Bernie might be the best candidate then but people despite all the horrible things that are happening there are too many people in poverty there are too many people who don't have access to health care the inequality is disgraceful but in polls and again there's a difference between a poll that shows
(42:32) Bernie winning by two more points than someone else and a poll that says the overwhelming majority of Americans at least as of last week all right yeah wait make the rest of your point but are we are we not doing polls we're doing polls that are so far outside a changeable margin that they are beyond dispute there's a real difference between Bernie winning by Perry we were one with the by far most popular personal approval rating of it but that's simply it's a three-point difference no that's actually no I'm
(42:59) talking on personal approval in personal approval rank not true as a senator in his home state as a national political figure is about rating them yes okay what's your point so you mean he needs an economic clap because as you think most people actually feel okay about the economy I think the state of the economy is disgraceful so the question is can you convince people that here's what I'd say that here's what I'd say yeah it's a it's two parts I would say that we know and Trump in
(43:30) fact sadly showed us that a good half of the population probably more they don't care what the numbers are they really are in disgraceful situations and that is really true and and honestly like that that should not be like a point in our little debate like that's the truth and it's really bad for and it's structurally bad because unless there's serious structural interventions in the economy people will be driving ubers and not have any pensions and I mean life expectancy is decreasing the United
(44:04) States it's the Europeans are like it's very bad and people live that and experience that so I do think speaking clearly to those conditions is not only the right thing I think it's profoundly helpful and I think that you know again Hillary Clinton it's already great disaster right now on the other hand I think to the extent again and I'm not you know trying to do like you know have my cake and eat it too here but it's like yeah he's an incumbent president with good economic numbers right but you
(44:38) cannot convince me in fact I would argue that's another argument for Bernie because if we're just doing a conventional race then great there's an incumbent president with good economic numbers because what you also have to recognize and I wish this wasn't true a lot of Americans don't have the same type of melodramatic response to Trump that we do partially because I think the media has done a disgraceful job of not highlighting things like the concentration camps at the border enough which really are absolute and obscenity
(45:10) and and reflect a broader threat to all of us but and most other things people don't care you know what they're like me I think as Twitter's awesome I think it's hilarious I don't care that he doesn't do this in that I don't care you there's no normal American who's just like I'm your boy you thought he sought out the NATO meeting they don't care and in fact at this point what's very disturbing to me is that after all these years of hyperventilating and melodrama
(45:36) and freak out and no strategic threat it hits on him in Russia yada-yada-yada he's at a forty nine percent approval rating with a high economic numbers so once again picks somebody who can actually fight on different terrain by the way terrain he knows how to talk about none of these other candidates have demonstrated an ability to do that like at all to the point where I'm scared I wish to be really one I wish there was a backup this is another trash centrist but maybe they can win option I don't want
(46:12) everything to be riding on me and my candidate but it is sadly but also potentially optimistically we can definitely win this Jacob I think you're less bearish than Dan on on Bernie's general election prospects but you have an interesting concern about Bernie being atop the ticket is that correct I don't think being Jewish will be such a bad thing I'm also doubtful about that but I would just like to note that you know of the post of the polls you're sitting in bow round states multiple candidates defeat
(46:49) Trump head-to-head Joe Biden defeats Trump's head-to-head in in those polls as Elizabeth Warren no Elizabeth Warren is much more MIT it's slimmer Swimmer margins but it's women margins but that still does happen so to have somebody that has been already in the public eye and already won those states the last time around we were taking on Hillary Clinton to still be posting those kind of numbers is much more reassuring than somebody who either is residually popular who's performing horrifyingly
(47:21) like Joe Biden or someone like Warren who again can we be real the places that people know her most how is she doing this is a lot of there's a lot of negative branding you can do against no but I've know but I'm asking you just even so far I know it's a different electorate but the people who know her the best so far how is she doing is she winning like how did she do in New Hampshire she's obviously so like again let's please tell me the Bernie fears but let's not you know cuz god yeah
(47:51) I think it's terrifying all like okay Elizabeth Warren she's gonna what we know look at the way she's campaigning with Bernie she can't handle you know people on Twitter about Bernie what are you gonna tell Trump to take an emotional intelligence course before they campaign not gonna work the point the point I'm trying to get across is that I do believe there are a number of candidates who can defeat trauma okay I think that you're right he doesn't before nine percent approval rating but
(48:13) with GDP growth this high and unemployment this low yes his approval rating should be way higher should be it should be way higher than 49% and I actually believe that Bernie does have the path to on from 70 walk tutorial votes I think you get the Rust Belt sure but I understand there are concerns for example you could lose certain states like Virginia and North Carolina it's actually doing really well in Virginia well electorate knows floor no no nationally too he'll lose Florida but I think frankly all of them I think
(48:43) Florida's I'm skeptical of Florida as a contested place but III agree and I also think that he puts Ohio into play oh because because due to the popularity of sherrod Brown so III do think that there's a path to 270 with Bernie having said that my concern is retaking the legislature because Bernie Sanders won't be able to accomplish anything if we lose the house as many moderate House members in the suburbs I used to live in Orange County California we flipped all seven of those seats from Republican to
(49:15) Democrat right I find it doubtful that we'd be able to keep those seats with Bernie Sanders at the top of the ticket and also I will also be we have a chance to retake the Senate I think it'll be way harder for Mark Kelly in Arizona to win when he's running under the ticket at Bernie's I don't agree with that one but I'll answer I actually think like if Mike Bloomberg was not full of  he would spend 30 million dollars in register every single Hispanic voter in Arizona and have a
(49:42) voting rights plan in place and Bernie Sanders would win Arizona so I don't buy that I don't buy that at all but as far as the House races go I'll give you the provocative things second the more conventional political thing is ticket splitting still exists and I can very easily see a bunch of suburban media we're candidates saying like you know I'm gonna be here you know you don't want Trump but I'll you know I'm gonna be your check on Bernie Sanders in the house they can run against him they can
(50:15) micro target their platforms they'll have plenty of money to do it it'll annoy me I think it will reflect the reality the Democratic Party is not one party it's multiple contesting factions but I think people can actually hang on especially if you know look if he wins that's generally good for other people on the ticket right but I do think that there are folks that will be able to hang on to some seats with that approach now that being said more broadly well two more things one the most power the
(50:49) president has we need to change this is in the executive branch and particularly with regards to foreign policy which is another reason why Bernie's in a league of his own and why I'm so serious about this campaign so what he will do though with immigration other areas on executive orders is not dependent on Congress and that's you know that's true of all of them but it's not dependent on Congress as far as getting anything done none of them are gonna be able to get anything done this is another area where
(51:15) to me it always has struck me like bernie is doing like this moonshot strategy like i'm gonna become president and i'm gonna mobilize popular will i think bernie should actually if the coronavirus becomes a thing i think he should declare martial law for single-payer and then pull it back and then in five months be like okay it's lifted do you really want to take away everybody's health care and there would be riots that they try to I'm only half joking I think we need a more Republican mindset though they understand power but
(51:45) the on a legislative level you sit there and you say oh this ridiculous like you're gonna fly around the country and mobilize people what like okay whatever okay sure okay whatever and what are the alternatives that somebody like a if Biden or Bloomberg or President they'll go we're bringing the country together Mitch McConnell said it was wrong to call children  and we all can agree to not be mean like mr.
(52:15) Trump and we're coming together and he's not gonna you know he's not going to say these horrible things on social media and we have a new Blue Ribbon Commission to cut cut Social Security and that's gonna be our big bipartisan push Biden and Bloomberg are both consistently on public record to want to cut these things then you have and coal Bashar is in that same and Budaj edge like nothing will happen you just won't have Trump be President and there will be occasional horrible bipartisan deals and even their health
(52:44) care plans you have to realize that they're not single-payer but an actual public option by the way Pete's public option actually increases the individual mandate so that's not gonna be popular when that's road-tested but any of those scenarios a public option is still objected to by the health insurance industry and it will not pass Congress so and then Warren is the worst of both worlds because Warren on her policy level actually pushes some things further but has no strategy for actually getting them done because Congress has
(53:17) not regulated Wall Street or Amazon because there hasn't been smart blog posts written about them right it's not regulated because they control the legislative process so what Bernie's saying might absolutely not work but it's actually like the only thing at public disposal if you want anything like this to happen nothing is gonna happen because somebody woke up and was like you know what I've been in Congress for a couple years all my donors are from certain industries but I don't think that that's really right I
(53:46) read a New York Times column let's pass something this isn't the West Wing it's not how the world works so you know and then the last thing really quick I I look I'm I'm into primary people and ultimately if we could reconfigure the Democratic Party I I would be very comfortable with as an example not on substantive issues substantive issues of people's substantive rights are never compromisable but if there was a candidate I would I just his Chuck Schumer was like every working-class person we pick up some of
(54:20) the suburbs every Goldman Sachs senator that puts out a woke tweet on Pride Day I will trade for a pro Civil Rights anti-wall Street senator who's like I own a gun I'll trade him happily so this is also a bigger contest about the nature of the party and I don't want ultimately the Democratic Party I don't think will become a socialist one but I think it can become a serious labor populace one I don't want a party built and configured around upper-middle-class attitude and social belief boating is not a majority it's
(54:57) not durable and it's not producing outcomes for working people Bernie Sanders becoming president is absolutely more important than a couple of you know former CIA agents representing the Democrats in the house and handing the gavel to Nancy Pelosi yes absolutely you're talking about keeping Mitch McConnell in power you're talking about making Kevin McCarthy the Speaker of the House oh yeah this is well that's again okay this is where these things get frustrating that's not what I'm talking
(55:28) about I've actually explained a lot but you know look if you're gonna let's be let's do more what I'm actually saying which is that if you want to force I I could just be like I'm not gonna answer that question because I think Bernie will make everybody win you're forcing me into a binary of do I think it's more important that a actual progressive force for the whole for all of global politics occupy the most powerful position on earth versus a couple point margin in a lower house of government
(55:57) that he will definitionally override yes I think that's more important yes so Marco you take the position that if Sanders is president he actually won't advance the progressive agenda to the same degree that other more moderate Democratic candidates were I think that's your position yes yes till everyone prefers point here that not that I doubt Sanders is a deal for press of causes simply that I doubt that he has the ideological flexibility to compromise to advance legislation where it'd be possible even if the Democrats
(56:40) can retake the Senate or retake the house I doubt that it would be by very sufficient margin margin that the Democrats could pass for they want and so to advance meaningful legislation we have to compromise but the Republicans in one manner or another thinking of meaningful legislation and what do you actually think what let's take just take health care because now you're talking about Republicans I totally agree with you that he's gonna deal with Democrats and whatever look if you look at his actual career one of his
(57:09) major legislative accomplishments is a veteran's right bill that he wrote with John McCain so funny I mean sometimes with people who are like really hyped about him on my side you kind of actually are quietly like you know that Bernie Sanders is not really like a sandanista right like he's pretty a very effective legislator and mayor so and read matthew Yglesias is peace in box which is not exactly my idea logical home and it's you know it's called like Bernie Sanders is actually a very conventional politician and talks about
(57:41) his deal-making and so on but if I was gonna take from you some type of commitment to a real progressive issue like giving everybody healthcare I just return you again to first of all I think we all know the very basic idea that you get to the best place you want you know if you ask him for an extension do you ask him for one day or a week hopefully you meet in the middle if you go in and say can I have a day you know even if he says yes you're not gonna be where you want so I would just say that with regards to something like that we got to
(58:16) get back to the two things I outlined before which is that one you always start from an aggressive strong clear position and you mobilize people that's just power that's how politics works and Republicans understand that better and then the second thing if you are actually talking about advancing legislation that implicates corporate America it doesn't matter whether it's a small soft reform it will be fun but Obamacare specifically brought Pharma and health care in as stakeholders it does nothing but good for them it forces
(58:50) millions of people into a marketplace and government subsidizes people buying that product that still was almost killed there's ideological and political reasons behind so if you come in and you say like hey you know what I'm not Bernie I'm gonna be reasonable and here's my Jill Biden public option plan well we're just back to 2008 it'll get killed and it will be even worse because people won't mobilize and do anything for it so we will have dead legislation except for teaming up to do
(59:20) things like cut Medicare and Social Security and just as J is you about the like you have any legislation being passed from the Democratic side from any of the candidates however I think that Bernie has made his career off of ideological purity and I know that's wrong really the math USP I see any case that it can determine not just on health care not just on purpose - Nicole's but in any sort of legislation to come to the middle to compromise if need be to basically say yeah so you know and I try and also I would say the other thing too
(59:53) is that he can do a huge amount which i think is a broader structural problem but a lot he can do on an executive branch level but the idea that Bernie's gonna sit I mean you got to read about the guy's career like there is a reason that a 79 year old Jewish man who's a socialist is a main presidential contender that's not because he sat in a co-op in Vermont just like a goal come on let's be real you got a read up on it because I don't know I mean do you have than anything else you want to ask though because that
(1:00:22) one's just you know we're not we're at loggerheads yes agree the glacis right and I just look at 20 20 18 the Democrats one husband is decisive margin I think what there's a probably agreement in that iowa's that was based on defending the herbal Care Act which enjoys great support it was such an essential winning issue for the Democrats that by moving to a far more divisive not as popular bipartisan plan as Medicare for all compared to simply defending the Affordable Care Act would be too risky there's all right yes mmm
(1:01:04) this is hard they feel like a broken record but again there is no bipartisan health care plan if Obamacare was passed by with the votes of three Republicans one of whom became the Democrat one of whom is retired one of whom is Susan Collins so that so it's not that's that's false that in the Senate that's the vote totals that's why it was passed to reconciliation so there isn't a bipartisan health care bill and the ACA was in fact for years extremely unpopular it became popular when and
(1:01:40) this is look this is a very easy issue and it's not a presidential campaign issue it's very much a midterm thing because you're not running on an affirmative agenda Bernie Sanders was one of the main people in 2017 who defended Obamacare because the argument wasn't about the whole structure of the bill the argument was ironically you're going to well partially the patient protections which are really important but also you're going to get rid of the Medicaid expansion which is what it's
(1:02:09) kind of government health care right you're gonna kick tens of millions of people out of your health care so yeah that's super easy that's a that's an that's a very effective midterm women no one made the case more across the country than Bernie Sanders in a presidential election it's still more you know it's much more effective and much more strategic to actually have a position yourself I think standing up there on stage and saying you know I'm gonna defend Obamacare it's so great and then you
(1:02:39) know Trump and you know Trump it doesn't matter everybody seems to think that Trump's like I agree with you he isn't that popular but there's enough people like people still think that like oh we got him doesn't matter yeah Donald Trump spent two years trying to get rid of people's health care you know what he'll say on stage at Joe Biden it's a disgrace and people have to pay for it it's not working you know what we're gonna do we're gonna get everybody fantastic health care and Joe Biden's
(1:03:02) gonna go I was the guy who what Bernie Sanders is going to say no how about no  how about everybody has health care and yes look we're going back into pole territory I read the polls the way I want to read them it's a 70 percent poll you put in other questions it comes closer to 50% but again no that's 30% on Medicare for all where are you seeing that no nowhere no no no well okay yes yes okay if you asked the most okay all right thank you come on if you asked like a pure Republican talking point yes no I'm like
(1:03:39) I'm not I'm not trying to I'm not trying to antagonize like I'm I am just saying that I think that there's this idea that Medicare for all is very popular among Americans no it's it's no no no it's it well if you frame it correctly it's very popular mm-hmm if you ask a Republican talking point that terrifies people and causes anxiety and is completely dishonest it's unpopular I actually I've never seen a 30% one that still seems really like I would have to assume that
(1:04:09) that's literally like a Republican push poll just saying Bernie Sanders doesn't want anybody to ever see a doctor right but if you get into like the polls that are real where you say it does this but it does that might do this it might do that we're still in the 50s well if we're talking about real polls so I'm comfortable making that fight and again what I want to keep stressing mhm I looked at people judges playing the most unpopular part of Obama's plan was that you get a tax penalty if you do not buy
(1:04:38) private health insurance that number gets jacked up under goodies in his plan Donald Trump I can't even not describe to you how much fun he'd have running on that like this guy he looks like the Mad Magazine he wants to raise your taxes and that is by the way another advantage that Bernie has that I think does not get put across enough in like collegiate and other kind of intellectual environments a lot of stuff is just style and presentation he doesn't care chris Christie actually said this on TV
(1:05:13) the other day he's totally right he's like yeah Bernie was effective in these debates because he doesn't care okay Bob Castro I heard you anyways back to my plans and we all know from polls that if you talk to most people and maybe this is unfortunate they really are mostly voting on personal qualities right they really are and and that's another advantage that he has mostly overall and to the extent he has disadvantages again unfortunately the other candidates exceed them in terms of communicative ability and
(1:05:49) likability and stuff like if Barack Obama was running you guys would have a case and then I was just be like come on let's give Bernie a chance we got to do this when it comes to personal cause as well though something many Americans are afraid of is the age of these candidates Bernie Sanders is 78 years old like most Americans are out 70 no I yeah and Joe Biden is 77 and it was with Joe Biden's an old 77 like I understand this down do you want to nominate people who judge a 37 year old mayor with horribly unpopular policies who I am
(1:06:26) mobilizing I'm not trying to advocate for anybody that's the only way this conversation can be productive is because again if we want to just sit look here you know what man Bernie 78 he says his socialist may yell sometimes yeah that can be tough okay compared to what what are the other options you know Bernie will always come up short to the imaginary fantasy candidate we have in our heads I don't think it's like I don't think it's unreasonable to want somebody who doesn't call himself a socialist who's
(1:06:54) not great but who's not geriatric like I think that it's like I think it's law I don't think we're shooting for the moon there you know well in this primary you are that there are four candidates who don't fit okay so cool who do you think I mean if you think I don't want to argue the relative electoral merit of any of them but there's no there's no one that jumps out is in any way being stronger than well I think that the I think I don't want a charisma free unpopular central's means
(1:07:21) that too much to ask is it too much to ask a you know to not have a 37 year old mayor does a terrifying Obama impression nobody likes outside of a white college campus right like is it too much to ask to not have like a senile 77 year old with like endless amounts of like serious questions about his campaign contributions of record is it too much to ask to not have like an Oleg arc who instigated an apartheid system of racial terrorism in New York I would hope to think that none of these things are too much to ask but I looks like they are
(1:07:52) because that's where we're at but you know you know obviously no one's you know don't vote for Bernie I I mean sure but it there there isn't what you guys want that's what I would leave the the argument with not like vote whoever you want and I'm not discounting the legitimate concerns but what you want in contrast to him does not exist in this field or in the modern Democratic Party and to the extent people thought they existed how did those people do the biggest call I was wrong in this
(1:08:28) election I thought calmly Harris was gonna be super formidable not popular hi hi so my first question it says on your Twitter that you're Jewish am I getting this right no right Twitter on my Twitter bio says I'm Jewish no but like in your tweets I just I don't want to be wrong I I have Jewish background okay thank you okay so ask someone with a Jewish background yes how do you feel about Bernie's plan for Israel especially as someone concerned with foreign policy I love it it's an absolutely necessary my
(1:09:10) Jewish values teach me to oppose apartheid okay could you elaborate please I mean there there really isn't that much to elaborate on I mean it has anybody ever been not only to Israel but also to the have you been to but I've been to the West Bank have you been to Gaza yeah you went to Gaza okay but not the Gaza well you know I know people have gone to Gaza you could definitely go to Gaza so for me my politics are built on a base of you know economic justice and actually ant really like anti racism as
(1:09:58) in some ways as distinct from some of this sort of woke stuff in a way but when I was I was already look I grew up you know I was pretty connected to left politics so I always knew growing up about the travesty that was the human rights situation there and I knew that people would think people I admired like Nelson Mandela said you know South Africa is gonna not be properly free until the Palestinians are free in 2006 I believe I wrote I read a piece by a guy named Tony jut in the New York Review of Books who was a really
(1:10:34) important Jewish scholar and he just said like the argument was that like literally this is childish like the idea that you have an ethnos state or a religious state if you're committed to any type of broad-based social economic equity and civil society it doesn't work matter how justified right of course there's justification because of Jewish history for Israel there's justification for Kurdistan because of Kurdish reality there's there's justification for Pakistan it's notable that Israel and
(1:11:14) Pakistan are both disasters Israel not in the sense of you know look if you're a European Jewish background you have a nice life there you're not you are even inside 67 borders not a fully equal citizen and the situation in the West Bank is I mean it is literally Jim Crow like and Gaza is I mean it's it's just an atrocity so that's not something that anybody can reasonably ask me to support and I understand you know yeah there's some actions from some Palestinian groups that you know we can condemn in
(1:11:54) fact those have not even really been in any way seriously in place it's like 2003 and when we talk about no look and the apartheid word specifically is both used by people who were crucial in ending apartheid in South Africa like Desmond Tutu or Ronnie Kasrils who served as intelligence minister under I'm Becky you have interviewed and the other main people who use the apartheid word or a Dahmer and a hood Barack so it is what it is and I don't support second-class citizenship and occupation and sieges for anybody no matter who
(1:12:33) they are are you not concerned about the binary between either condemning Israel entirely being like also a stance that a lot of like very strong and notorious anti-semitic people agree with versus like you know seeing this as more of a complex issue where it is wrong what's going on and it there's also a way to do this that Israel still exists and is supported so so it's not a complex issue that's the big thing it's super-simple there's one group that has enormous power it's the most powerful country in
(1:13:06) the Middle East it's backed by the United States it acts on another population of people with total impunity is never held accountable for anything so there's no symmetry in the relationship period and just as like a thought experiment IDW people if we know that if somehow a population of Jewish refugees ended up in West Bank in Gaza and an Arabic government in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv had an open-air prison and in what you know Jewish Gaza which they bombed the white phosphorus they killed civilians indiscriminately and they had no
(1:13:39) provisions for medicine they had an embargo that blocked food that the electricity wasn't running that there was an over forty eight percent unemployment rate life expectancy and malnutrition statistics were horrifying the one of the major policy makers in this hypothetical Arab if Palestinian state said we need to put those Jews on a diet in the West Bank there was another Jewish area where there was a little bit more autonomy but there was regular Arabic settlements where they pulled up the Jewish farmers foods they
(1:14:09) terrorized them with rocks the security forces broke children's bones and they couldn't drive their own roads we'd all have no problem understanding what that was so there's nothing complex about the second part of your question it's it's a pure asymmetry relationship and the question is rights or not so that's it it's not complicated the second part of your question at this point there's always been there's always going to be crackpots who are anti-semitic who condemned Israel that's not what drives
(1:14:40) the movement it's particularly the United States you lurk around most people who are concerned with this issue it's actually populated with a lot of Jewish people the real question we have to ask is why is it that AIPAC is hosting a information minister if you're slobodan milosevic why is it that there's relationships between the Israeli government and far-right parties in Europe why is it that Benjamin Netanyahu's son is posting borderline all right memes why is it that Israel is an all right state even
(1:15:13) though it is from the descendants of the victims of one of the greatest crimes in history that's a serious question and that's inseparable from the racism of the project which goes back to the first part that we have to solve but thank you Shalom and I am serious about it coming from Jewish values like Toni jut my reading to the extent I do which I actually do have some connection to that in a religious sense it's unacceptable for me but yeah I know I know but it's not complicated you said something about people kind of coming to
(1:15:51) the right because they have these certain material problems and they look for it in the media but because there's no like major like leftist Mia outlet they don't really like get those answers and so they kind of like turn am I am I not characterizing this character some truth to that I just thought I don't also think a lot of what they might encounter in like liberal whatever is gonna be very alienating to them yeah so that's part of it yeah I guess my concern is like if the Red Scare never
(1:16:21) happened and if there were like sort of true like a meaningfully socialist party or media outlets or whatever I think there's kind of this fundamental problem of like most people in any kind of political position are not going to be experts at convincing people like if you like like if you look at like um you say we have too much of a Democratic Party in this country very it's have a main center left party that produces generations of people it's like I think political leadership job is convincing
(1:16:53) people of things I I you know I'm and I'm not attacking you at all I just think of course political leadership is of course effective political leadership involves convincing people of things of course and to the extent that you think that I think you're right I think it's a product with a lot of people doing a terrible job at that but of course it's part of that job of core we doing any of this you know I mean I wasn't in any way good enough to like play professional tennis or something which seems way more
(1:17:21) fun but we are theoretically you know trying to convince people and if you're running for office if you're trying to do something your course part of what I point to in my book too is it's not all just a question of political leaders have you guys ever heard of something called cooperation Jackson Jackson Mississippi so it's a very interesting work of people who had a black nationalist project they ended up Chokwe Lumumba became the mayor but it wasn't just a political project that was actually an effort at a cooperative
(1:17:55) economy so there's community supported agriculture there's cooperatively owned businesses and things like this and actually if you look that sector of the economy is much larger than people realize and I check out Professor Richard Wolfe who I have a lot on my show but I'd really look at his work on this he's an economics professor at the new school and so as an example ma Dragoon in Spain is a major economic hub and it's cooperatively owned I mean it competes at a regional level very effectively so part of what I was saying
(1:18:30) was that I think that these guys are speaking very effectively to people's alienation there's a lot of sense of sadness of separation and lack of meaning lack of purpose that in a weird way I'm intellectually I find Peterson to just you know be retrograde and ridiculous like and I know I'm so people be watching this I can already see the comments but actually think the concerns he's talking to are super real right like even just like in pop this course you know like okay is something like in
(1:19:00) cell right is that associated with misogyny and is that a problem absolutely that's part of it but also we all just go like haha  loser versus be like wow that actually sounds horrifying and really sad and really isolating and like a big problem probably and I read a fascinating piece once that actually that term was originally coined by a woman to describe her experience so we're talking about not gender specific it it does affect a lot of young men and by the way that's significant like you know you can't even
(1:19:32) if somebody has relative privilege it's still a problem socially and economically so so your question on maybe with some hope I'm interpreting right on the more day in and day out level is that I think that and so what Peterson's saying in response to this whole world that is chaotic and there's diminished life prospects is you know clean your room and watch my videos basically and I'm saying maybe if people in their own lives had a greater ownership over their work they would feel better maybe if
(1:20:02) they were in cooperative efforts with people they were around that might generate a sense of meaning and purpose and that you're seeking of meaning and purpose is awesome and we should honor that that impulse not how it manifests but the impulse if I'm talking to people like politically how do I I guess I'm just concerned was like actually engaging with people politically in like a way that could be asked people what they care about okay listen to them I know I I mean I I know I'm not good at it yeah but you
(1:20:35) have to work that's if you talk to anybody but it's not I mean we have different roles people play but I feel like when you're talking about like organizing if you talk to people who organize who are in the process and if you ever do it if you go door-to-door for Bernie or you go door-to-door for Medicaid expansion or any candidate people don't I mean you have a script sort of to keep you in balance but no one says like hey hope you're enjoying dinner I have a good candidate shut up let me tell it mate what are you
(1:21:03) concerned about what are you thinking about it really is a process of you know of its it's like emotional intelligence basically the socially enlightened left tends to be stereotypes by people who are rich elite you know quote limp-wristed crybabies who don't want to work and and and and and so and so people who may not who may not buy into you know socialist ideas or ultra-left rhetoric they they take that stereotype they close their ears well i've door knocked for a bunch of candidates in in massachusetts you where are you from
(1:21:45) master I'm from Cambridge oh so like we're taught we're talking real liberal here but I've door knocked and there was a lot of working-class neighborhoods and I could you go certainly the cavers like doing what the  talking about ya know yeah so yeah so exactly you know I've Dornoch to people and you know presented my my little spiel and they've been like you know why would I listen to you like you know your college you're a college kid you're rich you don't know anything I'm talking about right you
(1:22:13) don't know how I live you know I throw in the little Boston accent maybe they give me a little bit but you know they don't really want to engage with me so so what is what is your counter to that because you know as you sit here when I listen to you obviously you you you present a very good and easily digestible case for socialism but you know someone's not gonna want to talk to me about that so how do you engage with the person that may be a center-left or maybe Center and just wants to throw your ideas out the window and doesn't
(1:22:43) want to talk to you anyway that's a trick okay so you're not talking I thought we were talking about the Cambridge people telling you to go off their porch maybe that was like a little bit of a different type of vote or a different type of thing than Center or center left eye so let me just make a distinction now also between ultra-left rhetoric versus actual programs so one of the thing like I don't like ultra-left rhetoric of any kind I sorry testing ultra-left programs I was just saying no it turns people off I listen
(1:23:17) to the idea so that's the part I completely agree with you I think you're totally right and I think that there is a lot of I I think that there's a lot of real problems with how people communicate these ideas I think they're really limiting I think they as I said in the beginning I said I want to be the pre mainstream I don't want to be a subculture so I see people sometimes they go yeah we're gonna go out there and then you know I'm gonna terrorize people with Mal quotes like I don't know
(1:23:50) like what he's talking about right like and I think that part of that honestly does actually like that stereotype of you know your feet liberal or whatever that has a lot of origins behind it there's problems with that obviously but like yeah it's a problem at the left is basically for decades been essentially only on college campuses in a certain way that's a huge problem that's a problem there's a specific type of social training there's a specific type of rhetorical strategy that doesn't
(1:24:19) work on most people that's another thing that I really would would strongly distinguish because between social habits and rhetoric versus substantive rights like you see this in groups if somebody came to a group and said I'll help fight for Medicare for all with you guys but I don't want gay people here we would say no you can't no we don't do that period now if somebody comes in and they say hey I want to work for a medicare-for-all with everybody in this group and I thought this hilber podcast
(1:24:53) was pretty funny and so wait we need to process that for fifteen hours disaster alienating embarrassing weird not helpful so I would make a very clear distinction between program and rhetoric and I think also by the way like the socialism word like back to your guys concerns about Bernie winning I'm hoping that Bernie talks a hell of a lot more about FDR than socialism over the next couple of months I'm hoping that Bernie goes to those older folks and says you know look he can't get away from the
(1:25:30) word I'm someone who cares in the long term about that word because that's my political program but if I was just if I was in my imaginary life I wouldn't have to deal with that word either however we will and so if he says it's pretty simple I'm trying to finish the New Deal FDR talked about the Four Freedoms that's my package I've done that anecdotally with older voters they go oh well FDR's good so Lulla I'm not saying to talk necessary about President Lula to average swing
(1:26:04) voters that guy but that being said no but honestly you know what's funny is that I know people through covering him a former president of Brazil and political prisoner guys come up to me at live shows who are like you know I mean look they're into my shows that are into politics but they're definitely not part of any type of college academic whatever that guy's cool I followed the gram the pictures in playing soccer are awesome you read his interview watch my interview with him he's talking about
(1:26:32) how people buy beer I had a program so people could get you know buy a cup of coffee when they buy coffee they you know I'm not doing it justice but he's speaking I think that's another thing you're talking about somebody who rose up from being impoverished illiterate metalworker who lost a finger never went to college and then became the most popular and effective president in Brazil's history and his brilliant statesmen he wasn't trained in one of these institutions now it's not black and white of course
(1:27:02) people come out his institutions who a great leadership and around trying to demonize college but no don't embrace being part of a subculture and make a distinction between substantive rights and commitments which are non-negotiable and cultural practices and preferences which just reflect your cultural training in class position have no substance and are probably mostly in the way so just my personal opinion I think you know Facebook pages like off of my Democrats it's great is you watch it yeah give the snaps but you know it's
(1:27:35) not focusing necessarily on substance issues and the solutions it's it's buying into that subculture narrative right I think that that's harmful to the greater acceptance of these ideals I well I can't criticize honestly just because I don't read it so I won't criticize a specific page but I would just say again to reflect what I said before I'll just say it in a different way just be very aware of what you're doing like like you know conservatives make all this hay about safe spaces
(1:28:06) right safe spaces safety first of all they all want safe spaces so who are we kidding but you do have to distinguish look if you everybody should have access to things called safe spaces in a very broad sense in terms of very basic very basic mutual levels of respect and then you say like we're doing different things I say um I don't know you want to do like a social club or a spiritual thing or whatever or a sports thing that's around the specific interest maybe you have it at your apartment instead of a broader you know public
(1:28:42) space then yeah that the rules of etiquette for that can be much tighter you want to build a mass political organization to elect somebody president or push a major piece of legislation again substantive rights non-negotiable you cannot control the way people speak about everything you can't control the cut depth with a culture that they like you can't control how they express themselves you can't control how they move you can't control what they think is funny you can't control even within
(1:29:12) other bounds different opinions they may or may not have and nor should you so I would make really strong distinctions there and we do not want socialism to be a a plaything for the rich we want it to be a real program that gives health care to people and other things that people need as well as insurance substantive rights yeah so I'm gonna come over here in just a second guys but since you mentioned Lula yeah so just everyone knows because I no not ever in studies Latin America like Lula as Michael said
(1:29:46) was the president from 2002 to 2010 Brazil as you said widely considered one of the best if not the best most effective presidents and Brazil's history but I'm just curious to get your thoughts on the left swept to power in Latin America from the late 1990s through the first decade of the 2000s and the left took different forms and some commentators divided it into like the radical leftists and Chavez sort of represented the radicals and then the moderate leftists and Lula was really kind of like the equivalent of Chavez on the
(1:30:20) other side accordin sidered a very moderate leftist and famously you know wrote a letter to investors and the lead-up to the 2002 election saying I'm not going to mess with you know our relatively Orthodox fiscal and monetary policy um and you know he lifted a lot of people out of poverty and but that was through a it wasn't by dismantling capitalist structures as much as it was skimming some wealth off the top and and distributing a lot of it to the poorest 20% so my question to you is like where like what was your position on those
(1:30:52) debates because Lula drew some fire from from people on the left in Brazil and international comrades look for kind of selling out the PT's socialism of yesteryear because it used to be a more radical left and right so I I think that it's it's it's a dialectic because I think on one hand I have very little patience for it kind of relates back to his question like a lot of the critique that came against Lula was people who were not doing anything right like there was that element of you know well 40
(1:31:35) million people are getting lifted out of poverty but I don't like x y&z well you know all these incredible accomplishments are happening but I don't like XY and z now i think Lula look I think he's objectively the best president of 21st century and I also think even just in terms of what he did on foreign policy given Brazil's a mid ranked country is extraordinary I obviously also think Chavez was a great president absolutely but I also think that the lesson particularly the place like Lula's should be very sobering for
(1:32:07) people on both sides of that equation because I like my friend Bosch Garson Carr who found a jacket in this dog was amazing it is it high just doesn't care you doing that's why she's so cool he said you know he became a Marxist because of his conservative like he's like by temperament I wish that a social democratic model would work but the way capitalism works it never seems to be durable so yes you had a presidency that lifted tens of millions out of poverty the economy did great things worked very
(1:32:45) well he not only he acquiesced to all sorts of problems I mean he he's been really up front he basically was like look by the time I was becoming president I wanted to get rid of hunger in this country period and I was able to I was willing to negotiate other things and he did he got rid of hunger so when you look at it that and you see the success and you see the model that was created and the fact that there was still this backlash from the u.s.
(1:33:12) foreign policy because they wouldn't privatize Petrobras and bushes their state oil company and because and you look at the all the wealthy in Brazil who clearly as Lula said Lula said to me in the interview he said poor people could fly when I became president and you would hear people in Rio de Janeiro go the airports look like bus stations that level of social entitlement and resentment as well as the fact that I don't know if that model as again the capitalist pie shrinks is replicatable Lula himself says and we were talking
(1:33:47) about uber he's like yeah it's different set of challenges I would be a more radical president today and not because it's interesting his instincts are really like he's a labor negotiator he really believes in like legit like you get everybody and you sit down and you figure it out his pot like he said he's like my politics are more like German labor whatever but doesn't work and then frankly you look at Venezuela which is a whole other thing but I will just say like there's valid criticisms there but
(1:34:18) there's also the fact that people repeat a lot of cliches that are not substantiated and they also if you're prime concern is lifting people out of poverty which is mine they lifted millions out of poverty and if I'm Maduro and I'm getting sanctimonious lectures about my relationship with the military I would say hmm but why is it somehow that I've still survived in power even as the US has tried to dislodge me every single day and people like Lula and even Morales this whole idea that Morales
(1:34:47) with some autocrat ridiculous knocked out so Lula it's a tremendous tragedy because if there was even just a willingness for you know policy makers and capital to say Brazil can have a new deal we could have a very nice model but that apparently is not agreeable to them so I I don't like that the Left moralize them and undermine their achievements and demand it like well why isn't little I doing what you know I don't like that but on the other hand I think the success and what it resulted in is
(1:35:23) showing the limits of that model so you've spoken a little bit beginning like the woke voters and like those who share like woke versus socialists mentalities sort of mm-hmm which I found interesting agreed with and especially with the rise of like the woke culture in younger millennial and Gen Z voters yeah one thing that has been spoken about is sort of like diversity on a democratic stage right and like while being the most electable candidate but he's still sort of like the elderly straight white man so do you
(1:35:54) think him getting the Democratic nomination will sort of cause a further schism between specifically the Democratic Party and voters or do you think like once he gets it it'll the sentiment of anyone beating out Trump for the presidency will sort of unify so I have to ask you I'm trying I'm trying to be I'm trying to learn from your professor I think there's truth to what you said there was multiple candidates of color who performed it busily why do you think that is I don't know I sort of feel like
(1:36:25) I don't know after the 2016 election the stage obviously changed a little mm-hmm so I don't really know but I feel that a lot of I feel people sort of lean towards what they expected to overall in America president job I think that there's I think that's I think it's terrible and I think there's some truth to that and that is like without a doubt like the ones they thought would I think there's some truth to that and a critique of woke nests and saying we need to understand these things in material and
(1:36:57) not moralistic terms is not a denial of those things so let's be really clear about that right these things are very real I also would point you to you know a great anecdote I believe was in the New York Times this gentleman african-american voter I think in South Carolina and said hey it would be great to vote for common law booker but they're not talking like Bernie and I need health care you have to look and this is actually another problem that I have with woke miss as it is expressed because it it turns like
(1:37:35) there is no single African American vote there is absolutely like of course my friend Phil who worked at Goldman Sachs whose family's from Barbados yes he gets racially profiled by police just as my friends who you know didn't go to Duke and works in a different field right and they have huge disparities between them but there is an overlap and experience of race and policing for sure by the way big overlap with class and policing that is transracial no doubt at the same time even just in New York City alone what
(1:38:10) the black vote in Brooklyn is versus Harlem is radically different Brooklyn is filled with people from the Caribbean from Trinidad from Jamaica from Barbados so you go to Manhattan you have people from the great migration you have a political machine that goes back to Adam Clayton Powell through Charlie Rangel and and even in some respects on to today so as adolph Reid jr.
(1:38:36) said to me once I loved he said what organization in America I'm switching to another group of importance in terms of Rights he said what organization in America represents more transgender people than any other group in the country does anybody know the afl-cio what do you say Oh No well okay no good all good I didn't know it but it's the afl-cio who has more concentrations of black woman power and representation than any other groups in the country labor unions if you implemented Bernie Sanders agenda which
(1:39:14) is not it yes it is a class oriented material agenda and good we need that that would still represent the greatest racial transfer of wealth in this country since reconstruction because we actually all know that these things are manifest of course along racial lines that's another reason that this woke stuff is so disgusting it teaches Mike Bloomberg to say I recognize my privilege okay great awesome you can I keep my money it's  and I think that there are people in the media class who are totally look they're wealthy great let's
(1:39:51) all sit around and check each other's privilege and come up with new discourses and new ways to terrorize people and control people let's have pogroms and each other because you said the wrong thing or you did a mistake you get rid of all of that  but if you actually want to solve these problems of course there's array of policy issues and of course some of them a race and gender specific but it's totally inseparable from economic actual power and the way those discursive strategies are used is actually to obscure them
(1:40:21) just because it's a social etiquette hey I'm Michael I have white male privilege thank you Michael okay I'm gonna go so what you know look and look at everybody on that stage you know my friend was joking said look Bernie is it's like it's like Cornel West he's like look Bernie he's older he doesn't all the buzzwords but he does have values so we were joking like you know Bernie's the type of person who might just a point like a cabinet that's 90% women but forget to brag about it
(1:40:50) so let's you know that so I'm I think what you raise is America it's vitally important but there's a much bigger and and that's where my critique is coming from it's not coming from the highlighting of those issues anybody that literally critiques the highlighting those issues is you know somebody I have to write a book about or make fun of on my show well thank you for being here thank you earlier you were speaking on the importance of like individual agency aspiration and how that fits into socialism for example
(1:41:22) well but speaking on for example Bernie Sanders policies in particular how does something like a federal jobs guarantee play into that because I feel like it's a step in the wrong direction because I don't really think it provides for any room well what I say aspiration I don't mean the the daily Herculean struggle for basic survival no no no so yeah and that no it's a problem because these things get equated well right my analogy yeah I'm a socialist I don't want I still want there to be an NBA team that
(1:41:54) wins but I don't want people to struggle how to feed clothe and live so the federal jobs guarantee not only as part of solving that problem it's also vitally important for giving labor power to get people to lord over business and that's another thing too your aspirations impact Lula is a pretty  ambitious guy he came from literal like dirt poverty to become president he did that through labor you don't think that that expresses personal ambition it has nothing to see that's the problems of these these that these
(1:42:25) things get connected in ways that are a problem we say bureaucracy and we think government what do you think happens when you're on the phone with your airline or HMO and they're not helping you what is that it's called the bureaucracy but because in America we have so much stupidity in propaganda we've been trained like Oh bureaucracy only happens by government so you know ambition means that everybody starves on the street and then you try to get you know you try to come up with some dumb widget Factory or be a lunatic like Elon
(1:42:53) Musk on Twitter these qualities are important they should be recognized they have nothing to do with people being emitted and not having power right but I think when you move past that on a base level it's more about providing meaning for people you know when you have aspiration it's finding maybe meaning rather than you know just becoming rich you know living this crazy life we're having this daily struggle like you talked about yeah so I would say that if we provide if we if we if every single
(1:43:19) human being had food clothing shelter healthcare material security then they would move from horrific meaningless preventable suffering to productive an interesting suffering and then let's see what happens sure yeah that's it yeah from what I can tell liberals are more scared of Bernie Sanders brand of socialism than they are of Donald Trump's continuing to the status quo and so like I guess my question to you is like what should I do as a person who sees more moral clarity on my Twitter than in the Washington
(1:43:53) Post in the New York Times how do I like what is this future meat at like leftist media gonna look like like I'm a patron in my show no no I mean actually honestly independently of that like no I actually it's it actually disturbs me how important I think our independent media discourse is because it's a disaster on television ideologically and in terms of like what they cover but if you're watching it all day you're an idiot you don't know anything you know and you have a magical view of the world
(1:44:26) like everything is you know is then he clapped back and Russia did that and it's embarrassing but I would want to make a really big distinction as tough as I am on like a certain type of liberal because you know they are what they are make a big butt but make a really big distinction between you know like someone of good faith who genuinely is appalled by Donald Trump and they will under floating for Bernice and they actually care about this stuff they're just not where you are I are you really have to make that distinction and that's
(1:45:03) what I would say is like all this Bernie bro  is just classes racist nonsense but be kind to your peers and be it totally you know ruthless with institutions right so I think that you know as best you can we all make mistakes and we all struggle and we all like another reason I don't like this puritanical culture we all need to like we all make mistakes we all have character defects right we all need to know that and act a little bit a humility or try to even when we fail and fail so that being said I think that
(1:45:42) clearly there is a segment of the Democratic establishment if you want to call us that that yeah I think they would basically probably prefer Trump to Bernie they have four years they can fundraise off of it they don't have any actual skin in the game they're you know let's be real here there they are in heavily policed you know metro areas that you know that cater to them as upper middle class predominantly white people there certainly don't have relatives in cages they certainly are not struggling with bills and healthcare
(1:46:15) and Bernie Sanders represents a threat to power and let's be in you know not just ideologically like I'm talking consulting contracts I'm talking if there's a new leadership in the DNC a handful of political consulting firms are not gonna get really that's real  that's money that's the biggest thing in the world right look at what happened in Brazil in the last election it came down to with I mean look and this is again people should never forget how important just political skill is
(1:46:46) Lula was the victim of years of judicial media warfare and the polls showed he still led bolson ro by 15 percent like such a big margin he would have won in the first round because of his record and because of his charisma when it became Haddad who's a great I've met Fernando Haddad G he was a great mayor of San Paulo he put forward a totally respectable moderate chill program which any sane person would respond to tons of liberals including the former president this  Cardozo either wouldn't
(1:47:20) endorse or campaign for balsan ro and because at the end of the day a lot of these people are just protecting their capital interests and I think the best thing you can do is just be really clear about what the power difference is and win I mean this is one of the things is another you know that frustrated me about so much of this Warren discourse it's like they're competing beat her win or she beats him and wins there isn't like this secret like they're really working together no they're competing and he's competing
(1:47:50) against networks of insulated people some of whom are insane some of whom were stupid some of whom are like having panics on television some of whom are cynical and corrupt some from all of the above some of whom actually probably really want to do some of the things we want to do and just didn't think it was possible and they're scared so guys just keep going but don't feel it's so stacked to the point that you don't do anything because that's when nothing happens you know what I mean like you
(1:48:22) really gets like well it's all rigged it's all it I think when you look at propaganda that will come out at Bernie if he is the nominee the most effective the the big picture like socialism and your Grandpa's scared stuff we'll deal with that it will work or it won't but in the margins like young people turning out look at stuff and I don't know whether it's conscious I'm look I'm not Rachel Maddow I don't have like I don't think there's a secret you know I don't
(1:48:49) rush I was doing it but I do know that publicly Israeli officials people around Israel and just today the head of the BJP party in India responding to Bernie calling out their horrific human rights abuses said we're going to get involved in this election so I know that these types of things are coming I know that the whole oligarch class of this country will try to fund propaganda against them and with young people and people all who are quote unquote lower information which I don't like that phrase because a
(1:49:19) lot of high information people are low content but you will see propaganda that will look more like yeah Bernie's a nice guy but nothing is possible Oh birdie talks a good game but he endorsed Hillary Clinton it's not gonna be the stuff that works on adults what we'll do a Joe Rogan audience which is more representative of mainstream middle opinion than the New York Times editorial by a factor of million-to-one is not he's a socialist a little blah it's doesn't matter dude whatever go out  have fun it doesn't
(1:49:56) matter yeah Bernie whatever maybe you like them maybe you don't nothing will change nothing will happen so don't worry about it don't bother and and what bothers me of course there's bias in the Democratic National Committee there these people are publicly talking about not giving in the nomination if he wins and I don't care what the rules are I know what the rules are okay I I know what the rules are by the way no bigger gift to Donald Trump when after they do that and they lose this wouldn't happen because they'll lose but
(1:50:24) the Democratic Party talking like that is so empowering of Donald Trump who absolutely will not accept the results of an election he lost and they all left physicals Democrats I mean we don't even know we got to figure out what's going on so but that's all true and we need to fight it and I actually think Super Tuesday might go quite well and it will shut a lot of people up but that being said don't go to a point where you just say like well it's Ritz nothing will happen because that's actually the most potent
(1:50:53) propaganda and I've looked at polls when they talk about you know these mobilizing these new voters that are hard to mobilize and it isn't ideology and in fact of course ideologically they mostly like Sanders but the most potent talking point is yeah but none of it will make any difference that's the enemy right there and cynicism is pseudo sophistication so let's not do it new this is my first time voting and as like Bernie Sanders is like the first candidate I'm ever voting for looking forward to elections
(1:51:27) in the future I don't really think like I don't really want to do make the immoral decision of voting for a corporate candidate like like I guess my question is do you think they will from now on always be a non corporate candidate in the demo party I think that if Bernie Sanders wins that opens up a lot of political terrain yeah I also I think you got a really look at each things in and of itself I don't think voting is a moralistic exercise so I think you can totally vote in terms of harm reduction and who you
(1:51:58) vote for is not a personal reflection of like the content of your character at the same time like as an example Mike Bloomberg like it's one thing to vote for a horrible trash Democrat who is a constellation of a coalition of contradictions versus formally saying in a Bloomberg case we're done a trump vers moon berg race means that the Democratic avenues and the small D sense are closed and I would never vote for Mike Bloomberg not as a moral exercise but because I would have to sit back and say I don't know what the Avenue is here to
(1:52:40) deal with these challenges because we're gonna we're competing in a world between one person who wants us to have an autocracy like Singapore and one person that wants us to run the United States like Batista ran Cuba in the 50s look it up but so anyways but I think there's a lot of opportunity for you to vote for people you like yeah thank you thanks man I agree with you that bernie is the best shot and in my opinion the best choice but even so if Bernie gets elected it's very obvious that like a lot of the CEOs
(1:53:13) of companies that are committing a bunch of human rights violations there still have a lot of armor to like actually get to them and get them to fix these problems like the factories in China labor factories and I'm sorry what do you mean fix problems I mean like I guess like a good example is how like like most of like like Jeff Bezos or such like they don't really pay taxes or write stuff like I don't like all the human rights violations in China taking advantage of the labor laws and I guess my question is just like what do you
(1:53:49) believe is a good route starting from Bernie to really get to solving that issues or those issues I mean global supply chains I I think today on the show I was hosting got a call from India about and what people really should be paying attention to this I mean this is really they are in the words of the Economist setting up the bureaucratic stages of ethnic cleansing right so other the old Noam Chomsky technique where he was even the economist so and this guy from India called the show and he was giving us an
(1:54:31) update and so on and you know like a call or a normal play not a guest you know just called in was listening online watching online and I said well what like well honestly like what I get the obvious role you know I'm in media any kind of platform you talk about it whatever and he's like when Bernie tweeted about this yesterday it set off a firestorm in the whole country please vote for him I don't want to reduce everything to that I just in fact I think a lot goes beyond that these are really complicated problems they aren't
(1:55:01) also like even the conversation about China like yeah there's serious rights abuses there and problems but at the same time like what's our strategy when China becomes a genuine peer-to-peer power and do we and what and how do we conceive of PAP you know all of this stuff is very complicated it goes way beyond one cycle I think that what Bernie does Michelle Goldberg of all people actually just wrote a piece and she's you know very bearish of Bernie but she's like you know she's like Putin
(1:55:30) doesn't want Bernie to win like the most terrifying thing in the world for any holder of any type of concentrated power is the idea that a youth driven multiracial coalition has one power in the world's last remaining superpower that's unsettling for all of them right and look there's a lot of things that he will try to do as Palo as president that no one else is tried to do he will try to get an Amazon to pay its taxes it's gonna be really hard and a lot of these things are gonna spill out to you know
(1:56:01) social political conflicts in all areas of life and people don't usually give up what they have freely and honestly I mean in an objective sense Bernie's campaign is like like what he's campaigning on is so it's not radical at all we know that and in fact if he didn't have this social loop I think he is some sort of socialist but you could very easily just say like hey you like FDR you know like really these people are crying about Elizabeth Warren's plans my plans are not Bernie's plans so you know but I I
(1:56:35) think it that's a Bernie getting elected president it's the tip of the spear yeah that's what I think I have the sort of concern that America in terms of like the sort of politics you see discussed on the news are sort of like so far right unlike AG like compared to like a global scale that I have this concern of even something so basic as like I might try to go talk to someone and go you should try to join a union or former Union because you need to be able to in gate have a certain amount of negotiating power like with your boss I
(1:57:16) have this concern that even something like that someone will go what are you talking about like even that kind of level of like sort of class conflict is there it's almost going to be sort of like nonsensical I don't know if that's actually true I don't know if that's actually true either and I think that there's actually a lot I think I think there's actually a paradox with older voters in Bernie too by the way because the most older voters that are just gonna be like socialism they're voting
(1:57:45) for Donald Trump so what I'm worried about it but there's definitely some older voters they will again it goes back to the FDR thing socialism might freak them out but that if you say hey you remember how you could go to college for free and you know five dollars semester and public works projects not and they say oh yeah I know we need to do those things so there's a paradox but again I'm appeal I just go back to the other thing about asking people questions because I just think like talking about somebody's situation is
(1:58:12) what elicits you're like oh really and then your boss you know she had to come in double time and she didn't get paid double time and that and then it's almost like you know what we know right it's called a union you know but I do think it you've got to engage the people where they're at I'm like a broken record but you have to and and that's even the thought with the media we do right the idea is that hopefully there's some angle you know I've definitely at live shows had some people
(1:58:44) come up to me they say well I liked you because you made fun of Dave Rubin and now I understand what's happening in Brazil or somebody's like well I really wanted to just learn more about you know African geopolitics I have a system for understanding the world you know that's the goal find out what people are interested in and what their challenges are and and then subtly propagandize them like a Russian one thing that Noam Chomsky talks about is how the media's advertising structure makes it such that
(1:59:18) they their audience is predominantly the consumer class right so what my question is is um how do you think the the YouTube advertising structure influences your audience type with the majority report well that advertising is not as important like my show my business is built ninety nine percent on people being members the majority report is probably like ninety six percent even right the ads on YouTube there there we get enough views where they make something but that's not how the business is based so the so there's the
(2:00:02) same the same themes with Chomsky but it's a whole little problem set the problem set is how much does the algorithm and the view count affect your content when do you start thinking to yourself like yeah that's kind of dumb but you know what that'll get a huge amount of views I mean and we all do that right like we all calibrate and sometimes it's like amazing like I did one with Milton al-ahmadi on a really important leader named Thomas song from burkina faso and that one like blew up and you're like oh that's awesome
(2:00:34) that's like an amazing piece of content a lot of people watched it and then there's other ones where it's just like you know look stuff I don't do anything that I don't think is good and I don't like but you know yeah sometimes I'm like okay like you know megan mccain has like a megan to mega tantrum is like you know here and my sit down with somebody who brought you know 5 million people out of poverty talking about iran is here alright that's not super encouraging i think in our world you
(2:01:02) know the audience capture is so direct because you're dealing with like a community right like you're you're in it i mean i've just even started to understand very recently that i have like a thing called like an audience like honestly i mean you know it's just like hey yeah i kind of do this  on youtube and podcast and there's some people like it and they pay me for it versus like oh I guess like this is actually like a thing that is professional and we do and there's a business and and it's growing a lot so
(2:01:34) what's Liberatore is that when people pay you directly you bypass all of these ridiculous filters and I can design a show that is you know it does like of course Matthews impressions and then does like African history right and covers all sorts of things he's professor likes the Chris Matthews which one was Oh Oh when he was begging oh no I could just that's that's too meta years ago Chris Matthews was literally on television begging Barack Obama to give him an interview so he would like end his broadcast with like please mr.
(2:02:17) president please Barack we keep it we've had on Hillary we've had on the other guests please come on my show I actually could we put you guys questions and a Chris Matthews voice that would be more fun I was like is it too much to ask that I have an ancient socialist is my nominee it's gonna be hard oh these Jewish Denmark all right so yeah what do you say absolutely old and Jewish to be fair so so you know and then on the other hand obviously you know just as it's liberating I can get super you know what's the line between
(2:03:01) somebody like the openness because you know you're not like you know in some like arrogant pedestal where someone's like hey I've got some feedback versus like you actually cannot control the content of my show like sorry you know and actually realizing that you do need to have those things but the bigger challenge for people in independent media like I think the noam chomsky model totally still applies to corporate news and all of that for sure the big problem for us is that we're building these independent platforms on some of
(2:03:31) the most concentrated dangerous mega platforms in the world we're doing I mean I'm not absolutely not in terms of life experience and fun and if we're doing well like recognition and making a little bit of money absolutely not but functionally like as like a function of the economy where uber drivers like we're independent contractors working on monopoly platforms that we don't control that can change instantaneously so the bigger question becomes how do we start figuring out we've got the independent
(2:04:09) content and the media but what about the platform that that and that's a huge challenge but that's how we need to think strategically yeah not gonna bang on you about the ancient socialist thing anymore don't worry Bernie I don't want to know that scared I'm at Lafayette College well they're like oh you have to admit though if you want Jeff Bezos to pay his taxes to be way easier to do it if you had Democratic control of the legislature they won't make him do it I'm just saying I'm just I'm just saying
(2:04:37) but they um it's an important point though that I ask you to really look at mm-hmm who does Amazon contribute more money to I mean it might be closer to 5050 now but Oracle II more so Democrats you look the real choice between Democrats and Republicans not Bernie but mainline Democrats and it's an important choice I'm not minimizing it but we have to go beyond this choice if we want to sprinkly survive as a species when you start bringing in ecology into it is Oldboy Network white supremacy monopoly
(2:05:12) capitalism or woke monopoly capitalism now I will pick diversity manat of monopoly capitalism any any day of the week of course but you have to get really clear that when it comes to actually solving these serious problems we're talking about right these not only are Democrats not going to do it I mean look at what the Obama administration look how the governed Silicon Valley take a look a really serious look at that the rise of all of the problems we're talking about are a product of Obama era a decision-making period that's not
(2:05:45) debatable so and I don't care what people put forward as you know what they say in election year that is where I well I'll say look Bernie's more practical and so on than people realize like no it actually matters that this guy is that a clear view of the world they write about for decades and I don't trust the Colombian men when King in the house or something yeah yeah did a lot he's also a mayor and it was a small town right bigger than South Bend but that's that is it being a mayor is
(2:06:17) actually to me like the ultimate test of like the practical components of politics so I'm really glad you're supporting Peabody Judge then well you know what I meant by it nose is no because I might measure of success is not firing the first black police chief sure sure sure  yeah to get to the question first police I would like to say I'm all about getting Dave Rubin to come on sam cedars show I know that campaign is still going on but when I was watching your show that was a big big thing and I'm still
(2:06:46) all about it how did the thing become Sam debating him I was the one who dumped on him first because I always saw Sam on the majority report being like oh yeah because everyone was like you know it's a marketplace of ideas oh no I know I remember that exchangable yeah well no what was really funny is just this history was I did a video on Dave Rubin mm-hmm and this is before I even launched my own show and I do not title videos right and I want I can tell part of this pennyways the video came out and the title er put like the name was
(2:07:23) something like I don't know like Michael like you know Dave Rubin is breathtakingly stupid or something like you know like something like you will not believe it yeah you will he looks like you will literally not believe how stupid they prove it right or something and so you know Dave Rubin was though he used to do this all the time and actually the answer your question I just like we I it's done like Dave Rubin is that the blaze now like there was like an actual purpose in exposing his  for a while which is like his whole thing was
(2:07:57) again and military consumed and maybe is now it's like everybody's probably do whatever was right but yeah but the way it happened was that Sam slid into one of those look you know I was like Sam's fake you know positive attention he would he put Dave Rubin in a coma if they debated and and so Rubin had the out which was the name of my video and so we did a whole you know like Sam was like I apologize I'm taking that down immediately you know horrible had homonym ready to debate yeah is the alpha male 1 yeah Dave Rubin
(2:08:41) was interviewing like I'm dead a David segment for a minute Dave Rubin was interviewing Larry King and Larry King takes a call from his son in the middle of the phone of the interview and starts talking about baseball trades and it's wow those things I've ever seen in my life well I say that Professor van Dyke has been referencing that video once a day yes you have a video that would be an understatement that would be an understatement but anyway the question yes so I'm sure I'm sure you have your
(2:09:16) issues with Tom Styer running in the race and attempting to buy it but it was actually oh he's helping us in South Carolina uh-huh well right because he's putting the vote guy but we actually find Tom sorry very interesting because he is this you know he's he's this you know dichotomy right he's this hedge fund billionaire who is you know for a wealth tax and he's for reparations and he's for all of these you know he's for these like you know material gains and like some he's even
(2:09:49) more lefty on some things than Bernie Sanders including reparations especially economically speaking definitely okay all right I don't agree with that but well I mean obviously I mean on on average but irrespective like yeah you you understand the point that I'm trying to make that he's a liberal hedge fund guy I'm not that he's I'm just saying that like what do you what do you would you vote for Tom Steyer is like sort of the question I'm getting at but also what do you think of these like
(2:10:21) he's obviously there's styling and there's Bloomberg and stires much more on your side of the spectrum and Bloomberg is putting it but this is where and this is why like a kind of socialistic viewpoint drives people nuts mm-hmm it's really like it's not it's about function not personality like I find Mike Bloomberg like I think it's kind of charming that he's just this like horrifying old ass I think Trump is hilarious I think Trump is an amazing campaigner in terms of again I'm not making a moral judgement
(2:10:52) but look at how he communicates out you whoops crowds up so my philosophical like and and this really should not be a radical statement all billionaires and democracy are incompatible mm-hmm that level of wealth concentration and how it affects politics is fundamentally unhealthy and Tom Steyer is a minor example of that there is zero do you think and I might think you know I don't really care about people's resumes that much but I think you should have some okay do you think that like the public school teacher of the year in
(2:11:25) Pennsylvania should run for president and would you consider voting for them is it merely asking me but generally asking for president United States now right so right same reason I would never consider voting for who the hell's Tom Styer uh-huh the  this Union right nothing and that's purely a function of social capital you go to read Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson he says what should we do about education in this country and Steve has a bunch of you know pablum you'd expect about teachers or
(2:11:55) whatever some nonsense mm-hmm okay let's go ask the New Jersey State public school teacher of the year about how Apple should be wrong as a company Tom Styer it has no political experience he has private prison investments he built a email list off of whipping up a bunch of idiots to you know think we're gonna remove Trump through impeachment which we won't and yes he's okay he announced the support for reparations one week ago at a debate in South Carolina sure as a former private prison owner if
(2:12:27) Tom Steyer was remotely serious about power and influencing things he would be funding all of those congressional races you're so concerned about and there's no I mean it's just not even as if we're in a world where the high school teacher of the year is I come is a presidential contender great then everybody could be considered but there's no i money does not have that value to me and again I don't just mean that as a moral statement I mean that it's like literally like I don't think Stiers that
(2:12:54) I don't think he's that bright I don't think he would you know the great president and I think what capitalism is actually way more embarrassing I prefer the actual thing that be some start like Mike Bloomberg hasn't had somebody telling these wrong for decades and that's quite clear Tom Styer does like a once-a-year he's the curry let's have a rap session oh you're fired it's embarrassing what are your thoughts on a universal basic income yeah if it's an on top of other
(2:13:27) vital social programs I don't know if it's a substitute if it is packaged with an openness to actually cutting things it's a Trojan horse and I don't like it should be anti what Andrew yang proposes a freedom dividend andrew yang people do not like me very much okay you're not a friend of the yang yang look I'm a friend look I'm a friend of the sentiment I think honestly like look it's great I do I like the concept that Andrew yang came out and said I'm running a campaign that is about
(2:13:58) people's material needs is great there's kind of your whole spiel I guess you know but I'm talking yeah well well it's not my host field because there's listen back to what I talked about with things like modular bone and cooperation Jackson yes material needs and also power Andrew yang is not talking about giving people power he's saying we have an inevitable capitalist process which also I'm not frankly convinced of like I thought oh my zation stuff is way more contested than he says way more contested and then
(2:14:29) he's like we're not gonna do anything about it we're not gonna regulate these industries we're not gonna take technology and make it beneficial to a broader democracy we're just gonna let these predator companies do whatever the hell they want it will spike unemployment and then in exchange we'll give people a little bit of cash so they don't starve I don't that's not my politics but if it's on top the broader set but I think like look Bernie has a proposal on workers
(2:14:55) being on corporate boards which by the way again look at Germany they do that well it's not common sense in American capitalism but its enormous Lee effective and would be infinitely more empowering also if you don't pair that with rent control people don't like this point but no one's ever been answered me how that is certainly in urban areas if that happened in New York half of that check will just get sucked by a landlord immediately assuming Bernie does win you talked a lot about like foreign policy a
(2:15:25) huge I'll keep you out of Central Park thanks I appreciate it it's okay I can flee to Canada it's a good place but no have you heard of socialist border protection units we let them in but not you out but so you talk about India and China and Brazil and the world is kind of a messed up place right now there's a lot certainly terrible things going on for a while but you've got ethnic cleansing and who knows how many countries and Bernie's been attacked at least used to be attacked for being
(2:15:55) isolationist but he really doesn't seem like that anymore it in an interview he talked about defending Taiwan from China in a general election against krump he'll probably be the interventionist unlike defending NATO opposing Russian aggression and it seems a coup seem to me cuz like you know you talked about if you're a foreign tyrant a socialist seizing control of the like last superpower is your worst nightmare and so it seems like there's a part of the socialist left and of what Bernie says which i think is a great idea which
(2:16:22) would argue if he did win if he did gain control of the US military in the US Army you know you can avoid reckless wars and so on but he seems to be sketching out a much more aggressive use of US power to protect workers and protect minorities so you like well not so here's what I'd say and this is another thing that's gonna take major major work because a big problem that the left has in my opinion is that for decades you've had people like Noam Chomsky who like his no chances view us Empire and u.s. foreign policy I agree
(2:16:53) was completely I totally agree with 100% and because and it's not the left's fault it's just been so marginalized it hasn't sketched a view of what it would actually look like when you're in power that's what I have a friend Daniel best Knar who's at University of Washington and this is what he's working on is like what does it actually look like when you staff up an administration what does it actually look like when you have a national security council that cares about labor unions
(2:17:19) example so it's a it's a you know but it would be a complete rejection of so-called humanitarian intervention ISM which is obviously a total failure and it would and needs to be a serious to the extent that's possible pull back and cut of the military budget and demanding transparency of the intelligence agent like all of these things that are called they're not isolationist they're Democratic are fundamentally important to any durable projects including just even budgetarily but I think what he's
(2:17:56) saying in what people around him are saying and people are looking at like know it there's still gonna be a State Department so what does that do state Department that was gear I mean the only effective concentration of State Department power we've seen in decades was the Iran deal it was pretty good accomplishment right why I mean South Asia I don't agree at all like Richard Holbrooke is not my cup of tea but his whole upset with the Obama administration is why is it that you can fund all of these military expeditions
(2:18:28) and NATO you know but you don't give me any backing to try to come up with some type of comprehensive deal in the Afghan Pakistan India region and conflict right so I think I think though to be clear a lot of the things that we can articulate clearly are still harm reduction stopping the drone program Stein certainly people like me are gonna fight to stop trying to foment cooze and so on and again with like Russia of course and speak out and criticize this particular policy but of course we need to get back
(2:19:03) to trying to do like arms control treaties with them as an example and China yeah you can criticize but also China you're gonna need to do a hell of a lot of work with so I think you know he's the only one with even the remote sketchings of a map that fits the world were in I mean that that's the other thing too is that it's like you read these other people's plans and there's there's always you know subjective and objective and subjective I don't support humanitarian intervention I don't like you know us
(2:19:34) Empire I don't like militarism but I also I'm looking at it and being like what world are you living in like the this is ridiculous like did we are not where you are this is not the 1990s so but I don't think that he would be isolationist in the sense of you know we don't care like he called for fraying Lula the only presidential candidate to do that that is a totally appropriate use of a bullhorn should he sanctioned Brazil no right no I don't support that maybe maybe specific officials but not the country
(2:20:13) as a whole and L on Omar is actually doing some really interesting work on reforming sanctions okay because sanctions have been an interesting issue because for the most part they've been imposed in a lot of cases because the officials so what's an example of something Sanders admit to my foreign policy dog definitely said it is foreign policy but so what time they'll of yeah sorry what's it no gun what's an example something that a Sanders administration would do to like I don't know help
(2:20:46) Muslims an Indian well again the first step is the bully pulpit I mean again I'm telling it like it actually shocks me like he put out a tweet yesterday and it caused a riptide if you're president you can do that if you're president yes I think we as the left have to oppose you know the types of sanctions that you have that Iran and Venezuela right now are literally designed to try to like malnourished people I mean we have to oppose that but of course I have no problem with if he said you know Narenda Modi is not going
(2:21:24) to travel to the United States we have a list of people that you know we know are involved in these pogroms and or you know administering in Kashmir no yeah I I think he could certainly do things like that and I also think there's a lot of permission giving from and I don't think the world should look like this I think we should have a multipolar world but Obama gave Modi permission Obama normalized Modi on the world stage sticking with India when Modi was running for prime minister he was in 2005 several years before it began prime
(2:21:56) minister he wasn't allowed in the United States under the Bush administration because in 2002 there was a series of mass killings in a state that he governed which in the most generous scenario he looked the other way and let happen and there's many credible allegations that he allowed to happen and I'm talking about not to be too gruesome here but I just really want to say like cutting like babies out of women's stomachs  when he was running for prime minister in 2014 Barack Obama didn't just say of course
(2:22:28) he's the head of India we got to have a relationship it's a major country they wrote an op-ed together for The Washington Post he went to India they vetted him they had there's close to huge business opportunity there's a strategic you know that's capitalist foreign policy that's the first step this is how all of these dynamics work the neoliberal it will prioritize capital and doesn't really care about all these issues that they profess the care about then he normalizes him and now under Trump you know all he sits
(2:22:57) down with Trump and says you know you're a great businessman and the Muslims are dangerous great no problem so one president that would even at least just say actually what you're doing in Kashmir is unacceptable to us and we register that could motivate forces inside the country to be like actually we need to pull back from this but we can't scrap our Constitution well actually yeah I did have another question about what do you think the worst outcome of 2020 was but but which Bloomberg you think no the worst outcome
(2:23:26) is Trump beats Bernie that's them just because their story says we can if Bernie just on political terrain if Trump beats one of these other losers we can just be like again we  told you so and of course there's a massive double standard like if Bernie wins a on inspiring historical primary takes on all of these forces and takes on and incumbent president with a strong economy and it's close that's actually an objective massive accomplishment and he's recreated American politics and then all of these
(2:23:59) people haven't accomplished anything in decades other than decimating the Democratic Party and increasing income inequality issues so well we'll fight on but that would be my least favorite scenario yes yeah so then in terms of immigration I'm just wondering because my Trump was able to kind of go up a lot of economic populist stuff on trade and immigration obviously the ways implemented I don't know one can possibly support but so it's kind of exploded the issue on the left as well and it's kind of undermined like say
(2:24:34) like a Sanders traditional like economic populist or labor position so the foreign things kind of moved on from that so I'm just kind of curious where cuz I've heard you talk about a bit like in terms of short term just I think it said you'd do two things you that just grant everyone citizenship immediately and then demote as the border so I just beyond that like what sort of policy because I I mean I imagine that you're on favor of like it sort of a meritocratic Canadian model or something like that but kind of that labor
(2:25:11) position has been kind of eroded so well so I'll get to where I think you're right and where I think it's tricky in a second but I do don't I don't if you have the frame of the world I have the issue is always the boss and always capital it's not fellow workers so even someone like my buddy Sagar and jetty on the hill it's quite right-wing will say he doesn't think it will happen and it's not his path but yes if you implemented with Bernie said which is a universal minimum wage for every single worker in
(2:25:45) this country documented and not yes that would deal with it in a lot of ways if I hope I'm characterizing them correctly I think I am but you know he'll correct me if I'm wrong but to if you're in a situation where you can use surplus labor to drive down wages your enemy is not the other person laboring your enemy is the boss that's  your wages that's it so my politics around immigration are not just moral their material and strategic because what difference does it make likes okay so maybe there's some because
(2:26:19) even today even with the biggest economic even with the this terrorist white supremacy regime of immigration is that really helping people's wages no is that really doing anything and if you implement a quote-unquote merit-based system all you'll do is the people at the floor level are going to be  regardless because the reason they're there in a bad position is because of their labor value and how they're compensating the market and they don't have labor and governmental protections
(2:26:47) if you do a merit-based system all you're gonna do is all of a sudden say like hey you thought that an upper-middle class job that you thought you had sorry we have people that actually come undercut you and again that's a boss issue not a fellow immigrant issue so it's actually important to properly diagnose where the problem is coming from strategically I think that when you actually pull a vast majority of Americans it's interesting how liberal their views on immigration actually are they don't support open
(2:27:16) borders they don't you know like and which I'll get to that stuff in a second but the idea like I have a friend of the labor attorney and it's really interesting like he he's like no no people really do think that if you're undocumented you can just like walk to a post office and fill out some forms and they'll figure it out like they actually think that they don't understand how brutal the system is and they certainly don't support kidnapping children and they don't support this type of thing
(2:27:44) and they don't support you know but you know what are the racial implications of chain migration stuff that's come out about Bush about Trump wanting to have immigrants shot at the border I mean this stuff is really obscene and I actually really not only I think most people don't support it I certainly think anybody that would consider voting for any kind of Democrat you know it's gonna be the type of person that probably wouldn't support such brutality and racism I think this though when it
(2:28:13) comes to left this is another counterculture subculture of thing and I think like I think it's cool if people want to say that the dream and the vision is ultimately like some type of borderless world that's probably where I'm at in my utopia but I think going and demanding like specific inflammatory rhetoric around like there needs to be open borders is is just I think it's just a political disaster it's totally unnecessary it's validating group speak over national appeal and it's also
(2:28:50) ironically to me very problematic in a context where you know in the foreign policy to mention that indigenous people or you know so after President Lula fourth of what he's talking about is getting Brazilian sub Rena T respected and now there's like this first world discourse on like no borders man so I I don't like that and I also think this is another thing again I keep trying to distinguish between habit and like social etiquette and principles if somebody says to me I believe in borders and therefore I want to be able to
(2:29:23) kidnap children have people murdered or what okay we're on we're fighting that's it there isn't anything to talk about but if somebody says I want to feel that I live in a country that has a discernable map and some type of broad-based identity that isn't defined along racial or ethnic exclusion I could say hey I have a different vision of the world but I can't just say that that's wrong both because it's not we're over 90 percent of people are at and also because it's actually really quite
(2:29:54) arrogant I have the sense I could totally be wrong but I think like the more kind of provincial close-minded and I don't mean that pejoratively just mentally close-minded provincial people in this country including like me most of them working-class a lot of them don't want a more multicultural country they do want something that and in that sense they do favor something that's kind of racially exclusionary to use your which part were you saying about though because I I think well first of all I don't those are the people who
(2:30:26) supported Trump you know and well again I don't like that use of the word working-class because the working class is over multi-racial now on the other hands hey sweetie that's a another mix thing because like on one hand the working class is overwhelmingly multiracial and no I don't think I'm being really specific I do not think most Americans support having children in concentration camps oh right and on the other hands when I say no I actually think there is a difference I think that and in fact if
(2:31:03) you look at the polls amongst African Americans and Hispanics who are citizens they're not super liberal on immigration so there absolutely is a constituency of people who pretty definitionally in American context would not define a national identity as racially exclusive but certainly think that they have a border and da-da-da-da-da so yeah I think that's a distinction I make on certain issues it seems that the American public generally is pretty apathetic towards certain political issues and I thought something that was
(2:31:35) interesting was a couple of weeks ago when Secretary of State Pompeyo said to an NPR reporter that no one cares about Ukraine and asked them to find Ukraine on a map and so I was just curious where for an issue that is so important especially for the type of position of the United States has and considering that I mean we will be deciding the direction of foreign policy through the course of this election how can we motivate the American public to care about these issues that are pretty important but don't necessarily are seen
(2:32:09) in like people's everyday lives so two ways one I don't mean this as cynically as Pompeo means that but the truth is most people don't care and that's just like the truth right and frankly most people like people across the world care about the United States because the United States is you know affecting their life one way or another but I don't think most human beings are necessarily territorial ease like scanning the globe right so one way of dealing with that is I do think when we do you know media as an
(2:32:47) example like I'll use Lula again a lot of people got interested in Brazil in my audience because it was a compelling human being with an incredible story that opened the door to u.s. foreign policy history etc etc and on the other hand I'm pretty relaxed with like I think there's certain issues I want people to be aware of his dog is awesome I want people to be aware of and I want them to vote on and I want them to you know certainly not be war mongering or xenophobic or bigoted or whatever but I
(2:33:25) and in the long term we need to generate an educational system and paradigm because a foreign policy does desperately need to be democratized but I don't people don't need to be specialists in this and actually a lot of content that is generated in the Economist or NPR you know for people who think that they're getting super informed is like a disaster you know I mean it's funny like this piece that just came out in the Washington Post you know confirming that yes in fact the OAS put out a totally dishonest report
(2:34:00) and it was a coup in Bolivia and it's like you know and I'm just I was talking to my friend like what I would trade for a system of education where somebody just read one book on Latin American economy and US foreign policy they would know what happened in Bolivia because they have a historical understanding versus somebody who's reading 50 different news articles and this pundit said dad and this proof that doesn't give you any information there's no that's one thing that I tried to do in
(2:34:33) my show I try to give a context and paradoxically I actually think through context is ultimately more interesting than just like a bunch of random bits of information so I don't know I think long term it's a super big challenge because we need to democratize foreign policy so people need to better understand it and you know but maybe it's also just we hope that people have like a positive intention towards our friends in Ukraine or Zanzibar or Jamaica or whatever but I don't know if necessarily everybody's
(2:35:05) gonna always be up on it you know yeah but I'll think more about that I think that's an important question Michael thank you so much for giving so much of you guys
