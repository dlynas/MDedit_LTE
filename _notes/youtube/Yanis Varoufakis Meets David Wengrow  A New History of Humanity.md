Yanis Varoufakis Meets David Wengrow | A New History of Humanity
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI12ak1mmI)

## Transcript:

good evening good afternoon good morning
wherever you are in the world my name is
luke i'm a producer here at howto
academy and welcome to what i'm sure is
going to be an amazing event
today we are very lucky to be joined by
david wengrow professor of comparative
archaeology at university college london
and visiting professor at new york
university when david is not conducting
archaeological digs in africa in the
middle east he writes excellent books
his most recent the dawn of everything a
new history of humanity was co-written
with the late great david graber and is
out now today professor wengrow will be
in conversation with janice varaklakis
ex-finance minister of greece co-founder
of the international grassroots
democratization movement dm 25 and
current professor of economics at the
university of athens and greek member of
parliament
today david and giannis will be
discussing a very simple topic the
origins of human civilization
specifically how much we have gotten
wrong about our prehistory and how we
can use a new understanding to shape our
future so after a 45 minute or so
conversation david will take questions
from you the audience so please type any
you have wherever your q a function is
on your screen and just will get to them
a little bit later well that's more than
enough for me so without further ado it
is my absolute pleasure to welcome
janice rafakas and david wenger giannis
over to you
well thank you very much uh and thank
you to
uh how to academy thank you david for um
you know making yourself available to
have a chat with um
very enthusiastic reader of your book
i think it would be
remiss of us not to begin with a few
words
um
regarding the person who is not here
with us tragically
today tonight
um david graber
i have to
for the purposes of full disclosure say
that i actually never met david
i exchanged many emails
we had telephone conversations i
received his support and i tried to
return it in kind uh at difficult
moments in my life but i actually never
met him and tragically
it's not going to be so david
um
i'm passing the microphone over to you
with just one comment about your joint
effort with the other david
reading through the pages of what is
very clearly a substantial contribution
to our understanding of humanity
the one thing that i take away from it
at the level of sentiment
and
aesthetic as well
is that
it was written in a great spirit of fun
you seem to be having fun while writing
it
is that so
100
it was so much fun that when we finished
the first draft of the manuscripts
completely
um which was only about three weeks
before david passed away
we were both deeply depressed i can
vividly remember a phone call from uh
safiya where where my wife is from uh
david was in in london at the time i
think
where it was one of the most miserable
phone conversations i think either of us
didn't know it's finished you know what
what are we going to do for fun
now you know come possibly just go back
to our day jobs
um so we immediately actually david uh
insisted
i don't know why but he fixated upon the
idea of writing three sequels whether it
was some kind of tulkian fixation
if it was a tulkian fixation it was all
topsy-turvy because of course the first
one's meant to be rather short and then
you do the lord of the rings but i think
we we did the lord of the rings first
maybe and then anyway so he he
immediately said well we just we just
carry on it's not finished you know we
hand it over to the publisher and we
immediately um we just keep going
because it's full of these concepts
which are
um
as we as we quite freely admit you know
that they're not fully tried out they
haven't been uh road tested to anything
like the degree that that um we uh
we would want them to be and
one of my uh uh hopes for the book uh is
that some of these ideas will be taken
up by other people not necessarily
researchers but
also artists or just anyone who's really
interested um and extended to other
parts of the world other periods of of
history so it's not a um despite the uh
the superficial appearance of the book
um
it doesn't claim to be an authoritative
or comprehensive
study
um but it does claim to be a
new
way or at least an invitation to a new
way of looking at human history in the
history of civilization
well it must be quite daunting to be
writing about
societies and communities
from the ice age all the way to the
the earliest of states
and i wonder how you know
how you you pluck up the courage to do
that but
it is remarkable how you have
made prehistory sexy because prehistory
is usually something that you know we
just
um
dismiss at least us who are not
archaeologists we're not anthropologists
we go through it quickly it is
the kind of straw man and woman that we
conjure up in order to build up our own
history of history um so prehistory is
usually dismissed as a homogeneous
boring
rather
primitive kind of thing yeah that is set
aside sort of
primordial soup as we say somewhere from
which structure one day uh emerged but
the funny thing is it's it's really not
difficult to make prehistory sexy if you
actually look at the facts and and the
details um something we say very early
on in the book i think right at the
beginning
is that the
conventional narratives which most of us
are familiar with of human history
quite apart from being divorced from a
lot of the facts they just make human
history unnecessarily boring and dull
they flatten everything out it's almost
as if it were
a prerequisite for telling those stories
that we turn our ancestors into these
kind of cardboard cutouts who lived a
long time ago
in societies that were really nothing
like ours
in any sense even in the sense that they
weren't really conscious that they were
building societies at all around any
particular set of values or any notion
of the human good or the human bad
but you know we're asked to imagine
people who were simply adapting to their
environments or who were taking part in
some kind of
inexorable process that we can
understand as a process of evolution but
which they themselves were completely
unconscious of supposedly
and this is the um i think this is what
you're referring to if i understand you
correctly by this idea that you know
nothing much happened before the
invention of agriculture
whereas actually what archaeologists
have discovered
over the past 40 or 50 years is that
this couldn't be further from the truth
it doesn't matter where you dig or
survey everywhere from
japan to central america what you see
before the so-called agricultural
revolution is nothing like that at all
it's not this picture of
culturally deprived people living in
some state of
simplicity
actually you see this incredible variety
just to give you a couple of examples
in in north america and the state of
louisiana
there are earthworks which are three and
a half thousand or so years old at a
place called poverty points which are
really the size of an urban sort of
conurbation put together by people who
didn't practice farming hunter-gatherers
who came together probably at specific
times of year and built something that
resembles a kind of series of
amphitheaters and we must be talking
about publics gathering in their
thousands
fit even remotely the idea that before
the coming of agriculture all he had was
egalitarian tiny bands of 10 or 20
people roaming around the landscape
quite the opposite you know this is a
kind of hunter-gatherer metropolis
before farming and there are similarly
striking examples that deviate from that
stereotypical
notion of hunter-gatherers on every
continent of the world
when i first read uh david's other
great book that the first five thousand
years as an economist
i felt so relieved that i was not alone
that somebody else believed
or understood that the barter myth was
just about our myth and that money did
not
simply
correct the failures of bada but it
predates you know if the the whole
notion of fictional capital
um
predates even agriculture or coincides
with the invention of agriculture so
yeah david busted that myth the bardem
beautiful in that book and what you seem
to be doing with uh the dawn of
everything is that you're busting the
other myths that um
there is some kind of vector historical
vector taking us from
simplicity to complexity
prehistory prehistoric societies were
simple
and boring and
with technological change
we had hierarchy because we had
complexity
by demonstrating as we just said
from using the example of louisiana that
there was plenty of complexity back
there
then
suddenly the notion that
autocratic hierarchical regimes
are the result of technological change
because of the complexity that is
created
and
that is busted just as
beautifully as the the barter myth was
busted by david's
previous work
well we try and pay attention to the
structure that exists in both camps both
in the camp of hierarchy and in the camp
of
anti-authoritarian or more egalitarian
kinds of social movements
because i think you're quite right the
the dominant story that's told of human
history
makes hierarchy seem like an intrinsic
feature of structure and vice versa so
that everything else is kind of
amorphous it doesn't really have a
direction there's one very striking
example that we talk about in the book
of these remarkable settlements north of
the black sea which are as ancient as
the first cities in the middle east in
ancient mesopotamia
but they're generally not defined as
cities they don't have a part in that
dominant narrative of how we went from
small scale to large-scale societies
because the dominant idea of a city is
precisely some kind of ancient
megalopolis with some equivalent to a
financial district in the middle of it
whether it's palaces or temples um or
factories
but in fact these uh other kinds of
settlements although they're on an urban
scale they're completely decentralized
tens of thousands of people coming
together
finding a way of coexisting
without any of those traces of
structural inequality they actually the
settlement plans look like these great
concentric rings of houses
and of course you know then immediately
our minds turn to another stereotype
which is that equality means homogeneity
equality must mean some kind of you know
rather drab existence based on the
principle that everyone is the same but
actually when archaeologists go down to
the details of people's family lives
their domestic lives within these big
egalitarian cities they find quite the
opposite actually every house is a
little bit different it has a different
uh aesthetic style you can see it in the
pottery and the everyday crockery the
equipment used for eating and drinking
it looks more like some sort of vast
artist's colony or something and there's
another example of this that we talk
about in um
in mexico in the valley of mexico the
ancient city of tertiwakan
which seems to have developed the most
incredible project of
social housing with people living
quite uniformly
to very very high standards a very good
quality of life
and again when we talk about social
housing or public housing i guess the
image that comes to most people's minds
is of you know a great tower block that
flattens out all the differences between
people but in this case we know that
this was a multi-ethnic
city uh of about 100 000
individuals who spoke multiple languages
came from different parts of
mesoamerica
um and that diversity uh doesn't seem to
have been opposed in any way to the
creation of a more egalitarian
and equal
equally distributed urban infrastructure
so we spend quite a bit of time in the
book
tackling those binaries you know the
things that we assume must necessarily
be opposed to one another actually the
evidence of history and archaeology
often shows that they don't need to
exist in opposition
and that other things which which we we
tend to think of as unities actually did
begin in opposition to each other like
our whole notion of states and what is a
what is a state
for example
now of course one of the
contributions of the book is that it
reminds us
you haven't discovered that but you
remind us very vividly of the tendency
that we all have
to look to the past and project our own
assumptions
on
long-dead people and communities
economists are even worse at least
mainstream economists they project
troublesome cruiser upon everyone and
they create the the you know the concept
of the liberal capitalist individual uh
whenever they see you know
they excavate a site and they discovered
a 3 000
old dead person
uh
but
just to play there was advocate david um
when when you use terms like social
housing
or egalitarian cities
are you not opening yourself up to the
criticism that
you're projecting your own
political
ideals
upon fines that
may or may not contain evidence to back
up your own assumptions
well i think it's about uh i mean it's a
reasonable point and and we've certainly
i've certainly had to deal with
criticisms of that nature i think it's
about where you set the evidence bar
and whether that is done in uh in an
equitable way
so if you want to talk about um a
hierarchical city
a city with
kings and aristocrats and
and centrally
organized top-down administration and so
on
the evidence bar in archaeology is very
low you can more or less look at any
large settlement and say oh almost the
automatic assumption is that any kind of
large-scale organization must be some
variation on a state
or a kingdom or an empire
um and you're not really asked to
substantiate that or subject it to a
great deal of scrutiny but the minute
that you try to identify something that
isn't
that kind of stratified hierarchical
structure it seems to me that the the
expectation
of proof uh goes up uh inordinately now
this is nothing to do with empiricism
it's nothing to do with science i think
it's to do with quite the opposite it's
to do with some very ingrained uh quite
unreflective tendencies to assume that
hierarchy is normative
in any kind of large-scale social
agglomeration
so
the
accusation i think it thrusts both ways
for example
i mean it's quite funny that you talk
about economics
one of the the things that motivated us
to get going on this project was a whole
spate of books and studies that came out
directly in the wake of the the big
financial crash 2008 nine
on the the roots of inequality
and many of these had a strong
historical dimension they weren't
content with just looking at what's
happened since the industrial revolution
they try and pursue a thesis about the
origins of inequality all the way back
to the ice age or beyond
but they do it through a kind of
economization of history applying tools
taken from books like piketty's work on
capital the guinea is it guinea or genie
coefficient i can finally ask somebody
who actually knows the answer it's the
genie the genie goldfish gene it's it
was an italian economist right
yeah well the english call it i mean i'm
anglo-trained we in the anglosphere call
it the genie coefficient coefficient so
you know you actually have studies by
serious people with full academic
credentials tracing genie coefficients
for ice age mammoth hunters
and telling us what their uh you know
projected income level would have been
in dollars and cents
um now um
of course they did do they assume
capitalism would have been a fixture
from
from the ice age um
i would like to put the question for you
if you read charles darwin's
introduction
okay um
to to to to to to his famous book here
you'll find that thomas mathis is the
one who actually guided him to the idea
of the struggle of population
so the whole idea of natural selection
comes from a victorian perspective of
capitalism
now it so happened that in the case of
darwin he didn't harm him because this
fallacious
assumption led him to the correct theory
but um
the capacity of those who have been
nurtured within capitalism to see
capitalism in prehistory is
mind-boggling so you know in a way i
think you've just answered the question
that you asked me i mean if there's a
criticism to be leveled about
um projecting one's own biases you
couldn't possibly find a more obvious
example than this kind of uh plutocratic
uh
notion of human history i mean it's so
obviously a reflection of our own
preconceptions with private property
with with money um and with growth uh in
the sense that the guinea code gini
coefficients um you know they always
come out very low at the start of the
story so we have to imagine ice age
hunter-gatherers with um you know
incredibly low incomes i think the it
was it was projected as something like a
dollar fifty a day or something crazy um
i don't know what this is even based on
but it's so obviously a reflection of
our own preconceptions that i'd like to
think that you know
we're quite transparent about this in
the book we actually say
well we don't really have a language for
this
an egalitarian city what do we mean do
we mean democracy do we mean a republic
how do we tell without written sources
so we're quite open and frank about this
but what we don't try to do
which i think
you can find in some other studies is to
just try and unsee it all as if it's not
there
so where we have things like
aristocratic burials in the last ice age
that look like royal burials we don't
just ignore them and say oh they're all
living in egalitarian societies we ask
how is it possible to understand the
existence of a society that treats some
of its members like royalty some of the
time but never seems to coalesce into
any kind of permanent
stratified social formation how could
one understand that and that's where the
anthropology
and david greber's deep understanding of
the ethnographic record was essential
because it's we found it's not really
enough to just pile up all of this data
and all of this these facts this
information
conceptually you have to make a shift
away from that rather simplistic
one-dimensional view of human societies
to understand something that's much more
complex and much more interesting well
this is what i enjoyed about your book
that um prehistory emerges as a
fantasmagoria
of uh different political forms with
actual people in it people who are
reflecting on the societies that they're
constructing
one of the
expressions
phrases that david
coined which
i have to say i plagiarize often
both in academic
terms but also primarily these days
because i'm a politician for better or
worse for wes actually um in politics
and that's the the his famous phrase
that everything could have been
different or could be different
and that that comes out
very distinctly in your book that um
yes there was
a timeline there were developments but
at every point in time things could have
been different there's no the opposite
of of determinism
and
i think that that's very refreshing and
very good but again let me play devi's
advocate
a bit of personal history here
from a very young age i was being
bombarded by my father
who is uh who was
he passed away recently
he was
a chemical engineer a metallurgist
but his real love was archaeometry he
worked for decades
doing research in a geometry and he kept
bombarding me
based on fines in the ancient greek
realm
about the importance of metals
so for instance i remember when i was
eight nine he would take me to these uh
digs in thessaly and in macedonia and
various places and you would he would
show me various layers and you see look
nothing much changes in terms of the
artifacts that we find
until
humans
learn how to harden iron
the iron age
uh and once
once we move from copper to hardened
iron to steel
then
history is measured discounted
not no longer in the millennia
but in the centuries and then later on
in the decades
and he had a very strong case for that
which
i have to say has influenced me from a
very young age what do you say to that
well i think it's um
it's it's a way of understanding history
which actually has a history that
probably goes all the way back to the
ancient greeks in terms of thinking of
history in terms of
not so much technological phases as
technological ages
the age of iron the age of bronze
and
it's it's a way of thinking about
history that's i think very very deeply
rooted in in our culture in our
education
um
where we understand the development of
human societies as a series of ruptures
often linked to the creation of things
like the discovery of advanced
metallurgy the invention of agriculture
the origins of writing systems
so the general picture you get of
history is of uh
long periods in which not a great deal
changes in in fundamental terms in terms
of the way things generally work uh in
people's interactions and then there are
supposedly a few key moments
breakthroughs revolutions which change
everything and afterwards nothing can be
the same
even the sense of time as your father
was intimating
changes uh people's understanding of
themselves changes fundamentally
um
and i think this is very much uh the way
that most people tend to think of the
the shape of human history the shape of
time
one of the points we make in the book
is that actually the evidence we have
now
suggests that things we considered
revolutionary things that we considered
the the consequences of major
technological changes were actually
happening all the time on much shorter
time scales so for example
the idea that with the coming of
agriculture
comes the notion of private property
and hierarchy um
actually what we can see now is that
non-agricultural societies were often
switching and alternating
between those particular concepts and
notions on a very regular basis even on
a seasonal basis within the same annual
round a society might flip over from
something very unequal and hierarchical
to something very uh communal and
egalitarian
so we even have examples of han together
societies
which practiced household slavery
and other hunter-gatherer societies
which managed to abolish it
and these are fundamental
transformations i mean at a
philosophical level they're really
things that we tend to think of as
happening maybe once or twice in the
course of human history
the origins of democracy you know we we
tend to think this is something that
happened very rarely fifth century
happens and then you know maybe one or
two other examples actually we find
evidence for it in all sorts of places
and we talk about this a bit in the book
so i think that that basic idea
of human history is a series of periodic
ruptures and then nothing much happens
um
is is
difficult to fit these days with the
evidence that we have and it also has
consequences for the way that we think
about technological change today
you know the assumption that something
like artificial intelligence
is necessarily going to change
everything we don't quite know how but
there's an assumption that we're not
controlling the technology we're not the
ones who are fully in command of this
and that we're going to be sort of
propelled
into another age where everything is
different but we can't really show how i
think this is the message you get from a
lot of books about the broad sweep of
history is of humanity
kind of stumbling haphazardly into these
discoveries and then having to live with
the consequences it's a notion that goes
all the way back to the enlightenment
and writers like jean-jacques rousseau
but what we show in the book is that
actually many of those key innovations
were created much more in a spirit of
conscious experimentation
even of play playing around
people inventing agriculture and then
deciding that perhaps it doesn't really
suit them and going back to foraging or
perhaps combining them in all kinds of
ways that we would hardly have imagined
so i think that would be my uh not
retort but response to uh
to your father's
notion of
science and technology
don't you believe that capitalism
changed
human societies in a fundamental way
and has proven that
there can be such a great transformation
to use
a well-used expression uh which um
you know
of course there are
there are movements backwards and
forwards uh
there are oscillations
but nevertheless
it's like an iron force which is uh
which has transformed every part of the
world in a matter in a manner which
can hardly be described as
experimentation playful experimentation
and choice
well i think you know
somebody pointed out um it's what you've
just said is exactly the kind of thing
people used to say about divine kingship
it seemed entirely impossible to
conceive of life without it it was
preordained it was literally no i'm
certain
i'm not saying that captains cannot be
overthrown or
altered or transcended what i am asking
is don't you think that over the last
200 years or more or less
there was a fundamental transformation
of almost every society in the world as
a result of the
coming of the capitalist mode of
production
undoubtedly but i don't think that
necessarily obliges us to uh to adopt a
perspective that i think it was mark
fisher called capitalist realism uh in
fact as i think you yourselfers point
have pointed out and and as david
pointed out in many ways capitalism in
in in the uh the pure sense the sense
that that was theorized by marx and and
others um is over we're not living in
that kind of uh system anymore um
david called the present system
something closer to managerial feudalism
um
where really things are not being
dictated by things like the principle of
free and open competition
uh for example um but by something that
in many ways resembles the the old
pre-revolutionary
uh regimes of uh
including those rates of inequality that
people are so careful to uh to measure
now uh i mean the uh the gap uh between
the the haves and the have-nots and also
the way that uh that those who are
better off think of themselves uh seems
very reminiscent of some of those
pre-revolutionary notions that uh you
know we're almost a different species
well you you know i can't argue against
that because um as you said it's a point
i'm on the record uh i call
i think in my view if i may say this
2008 was the capitalism that which 1991
was the communism it was the beginning
of its end and its trans transformation
into what i call
i call it techno fidelis but it really
doesn't matter um
but this is not about me it's about you
and your book so let me go back to um
it seems to me that you are
aiming at you're taking aim and quite
correctly so
at a deterministic view of history of
prehistory and history
where people are the play things of
forces beyond their control
and you you want to take the idea that
everything at any
juncture in time could be different
and has been different
and could revert or move to something
else and so on so the notion of
collective choice and individual choice
as opposed to the deterministic forces
of history view and i think that is fine
but
sometimes you give me the impression of
going too much into the choice realm
um forgetting the importance of the
the forces that are nevertheless
constraining us and that makes me think
of the the famous line by marx in the
18th round
in which he says that you know humans he
said men but today we would say humans
make history but not as they please not
under circumstances of their choice and
is it not important
would you agree with me on this that it
is
uh crucial to emphasize equally
the we make history so we have we have
we have choices
and therefore moral responsibility but
at the same time
that
material
conditions social relations of
production means of production
the way we organize life
these are not ways in which we as human
beings communities individuals
have chosen
well we actually quote in the book that
exact line from marx which we very much
agree with about people
making their own
societies their own histories but not
necessarily under conditions of their
own choosing i think what we're arguing
against is is not so much determinism as
teleology
yeah of course the the t loss of history
we
we don't actually ascribe to some kind
of completely laissez-faire notion of
people uh you know making choices in
some kind of whimsical way actually
we're very careful you can't really
avoid it with archaeology it's
inherently materialist
i mean the evidence is all it's all
physical it's all tangible um which is
not to say one then has to adopt a
materialist perspective
but all of the the reconstructions that
we offer
they very much come out of the
ecological the physical the material
conditions of people's lives this idea
of seasonal alternations between
different social and political forms for
example is completely rooted
in the physical aggregation and
disaggregation of human societies within
a landscape
um
are you still with me i'm conscious that
the wife i might be playing no i'm not
completely with you
just reading some of the questions that
keep coming because i have to convey
them to you but i'm listening to you as
well so go ahead but what we don't
subscribe to is um and what we we
actually
go into some detail about why we don't
subscribe to it is the idea that uh
modes of livelihood modes of production
um are a determining factor
in social and political forms
so we actually look at the origins of
that notion
of the idea that it's useful or
informative to divide history and human
societies according to those kinds of
classifications hunter-gatherers
agriculturalists urban industrial
civilizations
we spend a lot of time showing where
that notion originally came from
um and why in many ways
it doesn't work
in terms of actually explaining the
various transformations that we see
in
in
chains of causality
which just don't seem to fit
that kind of materialist perspective so
we're not anti-materialist but we are
anti-that kind of stage-like
technologically driven
notion of change
well in a sense you know rosa luxembourg
put it from a left-wing perspective
quite aptly when she said it's going to
be social is more barbarism that is the
most anti-teleological statement that
i've heard
is that
it's whatever we make of it
nothing is prefabricated
before we open it up to the questions
there is
a very intriguing at least to me
part of the book or argument in the book
which you call the indigenous critique
um it's something i i
knew nothing about until you read your
book and i found it absolutely
fascinating
this is maybe you can speak to this but
i i was uh very surprised
to read that you know the the the
hypothesis
that the enlightenment was
substantially
informed by a critique of the west
of europe
by indigenous scholars or intellectuals
native americans in north america
whose views and criticism of europe
of colonial europe
were conveying to jesuit priests or
whoever it was that
spoke to them who then brought these
views to europe
to europe which
had not been imbued yet by the spirits
or the notions of freedom of democracy
of rights and so on and that this
indigenous critique
was played an important role in bringing
about the enlightenment that is
an audacious hypothesis if i may say
can you speak to this uh it's not a new
yes i mean it's well it's new to me
because i'm an economist right so you
know by definition i'm uneducated
it actually uh
it actually is
well established and and well accepted
um by scholars of the european
enlightenment and of the 18th century
that there was such a critique and that
it played a very prominent role in the
writings of european philosophers of the
time often in the form of dialogues
um with an exotic uh
other person who casts a skeptical
critical eye back on european
civilization and points out all of its
faults and almost every major
enlightenment philosopher wrote a
dialogue of this kind putting these
critiques into the mouths of exotic
so-called savages
what is not generally accepted
is that the exotic
other character in these dialogues
might have actually reflected any kind
of reality it's assumed to be as
fictional as disney's pocahontas if you
like
but
what we try to do in the book is to give
some
serious attention
to a contrasting view
which has been developed by historians
particularly in canada
and north america over the last few
decades which went back to some of those
first-hand accounts of europeans jesuits
traders travellers soldiers who spent
decades in the americas learning native
languages marrying trading colonizing
killing and otherwise interacting with
local people
and who have pointed out that actually
in at least one very important case
these dialogues contain a very strong
resonance with the kind of societies
that existed at that time particularly
in the northeastern parts of north
america the great lakes region of what's
now canada and upstate
new york
so um really what we're saying
i think shouldn't be that controversial
we're simply saying that there's no
particular reason
to believe
that europeans were purely in a dialogue
with themselves about these things
especially when the philosophers in
question are saying uh we look to the
people of this distant region as an
inspiration for these notions of freedom
and equality now what's kind of
interesting is that this comes back to
the question of materialism and modes of
production because something we describe
in in the the second chapter of the book
i think is how the whole notion of
history is modes of production was
basically created as a kind of counter
reaction a very conservative counter
reaction to the force and the power of
that indigenous critique as it washed
over european intellectual and literary
circles and we can actually pinpoint how
this begins with the economist and uh
sort of physiocrat and robert tilgo who
in many ways is the originator of that
stage like technologically driven notion
of human history the economization of
the past it really begins there
and the point he makes
in his studies on universal history
is that perhaps the reason
that some of these uh
native american and other remote
societies can enjoy such levels of
freedom and equality and women's rights
and all the rest of it and can live
without things like money and monarchy
is not because they are in any way
advanced or ahead of us or superior to
us
but because they are in fact primitive
they are technologically beneath us in
some kind of evolutionary ladder
organized precisely according to
principles of productivity and material
production
which invariably placed europe at the
pinnacle at the top
because that's where it was in terms of
just physically being able to garner
huge amounts of labor by coercion or
other means and produce and export and
trade
so
i think there is a relationship between
that kind of materialist notion of
history and the the response to
this indigenous critique which was
essentially to take it out of the
present world altogether
to relegate it to an earlier stage in
time
and
i think this is a very interesting
moment now
where we can go back to some of that
material
and actually try to tell that story in a
different way which also opens up
different perspectives for us
well perhaps this is a good moment for
me to bring in a question from the
audience then i will ask another
question
about european philosophers but i think
it's quite up uh the latest question
that i got here from the chat
and is this and i think it's better
is there a tendency to discount
significant scholarly influence to the
development of the enlightenment by
former colonized indigenous peoples of
south america
because you're talking about north
america
and you know south america central
america there was a lot more of inter
marriage more a lot more intercourse
maybe because of catholicism as opposed
to protestantism
would you like to to speak to this this
is a great example of what i mean by the
book being
exploratory it's a beginning it doesn't
claim to be comprehensive the reason we
focus on north america and on that
particular area of north america uh is
because that's precisely the area that a
french philosopher in the middle of the
18th century would most likely have been
reading about and familiar with it was
part of the the colonies known then as
new france
um but absolutely the you know for every
case like that
we should expect and we should we should
be looking for hundreds of other cases
in completely different parts of the
world just recently a friend and
colleague of mine in rio in brazil sent
me uh some
an article about a whole series of
letters
written
in
tupi transcribed from a tupi language
so
we're now talking about indigenous
societies in in the southern hemisphere
which are earlier than the material i'm
talking about and which seem to be along
very similar lines of indigenous
perspectives
looking at the behavior of the
portuguese of the colonists and making
some very pertinent assessments about
the nature of their social lives and why
we may not want to
align ourselves with them so absolutely
you know i i think this is really the
tip
of a much larger
iceberg
and
would love to hear more examples from
other parts of the world
and now to the question that i had
before reading that particular one
concerning european enlightenment
philosophy
you you you concentrate on
two philosophers
thomas hobbes the very pessimistic view
of um uh the state of nature of and
ancient societies or
primitive societies being
ones in which
a waterfall against all prevailed and
life was nasty buddhist and short which
is clearly anthropologically absolutely
utterly ridiculously wrong but
nevertheless it was important for him in
order to to build his
um
proto-liberal theory
of the legitimate state of leviathan and
then you have jean-jacques rousseau who
has a completely different view of the
state of nature in which we're all
fantastically beautiful wonderful people
and then
civilization uh
ensures that we all end up end up in
chains and then you connect
it seems to me
if i'm wrong you connect um
contemporary thinkers like stephen
pinker um with hobbes and fukuyama with
russo and so on but
from my perspective allow me to bring in
my own uh
um thinking now thinking that goes back
many decades
maybe the most i mean you're right turbo
is crucial
in terms of the projection of
homo economics to the past
but
for me the most significant
scholar and philosopher
especially from
anglo scottish sphere
who is a foundational thinker for
contemporarily liberalism or
libertarianism is david hume
who is david
david hume and i know adam smith copy
that
david hume there's nothing original okay
at least when it comes to
the theory of moral sentiments so hume
has this view that very similar to yours
and to mine
in disturbing ways because he's got this
idea that we never needed a state
uh social conventions evolved naturally
allowed us to reduce conflict
and those social conventions were
sufficient in order to create
spontaneous order
a kind of anarchic
syndicalist
communal
relationship between human beings
and
reason
our rationality
has been overblown by people like
rousseau and descartes it's not it's
it's it's an important instrument but
just an instrument
all the
everything that's happening which is
interesting and good about society
happens at the level of social
conventions that learn to
you know regulate passions
now
that to the untrained eye
sounds very much like you
and yet
it is the foundation
of the most ardent
fundamentalist
free market capitalist
philosophy that one can think of
now how do you escape the embrace
of david hume
well just quickly going back to the
other guys it's not us
projecting rousseau and hobbs onto
pinker and fukuyama they do it
themselves explicitly i don't know
okayama says russo was right yeah it
says
right you know
um that's the only reason they come up
really in in the book initially um is is
to deal with the neo-neo versions of
those those arguments
um there's another connection with david
hume which i i only became um aware of
quite recently which is around the um
the notion of property
i think it's um it's hume
who points to the analogy
between
private property
and uh the notion of the sacred
um
this sort of mumbo-jumbo of what
property really is is has this kind of
superstitious mysterious character um
which is also very similar actually to
something that we argue in the book
which is that property relations are not
some kind of logical consequences of the
adoption of farming and agriculture
but actually there are notions of
private property if they resemble
anything else it's really this idea of
the sacred of something taboo something
which is surrounded by a kind of
invisible force field um
i think you know where we part company
with hume and with other
overlaps let's say with that whole canon
of european thought
is that we do try to take seriously
contributions to social thought that
come from completely outside that canon
and this becomes absolutely crucial
when it comes to the topic of freedom
which is central to the arguments that
we make
and we explicitly juxtapose the
kinds of
freedoms the notions of freedoms that we
find in the philosophy of the
enlightenment and european philosophy
which
tend to be either freedom
from rule freedom from sovereignty
or freedom at the price of another's
captivity
freedom from slavery
which has a very broad connotation at
that time slavery meaning not just uh
chattel slavery but being at the whim of
any other person
what we talk about a lot in the book are
other notions of freedom which come from
outside the european tradition entirely
and which really have nothing much to do
with that particular idea of freedom as
the right to
use and abuse
one's property for example
which is very much rooted in in the
european legalistic uh tradition going
back to medieval and ancient roman
precedence uh
freedom uh in the sense of ownership and
possession
we talk instead
about three basic uh principles of
freedom
which are nowhere to be found in in that
tradition but really come out of all
these other examples that we consider in
the course of the book
of people enacting forms of freedom
that today we find very difficult to
imagine as the basis of societies for
example the freedom to move away from
one's surroundings and be welcomed in
some distant location we were talking
earlier about freedom of movement and
you know the extent to which the world
now is carved up into so many tiny
impenetrable silos and this is what we
call globalization what we show in the
book is that actually the the big
picture of human history is really the
reverse of that we we don't start off in
tiny isolated little silos human beings
start off in these great
coalitions of societies and there's a
process of shrinkage
which basically ends with modern nation
states and the divisions between them
and hard barriers
so that's a very concrete form of
freedom
um just the freedom to to move away and
be received
in a hospitable way somewhere else um so
i think you know those are the kind of
points
um
where we don't find ourselves limited by
hume or by the the european canon
you know this is the anthropological
face of the book is that it tries to to
step outside of that entire
framework of thought
and all its disputes
kevin kevin andrews is asking how long
how long do you think it will take
before the ideas in the book will be
reflected in our museums
oh what a great question i think
museums are responsible for an awful lot
i mean it's it's partly from the
experience of going into big
metropolitan museums including the
metropolitan museum in in new york
that i think people come away with this
idea that for most of human history the
world was carved up into great kingdoms
and empires and um that
you know this is what the the ancient
world was like
um
precisely because museums have tended to
focus on fancy monuments and on the
activities of aggrandizers and people
who were proclaiming themselves masters
of whichever universe they inhabited
i think um museums also epitomize a
principle that we talk about in the book
which is how
violence
the violence done in war in colonization
goes from being something ephemeral to
being something structural
because of course what museums have done
historically
is not just take appropriate and curate
but also care for
objects conserve them
and of course the you know this is the
the crux of the debate about ownership
and repatriation
um so i think the the transformation of
museums is absolutely central as a
cultural
project
to wider transformations in society and
i think it's already happening to an
extent
um
i was very impressed on a visit a few
years ago to new zealand
reading about the incorporation
of indigenous
maori values into the whole notion of
what a museum is and that ownership and
possession doesn't necessarily imply
commodification
or the right to put something in a glass
case and just display it
as you choose it's more about curation
and consultation
so i think that there are lots of steps
being taken in those directions and i
think it is inevitable
that they will hit the british museum
and the other major metropolitan museums
of the world
it's coming and i think the sooner they
get their heads around it the better
it's unlikely that they are ready for it
but let's see how that pans out
um
our time is coming to
a close
uh and i have to finish with um a
bittersweet question are you going to be
writing the sequels
oh uh i don't know janis i can't give
you a an honest uh response to that
because it's all been such a a whirlwind
you know since david passed away and the
book coming out and so on that i don't
personally feel that i've had a chance
to reflect uh really on much of what's
happened in the last year i think a lot
of people are in that position right now
for a whole host of other reasons the
pandemic among them
so i'm not making any any decisions of
of that kind at all i'm just um
trying to do justice to the work that
david and i did together i think that's
what he'd like me
uh to be spending a good chunk of my
time
doing and trying to get the the message
of the book out there without him as as
clearly as i can manage
um
and at some point there'll be a chance
to uh to sit back and uh
and reflect and also take in
the responses many many many responses
uh
right across the spectrum from elated to
contemptuous
and they all deserve to be thought about
but that's going to take a little while
so i i can't give you a straight answer
perfectly understandable but i have no
doubt that at some point point something
is going to be written
up by you which is going to
not provide closure to the work but at
least
add a few important vignettes to it
uh david um thank you so much
the one hour we've been allotted has
just passed it passed as if it was five
minutes as far as i'm concerned i hope
the same thing applies to our audience
thank you everyone for watching for
asking questions i didn't
do justice to all of them i tried to to
pick
a couple that
seemed pertinent
i seek the forgiveness of everyone else
thank you very much
it was great to meet you
