my people are part of the revolution in the
Canary Islands
with respect to the Cuban legal system
the first valid thing that we must highlight
is that Cuba does have a constitution
unlike what is said outside
cubas that cuba there is no constitution in
cuba the law does not exist in cuba they work
on the basis of discretion or
considerations to the appreciation of the
authority of a person or of some
people that is totally false or so it
has a constitution and it does have any
system  legal
is now greater than the discreet whatever
there is expulsion is used as matter in

agriculture executive opens color does not
want that small day and then expand it
does not have to be several previous so
that it gives us everything  It does not say whether it was
developed nationally in
research positions in Granma,
Granma province. There was an event where it was
demonstrated that very good
results were obtained by applying humus, which is the
name of the love of man. The
Cuban constitution is the result of a
revolutionary process that began as an
institution.  or from the institution
of the state to be formed once the
power to revolutionize the sum of power in
1959,
the Cuban constitution is not
exactly from the year 1959, as for the
constitution when the Cuban revolution
triumphed, it required a whole process, the
revolution of radicalization until  In
1976, this process was consolidated
through the Cuban socialist constitution,
which dates back to 1970.
The freedom you have is for
life.
In 1989, everything changed with the collapse of the
socialist camp
and the economy
plummeted.  between 89 and 93 between 1989 93
our economy falls
falls falls falls until it lost 34 7% of its
wealth in just three years this crisis
for the Cubans of my generation is going to
be like the crisis of the 1920s
for the Germans it is a  very
deep crisis that had a very
strong meaning in the fall in the population's standard of living.
For example, the lack of
electricity was 16 hours a day. The
new one, the entire productive system was paralyzed.
Food
substantially decreased. Transportation collapsed in the
city of La  Havana had 30,000 departures
every day and that dropped to
3,000. Millions of
bicycles were imported and people traveled based on
that. It was a very difficult situation.
They have and in the civil service civil
service no military service boys they have

hello
but here
and we were kings and you know it was in
Bahrain from a part of that constitution
he responded  to how radical
the revolution had to be when until that
moment a product of the bear, the hostility,
the aggression of the United States
and the need that it had played in its
moments to adjust to the
Soviet system to the Soviet political,
economic and legal system

health guys against the wind and protect

despite the global crisis the economy
grew by 4.3 percent this year the
government's estimate is that the
economy will grow by 6 percent in my
opinion it is a very optimistic estimate
the world bank
estimates for cuba a  growth of 3%
most
Latin American countries either do not grow or grow
very little our economy
grew last year but we suffered the
consequences of the crisis well you
know that the price of
raw materials fell nickel in the second
line of income  For our country, the
price of nickel fell from 50 thousand dollars
per ton to around 8 thousand dollars
per ton. Due to this concept of
losses, we had losses of 250
million.
The truth is,
I wish we don't have to buy
fertile fertilizers in from the same
o  a subscription therefore the
Cuban constitution of the year 1976 to some extent
resembles or seemed to be assimilated
has a very great resemblance to the
Soviet constitutions the
Soviet constitution and of the former
Soviet socialist republics
however and what I am going to say is
important
a  once red once
the Soviet economic and legal system collapsed
former socialist hugo assaulted his
own socialist political and social economic system
based on the
mistakes made and tried to build a
new model that involved changes to the
constitution
in that sense then  We have a
non-partisan constitution, not
a constitution that establishes a
single-party political system,
however, that party cannot
be equated at any time with the
traditional liberal parties.
The Cuban Communist Party plays a
role according to the constitution itself, very
different from the role it
plays.  the
traditional liberal capitalist political parties that
are in crisis and in which no one
grows
or the Cuban communist party does not play
a transcendental role in the
electoral system in the elections it is not an
electoral subject it does not participate in
party elections it is not a
political alternative
Every time you want, you can come to
our country and exchange with us
so that the little vision that
the world has of Cuba was expanded
a little more and you realize how
sometimes it is projected in another way
and the Cuban reality,
the link with  Venezuela is very
important, Venezuela at this time
guarantees Cuba a supply of
oil for five months of the year and
also gives us good payment conditions,
50 percent of that fuel of
that oil is paid with
sports medical services, etc. from Cubas in
Venezuela for  Cuba that is very advantageous
with Venezuela,
new technologies are being introduced in the
oil sector in Kurt, the
Cienfuegos refinery was reopened last year
based on an investment
of 500 million between Cuba and Venezuela,
the relationship with Venezuela has been
very long.  really beneficial
specifically. What I do is
language therapy for those people
who have suffered an accident. I
have lost track of the time and
space of language. With other
exercises, they cannot recover.
Likewise, children who do not have to
correctly pronounce a letter of the
alphabet
for the  question then would be
our political system and our
electoral system on what is supported on what is
legitimized on what obtains trust and
who has the support where is the
legitimacy of our political system
of our economic system of our
social system and our
legal system in general for  As a result of the
blockade, our communications are via
satellite, which are much more expensive and
slow, and they
also pass through the United States. Curiously,
there are 21 submarine cables around Cuba,
however, Cuba cannot
connect to any of them. Now,
last year, a joint venture between Cuba
and Venezuela was created and  He is going to take out a cable
from Venezuela that must enter through the
south of Havana and that can
owe us the technological capacity to
undertake cellular telephony and
introduce more computers for other
political improvements.
We pay attention to this person who
has no power and who  You can attend
our clinics without it costing you
anything, our task and in Venezuela it is
only attention to the dispossessed, well, the
dispossessed, the video person does not also go to the clinics,
but we go
for the one who does not have each chemistry,
the dengue is the  who does not have money
can the answer to that question lies
precisely in direct popular participation
in the exercise of power
through legal and
political mechanisms of popular
intervention of the people directly and
not through parties,
organizations or the state of
traditional popular representative but
by intervening directly in
political decision making through some
mechanisms that now explain
in the year 94 the economy began to grow
and the package of measures was taken more than
20 measures
market mechanisms were introduced
foreign version
tourism and  self-employment,
remittances are authorized and
the concentration of wealth
and a certain level of inequality begins.
These measures allowed the
economy to grow but generated a
set of contradictions. It
was once very complex decisions
in the face of the situation we had,
there were no  alternative, in 1992 the United States
approved the Torricelli law,
the blockade that had existed since 1962
and 1 but allowed subsidiaries of
North American companies that were
in third countries, say in Nicaragua,
General Motors Nicaragua could
trade with Cuba, that trade
represented about 800 million.  It was
a lot but they were products that the
socialist camp did not produce, then it was very
sensitive, they were very necessary for
our economy. With the Torricelli law,
this trade was cut off
and then in the year 96,
the Helms Burton law was approved,
which further reinforced the blockade because it
began to  persecute the businessmen
who invested in Cuba' we had a
difficult internal situation and a
very complicated international situation.
Also, the revolution could really
collapse the reform, therefore in my
opinion it was inevitable to save the
revolution
that participation as materialistic
as it is carried out number  one in the
electoral system proposing
candidates directly in neighborhood assemblies
number 2 dominating its candidates and
number 3
electing by direct
and secret popular vote each of the
representatives of our
representative bodies of the state, those
representative bodies of the state are called
in cuba popular power assemblies
when i was in rome last year
we went to the presentation of the book
a pizza in the city of pizza an
italian intellectual an
italian communist scholar told me that we
had betrayed socialism
betrayed the hammer by allowing
foreign investment and  that a part
of the Cuban surplus value was taken
to the capitalist world and that he did not
understand the reform how we had done
that reform, I
told him first we had to save the
revolution that was the most important thing
then the other things can be done
but without the  revolution we could not
do anything,
it is part of a state corporation
for the company in a socialist company
of state ownership but the cadres
and the workers love it as if it
were evil and we protect it as
our caretakers and we make it
produce as if it were ours  in the
social property of the socialist
production regime and that is why I say
my company,
someone says the name of the company and my company,
my car and the entire state,
but since they respond to a social interest, that is why
we say that the means of
production
what is produced in the company and
therefore the collective and the property
also collectively
because the workers
also live off the company they receive a salary
but here they receive lunch but here
when they have a sick family member they are
cared for then the
workers too  The company is also part
of the families that make it up or the
interior workers. The assemblies
of popular power are organs of the state
or representative bodies of the state, as
in their case, power can be the
British Parliament from a large
family
that one's problem  The problem of
the entire farm is the state's, but those who
work on it receive
the economic and productive benefit of
the protein as if it were private property,
the more it produces,
what encourages me, michael knight frank, this
edition of objects, this method of
transportation is constituted with  the bucks
I am looking for some written lessons
those assemblies in Cuba exist the
provincial and national municipal body
the different
territorial levels at which the
state is organized the members of this assembly that is to
say the delegates constantly
have to be or must be in
exchange with the people and  For this,
there is what is known as
accountability, a mandatory link between
delegates of the assembly and the people
who systematically render them accountable
for their management of their
mandates for their work. Many foreigners
who visit Cuba wonder why
a tax of  20 percent on
the warblers is in dollars because Cuba
needs the dollars for
the replicas that it was going to make,
however what really happens is
that when the Cuban government takes
dollars it is very difficult for it to be able to
place them in the international economy in
the treasury department.  from the US
state and what I am going to say is
information from the North American government
where there are more people to monitor
Cuba's operations
than there are people to monitor
terrorism operations. In 2002
when the tax was imposed, a Swiss bank
was fined 200  million dollars in
gold for managing Cuban accounts since
1961, the Treasury Department
prohibited the Cuban government from using
dollars in its transactions. It is one of
the first laws of the block of those who
persecute our operations in that
currency and confiscated the milk
now.  transactions a ver
and day and many portfolio
that is why we have put that
tax to avoid taking that risk
when the state takes when the state
has dollars in addition to accountability
the Cuban people have to the revocation
of the mandate as another way to
participate  in decision-making, that
delegate who reports to them once
the people do not feel satisfied
with his management can revoke through
a process provided for by law in the
constitution
in such a way that the Cuban political system
has within its principles  to
popular sovereignty and not to
national or parliamentary sovereignty as in the case of
the British political system,
sovereignty resides in the people and that sovereignty is
not delegated, it is not transmitted to any
member of the state apparatus but rather it
remains with them and they are constantly
exercising it.  and functioning in the
document that Bush approved the
outgoing president of the United States
if the document that is called document
to attend a free Cuba says in
chapter 1 verbatim to neutralize the
fictitious companies of the Cuban government
by establishing an
evaluation value group  of Cuban goods
in which it participates mention the
relevant agencies to investigate the
ways in which foreign currency enters and leaves
the cube that is a
responsibility of the agencies
to pursue the Cuban operation(s)
is a state responsibility in the
United States

threats are made to the  foreign banks for
Cuba, this has a very high cost because it
increases transaction costs with all
the monetary manipulation, how
the cost of
ship freight is much higher because
according to the Torricelli law, the ship that
enters Cuba  In the next earthquakes you
cannot enter a North American port,
this type of operations constitutes a
legal obligation of the
US Treasury Department to pursue the
Bilbao operations, Detective Hoffman

and remittances
are very important for the country we
do not have exact figures
but they are more than 1000 million because
we do not know the amount of remittances because we do
not know it
because there are no  Official legal relationship
between the Cuban banking system and the
banking system of the
United States - Mexico knows exactly how much
Mexicans send from the
United States at least, but we do not
know, the Cubans who are in the United States
when they travel to Cuba hide the money
in places  Because
that commission, that document,
this limited the amount of money that
could enter to 55 dollars a day, the
Bush government established that
regulation, remittances cannot be sent
according to that document to
members of the armed forces, to
members of the communist party, that is, to
I cannot send remittances to the
members of the central committee to the
members of the council of states to the
members of the committees for the defense of the
revolution
when when the document when a
Cuban a Cuban-American gets the ticket
at an agency they give him the document  They
say, here, read this and it says it there, it
says online, due to regulations, the
Treasury Department cannot
give you money. It
is an incredible thing, but at that
time, officially,
through agencies, you
can send four shipments a year
of no more than 300 dollars.  those
Obama restrictions being in none,
therefore in my opinion the remittances
must be at home due to the death of
Stalin there is so much division I think

in Cuba, it is also necessary to clarify that
in addition to the assemblies of popular power,
the figure of the
president of the republic does not exist. Cuba is not a
presidential country, unlike the
United States and the rest.  Of the
Latin American countries or the majority of the
Latin American countries in Cuba, what
exists is a council of state where its
main figure is the president of the
council of state, therefore the
decisions should not be made
unilaterally by one person but
collegiately in a council.  The
state council represents the
national assembly of popular power between one
economic session and another is

I have very delicate because it also
fundamentally benefits the

a complex issue
complete system that is why
I say that it is so difficult to eliminate
the monetary duality
in those stores
the prices are very high when you
will have noticed it that
is to say the  way that up to this moment
the state has found to collect
that that currency is these stores this
chip system shopping malls
where the prices are high and the
20% tax on the currency exchange
on the dollar exchange on the
time change
are the  two main ways that the
state now has to go about capturing
that money.
Personally, I think I think that we will have to
go to other ways
because these people have deposited that
money in the banks and there has been
a different polarization in the
bank accounts, the major accounts.
20 thousand pesos grow and the accounts
below 5000, that is, those of
common workers, decrease,
that is why we say that there
is a differentiation in society that is not
reflected in the school, in the hospital,
in the polyclinic, but is reflected in ex
fundamentally in the sector where
the currency is where
inequality is fundamentally reflected,
but it is a very complex issue, which is why
it is my opinion that it will take time, 45
years, to bring this to its
normal level of a single currency,
which means that the Cuban people were
prepared.  to face any
