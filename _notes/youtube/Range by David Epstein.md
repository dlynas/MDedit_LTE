## Transcript:
point or anything like that right no no
no okay perfect perfect
all right welcome everybody to 52 living
ideas
uh today is wednesday today is
comprehensive is wednesday
this is for polymaths and
transdisciplinary people
um and for human beings so that's that's
that's the that's what we're trying to
do here
and i'm delighted to have my friend joe
uh talk about one of his favorite books
range so joe take it away
uh thank you shrikha sorry let me
interrupt for a second let me just
let me tell everybody about the format
so what we're going to do is that joe is
going to make a
presentation about the book okay
then we're going to have some short q a
but today what we want to do is that
this book really puts on the table
the idea of a generalist and the power
of generalist
and this is something that this group is
all about so this is really core
of what core subject that we focus on so
what we're going to do is that we're
going to do breakout rooms
after that 20 minutes breakout rooms
then we're going to come back
and we're going to talk about our
takeaways from the breakout rooms but
not just passively
you know what just takeaways and what
are the big
questions you have and what i will do is
that i'll keep summarizing everything
and once we have an idea of all
our thoughts together we will either you
know do
kind of further q a for the discussion
on this
and then at the end of it we will
identify another like two or three
questions
which survive uh and which remain like
the key
questions that are on everybody's mind
and we're going to do another round of
breakout rooms
after that so this this is all about
discussion so keep
track you know i i have uh you know i
recommend that you use a
you know notebook or something to keep
track of all the ideas that you have and
please talk about them so there is going
to be plenty of opportunity
for you to talk all right so with that
over to you sorry about the interruption
oh no no no thank you so much and thank
you everyone for
joining me here happy thanksgiving to
everyone
i'm not feeling a hundred percent this
evening but we'll try and get the
conversation off the ground
and uh you know as shri has already said
this is really core to the
comprehensiveness wednesdays
uh topic so the book range is about the
development of human potential
and what i want to do is i want to cover
three specific areas
coming away from the book uh even though
the book covers
a multitude of topics of when it talks
about
unlocking human potential but the three
that i want to talk about is why we over
value specialization the importance of
match
quality as a predictor of success
and lateral thinking with withered
technology
now the book breaks down the development
of human potential into two different
areas into a generalist and a specialist
and a generalist is someone who dabbles
in a number of areas
and before settling on what they
actually want to choose to do
now generalists in this time are able to
obtain the way of thinking conceptually
because they're getting experience
across a wide range of domains
this is you know obviously
something that is advantageous for when
you're trying to
look into if you're making career
changes and will go into different
things
along those lines down the line a little
bit here
specialists are a little bit different
in the sense that they pursue
very specialized goals with the idea of
becoming very efficient
now the book is really built around
challenging the 10 000 hour hypothesis
which is where the idea of becoming
great of anything in 10 hours of focus
practice so it's if you get started as
early as possible
that you'll become great at something
and the specialists view
point of the world is also that
the more competitive that we we
have we live in a much more competitive
world so if you pick
something to specialize early on that
you can focus on it
and you'll be more likely as a predictor
for success
now the example that he uses that's
and he was a writer for sports
illustrated uh
and is in the way he had come around
this book is he had actually debated
malcolm gladwell at mit
uh sportscon at an mit sports conference
and the he called it the tiger and roger
brook
a problem and essentially
that tiger woods early on in his career
at two years old
had a famously been on uh
national tv and gain recognition
and 20 years later was the best golfer
in the world
where the other individual is roger
federer
is somebody who played a variety of
sports
and before becoming the best tennis
player in the world
now the reason why we
are all it's a very well documented
story with with tiger woods and not
necessarily roger federer
is that we tend to think of becoming
successful as a linear process
and we like to identify with somebody
that
is pick something that they want to do
practices that for 10 000
hours and and becomes very good
and become successful in their goals
where you know
it is a nice narrative because that's
but he applies
so what he does is he takes this this
these two cases
and finds out that if you really want to
be successful
roger federer's path is in much more
likelihood as a way of achieving success
playing a variety of sports and then
choosing something to specialize and
they found out that put
that tiger woods his story was more or
less
the exception not the rule now what he
does is he
then takes this hypothesis and applies
it across
other industries and says you know if
you
are specializing at an early age
that yes early on you have a competitive
advantage
but you plateau whereas generalists
continue to be
successful as they find out their their
what
what they want to do as they pick what
to specialize in
so there's something called match
quality that's with economists
is where they're basically uh uh
and you know looking at
how you basically match
how you become successful is basically
by trying new activities
building new networks finding as many
new role models
and trying as many different things but
you have to be comfortable with failure
in this pretend
in this process and but
as you have this form it becomes you
start to discover about yourself what
you want to do
and how you what you want to and and how
to become successful
and one example that i want to use with
this
is that there is there's something
called
a you know uh lateral thinking with
withered technology
is the concept that's introduced later
in the book
and there is an engineer who is a
low-level engineer
who liked to dabble in a lot of
different things
but ultimately when he
you know he was you know didn't score
well in his exams and everything and
and came in very low on it it just
worked as maintenance
but he was able to use concepts
to build new tools and basically that
company
that he was able to build up was
nintendo
and he built it up by just using
concepts
from things in his experiences from a
broad range of topics
and so i
he he took things specifically from the
calculator industry
from the credit card industry and he was
able to
extract all this information and build
tools
and this is something that i find to be
the most interesting part of the book
you had somebody that was able to think
deeply about something or think broadly
about something as opposed to thinking
deeply about
something and when you're talking about
innovation this is
something that uh
you know to me it's important because
i think that it shows that it's
accessible to everybody
that there is so much good technology
around that if you start to think
broadly about a topic
then you're able to actually put
something together
and uh and and and based off of your
experiences
that you're able to innovate when we
think of innovation
we kind of think of the same thing with
the tiger woods story
in the sense that you have people like
who do you think of when you think of
great innovators you think of bill gates
you think of mark zuckerberg you think
of
elon musk who are all great innovators
but their child prodigies or they
they've achieved a lot early on
we don't necessarily hear about the
stories where people that are
um uh people that like uh
the guy his name is gunpeyoko who worked
at
at nintendo that was able to bring
around
bring all these various concepts in to
build
one of the more successful companies in
the world with a market cap of around 60
billion dollars
so this idea that
you can start to get as many experiences
possible and and build industries
based off of this i think is the you
know one of the more powerful concepts
in the book
um and from there i'll just leave it
open to questions for
for now all right
uh wonderful thank you very much uh so
folks um
let's do um so we have four rules
for q a uh number one uh type
exclamation mark in
the chat you can both uh at this point
you can both
make a comment or make a question you
know uh ask a question
number two keep on topic we're talking
about
you know the power of generalist uh you
know generalist versus specialist what
is the difference in approach
uh number three uh be brief there's a
lot of people
a lot of interesting things to say uh so
keep your
piece short so you can hear other people
and number four
feel free to disagree with anybody on
anything
and do so courteously all right uh so
um so comments questions
okay so i'm going to get it started um
so joe i mean
one of the things whenever i think about
this issue
is the question of business and personal
i mean we live in a time
where we have considerable
amount of leisure so in addition to your
work
you have plenty of time to do other
things
so if you want to be a generalist you
can have
you can it's a very easy way of
investing
your free time into anything else that
you want
until you build up something so i you
know i don't think of
the concept of generalist as purely tied
to a profession um i think it's a wider
concept that
applies to the range of what you do what
what do you think about
absolutely and this is actually one of
the examples that gang tayoko
the person with nintendo he had you know
he was in a maintenance position
and he had some excess time to start to
come up with
new toys that essentially allowed the
company to pay all
step back and and and uh
and start to you know become the company
that it was
but he had time and he used to he did
things like ballroom dancing
he worked with cars he worked with all
these different
you know things and he and but he used
everything that was there was already
accessible
to him and that was the interesting part
once he had the time
to really focus and see how all these
parts
work together he pulled things from
various industries
in order to make it work and so i think
that that's a very
important part of this entire process
excellent so it's going to be uh jean
barry
vanessa and sally gene go ahead
yeah it's quite interesting so i'm
actually listening to the book
essentially right now which is quite
inspiring
and the idea is like we have to focus on
few
things like say no to a lot of things
actually um it's quite different from my
approach before
and i was thinking maybe it's good for
me but so i was wondering
you know like it's kind of like conflict
between the exploring
and dive deep so when you should so they
what they said it's like before you
become essentially you have to explore a
little bit
you have to explore first then you
choose something then you say no to
everything else
so it's a little bit like especially in
some way so i was wondering you know
that
when you stop exploring when you should
be more essentialist
when you should be all open to new
experience
i think there's kind of like hard to
define you know i'm trying to figure out
myself actually
what do you think what no that that
that's actually one of the breakout
questions that i really wanted to pose
to everyone is that how do you really
measure your progress and that you're
not drifting
because at some point you do have to
pick
you know something to specialize in and
that's one way the generalist is a
little bit different like when we tend
to find generalists we just look at
somebody that does
you know jack of all trades master of
none
what the author is saying in this book
is that at some point the generalist is
just sampling
it's going through a very large sampling
period where you eventually choose
something that
you that that you're good at
and that you like so it's a very it's
hard to draw that line
but the thing that i like the most about
the book
is that he really hammers home the fact
that you're really never far behind
don't really compare yourself to other
people and to really look
you know to look at yourself
what you were yesterday and to
essentially the best way to really have
success
is to really focus um uh on yourself
not other people but the idea of
drifting
is something that i'm hoping we can have
a discussion about
because i really don't know what the
formula would be
to distinguish between somebody that's
drifting and somebody that's just a
generalist
and and that's that's that's a danger
that is a danger when you start to
generalize in too many different things
and that you never choose
at the same time
what a there really is no age limit on
this either
so it's it's it's a that's the question
i'm hoping we can all explore together
so joe uh my thought is the way i
experience it is that it is kind of
i i go out and come back in so it's like
it's like
explore there is explore more and there
is a exploit mode
and you have to continuously keep going
like that
relentlessly in every dimension um so
what you're doing is
it's like you know macro what um
what bucky calls macro comprehensive
right
and micro incisive and you need both of
those things
uh if you if you just went like this
it's going to be
dissipating all your energy unless you
can bring it back onto something
that you can actually transform
then you're not doing that much so you
have to have
you know kind of go go in that that
fashion so i think you know i
i operate visually so that's that's the
best way i can
describe it uh next up is going to be
uh barry vanessa sally sanjay and dustin
barry go ahead well did the book talk
discuss a little bit about
uh the value of being a generalist not
so much to make more money or to be
successful in a business but to be a
better person
to be because i contend i argue
that uh we're naturally generalists
that is our culture makes us specialist
and it's a aberration it's pathological
and i think our natural tendency is to
be journalists
because our bodies and our brains
are journalists we don't have one sense
we don't have
we have five senses sometimes we have
more than that
and so i i
i am firmly convinced that people that
are specialists
are and that they are the aberration
not not the generalists and so what i i
was what i'm asking is the book get into
about making you sell yourself into a
better person
that not that does not necessarily mean
you make more money
no it makes you a happier and more
stable
and grounded person that that to me is
more important
than making a lot of money because we
can see people that
pursue power and money and they are
horrible people
they're often narcissists absolutely
and so so uh i mean look i mean steve
jobs he was very successful
but he but he was a horrible person
thanks very great great observation uh
go ahead joe
so i mean it does talk about the idea of
success but when they
you're talking about the unleashing
human potential
i think you know he really does cover it
across the whole
you know uh spectrum of things i it's
not
he doesn't really cover the moral aspect
of becoming a generalist
i agree with you a hundred percent and
he does cover
the idea of how society is forcing us to
become
specialists and so and so are
encouraging us they're not forcing us
to become a specialist that and it that
aspect of it you if you look in the
industrial age
yes the specialist has become a scene as
a path
up to success and what he's trying to do
is
counter that entire hypothesis and say
no the i the real way to success
is it's your own personal journey and
it's getting as many experiences as
possible
so that you can then extract concepts
and apply them to where you find to be
most fit
it doesn't get into the idea that money
he he doesn't get into the idea that
whether money is good or bad
but this is the best way to find your
own personal success
in your own journey and that's perhaps
the most
important part of the book our important
thing to take away from the book in
becoming a generalist
and i do agree with you that we do tend
to
overvalue specialization in
today's world i i i think that that's we
and i think the reason we overvalue is
specialization is because of the
hypothesis that he puts forth
is that um primarily is
it's a very neat narrative it's nice to
think that if you work hard
and you do something for 10 000 hours
that you're going to be successful
and that you're just it's just a matter
of grit
where that sim simply doesn't hold water
uh you know and he proves that
throughout the book uh
thank you barry that was an excellent
observation that at a personal level
you know i and i i completely agree with
you that
the personal level i don't see why a
person shouldn't be that
because that's like simply exercising
all our faculties
and and kind of being open to the world
and open to life
the problem okay how do you convert part
of that
into living uh you know
into money is a separate i think a
separate problem
uh absolutely important problem but a
separate problem
but at a personal level i think there is
no doubt in my mind
that you know it's like you are losing a
lot if you say
i'm going to look at only this and
nothing else
um the world is too rich uh next up is
vanessa sally
sanjay dustin julie and kevin vanessa
what's your question
okay i have a question and a comment um
does it also relate on the individual
like
uh let's say if you're very analytical
does it help let's say if you maybe go
to the specialist
first and the other thing just to come
about the body in general how if you do
exercise it's better to cross train
to like mess with your metabolism or so
you get so focused on the metabolism
kind of figures out what you're doing
because sometimes you're better if you
wing it and you may be more creative if
you know your face
you know you dabble here and there
versus someone that has to follow the
recipe
to the tea don't you dare try adding an
extra spice or something
because you're going to mess it all up
versus you know with experience realize
oh this could use a little bit this to
jazz it up and
i think more people like it thank you
yeah thank you
go ahead so i think that you know you're
asking basically is there a point where
there's someone that's analytical
he's not saying that there's no room for
a specialist
and that's what i really like about this
book and
in the example yoko was another
um that i used a little bit earlier
is that he was actually saying
yes i need to know the concepts but
i need to know what a semiconductor can
do
but i don't need to know its inner
workings
so you do need people that are
analytical and specialists at a certain
point
so i as far as personality
is concerned there are personality exams
that he covers in the book
um but he doesn't say that they can't
become generalists
but the other part to your point to your
question
you know part of your question is
there's still a role for specialists
in this book he's just saying that this
is
we're always told the specialist is the
best way for human development
when gen you know a generalist is
actually an optimal way to do
to approach learning and your career
sally you're next
okay i have a couple of comments um i
don't know
if he the author touched upon it in the
book but um
the the findings remind me of some
studies i've heard about
um about teams in the workplace um
and that um teams who are more diverse
as far as gender race occupation
class you know all these different
aspects of life
teams that are more diverse um come up
with better solutions
um for you know integral approaches
um so i feel like they're you know what
the generalist um i feel i feel like
those are
somewhat similar although now that i
think more about it not sure but um
diverse you know uh teams could make up
like a body and then that body is better
when it has more
um information um secondly um
there's this uh physicist who who's um
speaks on time or he's a
he's a specialist in time but he's also
a generalist there's a
um an interview with him in um
apartmental magazine
and um he's just pretty famous italian
physicist carlo rivelli
and he's known for being a generalist
and then um
lastly um just to comment on what
vanessa said about the body
i was when i was young i took ballet i
was in a ballerina i just took ballet
lessons
and then i went to this other school for
a moment and i told them i ran track and
they're like
oh no you you can't run track you're a
ballerina you know
that different muscles it's just not
going to work you can't run track
anymore
so i thought that was kind of funny i
definitely didn't give up track
thanks thank you thank you very much uh
sally uh great observations next up is
sanjay
um yes hi um so uh
fantastic topic joe um this is very
interesting
so um i have um you know for so i've
worked in in the life sciences for most
of my career
and i've actually thought about this
this topic for for years and tried to
understand
how um you know what makes uh what makes
us
capable and creative and and you know
inventive um and most of the people that
i work with
are you know many of the people are
highly educated and specialized
um so what i what i've seen is that
um the best the people who are most
um effective most capable
tend to be both generalists and
specialists they have both
um aspects um
so people who are only a generalist or
who are only a specialist
um they can succeed but the level that
they achieve
from what i've seen the level that they
achieve
can be surpassed if they gain that other
side of the
coin so to speak um for example and this
is what you know i think that
when bucky described the term that she
got the used
macrocomprehensivist and micro incisive
i think that's what he meant
is that the comprehensivist is the
generalist where you're expanding out
and i agree that
this is under the process when we're
learning that you
learn something you expand your your
knowledge you look
across all not just fields but all
areas of knowledge outside of your field
included
and you co-less you consolidate that
information and then you
um you know after you consolidate then
you start exploring in different areas
so it's both the the expansive and you
know the the broad
and the the deep um i think both of
those are just as important
and i don't think that it's it's
necessarily that this
you know being one or the other causes
people to be uh
you know horrible person i think barry
he used
he was giving examples of steve jobs and
other people but
i don't think that this necessarily
makes somebody a bad person or a good
person or
that it necessarily makes them enjoy
their their career or their work or not
i think that's totally unrelated i think
that um
you know many of the people that i work
with i especially enjoy i
always had found my career very very
interesting
but um i don't think it's related to
necessarily
this aspect i think it's that's more of
that's more our psychology that that
makes us
enjoy things and whether we're good or
bad thank you
thank you sanjay go ahead go ahead joe
no yeah i mean
actually and uh thank you for saying
that sanjay because actually there's a
couple
things that um
even i i've known you even before the
book had come out
and we had had a conversation and you
talked about
how a generalist has to specialize at a
certain point
and that even you know to some degree
you have to focus in
and uh that's kind of the same
definition that the
the the um
that the uh the author does use um
as far as it you know relating to
comprehensivism
uh you know i i agree with you that you
know you
you can be both you know
you have people that are both broad and
deep it's not necessarily either
or it's just whatever again he's
challenging the narrative
that you have to specialize which is
seems to be the over
you know the um the uh
uh overwhelming narrative to become
successful
because things are more competitive that
we need to
we need to specialize in order to even
be successful
so it's not you know and there's another
part to it i
i don't think it necessarily does have a
a
link to the type of person you are but i
will say this
the more experiences that you have
the greater empathy that you'll have for
others
and so i think that that's that's
you know it's unrelated um but i
i do think that there is a the
the idea that you start to uh step
out of yourself in your specialized
world and this is where teams in the
workplace
become able to work together better when
they start to have multi-disciplinary
teams as opposed to having just
you know analytical people or you know
just
uh scientists and and you know i know
that you
are a uh generalist yourself to you know
with with
you even though you do specialize in the
life sciences
so i i mean i'm sure you have experience
in this area
um with making those teams work together
uh so there is a i think that there
really is a um
uh there is an idea that you can develop
the more you get outside yourself that
you can develop empathy but you're right
i think that it's you could still be a
good person and be a specialist
so i want to follow up on one
observation of sanjay so the question of
you know i think i agree with sanjay
that you have to have both
you have to be able to go broad and you
have to be able to go deep
um and the question is what how do you
do that
okay and i think there is a magic there
is a magic concept
that allows you to do that and that is a
concept of general principles
that uh buck minister fuller talks about
so what you're doing is that when you
are actually going across a
field and this is i i learned it first
from
charlie munger uh and many other people
um but the idea is that you are not
trying to just study concrete it's not a
field to you
what you're trying to do when you're
seeing something new
is that you're trying to extract general
principles
general principles are applicable
anywhere so it is the way in which
charlie munger puts it is that he's
adding a tool to his toolkit
that can be brought to bear on anything
so if you
go abroad and walk away from
in from this new area with a general
principle
that means applicable anywhere then your
effectiveness of operating in
any field goes up so i think general
principle
is the middle term of how do you go
broad
and deep at the same time uh
next up is going to be dustin julie
kevin and donna dustin
yeah so i was going to respond to joseph
and srikant actually kind of going along
with what i'm going to say here is that
when you're talking about jack of all
trades master of none we all heard that
saying before but
often times it's actually not fully
spoken it's jack of all trades master of
none but also sometimes better than a
master one and i think you might
mention that in the book it's funny i
haven't actually read the book yet but
i've listened to like a dozen podcasts
by him about it but it's interesting how
whenever he's talking about being a
generalist it's more about
how you go about doing it and something
you mentioned earlier too is about being
too divergent and not building it up so
the jack of all trades mentality where
you're just a novice and everything
i do think that when you're becoming a
specialist in many areas like a polymath
that you can do it multiple pillars at
once not just one thing
like he talks about a funnel where
you're dabbling like a jack of all
trades
funneling like roger federer did and
then becoming more of a generalist as
you get older
but i do think you can do it as multiple
pillars at the same time it's just like
you're like shikon is saying
having more along the lines of
principles and mental models too
to kind of get that way going so i
decided to get your thoughts on that
excellent thank you uh thank you dustin
um joe any thoughts no no i thought he
actually just spoke beautifully i mean i
thought it was excellent so
excellent uh thank you justin uh next up
is
julie kevin donna and mike julie
um i had a question about wednesday
nights for those of us that are new
uh maybe specifically define what micro
incisive means
and i also had a question about do they
have they done any studies about
curiosity because you can go curiosity
wide and you can also go deeper into
what your
specific field is do they have any um
studies on whether that trade is some
is more one or the other thank you
okay uh i'll answer the first one and
then hand it over to um
uh joe for the second uh so the first
one micro incisive
um that term of buck minister fuller
it's
saying that he's it's it's a pair so
he's saying macro comprehensive
that means at a broad level you go broad
and try to take in everything you can
okay at the same time you have to be
micro incisive that means you have to be
able to bring to bear
all your knowledge on the thing at hand
so incisive that means if whenever
you're dealing with something so it's
think of it like a funnel you're not
just going out you're trying to get
everything and all that you got you're
trying to bring to bear on the point
at which you you're focused so micro in
size micro means at
that small point on which you're focused
on
whatever it is that you're doing now
you it has to be incisive in the sense
that all the knowledge that you have
gained
you have to be able to transform
whatever you're doing
better it has to be a cutting it has you
have to be able to cut
better because of all the
all this is that's what he means by that
um so about curiosity let me hand it
over to joe joe
yeah i mean curiosity is key to becoming
a generalist
i mean so the idea that you're
intellectually curious that you haven't
necessarily even
uh you're not satisfied with where you
are
i don't really see how you can become a
generalist without
being curious and he states that re
that's a reoccurring theme in the book
is the importance of being
intellectually curious
uh in your journey to self-discovery
um so and and that's where he talks
about the idea of
uh um uh
you know finding your your match uh so
uh match quality as to for
your for your future careers that you're
identifying
you're getting into as many industries
as possible
having as many planned experiments as
you as you possibly can
and as many role models as possible
and only a curious person could possibly
have those
so and we're it's an essential quality
of having a generalist
um one other thing is that it's also is
that uh
the the comprehensivist is and i would
you know
really appreciate anybody else's impact
input on this the comprehensiveness i
look is more as a system thinking
approach whereas this is i see as a more
of an individual
which maps into the systems thinking
approach
um would you agree with that sure can i
ask you
um it's it's difficult can you repeat
what you said let me just try to make
sure i understand what
so basically i looked at the
comprehensiveness is bucky fuller's
approach beam is more systems thinking
where this is more of a
personal development yeah i mean that's
that's yeah
i i think that buck minister fuller's
view is far more broader right more
powerful
it is more philosophical it gets to the
root causes you know kind of root things
that are involved in making this happen
uh whereas this is kind of a much more
kind of a lower level
um it's kind of it's it's kind of
reporting on what he has found
uh amongst amongst this so it's a
whereas uh buck minister fuller is a
profound philosopher right he's actually
showing you how everything is put
together
so it's it's at a different different
level it's a different level yeah it's a
mic
that's where you can get in the
metaphysical and physical one and i want
to uh
address one more thing uh julie um
you're talking about this uh that you're
new to the comprehensivist wednesdays
so i want to spend a little bit of time
talking about what we are trying to do
here okay
this is a joint project between the
greater philadelphia thinking society
and 52 living ideas
it started like that and joe was
instrumental in
getting this started because he
introduced me to cj
who is really amazing amazing person
um so what we are doing is that we are
trying to
encourage and get people here you know
cj calls it you know comprehensivist
collaboration collaboration
of comprehensiveness okay so that's what
we are trying to do here
okay so firstly we cover a whole range
of topics now cj by himself can cover
a range of topics so he has just sent me
his
plan for the next year is just just
awesome okay
um then in addition to that we have you
know we are starting a new series with
sanjay
on neuroscience um neuroscience i mean
that field is growing okay that's it is
experiencing
a renaissance you know it's really
growing
uh it's a golden age every week every
day something new is happening
and it is important to understand that
it's very difficult
because it's very easy to get kind of
sidetracked by this study or that study
um sanjay has been looking at it for a
long time so we're going to start
off on december 9th with
introductory concepts you know of you
know key concepts of neuroscience to
get you started but we'll be go doing
this every month
in order to build up that in addition to
that on sundays
angela cartilasa she has done research
she's a phd she's i think the only one
who has done a phd
on polymaths in uh in the 21st century
and she invites many polymaths and
people who have studied polymaths
to to study that but broadly
if you look at this entire 52 living
ideas that's what we've been doing
okay that's what we do every day we take
a topic different topic
and we are always trying to connect
between topics
you know i call it i learned this idea
from mortimer adler it's called
syntopical
that means no matter what like if you're
looking at this book
you connect it to all other ideas that
you know
in every field and that's how you
understand
what you're looking at better because
it's not your purpose to read a book
your purpose is to learn a topic
and you bring every idea to bear on that
so that's
a method that we use in these meetups so
in that sense
all these meetups are connected to each
other
and this wednesdays are explicitly
focused on connecting
so some so that's why i'm always
i like this meetup very much because it
is giving tremendous opportunity for
everybody
to put their thoughts down you know
look at what has happened just so far
okay vanessa made this beautiful point
about the body
and how body the variation and and
this is a very deep point about the body
okay about biology itself
you need a variety of exercises you need
a variety of food you need a variety of
movement
in order to keep body active so it is
for the mind so it is for
for an individual so that point you know
the you know
sally made a beautiful point about teams
that it doesn't you don't have to know
everything
it's the fact that we can we are social
beings
and all of this happens in a distributed
way and we can
gain and trade with each other in order
to
fill in wherever where we are weak and
maybe learn a little bit
from people who are stronger and offer
where we are stronger and all of it
together works better
so these are all very deep points you
know sanjay made point about
the combination of uh you know
generalist and specialist
so that's what we do we have all these
people who are thinking along at the
same level
and we are putting our thoughts on the
table and we are trying to have a
conversation so that's what we do in the
comprehensive wednesdays
sorry about the uh you know the lend the
answer but i think it is important to
know
what we are doing and to set the
principles down next up is kevin
uh donna mike and miguel
kevin uh thank you thank uh
i used some keywords so i described
generalist
and specialist the children from
personal level generally
focus on variety broad and
after box thinking or outside thinking
another side it's specifically
more deeper and inside thinking and
narrow
and limited deeper then here that's
if from team let's see we won't form a
team you need a
following mix you need project
management possibly needed more
generalities
but you know whoever did do a job for
production
you need to move more focus on
specialties
um these come to you my question is
for the book i'm an australian book
manchester
uh which uh sranka you mentioned general
principle
it applied both to a journalist
and
specialist it should be the system
thinking for all
that's something obviously we need deep
down
use the same principle apply for
everything
for learning it's a book mention this
area thank you
joe would you like to respond to that um
could you actually clarify so that your
question is basically
the idea of a specialist and a
generalist should be approaching the
system's thinking approach
the same way yeah that's and this should
be some
general principle it doesn't matter it's
which
which let's see i'm a generalist then
for myself i need i'm specialists i
still need
general school skills as generally
you need some something you use your
favorite or your practice professional
going deeper so the the distinction
would be
is that that this is again this is about
the idea of unlocking human potential so
he's saying that the generalist can you
know have
a way of doing things that
is a little bit more efficient than a
specialist
or thinking about things a little bit
more efficiently than a specialist
but you're right in the sense that a
specialist
and a generalist ought to be thinking
about the system as a whole
so that it's not necessarily whether
you're one or the other it's just that
you're more likely
to see the whole big picture
if you start to incorporate as many
experiences as possible
and he proves that throughout the book
especially when it comes to prediction
markets uh
and and and various outsider just
advantages with making uh
recommendations on
even uh different parts of uh uh
basically problem solving uh for for
companies
um so yeah
you're right in the sense that um
you know you're you're right that both
both the specialist
and the uh the generalists should be
thinking
more on a a system-wide basis absolutely
uh thank you um i i just want to say one
thing uh i forgot to mention barry
i mean barry's observation that human
beings need
this i think it's a very phenomenal
observation
and uh it's a very deep observation so
thank you barry for that
uh next up is donna mike and miguel
donna so
i i agree with a a lot of what folks
have been saying
sanjay sanjay and joe i think that
the ideal specialist to me i i think of
them as the t-shaped
which is they're very deep
in one topic and then very
broad in a number of topics
i think that just makes them a stronger
specialist
and then i would say for the generalist
i think of them as m-shaped where
they're
they're very broad
but at the same time very deep in
multiple
areas so they go both go broad
and deep and one area where i
see danger of specialization
is in the medical community uh i've
you know you have the cardiologist and
the kidney doctor
and you know someone who has multiple
comorbid you know problems that they're
that they are seeing specialists
individually and sometimes the person
isn't being treated as the whole person
and that becomes a huge risk so so that
that's an area where
specialists i think it's very
dangerous so the second piece of
specialist and generalists
is communication
so if you have the specialists they
definitely need to communicate
and they need to have that generalism
in order to communicate with all of the
others so
again i i just reiterate the point that
it's good to go both broad and deep
depending on you know what your
preference is whether you're a
specialist
or generalists

yeah i mean so one of
there's a couple things to impact there
actually getting back to your medical
example
one of our previous meetups and he does
talk about the medical field in general
and how specialists are you know um
uh you know how generalists are have a
better way of dying
being better diagnosed uh dietitian
diagnostic being able to diagnose a
person's illnesses
much more efficiently but the idea
uh we even talked about during a
previous meet up was um
and i'm forgetting his name strict night
you led the discussion on
acura uh the systems thinker
that when he talked about the idea of
the medical field of how we don't
what's that yes
thank you um about how he
would look at how we look at the whole
uh and if you look at the goal of the
medical field it doesn't necessarily
look at
the idea of you know how you're treating
somebody uh as the
their entire medical uh
uh how am i saying this um
uh basically trading the whole person
versus actually treating the disease
so that's essentially where he he looks
at you know
he looks at it as you know you're not
solving the whole problem and that's
where a generalist would actually
look from a medical perspective makes a
little bit more sense
as far as going broadly and then deeply
you know i have mixed emotions i mean
mixed feelings about that because i do
see the advantage
of people that are able to go deep and
i do see the advantage of just being
broad
and i think that there is if you're
ideally you would like to be able to do
both
and you are able to do both as a
generalist
because you're able to apply general
principles to a specific
problem with it will allow you to dig
deeper
but i don't necessarily
think that when i think of a specialist
i really do think of somebody that is
very very focused and
that is in a particular area and it
doesn't necessarily mean you can go as
deep
as a specialist would um
it's a balance i really do think that
there's a balance there
the the key for a generalist is that
they can use general
principles that allow them to dig deep
and find answers um
but not to the degree that a specialist
would they wouldn't be able to do the
things the specialists would
thank you next up is mike
okay the
statement has already been made that you
have to kind of be both several people
including uh well every everybody has
said you have to be both
and the question becomes is to what
degree you need to be
both and uh a uh
uh to be and you need to be effective
in solving whatever problem that life or
your career has presented to you
and uh that means
that depends on whether what tools you
have available to you
and knowing how to use those tools um
the um uh
the added the if you can generalize this
or define it mathematically
you can get to a high degree of
specialization
uh very quickly and completely define
the problem
or at least a model of the problem uh
now the uh the
adequacy of that problem is uh is
sufficient is is the driver and
uh the there's a concept of bandwidth
that goes in that you uh you could be a
if you're a specialist you're uh
the amount of uh your ability to reach
into other disciplines or to generalize
uh needs to be enough that you can
gather all the resources to solve that
problem
um and so everybody is
a generalist and everybody is a
specialist
in in what's going on in
in this vaccination program
uh mess we have
three of the companies are using
specialists
in messenger rna now
what there's a difference between the
specialists in messenger
rna one of the companies for example
is using a virus uh that is a harmless
virus to vector
the messenger rna into the body into the
subject's body as a vaccine mike could
you wrap it up in about 30 seconds
i wrap it up in uh one more sentence
the other specialist is trying to
encapsulate
uh stillwork a specialist in messenger
rna
which to uh to an outsider sounds like a
uh like a very generalist thing a very
specialized thing
but he's encapsulating that in a
particular kind of lipid
to stabilize it that is digested by the
victor by the host so
you need to have bandwidth as being a
specialist
and a uh and a generalist that's
adequate to the problem that you're
trying to solve mike that was a lot more
than one sentence
but it's a it's a very interesting point
the point about bandwidth
of saying okay is is there a question or
is it how do you think of it
in terms of kind of you know maximizing
the the depth
and uh this one and what kind of you
know what
you know how how do you think about it
in quantitative way but that's a very
interesting question
thank you uh mike next up is uh miguel
paul and ash miguel
yes so um i haven't
read this book yet so i wanted to
propose
this topical question about this
topic and if the
people that have read the book or you
sure can i can help me
fill in this confusion
from the standpoint of approaches to
information depth and
understanding we have the compressivists
we have the assistant thinkers we have
the generalists
and we have the polymath so what
are the the commonalities
and what are the differences and please
uh illustrate some examples that
represent each thank you all right that
was a brilliant question okay
that's a brilliant question so
comprehensivist
generalist polymaths and what was the
last one you said
systems i believe
systems thinkers um now i don't know
what
each of these things um you know it's
like i
the way i think about it i can just tell
you how i think about it
okay i think that you have to be open
to all the world and you have to
abstract general principles for
from it and everything works in systems
so you have to figure out how the
systems are working and what are the
general principles
involved in that in order to do anything
uh that's how i
you know i approach it so that's why you
know i'm very curious about things
what i'm trying to get i'm trying to put
it in form of principles i'm trying to
relate it to each other
i'm trying to say okay what is the
systems how is actually the energy
flowing
in all of this so systems is a core part
of how i think about it
general principles is a core part um
now i'm going to try to describe these
things
but each you know these are not the
terms that i commonly use
uh so comprehensiveness is focusing on
being comprehensive
um the generalist is saying
okay i'm not going to restrict myself to
specialists so it's kind of
defined as as opposed to a specialist
a polymath is like different
uh you know different disciplines
systems thinker so in in in many senses
many of these terms are reaction
to the to what has happened in
industrial revolution
of division of labor uh they are all
kind of this start their kind of
reaction to that so it's like that's why
i don't
like many of these terms because i'm
just saying okay what
should a human being be so this is a
more kind of philosophical way of
looking at it
and when you come to that i don't need
to think in terms of specialist or
generalist
because you're saying i'm saying that
you need to have general principles
in order to do anything at all so in
order to be a specialist
and seeking of general principles is
good the more disciplines you see
more chance that you are going to get
more general principles
polymath again i don't think in terms of
polymath
because i say you know i i don't regard
it as being
unusual i regard that you know just
you're an individual you should go in
so that's how i i take it um now each
at the same time i want to make one
thing many of these many
folks have spent a lot of time on each
of these terms and they will defend
it they will give a better um
better take on these terms than i i have
i've been able to do
um so i you know and so i i respect that
but this is how i
this is my personal answer to that joe
i mean i i define it similarly
um the way i look at it as a
comprehensivist
and a is a is a comprehensive
is taking someone who's taking a systems
thinking approach
to things and they're looking at the
whole system
now i agree with srikant and the idea
that you're looking at general
principles
in order to get to some value
and that is systems thinking and it's
been
uh in its utmost to me is that you start
to
say i can i can build these principles
with the idea
of uh achieving
you know some objective and i have
a framework that i can now apply
to the entire system that's how i look
at the comprehensiveness
is the comprehensiveness and the
system's thinking or kind of is just the
individual that is
you're taking the entire system into
account
as far as a generalist is concerned
um in a polymath there is
in the book uh you know he defines
polymath within
the context of the company 3m
and a polymath the way they defined it
is somebody that is
somewhat of a generalist but actually
can
go very deep uh in very in specific
areas but they're
a generalist and say
you would almost be a generalist in the
medical field but you could
specialize in one particular area where
the
you have more generalized experiences
but i don't necessarily
distinguish between a polymath and a
generalist in my personal opinion
um yeah i mean i i do think that
as far as a uh
a comprehensivist or anything that bucky
talks about is
as we had talked about earlier it's much
deeper
it includes how to think about the world
and then you use principles within that
in order to analyze the world
and analyze your experiences and that is
a much deeper concept
than just gaining a number of
experiences
so that you can start to understand the
world
that's actually looking at the world
it's it's a very it's almost a way of
solving the problem
as opposed to in this case is just about
experiencing
problems my my approach is very similar
i think the
closest one is about minister fuller's
approach
uh that that i kind of resonate with
right um
i don't see this as a problem like
you know buckminster fuller talks about
it akov talks about it
um i see it as you know the child is
like this
you know we are born like this we're
curious about the world
we want to do stuff with with the world
and that's what
we are for some reason we lose it so
it's not
something a very complicated thing that
we are trying to put together it's kind
of going back
to the root of what we are
uh so it's like you know like carl
jung's terms
in psychology it's like understanding
the self
of so i don't know miguel
so that was a great question but please
uh what what do you think
oh i i was going along the same lines of
viewers saying that you know
there is an emphasis or an effort to put
the
those terms within a context of those
books
and the grand scheme grander scheme of
things
i'm just asking because as a group
we're developing a conversation and
bringing in all those terms
so we we understand the cross
definitions of
how it applies um
i what i get from joe is that the only
slight difference is that the
the comprehensiveness goes deeper
i mean in the sense of not stopping
at a specialty but going
to metaphysical and an interplanetary
level so
it's a higher higher elevation than some
of the other
topics but otherwise
we're just looking for depth in whatever
endeavor and trying to have a systemic
approach when looking at those steps
wonderful thank you thank you miguel
next up is paul
yeah thanks um i'm very curious about
something so i'm going to
tell a very quick story or two and then
ask this question related to it
uh i want to use the example of my
daughter who
was majored in fine art oil painting
okay and and that sounds pretty specific
already right
but they said you can't just say oil
painting
they forced them to draw the human
figure for a whole year
she wasn't necessarily trying to draw
the human figure but
my point is in that educational program
they decided
what a person needed to try out in order
to call themselves the bigger domain of
oil painting then she went on to
risd and then she was talking about
being a director well to be a director
the guys who are directors say
you should spend some time as a prop
person you should spend some time as an
art
person you should spend some time
choosing the music you should try to do
every job that the director is directing
and so my point is now i'm going to give
you one more example
the liberal arts education they claim to
have solved this problem a long time ago
long time ago way after the industrial
revolution saying you should get this
well-rounded education with some science
and some history and some
so what is your thought and the author's
thought about the educational curriculum
that flows from the ideas
well i mean one of the idea the the
one of the chapter i believe it's
chapter four goes into
the idea of teaching procedures versus
teaching concepts
and this is a very important thing when
you're talking about a liberal arts
education versus a
what we've now you're talking about even
traditional education um in
in traditional education and the way
we're we're teaching it
especially at university levels um
you know we're teaching procedural type
of things where we understand we do this
we get an answer and we don't
necessarily question that answer
and that's where you have highly
specialized majors
that don't necessarily ask some of these
broader questions
and so the conceptual aspect of it by
teaching concepts
and it is is a much more effective way
for learning and understanding that is
uh he talks about the book is the
importance of it and he's
and he talks about you know various
countries and studies that have been
performed throughout you know the world
where conceptual thinking is
progress and i think you know while the
liberal arts
education in and of itself hasn't you
know he doesn't go into great detail
about that
but um uh you're right the liberal arts
gives us a lot of broad perspectives
that
we need in order to solve for problem
solving
after school thanks wonderful
thank you paul and this is a topic that
we'll keep coming back to
on kind of education uh it's a core
topic
and uh it's a of perennial interest
we've done many meetups on that
and we'll keep on doing more but
specifically from this angle
uh next up is ash
thank you um so i don't really have
a specific question i guess so much as
a couple of general observations in the
spirit of the
uh what's it called the
comprehensiveness wednesdays
uh so uh so yeah
just maybe get your thoughts on them but
so you mentioned uh a
few minutes ago srikant about sort of
the division of labor
uh and it's kind of interesting because
in a sense
the specialization is sort of as you
know
specialization in exchange as laid out
by adam smith and the wealth of
nations is sort of the almost the
foundation of
our modern capitalist society economy
um so i'm kind of curious i guess
i i guess a question about like how this
fits in
to that picture um and then my other
just observation i guess
is uh so i actually am working on a book
on evolutionary theory so i kind of
see everything through the filter of
that and always uh find analogies to
that with everything else that i am
learning about and uh and this book is
kind of a perfect example of that
because
the way i look at um evolution is that
you know in response to any given
situation
uh evolution can can go in one of two
directions and
one is greater specialization um
in other words being more adapted to
a specific situation um
and the other one is you know greater
generalization or being
becoming more adaptable to a broader
range of situations
and uh and it seems like
in the short range the specialization
route
has the bigger payoffs as it you know
enables
uh the the capture creation more value
but in the long range
um the generalization approach
tends to win out um and and so that's
kind of you know
exactly what he talks about with how
people who specialize early tend to
maybe outperform their peers um up to a
certain point but then they plateau
early
and and uh fall off um so i don't know
if you guys have any comments on that
yeah
go ahead no i mean yeah so yeah as you'd
mentioned he showed the graph
i'm assuming you saw the graph where he
showed or generalists
over time more than make up for the
income
gap that is the difference between a
specialist and a generalist
but you bring up a very important point
because there's a discussion that's
ongoing now is that
in economics uh that where does a
generalist fall into the idea of a
specialized economy
or a knowledge-based economy versus the
specialist
and is there a role for the specialist
in in the
in the knowledge-based economy and as we
continue
to move post-industrial and automation
does have a way of catching up to
special you know
parts of individuals that are
specializing
you know there's an incentive to become
a generalist
because a generalist can reinvent
themselves
much faster than a specialist
so you have generalized concepts
that you've learned that you can now
apply to a different domain
and that if you're only specializing
within a specific domain
and you're doing a repeated
uh type of position um a process uh
any kind of you know position that is
that is
rules-based that it they can be
potentially automated and so
this is actually as a generalist going
forward evolutionary wise
makes a lot more sense and it's
even evolving with the new way where
the the knowledge based economy so i i
think that that's
it's a very that's an interesting
concept because
i don't know where the inflection point
is now with this
um because i think we are going to move
away from
uh specialization as being a
ideal path whereas again i think more
conceptual type of thinking systems type
thinking
or even liberal arts education will be
an ideal
um excellent points uh both of them so
firstly
on division of labor um i
think division of labor is made possible
by integration of labor somebody has to
put together
all the division of labor uh it's the
ceos people who
organize or you know organize
the economic system who makes possible
and who have to understand
each of those things enough to be able
to do that so
um the person who actually thinks very
well at this
on this point is john baptist say uh who
talks a lot about integration of labor
so that's where i would look if you want
to look at economics
of this um regarding evolution
um you know if you look at the in the
evolutionary scale
man is a generalist like for example
snake is born
carbon copy of its parents and it's able
to actually do something
immediately it's able to eat just like
its uh its parents
just smaller and it's effective whereas
we are completely ineffective
when we are born and it takes a long
time we have a long childhood and
the entire story of pyramid evolution is
longer and longer childhood and longer
and longer
ramp up to getting but that ramp up
happens
in contact with nature with reality
with others in learning from
doing learning from others that allow us
um to develop our capacity which is far
more
flexible far more and adaptive to the
environment whereas you know
if a snake is not it's very
well it's perfectly suited to that
situation
but if it doesn't happen to be that
situation there isn't much they can do
but you know that's what so so i think
and
and so and it is a investment
just like in a biological at the
evolutionary level
it's an investment to have a child and
to it is an
investment to have that you know
brain have formed when you're born a
completely incapable of supporting
itself
but it is that the glory of the child
that makes possible what a human being
is
uh and this is very much a story uh the
evolution is very much
a story of you know not evolution as
such but
human evolution is very much a story of
moving towards
um having this general capacity which is
simply learning that
really it's not that you know it's it's
simply learning
you know learning new things uh from
reality and from experience
so but um ash uh excellent excellent
question
um all right folks so what we are going
to do now is um
we are going to continue this
conversation in breakout rooms
and uh joe you had two questions so let
me
you want to read out the question uh yes
given the book's distinction between
generalists and specialists how should
we think about the strengths and
weaknesses of generalists
and specialists um and then
how can a generalist better ensure their
progress through life
um i think that's a really interesting
question because
you know generalists could have a
potential
of drifting so okay folks
so what i'm going to do is that i'm
going to start the breakout rooms now
and they will run for 20 minutes
and then we will automatically come back
into this give me just a second
all right us countdown 120 seconds
all right i think we're all set
all right so i'm starting the breakout
rooms now um
when we come back we're going to have a
very deep discussion okay you would have
had chance to talk to
several people about these ideas you
know
again one rule in the breakout rooms
please allow everybody
to put their thoughts on the table give
two minutes to everybody to put their
thoughts in the table who everyone
wants to speak that's the primary value
of this forum
that you actually get to hear other
people so don't focus on listening to
the other people
and speak your mind for two minutes and
then you can have a discussion
when we come back we're going to do two
things you have to talk about your
takeaways
number one and number two you can put
one
question on the table okay and i'm going
to compile all of that
okay and see what we are what everybody
is thinking
and i'm going to look at the patterns in
that and we're going to shape
what we're going to do next based on
that okay so it's very important
that you you know very crisply state
your takeaways
and if you can put a question on the
table which is
which you think is the most important
question to be to be thought about all
right starting the breakout rooms now
joe fantastic job okay this was just
great thank you
coming in all right welcome back folks
all right it's time for takeaways so
what we're going to do
is i'm going to try something joe i'm
gonna try something really really
ambitious
okay what i'm going to do is
um i'm going to hear everybody's
takeaways
everybody's questions and i'm going to
try to summarize them
uh maybe three at a time so we keep
track of it normally i put them together
but i do that in an impressionistic way
i want to do it more systematically this
time okay
um so and i but i have help
i have some very high tech stuff you
know that was just
uh give me a second i'm gonna there's
some couple people who are unmuted
uh okay i've got some
high-tech high-tech help which was just
invented about 5000 years ago
i have pen and paper and i'm going to
keep track of everything
that is being said and i'm going to try
to organize it and then
we will see patterns in what is being
said
and then we will focus on themes which
are which most people
keep coming back to okay so that's what
i invite you to do the same thing
okay that's the best way uh you know the
more active you are
the more you get out of it so don't just
listen actually try to summarize it in
your own way
write it down in your own way all right
so i'm going to
call on people um so i'm going to start
with uh jeff andrew and david roller
uh those three will be first and then i
will go to the next one
and what i will do is that uh you know
after three people have said something
and please help me
by being crisp try to you know give
your takeaways in a crisp way if you
have a question
this is the most important just one
question you can put it down
um all right so with that jeff andrew
and david
jeff take it away so
it does seem to me that there's some
balance between
specialists and generalists that is true
in almost everything
and it see it also seems to me that
there are different
kinds of genius if you will
that lend towards a person really being
able to become
a phenomenal expert on things that we
really
want them to be phenomenal experts on
and then other kinds of genius that
really lend themselves
to um knitting or you know seeing the
relationships and the connections
between many different things
and i wonder what those types of genius
might be
in each of us or and that might be
stronger or not as strong
you know to each of us individually
excellent
thank you jeff uh so it's going to be
now
andrew david roller and barry andrew
all right thanks my takeaway
uh well my maybe observation was that
this
maybe a terminology issue here and uh
generalist is it sounds like really what
we're talking about is
openness and uh so i would argue that
that's really important to make that
distinction
because um you can become you can be a
specialist
but be open-minded and uh
so in a way you can depending upon how
what how you want to
define these terms really they don't
have to be
they're not separate right you can be
specialized and open
excellent thank you andrew next up is
david barry and gene david
so i guess my observation or
something that struck me is some other
readings i've been doing
is this discussion follows along the
lines of artificial intelligence
development
and so the the current progress is being
made in narrow
artificial intelligence narrowly focused
but the desire the goal is to strive
towards the general
general uh artificial intelligence and
then eventually
you know to the super artificial
intelligence but
i found it very interesting the
discussions that we've
had going on here is it almost
is matching something that i've been
reading is what in the direction that
artificial intelligence is being
migrated and maybe
that work is being patterned off of our
behavioral
dynamics excellent uh thank you
all right um thanks uh david
next up is going to be barry jean and
toa
barry yes uh well my observation is and
i talked about this
is the peter principle can be applied to
the workforce
but also can be applied to your life and
the preeta principle is
that you advance people to their level
of incompetence
so you always pick a manager that was
really good in their specialty
but when they become a manager they're
lousy well that was my experience
in life i was good as an engineer but
when i
lost my wife i wasn't ready to handle
the emotional impact to it
but when i started exploring yoga and
art and poetry and psychology and
neurobiology
and all these other things i was able to
advance
and grow so it's all about do you want
to be
stuck in grief or do you want to be
growing to be better at what
ever life brings your way wonderful
thank you thank you barry
next up is jean tovah
and paul jin
yeah i think the general listener
specialist uh
we all have some of that it's more like
what you're more towards
you're more specialist or you're more
generous we have both
qualities and and my experience early in
my career
i think to be a good employee you have
to be more specialist
because the manager or the boss usually
the journalist
they're looking for specialists to work
for
certain function for their company but
as you move up
you actually need to be more generalist
to be able to take
higher position you know so it's kind of
conflict the good
employee may not be a good manager but
the good manager
materials could be a lovely employee at
the beginning
looks kind of funny excellent excellent
observation
uh great great observation gene next up
is uh toba paul and ash
um i guess my takeaway is just like the
significance of
what type of learning environment lends
itself to what type of specialist you
are
um and just wondering like on like a
sociological
level like what and how and in what ways
like our industries
will be changing um with like
advances in technology advances in ai
um for the ways in which we learn as a
whole
excellent uh thank you uh next
up is uh paul
ash and linda paul
yeah my main like open point relates to
this thought that they're in any
place you want to speak with credibility
there's expectations about how much
depth you need to speak with credibility
so it's not our choice if we choose a
domain we want to speak with credibility
in
we're forced some degree of
specialization
and some degree of breadth and it's
determined by expectations
okay um thank you thank you paul
next up is going to be
ash linda and sally
ash
yeah one of the kind of recurring themes
that
keeps coming up in the discussion is the
necessity of being
kind of both a specialist and a
generalist in different
respects or at different times or i'm
not sure exactly what the relationship
there is but it kind of seems like
um they're almost flip sides of a coin
or or maybe um
even better to describe it as as uh that
they form a sort of spectrum
so uh and and joe kind of mentioned the
need to balance them so i guess
the way i would maybe think of it is you
want to
sort of broaden your range along that
spectrum so that you can
operate in both sort of generalist mode
and specialist mode
as needed uh so i guess that that would
be my main takeaway
wonderful thank you uh
next up is uh linda yo then linda mons
and then sally linda uh
i'm sorry i'm a terrible listener so i
just agree with myself
and give my example i have a brother who
is
not good at math and other general
education at school
and it was really when we were little
it's very hard
to teach him anything but he was very
good with his hand
as he grown up he became a mechanic and
he makes a lot of money
with that job and he he loves that job
he cannot do other things
i have to help him in other way but he
is very good
with this job i myself is uh
a generalist my bachelor degree with an
in accounting and then i take a master's
degree in nutrition and i like to study
all other things and i make my money
here and there
from the things that i know so i think
it's okay
either way sometimes people judge their
themselves too harshly
like i judge my brother when he was
little like oh my goodness you cannot be
anything
you know you cannot study
but yeah forgive yourself and then you
know
learn about your kids also if you have
kids you know
try to find out their talent and
direct them they can be generalists they
can be specialists
either way they're they should be fine
thank you
linda now it's linda montz followed by
sally and miguel
my conclusion would be in the best of
all possible worlds people should be
given the opportunity to be specialists
and then if their life allows it branch
out to be generalist
okay uh thank you uh
let me see okay next one is sally sally
go ahead
okay my takeaway is just um the reminder
i think srikant you may have said it or
joe
um that uh just to look at where i am
um and to try to improve upon
my level of knowledge in whatever
category i'm trying to improve as
opposed to
you know a specialist my age and the
same
you know specialist my age in the same
um
you know workplace um endeavor
or whatever and so my um my
uh question is um basically the second
question
um for the breakout room is how does one
know
when they're becoming a drifter and to
you know either go deeper or move on to
another another topic got it
um excellent thank you sally next up is
miguel anaki and evanec
miguel going back to what sally was just
saying
um there is the it's important to keep
track of
relative progress because
we in a globalized world it's hard to
really assess the levels accurately
so keep track of our personal progress
and secondly i think that the
weakness of the drift is
is important there is
chasing too many rabbit holes or too
many
subjects uh not only is it time
consuming but it
it it lends itself to
lack of action so i would follow up with
when taking on whichever
path of learning is
connect that path with concrete and
tangible action
that way we don't just uh
leverage
thank you uh thank you miguel
next up is anaki evening
and brian nanaki
um i really like you know um
an argument somebody was making in my
group that
do we actually live in a world where
specialists are dominating and we need
more generals because
i feel like we feel like what you know
the world we're living in is a world
where
there's so much information and people
are actually
you know um they kind of dabble in
different areas and different fields
and we actually like people with depth
with
actual depth of the subject they're
interested in
so that's something that i find pretty
interesting yeah
excellent uh thank you um anaki next up
is evernique
brian and sanjay evernick
yeah so my takeaway is just being
openness uh uh open
is openness i think with a specialist
um being a specialist is great but you
should be open
to learning more generally about stuff
or exposing yourself
to things um like if you are a scientist
maybe
go go to the theater or you know just
something like
exposure to different things and
you know finding different ways to find
your way i think if you're a generalist
it's the key is being open to being more
focused in a particular area
until you learn what you need to learn
and then moving on to another area
not just jumping around that way you can
still be
a generalist and still have some depth
of knowledge that's my takeaway
thank you now so so far 14 people have
given their takeaways so i'll try to
summarize all of it
this is this is very difficult so i'm
going to try okay
uh so this is a summary of the first 14
people again this is the summary so we
always focus on what people said
this is just my quick summary of trying
to put it together
so jeff and linda talked about looking
at types of geniuses you know what are
the strengths
where people are able to just do amazing
things and that's different from person
to person
uh andrew and evanic talked about the
importance of openness
david talked about the analog between
what we are talking about specialists
and generalists
and what is going on in ai special
special purpose ai versus general
purpose neural nets or
kind of ai um then barry talked about
you know kind of moving from being stuck
in a in a rut
in in some some place versus whether it
is uh you know
part of life part of business to kind of
uh
having the growth mentality and going
going out there uh gene made a very
interesting observation about that
you know when you're starting out your
kind of specialist but as you move up
the organization
when you're trying to kind of integrate
works of many people
you need to kind of become more
generalist um tawa talked about
the learning environments and how the
world is changing and what is it that we
the world requires of us and what where
we can make most of it paul
talks about the expectations of
credibility that people have
when you're doing something um ash talks
about
you know learning to operate with both
in the both
um generalist and uh specialist mode
need for doing that
um linda argued for you know specialists
first and then trying to
become a generalist when you can um you
know
sally and miguel talked about
you know the problem with drifting if
you don't watch out that you're just
moving without just
not kind of causing anything and taking
anything with you
and um uh you know anarchy was talking
that
you know the world is has a lot a lot of
special specialists
so maybe having a few more generalists
would
would uh cause better you know things so
that's a quick summary of so far
so let's continue um it's going to be
joel
oh sorry brian sanjay angel brian
okay um i think my first comment would
be
what i i've heard in the breakout or
what i'm hearing here
is there's a lot of confusion um over
what we're talking about here
um which i would subscribe to that i
have a lot of confusion also
i generally tend to think people
developers as generalists
and go to a specialist later on but i've
also had good arguments so that should
be the other way around
okay uh confusion regarding the order
okay
um very good next up is uh sanjay
sanjay uh joel and kevin
um okay thank you uh so i um
i was um
looking at this in a in a little bit
different way in the sense that i think
that the concept of
a generalist and specialist is actually
multi-layered
um when we talk about our behavior our
personality
um at the simplest level we are
generalists or specialists
and again that's a spectrum so we fall
somewhere along that line
some of us are much more specialized and
mostly act that way
others are much more generalized yet
that way other people are somewhere in
the middle
but that you know most people are
talking about that from the point of
view of our
of our field of education the subject
that we studied but there are actually
other
um knowledge domains of life that the
same thing applies under
you know meaning that we can be a
generalist or specialist in other areas
for example
in the discussion this this actually
raised my this idea and me that
you know when we're working in a company
or for a company
we have our own field of knowledge that
the field that we studied
but also the domain of business
expertise and
many people who go in who work as a
leader in
management have to work in both of those
areas
they have to be either a generalist or a
specialist in their own field
as well as either a generous or
specialist in the domain of business
and then i expand you know i expanded
that to mean it's it's not
only it does not apply only to
our professional life it also applies to
a personal life in the sense that
in our general life how we acquire
knowledge so this is really about
um how the the
gathering knowledge across multiple
domains that's the
idea that i'm trying to express so for
example in the business world we have
our specialty
as well as general business knowledge
and then our personal life
two that i am aware of just right now is
how do we gather knowledge of life in
general
right about the world that we live in
about us as beings how we integrate into
this universe things like that
and then a second is much more personal
in that
how do we work with other people how
emotive
are we our human interactions and and i
suspect there are more
layers of this you know around that
so i'll just stop here excellent uh
multiple layers
like uh individual versus kind of the
social interaction very good
okay um next up
is joel kevin
and debra cavisto
thanks thanks joe and sriken uh
as always very informative but i think
for me the
the most profound part of this evening
was miguel's quote and i'll just post it
in the chat again
and accept to add a little levity i'll
just add
one more right and uh
it's it's not only a great quote but
it's
it's rhyming um
and i i don't want to take away anything
from what sanjay just said because i
think it's
it's profound enough to uh
to be worthy of much closer study so
i'll i'll just leave it at that and

thank you again for a very entertaining
evening
thank you joel uh next up is
kevin uh deborah cavisto and deborah
thank you sync uh
my observation is like
especially needs open mind to
have general skills it's help you adapt
to new change
for your specialty area
the generalists need some focus by one
area you cannot
like butterfly here there
you never get anything deep
but here my question is i'm not sure
anybody agree with c
we too especially like
as human beings as whole for example 200
years ago
we too focus on the industry revolution
still
lost change we benefit from them now
now we think about the environment let's
see if about
2200 years ago can we
do an industry revolution also think
about the environment
impact the world would be uh different
thank you okay uh thank you kevin uh
next up
is deborah cavisto deborah and laura
okay i do have to a disclaimer which is
that i had to leave for a couple minutes
so
i hope i'm fitting in correctly to
wherever we are right now so deborah uh
what you what we're doing is
we're just recounting very brief
takeaways
and you have any question we are putting
it on the table go ahead okay
i was in the breakout group so um
i was arguing in the breakout room of
a liberal arts education i know joe
mentioned it
thank you joe you're so smart
and i just cannot emphasize enough how
incredibly
useful it is because it's very
comprehensive
and it's very useful to in today's world
so you study psychology sociology
criminal justice
argument and reasoning debate religion
all of those things allow you to build
community and to connect with other
people
which is a great foundation for any sort
of
negotiation in the world or any
occupation
and so i was saying like in europe they
have this kind of thing
and then you specialize in your master's
degree
so if i could be the secretary of
education
that's what i'd be pushing for and it
would be free
thank you thank you you're welcome our
next cop
is uh deborah
debra yes and
christian deborah go ahead yes
thank you so to follow up a little bit
of what
anaki was saying we talked a little bit
about in our breakup
breakout room i i was interested in just
this you know in range and a couple of
other
you know new books that have come out
recently on polymath and
um from what i understand it's a fairly
new literature
of course polymath existed throughout
history but
it seems to be a new area of study and
most of them say that we live in an age
of specialization
but you know they give examples of this
but
i can think of many counter examples
that we maybe live in an
age of generalization because the
digital you know the knowledge explosion
and so i wonder if
this new literature is a reaction to
specialization
or it's actually a reflection of the
fact that
we've already moved away from
specialization
i don't know the answer that's my
question wonderful thank you
debra what's the state of specialization
versus generalization
uh laura laura you're next
um why am i i needed
um yes go ahead okay okay um
i mean i could sort of think through
through general as i
looking through um generalized
um topics you know we focus on one
so we get to the point where we actually
become specialized in something
but we move back into a generalized
state we haven't really
left the generalized but we've become
specialized in a small component
of a generalized area and then the other
part is
can we be can we ever become too
generalized
from that the second question thank you
okay
next up is going to be christian
donna and vanessa
um so we had an interesting discussion
in the breakout room
and uh i think sally was bringing up
an example of someone who kind of like
made their way
as a screenwriter and um
had to continuously kind of push forward
and kind of
even though they had no idea what they
wanted to do they just continued to
uh go into different experiences and
learn from those experiences
even if it wasn't exactly related to
um what they wanted to do and then later
on they became
successful so
that kind of goes into something that i
wanted to
ask a question about is how do you
prevent drifting
when you're not sure of what exactly do
you want to do
if you're a generalist um that was our
second question in the breakout room we
never really got an
answer so um yeah
excellent thank you thank you christian
next up
is donna vanessa
and uh hyrule
donna so a number of people have
touched upon this that generalists and
specialists seem to black and white to
me
um i think the ideal as i said before as
a specialist
that goes broad and the generalist that
goes deep
and i see it as a matrix where
you know it depends on what is needed at
the time
when and where do you go abroad when and
where do you go deep
when and where do you go abroad and so
it's um
about flexibility i think that's that's
the key
wonderful thank you thank you donna uh
next
up is going to be uh vanessa
uh hiro and julie vanessa what's your
takeaway
okay well i've seen that um depending on
the desired outcome jeffrey brought
something up like a specialist like a
cardiac surgeon you want them extremely
focused and specialized or like a
neurosurgeon
so you may have a excellent product and
if you're more with the generalists
you may have a more unique product and
they may end up being more productive so
you may get something more unique with
the generalists
but something superior with
the specialists like i said the
neurosurgeon or something and
a little disclaimer for the specialist
would be helpful to be a team player can
you imagine
being in the surgery and just
pushing everyone the wrong way you may
not have the best of outcomes
thank you vanessa next up is jairo and
julie
well well from listening to
jeff and sanjay and others
i get uh
sound is having a problem uh you can
type in the chat and i'll read it out
okay uh next up is julie oh what
uh oh that's better go ahead
go ahead go ahead oh okay that is my
head
so um uh slice
uh i just came up with this uh tell me
what you think about it that
this uh like three
like uh three dimensional or or or three
vectors
uh of a of spectrum from specialist to
generalists
uh so so from uh vertically
it would be like the classic uh
specialist
would be you train in a tech school and
you come out and get a job
versus uh get a master's in something
very general or like liberal arts
and you end up being in management or
something else and then there's
the another uh direction that's more
like
uh horizontal or
where you you hang in in that position
it could be
as a specialist in a particular uh
career at the bottom or it could be at
the top
but you're in the company for so long
that you become
so specialized or world renowned that
you're considered a specialist
versus somebody that gets put in a task
to
to learn real quick and and figure
things out real quick and then goes to
something else and then there's
another direction could be sort of like
a person like
steve jobs that that's so so
specialized and then generalized at the
same time because
he's so creative and and just has to
know a little bit
of everything but he's really focused
and specialized
thank you thank you next up is
uh let me see julie okay um
i i think there's so many examples of
things that don't work in this chaotic
world
that it's hard to find the truth and
i've spent a lot of my time
as a drifter kind of just floating along
hoping to find some and haven't been
proactive about it until now
and i've i've come so long just in three
weeks on these calls as far as
finding my position my and i have also
observed i like to
see things at work and then i take them
i see look for patterns and i
test them with another situation because
i do believe they're universal laws
that that a person can be very good in
his own little world and go out there
and be very skilled in a different
thing because of those kind of lessons
about truth so
i think that socrates is right about
getting to know yourself i
really have witnessed what happens to
someone when they're doing their passing
we all have gifts i'm trying to spend
i'm trying to go deep with myself and
let curiosity guide me
as far as finding out what my strengths
are and
i think that everybody was doing that i
think i think poly
polymaths are simply people that uh
totally follow their curiosity they
never bought into any of the limitation
life
and you know who knows they're just i
think if everyone just followed that
would be very powerful wonderful thank
you julie
all right let me go ahead and now try to
put things together um
there is so one one
kind of the the basic thing that came
out here
is what is the ideal you know what is
the idea
what's what's what's what's the best way
to function you know we talked about
like ash talked about it
um you know jeff talked about it so
several people have talked about it
but you know what is the ideal way
um instead of saying okay am i more of a
generalist more
what is the ideal way you know uh what
is your answer to that you know it's
like
for you forget about now talking about
society
okay just look at it for you
on this issue of generalist versus
social
specialist what do you think
is the ideal i mean for me
the ideal is to be open to the world at
all
times especially when the world
and experience is telling you that
you're wrong so being open
uh being curious secondly
relentlessly trying to systematize
things
trying to come up with general
principles
and then trying to apply it in action to
everything and
very closely watching what the results
are and
getting feedback especially if you're
wrong so that
cycle so you know
so there are two ways in which i'm a
generalist
that i'm open to many things and second
is i'm always looking for
general principles in the sense
i'm a specialist is that i'm always
trying to apply to something or the
other i'm saying
i'm doing this and i'm trying to put
everything i have in that
so that is how i you know that that's my
idea
my conception of idea so what is your
conception of ideal
uh if you want to speak just go ahead
and type exclamation mark
um and just i would like to know what
your ideal is
on this this front uh the
i mean i would add to if i wanted to
incorporate
um incorporate jeff's point
and uh point of linda is that you have
to be
cognizant about what your strengths are
and what your weaknesses are
that's very important especially your
weaknesses and also your strengths
and you have to be willing to work
with people where you are
weak and be committed to doing that um
because i think that's the shortest way
of actually delivering
a lot of value to the world and also
learning
uh in the process so that that's how
i would talk about the team part
communication part um the giftedness
part
uh so that's that's my take so folks uh
now
go ahead you have a little bit more
leeway uh you have maybe up to two
minutes
now to speak about what do you think
your personal idea don't talk about how
it should be for anybody else
what the world should be like just for
you what is your ideal on this
uh so it's going to be joe kevin
sanjay vanessa
barry and deborah joke ahead i mean for
me
i look at generalist being a generalist
is the way that's my personal journey
because i think in terms of concepts
and i really procedurally learning
isn't something that really interests me
what interests me
are whole systems and where i can apply
you know principles as we've talked
about here 52 living ideas
two problems as a way of discovery
keeps things interesting and
i think that for me that's i've always
been intellectually kind of curious
so that is that being said i
also have a and i said this in the
breakout room
is a high degree of admiration for
somebody that is able to find what they
like at a very early point in their
lives
and follow that path and make that path
work for them
so i for me it's a it's a generalist
i mean you know and taking these
principles this principled approach
towards
problem solving however i have great
admiration for those who
do choose and follow the specialist path
excellent thank you thank you joe next
up is kevin sanjay vanessa barry deborah
hiro and evening
so folks the question on the table is
what is your ideal
what is your personal idea on in this
kevin uh thank you
um for me i do is always lazy come to
your
52 idm empty myself you mind
everything it's a big bug bucket try to
learn something
learn general to be the specialist even
and never to be
specialized in anything it's just
learning and
and enhance myself thank you
excellent thank you kevin uh next up is
sanjay
uh yes uh thank you so i for me the
approach i take is is basically um or at
least early on
um was learning by observing um looking
for patterns and things in the world
and you know for example when we're
young
um we we do this you know we don't know
a lot so we're basically observing and
watching our teachers and others parents
around us
and also when we get older and we start
our first job let's say
at an early you know we're a entry-level
employee
similarly in that environment we would
learn by observing we would
we would not know the company we would
not know how work is done so it would be
in one sense we would be doing things
that we're trained to through our
education but also we would be learning
um you know so so to speak on the job so
learning by observing is a very
important part of how we learn and i
think we need to
extend this throughout life um second
the um i think there were two evening
and deborah they both commented on this
and
maybe other people also but i agree with
with the notion
of having a broad education um they both
talk specifically about liberal arts but
i think it's
more than that i think that every person
needs to have as broad
an education as we can the problem is
it's expensive and it takes time
and not everybody can do that but i
would say
um i mean i did this in my education i
i'm trying to make
get my children to to do this also and
and so obviously we have to have not
just an
arts education and a science education
but i would say
not even make distinctions between the
two try to integrate the two in every
course that you take
um and i actually saw that this can be
possible when my children were in high
school
and i saw that their high school did
something very experimental where they
tried to do exactly that
they tried to coalesce multiple fields
and they built their entire curricula
around that it was very innovative and i
think it can be done
though universities don't typically do
that we have to do it on our own
so yeah integrating looking at the world
in as full and cohesive a way as we can
um that will help us to find all of
these
threads that tie things together that
they're always there i mean i learned
early on that
that that helps me to learn like you
know i remember in
i think i said this earlier a while back
that history was a difficult subject for
me to learn
but after i learned that the world was a
full
world you know 300 years ago
that people were living not just
you know in in in terms of the the dates
and the times and the and the
names of people but you know the world
was just as complex it is today
300 years ago or 5 000 years ago and
once i started realizing that once i
started learning about the different
aspects of life
you know 300 years ago and integrating
all those together
it became a much more interesting and
easier to to learn so i think
doing that throughout life is is
important
thank you sanjay uh really appreciate
all all all the observations it's you
always have very rich you know rich base
of observations
uh such as just great thank you uh next
up is uh vanessa
vanessa what what is your ideal okay i
probably tend more
towards a generalist even like growing
up with kind of like trial and error and
i've had some of my most beautiful hikes
is when i went off the bean path
and stumbled across two fonts looking at
me
but i think sometimes to bring balance
into it it may be helpful to refocus and
maybe there's something
even if it's a hobby that maybe you
focus on the needlepoint
where you just bring all your focus into
it to maybe re-center
and like just like photography you can
have a great landscape
but then you can zoom in and have this
one drop of dew with the light bouncing
off of it that's
maybe more beautiful than the whole
picture of itself so i think it's more
like
kind of striking a bounce and what
brings you maybe joy and
stress or if nothing else even maybe to
calm you down
so like i said it's finally the balance
and one day we'll figure it out
thank you thank you vanessa next up is
barry
um yes um
i have to quote one of my poems uh
please when i live in oregon country and
uh
probably can't see me can you see me now
i can't see you we can't see you but we
can hear you very well go ahead
okay so um i live in oregon
and uh and vineyards are very
uh common here in oregon there's a lot
of wine
and so when i uh was
my wife was sick and on dialysis i
uh became very interested and i take
tours of wine
vineyards and one time i took a tour of
uh
where they had pinot grapes and they say
these pinot grapes are very
have very thin skin they pick up
everything that's in their environment
and i said that's me so i wrote a poem
about it and it's based on the concept
that fermentation is like meditation
i said vine take what is not mine make
what is mine divine
so that my meditation time ferments me
into fine wine so my ideal is that when
you drink of me
and i drink of myself that it will be of
high character and it will be something
that you will
want to swallow and not spit out
and uh so that is that's my ideal
to be calm creative compassionate
charismatic
confident uh
and i see competent
and uh i call it the seven seas
and uh so these are all the things i'm
striving for and i would suggest
anybody that is uh in my 78 years if
you're concerned about
drifting write down your ideals
and check what you're doing and whether
they meet your ideals
and if you're meeting your ideals you're
not drifting
and it's disintegrating what society and
your parents taught you
and doing what gives you flow
and harmony with yourself and your
environment
wonderful thank you barry you're always
the inspiration i really like your poems
so thank you thank you very much uh next
up is
deborah thank you um
so my personal ideal is definitely a
generalist
and theory to have a bird's eye view
i think it's it's a beautiful ideal
it's what i want i think it's
the limitations of our brains and our
lifespan i think prevents it on
you know the the search for the unity of
knowledge
it's a dream that i always want to
strive for but
i think at this point in time unless we
have many people working towards it it
might be
the question is always whether that's a
possible dream for one individual
um so it is my dream but i don't know if
it's attainable
thank you thank you um i mean i see i
like see i'm a student of history and
when you look at history the amount of
leisure that we have
amount of prosperity that we have i
think the opportunity of actually
pursuing
what you want is so much easier now i'm
also from
originally from india so i've seen what
indian villages are and how much of the
effort goes just to feed yourself
uh so i i think we're in a good position
so i think if people want to do it i
think
it's relatively easy and at least you
know
that's how i i see it but yeah there's
an embarrassment
of riches certainly yes uh next
up is hyrule hyrule what is your ideal
uh i like what you said
but um yeah uh perhaps i'm
um i've tended to to
end up being kind of a polymath or
trying uh or trying to specialize in one
area then i get tired of it and go to
something else so
so when i go in to specialize it and
then come out
then i see i see principles that maybe i
can use
to another area that i go into to
specialize as i go
in i don't see anything around because
i'm focused and then when i come out
i start seeing uh principles like what
you say or
yeah some kind of design principle that
i can use in
in another area like take something out
of it
and kind of uh apply it to other areas
okay thank you uh hyrule next stop
is uh evening uh ash and deborah
ebony go ahead
my ideal is that i'm a general that i
would be a generalist
and um in the beginning
stages like i think of it as a cycle
like in the beginning
i'm looking at many different topics and
picking what interests me and then
specializing
learning more going in depth more about
that particular
topic and then once i feel like i've
reached a level of
of attainment of knowledge that i want
then maybe going into another topic that
i'm interested in
um and focusing and then doing that
cycle again of
you know general focus general focus
excellent thank you evanic
ash and the cat
hi this is liberty hi uh
so i agree with a lot of what people
have been saying it's probably no
surprise that uh people
uh doing something called
comprehensiveness wednesday would tend
more towards being the generalist side
um and so like joe was saying i you know
i really
for for me really um focusing on
general principles i actually for years
i've been describing myself
as uh somebody who specializes in
generalizing
and uh you know it's all about finding
those
uh looking for those connections between
different things and
forming those broader concepts um
and i really liked what sanjay was
saying as well about um
you know kind of tearing down those
divisions between
uh you know the sizes and humanities and
education
and you know because sometimes people
say well and i agree you know like
you should learn about the humanities as
part of a kind of a broad liberal arts
education
uh that other people have mentioned but
you know i
i think it's as important for humanities
students to learn about science as it is
for first like science and engineering
students to learn about the humanities
um you know to be like a really broad
well well-rounded individual
and but i really like the way sanjay put
it about
you know not just that engineering
students are taking liberal arts classes
and maybe vice versa but
actually you know in all of the classes
trying to integrate the two
um and that's that's kind of what i try
to do in my own approach
and i and i hope that uh what sanjay was
suggesting
uh that our educational system will kind
of move more in that direction
excellent uh thank you uh thank you ash
uh
next up is going to be deborah
okay perfect segway ash thank you for
that because
um i wanted to just expound a little bit
on my
um comment i made about the liberal arts
education again um
um so i was just saying just to rattle
it off really quickly
psychology sociology criminal justice
argument and reasoning interpersonal
communication religion history
music art those are all things that i
got to study as a liberal arts major
but so ash this is for you and sanjay
my math course and you have to take
science and math obviously it's required
um was math for liberal arts
majors how do you like that so
at cal state fullerton they had a
program specifically designed
to use math in our field of study
so we studied statistics and all kinds
of different
types of mathematics that bring the real
world
into the field of math so i thought that
was
really they were ahead of their selves
in teaching that
but um for me it's been a good
foundation that's very comprehensive
and to tie into something that joe said
he had talked about being able to
reinvent yourself
so i think we as generalists it's easier
for us to reinvent ourselves because we
have to
pivot and shift and some jobs are going
away sometimes
we have to invent our own jobs because
ours has disappeared
and so i think as a generalist you're
it's more conducive for you to be able
to do that
with this sort of a background and also
for me it's
fostered a tremendous love of learning
and it's allowed me to exercise my
creativity
and in my opinion it leads to new
paradigms
you know i'm a paradigm shifter and also
solving problems
so it benefits society um i feel like
i can benefit society because of this oh
and then another thing that joe said
really quickly
um it obviously fosters a human
connection
and it involves systems so all of these
courses
teach you systems and then you could see
how the systems are analogous to each
other
and then it allows you to really
understand how systems work
i think i covered like everything in the
kitchen sink there
in two minutes excellent thank you uh
and deborah has a very nice video um
at our uh youtube channel
i i was astonished i have now 213 videos
and one of them is deborah's and he
she's talking about how to foster love
of learning
in children so i recommend it very
highly thank you
so folks um the next question i want to
discuss
is so we have talked about our ideal
right
and there are many questions about
sequences and the things that you have
to watch out for
and challenges okay so i want to phrase
it again at a personal level
so what do you think are your challenges
you've talked about your idea where you
want to go okay
you are where you are now
what is the next step what are the
challenges so what are the
challenges you're facing in getting
there to the ideal
and what's the next step for you to move
towards it
okay because uh so so
what are the challenges you face and
in your way towards your ideal and
what's the next step
so for me um i am
again you know when you if you want to
line up to answer the question just go
ahead and type exclamation mark
um so for me
i am i've always been curious and i'm
always very
creative i can i'm very enthused about
things and i'm just trying to take in as
much as i can
and do as much as i can um that's
that's the core of my strength and
that's just there
okay um now my weakness
is that though i have tried to
use general principles i have not done
them
as much as i could i've not tried to
crystallize them i've not tried to i try
okay
i have these little diagrams that i've
used for the last 20 years which
summarize
all my ideas but i think i can do
much better than what i've done on
kind of formulating the structure
of general principles because i think i
have a vision of what can be done there
and actually using them actually using
them
far more rigorously in my
thinking from moment to moment than what
i'm doing right now
so like my challenge is
to master general principles both
organize them and to apply them and
what am i doing what's the next step as
as always
these meetups are integral part of what
i do so i'm doing a whole series of
meetups on principles
i'm going in many many different ways so
i
stated my principles then i'm going to
look at principles set by different
people like i'm going to do
principles of jordan peterson i'm going
to do
uh you know principles of different
people and i'm going to try to put it
together so that's
that's what i'm going to do in order to
learn
how to i do these meetups only to learn
uh
i don't talk about things i know uh i'd
like to talk about things that i
i'm trying to learn so that's that's
what my um
my plan is to fix my weaknesses so next
up
is going to be jeff joe kevin
uh and vanessa jeff
what are your challenges
as you did not have a chance to talk
about your ideas you can talk about your
ideal
yeah and talk about the challenges no no
worries
thank you um first of all it's such a
great question and thank you for asking
it it's a really
important question for me personally
for several decades i led an
organization where
i really could acquire on my team
people with expertise in anything and
everything i needed and the role i
played was
in being somebody who could really look
ahead to the future could apply
principles could relate to everybody
could help to make smart decisions and
try things out and learn
and generate the the resources to do it
i don't i don't run an organization
anymore
and what i need to do is
again play to my strengths
and informally assemble
that kind of a team for for me to be
able to depend on and engage and
and help and support and i'm doing that
a little bit but to get much more
intentional about it is a really
important thing for me
so thank you for that question that
helped me to say
you know what come on dude get with the
program here you know what you're good
at
and uh you know and get yourself in
there with other people who can do the
things that you know they need to do
wonderful thank you thank you jeff uh
next up is joe
yeah i mean this is a wonderful
wonderful question um
you know kind of builds off of what some
of the things actually
barry was talking about the ideal self
and um and i appreciated what he had to
add as well
i mean my challenges you know the way i
plan on meeting them
is to develop role models uh and to
continue and i and i think that this
forum has actually provided a place for
that
um you know i was actually going to say
even before you were talking about the
idea of
this meetup in particular is a way
of becoming the ideal self so
that's a very important part for me the
other part is that
something that barry had brought up is
working on my own
personal character in that framework
because that will help me see the best
in other people
and it will also help you
um be able to you know do some of the
things
from a principled perspective that will
allow you to extract value
from forums like this but everyday
interactions as well
my biggest challenge
in this process without a doubt is
trying
is getting to diminishing returns at
certain points
and making that distinction was like
when is it
you know when should i maybe stop on one
thing and move to the next
and this and and here again this meetup
has actually helped me with that
as well uh by having such a variety
and such a breath and depth on so many
different topics
that it forces you to to
you know have different experiences each
night and the beauty in that
is that it's every time you show up you
can leave with something new
and then you can start to put pieces
together
and uh one final thank you is that uh
you know goals of like just even
presenting in front of people
um an opportunity uh like that
is you know it's a learning experience
for me and so
this is something that um
i appreciate and that's part of my my
challenge uh and uh
and something that i appreciate dearly
so this meetup is a big part of that
thank you very much joe uh it's and
you're a very big part of this meetup
too
so it's it's wonderful uh thank you uh
next
up is i'm going to give preference to
people who have not spoken before
so it's going to be julie paul and then
kevin
vanessa julie go ahead
so julie the question is um
you you've not talked about your ideals
so what is your ideal
um and then what are the challenges that
you're facing
in order to get there uh you know
ideally in terms of this
generalist versus specialist what is you
what are the challenges that you faced
uh to get there and what is the next
step that you can do
okay uh so it's going to be paul next
paul go ahead
yeah i one of the reasons i value this
group
a lot is the wide range of types of
people
among them are a group of people that
spoke
as jeff spoke of they've done a lot
they've run something they've been
something and now they're going how do i
synthesize everything and do the next
thing and uh i'm another one sort of
like that having had a career in
technology and managing large groups of
software engineers
and then i got into mental health so my
challenge
is i love learning a little too much
in a way so as an example um i
love the neuroscience stuff so i saw i
could get this muse headset that takes
my eeg
and then i know how some python so i was
writing python code to
process the brain waves and then make
music from the brain waves but see i go
off on these
cool fun tangents but my challenge is
really synthesizing all my knowledge and
experience in a way that
really adds value without drifting
into a tangent just for the sheer fun of
it
that's my challenge wonderful uh and
what's the next step um
well i'm learning from this from this
group and
i think there's a i have sort of a
from the eastern thoughts and things
method of thinking about this now where
you
when you're deciding on the next step
you have a lot of stuff already in your
head you already have the answer
you just get really quiet and make
decisions from that place
instead of getting all hyped up that's
my next step
learning to just get quiet and feel that
guidance i'd say
that's that's beautiful thank you thank
you paul uh next up is going to be kevin
vanessa sanjay and ash
i'm sure hey thank you swing
thank you for a challenging question for
me
challenges uh every time i try move
forward a little bit i turned
turned down on myself even better way to
do it or better thinking
and my my challenge
i always try to look for some uh you for
yourself you call the general principle
or common one people can
easily understand can um

let's one thing i finally made
every time from our generation we go to
school
learn from teacher and then now we got a
better tool from the internet from
youtube
and for our peers and here's one thing
we
lacked from unknown to known
meaning the bill needed a bridge of
connection between
unknown to no so here we need to be
known why one suddenly known
as something we need to build some tools
and not just knowledge itself
if these principles are my applied
work for example let's see africa
the education system should be at least
no education or no teacher
there's no no worry about that it should
be just like
uh let's think pandemic ways let's see
this way
if everybody knows these tools they can
easily deliver
knowledge to others because it's either
like just
one whoa oh okay that's from what i
known turned to uh uh
unknown error and known more that
that's so my challenge is to find a lot
of tourists uh finding more momentum
tools thank you thank you kevin next up
is vanessa so vanessa what's your
challenge
and what's your next step well i think
of the saying
uh curiosity killed the cat but until
that point
uh that day a cat always lands on its
feet
and sometimes i my challenge is uh
um if i'm dealing with like a straight a
stranger even something it's
a difficult conversation where i feel
like maybe i don't have enough
to give to the conversation so whether
it's my generation i may
may be less likely to speak up because
it's like you don't want to stir the pod
and make it a more hostile environment
and sometimes being too empathetic like
i said finding that little thing where
okay i
need to speak up now but doing a
respectful way because i mean
i think at least in the us we stopped
talking to each other on some key
issues and if we could just sit back and
have like a heart to heart
you know maybe have to put the
politicians on holiday for the week or
whatever and you know let the kids
figure it out
but sometimes the kids are more creative
so it's like finding that
balance where okay um i realize uh
even though or even being humble saying
i don't have enough to uh
about this but this is something we have
to keep talking about and look into
because
this is the problem we need to solve and
maybe look a different avenue
thank you thank you vanessa uh let's see
next up is sanjay sanjay go ahead
yes uh thank you so um i think um so for
me
the challenges are um i mean the obvious
one is time
another one is is my memory because i
find it
i wish i had more memory or a better
memory
um another is distractions uh they're
oftentimes distractions and i um you
know daily life um errands to run things
like that uh
i have a long backlog of things that i
want to catch up and learn about
um finding other people with similar
ideas and ways of thinking
although this group is fantastic and the
um
the greater philadelphia thinking
exciting both of these groups have been
fantastic
um very happy that i um found them
um communicating this is something that
i
is it's a little difficult i won't go
into too much of here but community
effective communication with people i
find very difficult
in the sense that um the ideas we have
in our minds
sometimes can be quan quite complex and
the goal of getting that exact same idea
into another person's mind
is difficult um so that aspect of
communication
um as far as next steps um
the the approach that i take and again
this is next steps is continuing that
is um you know quietly observing what
what is happening what i'm seeing you
know and then like that
sometimes when i'm observing i tend to
decide too early
what i'm observing so so i need to
improve on that that's that's one of the
things that the next steps is to improve
on that
um trying you know attempting to
recreate what i see what i observed
um exploring broadly and the internet is
a fantastic tool for this i i find
although you have to be selective
um exploring broadly and also exploring
in depth
wonderful thank you thank you sanjay uh
last
is uh ash ash go ahead
uh yeah i have a similar challenge uh to
paul i guess and that
my my interests have become so broad
that
uh i am easily distracted by new ideas
and it can be very hard to you know
focus
on actually um
implementing something so
i guess i take some solace from the book
and how he talks about
you know don't think of yourself as
being behind and
sometimes what seems to be inefficiency
can actually
just be preparation for a greater
long-term payoff
um but yeah i definitely need to

figure out how to get myself to uh to
focus more on on a
on a long term project without getting
sidetracked by other things
wonderful uh thank you uh so i don't
want to go
for too long i want to wrap up uh but
sally
briefly go ahead
okay um so uh
the um i think i need to be more of a
specialist
um because um i think i have these
projects
that are up and they're begun
but i feel like just like some of the
characters in the
paul coelho book i think i'm saying his
name wrong um it's like the dream is
there
and it's like i'm comfortable in the
dream and i have to um
i have to get out of that
