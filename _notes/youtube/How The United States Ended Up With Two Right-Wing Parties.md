(00:01)  this episode and others like it are made possible by the generous support of my patrons on patreon if you'd like to help support this channel and get early access to every video consider becoming a patron at patreon.com second thought believe it or not the republicans are not the only major right-wing political party in america of course there are smaller conservative groups like the libertarian party and the constitution party but for all intents and purposes and contrary to what you've probably heard your whole
(00:30) life the democratic party might as well join them on that list how else could we categorize a party that blocks movement to the left passively accepts movement to the right and sometimes even embraces conservatism outright in this episode we're looking at how the democratic party takes advantage of the current electoral system to stop to the best of its ability the progress of left-wing politics and how it even actively promotes a right-wing agenda we're talking about something called the ratchet effect if you've been following
(00:58) this channel for a while you've probably already heard me talk about the absurdly stunted american political landscape if you're new here the basic idea is this american politics lean heavily to the right on one side of the aisle the republican party espouses alarmingly far-right politics more extreme in their nature than even some notable far-right parties in european politics like the national rally in france and ukip in the uk often left out of the story though is that the democratic party is also on the
(01:28) right perhaps not by u.s standards but in the range of political ideologies both parties are devoted to neo-liberalism and the ideology's strict adherence to free international trade austerity and highly privatized economies this means that at the end of the day democrats and republicans disagree on relatively few things and most of those things are minor aesthetic differences or the usual hot-button culture war topics but stopping our analysis there ignores the special role democrats play in the american political
(01:59) system democrats actively enable the republican agenda in politics this is called the ratchet effect the idea goes something like this when republicans hold power the gears of the ratchet engage and the machine begins to move to the right happily clicking along as policies pass judges are replaced and budgets are approved come the time when democrats return to power the ratchet is meant to move left but the party acts as the paul immobilizing the gears meaning the ratchet remains completely stuck until republicans return to power and
(02:31) things go back to moving right again in the real world this ratchet effect can be seen when democrats do any or frequently all of three things passively accept movement towards the right move to the right themselves and block movement to the left let's start with that last one it's becoming obvious that properly leftist ideas are gaining traction in the u.
(02:53) s as i've mentioned in previous videos more and more people are losing faith in capitalism and are looking elsewhere for options popularity and socialism is on the rise and several policies americans have typically considered left-wing like universal health care increased minimum wages tuition-free college and the federal legalization of marijuana are more popular than ever with around two-thirds of americans and the overwhelming majority of democratic voters supporting them but these policies and many many others never become law why
(03:25) because democrats aren't responding to the growth in popularity of leftism in fact they're actively resisting it they do this in several ways during elections it's as simple as democratic elites clearing the path for their more centrist candidates like clinton and biden by handing them endorsements and the keys to their more powerful fundraising apparatus the mainstream media also heavily favors these so-called moderates offering effectively limitless free publicity and often outright slandering the more
(03:53) left-leaning candidates but it doesn't stop there once in government the party's attachment to centrism only grows we see this when biden abandons the fight for a 15 minimum wage long before it starts leading it to fail in the senate we see it in the infrastructure bill going from this to this we see it in the complete silence of high-ranking democrats when amazon workers and alabama coal miners attempt to unionize or go on strike leaving them alone and without the support they were promised by america's so-called most
(04:23) pro-union president you've ever seen everywhere you look the ratchet is frozen in place they aren't fighting like hell for the little guy they're getting in his way now of course when republicans take control of government the ratchet begins to move freely again policies get passed with purely performative resistance judges get appointed who uphold right-wing policies for decades and the country continues trending towards the right when democrats return to office concentration camps along the southern border become
(04:53) immigration overflow facilities and remain open immigrants are told do not come the u.s embassy remains in jerusalem despite an ongoing genocide and military budgets continue to rise nothing quite illustrates the ratchet effect better than the u.s corporate tax rate over time these are the taxes that corporations have to pay the same way you and i do when we earn our income back in 2017 trump cut taxes for both the richest americans and corporations while giving effectively nothing to the rest of us but the promise of an
(05:23) eventual fictional trickle down with this cut trump brought the corporate tax rate from an already low 35 percent down to a paltry 20 shifting the tax burden even further onto the shoulders of average americans and away from his party's corporate donors and himself thankfully biden is bringing it back up to 25 28 if we're lucky seven to ten points lower than where it started here the trend becomes clear year after year republicans push further and further for imperialist foreign policy for xenophobic immigration restrictions for
(05:59) rich americans to hoard more and more wealth democrats come to appease the masses promising they'll be different from the previous administrations returning power to the people but always less than they had before and never getting in the way of this greater rightward trend this isn't to say democrats never pass progressive legislation they sometimes do but it remains an exceptionally rare event especially in comparison to the number of conservative policies that pass and it's always less than what they promised
(06:29) less than what they could theoretically achieve and nowhere close to what would be considered progressive in other developed countries now these are all situations where democrats appear ineffective where they try but fail to deliver on the demands of their constituents but they can be far more harmful every time they gain power democrats adopt some new right-wing policy pushing the left further outside the realm of acceptable politics and allowing the right to claim even more outrageous amounts of ideological
(06:58) territory as it adopts according to some the trappings of a fascist state we've seen this for decades in the late 60s and 70s it was law and order a seemingly innocuous phrase coined by nixon became realized in full force by reagan's disastrous war on drugs law and order became one of the rallying cries of a political program that threw the black community black men in particular in jail with long sentences for so-called broken window crimes minor crimes heavily punished so that the state could showcase its power politicians drummed
(07:31) up fear of black and minority criminals while simultaneously terrorizing non-white communities with an over-militarized police force in the 90s democrats latched onto this republican program with their own narratives you may have heard the term super predator this super predator a young criminal with no remorse became the myth that glued the democratic tough on crime program together the clinton administration in particular led its own wave of over-policing with the infamous crime bill which included what was
(08:00) called three strikes lifetime sentencing put more police on the streets increased the scope of the death penalty and of course put more people in jail than ever before these are not the policies of a left-wing government generally speaking democrats are quick to jump on the police state bandwagon we've seen it when the biden administration tries to increase police funding and deploy it against black lives matter protesters we've seen it with the passage of the patriot act by a democratic-led senate back in 2001. over time democrats tack
(08:30) more and more right-wing politics onto their agenda until the democrats of today begin looking a lot like yesterday's republicans there are two main reasons the democrats act this way first they rely heavily on large corporate interests weapons manufacturers the pharmaceutical industry and fossil fuel companies are some of the most influential sources of funding for both political parties and so will necessarily drag the democrats further to the right than their constituents and the american people in general want them to go just look at the
(09:01) biden administration's stance on oil drilling second the u.s works on a mostly majoritarian model of democracy in these types of democracies two parties naturally rise to power and completely dominate the political arena whoever has the most votes that is electoral college votes leads the country naturally creating the incentive to vote for only those parties who stand a chance of winning in the u.
(09:24) s the democrats and republicans this does a few things one it stops third parties from gaining any significant traction after all why vote for the party you like better if they have no chance of winning two it stops the two big parties from having to actually be accountable to their core voters who have no choice but to vote for them so long as they remain preferable to the other option which they always will there will always be a quote lesser evil and three the two parties must now compete over the same centrist voters to have any chance of
(09:56) winning forcing them closer ideologically since both parties are already dragged towards the right by their wealthy donors fearful of the unruly masses the center creeps ever so steadily towards the right and with it goes the entirety of american politics every election year the democrats elected to the highest levels of power get there by feeding us the same lines they say we alone provide an alternative to the past x years of disaster and the objectionable republican figurehead we alone are the barrier that prevents the
(10:27) free reign of regressive conservative politics surely you wouldn't vote for the fascist and yet in the very same breath they assure us that they need to work across the aisle that our democracy hinges on their need to move towards the center and capture the mythical swing voters who decide the election according to them this is the only reasonable approach this is what it means to be electable all the while american politics move steadily further right there is some hope though within the democratic party
(10:56) progressive figures are gaining traction and getting elected the policies that are considered too far left by corporate democrats like medicare for all and the green new deal are actually the policies that are kicking them out of office and earning their more progressive counterparts a spot at the table that being said progressive politicians regularly find themselves defanged by their corporate counterparts over time they are assimilated into the centrist fold with every concession to the party's elite so while electoral
(11:24) politics do provide some short-term gains most notably starting the radicalization process of many apathetic americans actual change will only come from popular grassroots movements if you're looking for ways to get involved see if any groups near you are looking for help joining your local chapter of a national group like the dsa or any of the several left-wing political parties or your city's mutual aid collective can have a bigger impact than you think the main takeaway is this the united states is run by a two-party corporate duopoly
(11:54) both the republicans and the democrats are beholden to the same corporate interests and both parties are dedicated to the maintenance of the untenable and increasingly dystopian neo-liberal status quo both our major parties are right-wing this trend will only continue to get worse until the left the real left can mount an effective opposition to this deeply flawed and inhumane political project if we want to make real positive lasting change if we want to safeguard future generations against climate fallout if we want to stop the
(12:25) inevitable transformation of neoliberalism into outright fascism we have our work cut out for us so let's get to work i mentioned at the beginning of this video that this kind of content is made possible by my patrons on patreon when i decided to make the shift from general interest stuff to more radical political content i knew i ran the risk of syncing my channel and losing my ad revenue and sponsors these days it's pretty hard to get a sponsor on my videos i have one reliable one and they're great but for
