Christopher Alexander - Life in Buildings (Full)

## Transcript:

christopher alexander whom i know only
slightly has had an enormous
critical influence on my life and work
and i think that's true of a whole
generation of people
i think that
for me it began on the second floor of
the library of the graduate school of
design at harvard when i was looking for
something else and i ran across an essay
by this person christopher alexander
called the city is not a tree
that was a landmark moment in my
development as a thinker and as an
architect
it really blew away what were the
foundational principles of the education
at harvard in those days
and it established in me an interest in
actually looking at the world and not
looking at a set of preconceived
abstract mechanical ideas that we're
supposed to replace the existing world
chris's scholarship in fact has been
his criticism
by his proposals
implicating
and critiquing contemporary practice
the inclination to focus beyond the
individual building on placemaking that
might in fact
please its users
a kind of radical idea it made me think
about
what really how can you break a project
down into requirements is what he called
them uh you know women should face a
certain direction or there should be
wind protection or whatever the thing
was and
uh
like everybody i think of my generation
i bought those books
and i
went on and did other things and it all
came back to me when i was building my
own house i realized at one point i
think it was because i had placed a
window somewhere and i realized you
couldn't see anything through that
window and it really should be a little
bit lower and a little bit over here and
then you had a nice view out
and somehow the patterns started falling
into place but all the patterns were
actually there they sort of came out
naturally and even the one about
sleeping facing a certain direction that
was the way our bed sort of turned out
and it was the thing that i think
convinced me totally that experience of
the correctness the sort of fundamental
correctness
of his vision
his idea that you make places that
people appreciate that people love
might be the formula for the ultimate
sustainability
in which you make places that
um
people in participating in making and in
their beauty will want
to save
i don't think i'm saying anything
controversial uh to anyone here tonight
when i observed that in the last century
we humans have begun to make a very
worrisome mess of our planet and of
course a lot of this has to do with the
ways that we've chosen to build our
world and for many people there's a
growing perception that the manifest
sustainability of this state of affairs
is in some perhaps deep and important
way uh connected to the growing ugliness
of the world that we're building
so i think one reason that christopher
alexander's work strikes such a strong
emotional cord for so many people is
that he took up this challenge a long
time ago and he offered a very humane
vision of a more hopeful alternative
he reminded us of the beautiful and
harmonious places that we are capable of
achieving and have achieved and he
offered some ideas about how to achieve
them again in a way that's likely to be
much more sustainable and more beautiful

that's wonderful
would you like your tea
is this yours yeah oh god it's cold
would you
like a hot tub okay
yeah okay i think i mean i'm gonna make
myself some
i've got some water here that's fine
now it's growing very hard
really one of the
very largest problems
that is
facing the earth
just now
is rarely mentioned
and that is
the spread of ugliness
by the standards of the 20th century it
sounds
like a
sort of rather trivial and unimportant
issue
it's not it's on the same scale
as
the alarm that was spread when people
began to realize that the brazilian
rainforest was being
destroyed
nine out of ten
development projects that are being done
now

devastate the area where they're built
uh this is going on at a colossal speed
and no amount of planning
and architecture in the
current
way of thinking
is going to save it
in fact if anything architects are
contributing to it
by
making their particular contributions
more and more fantastic uh so that they
can be on the cover of magazines
the
the real issue is
something that i
call adaptation
and that means
the extent to which
all the little bits
whether it be of a building or of a
sidewalk or of a staircase or
anything
can only be made right if it is done
slowly and with care
and by people who know the immediate
vicinity
and uh
um
the number of actions that are needed
to take care
of a piece of the environment
uh
and get that kind of
beautiful
subtle fine-tuning
of the alignment of streets and the
width of a road at a certain place and
the preservation of a tree in a certain
place where it would otherwise be taken
down
and
so on
we
urgently
and desperately need to find a way of
doing this which is consistent with our
21st century world
so what is the nature of order all about
took
25 years to write
four big fat books or big thick books
unfortunately a little expensive about
60 dollars a book
thousands of lovely colored pictures
anyway what's it all about
when i finished the pattern language
i thought that i had come close
to solving the problem
of
making good human environments
and that if people went to work and and
used all those patterns
um
something very uh beautiful and good
would follow
in the hands of ordinary people and just
from the use of that
language that pattern language
um
that turned out to be not true
the
early experiments that i made after the
book came out
the pattern language book came out i
made it over a period of years i made
experiments
to see what happened when people
actually used this
and
yes certainly things
i think people did things that were very
very helpful to them
and some of them are
are quite lovely in a
just in the sense of being informal and
being about that person or this person
or that place and so forth
but

the buildings
and the groups of buildings and so forth
were not really
beautiful to put it quite simply
they weren't
luckily i was at that time
still
relatively early in my professional life
and so i had time to think about this
and
um what the nature of order is about
is
what does it take
to make the the things beautiful
um
really and truly beautiful in the
old-fashioned meaning of the word
um
so that it touches you in your heart
and what these books attempt to do
is to describe
what is involved in thinking about that
what's involved in
doing it
what's involved
from a practical point of view in terms
of construction contracting and so forth
what's involved from a spiritual point
of view
so that
you as the maker whoever that is
are in a sufficiently harmonious state
to be able to make a beautiful thing so
it's really the gamut of all of that
is what these books are about
and um
i certainly got closer
in
those books
than i did in the pattern language a lot
closer
i've come to the conclusion
that in order to set our ideas about
architecture straight
and in order really
to establish a clear picture
of what we're doing when we build
it's necessary to make changes
in our
conception
of how the physical universe is put
together
that actually the order of space is
prior to the issue of function
that is in other words although
functional issues are overwhelmingly
important
the root matter
has to do with order in space
and that there are ways
of getting hold of that issue
which are so deep that they cover the
functional issues but they turn out to
be more fundamental and in fact they
have the ornamental stuff and the formal
stuff as by-products of them
but that structure by the way this
structure that i want to talk about is
not very obscure i mean i can easily put
a name on it i can call it wholeness if
you want
we can call it many things
and i'm going to show some examples of
physical things that have this a deep
kind of wholeness in them
and then we'll just talk a little bit
about what sort of structure they have
can we say anything about what these
structures are
can we be explicit about it at all
i after thinking carefully about this
for a number of years
been able to identify somewhere around
about a dozen
something between a dozen of 15
different structural properties that
repeatedly exist
of course it remains to be discussed and
argued whether these deep structures are
important or not

so


when one discovers 12 15 properties of a
certain sort which are structural
properties that appear to characterize a
class of structures then you say to
yourself well what is going on what are
these properties
i mean where do they come from what's
the meaning of them
and quite simply
the conclusion that i've come to i don't
know if it's the right way to explain it
is that they are
essentially the different ways in which
space can be glued together
to become whole

do

me

if it's true that space has the capacity
to be more whole or less whole and there
are real structural properties that have
the capacity to glue it together more or
less
both in a functional sense and in a deep
sense
and then of course in some way one would
start to confront
a kind of moral imperative
that that is what we're supposed to be
doing when we make something
to glue space together like that
of course another very important
question that you ask is well how do you
produce something which has this
unity of space or this kind of wholeness
or this glued together quality
how do you actually go about making
something like that
the number of actions that have to if i
if i take an area let's say
the sake of argument
100 square meters by 100 square meters
one hectare or two acres
the number of adaptations that need to
be made
is is somewhere on the order of about
somewhere between 1 and 10 billion
10
billion
little tweaks that have to do with
pushing this stone that way
opening up that window that much
making the slope of that particular roof
be like that
and
so on and so forth
that's a ferocious number
and it isn't it's not just the number in
and of itself
because it can't be done
in a
um
it can't be done in a computerized form
far away from the place
because then you haven't got the real
data to work with and you
you don't see the hole that exists and
therefore you don't know what
adaptations are needed in order to make
every little bit just right
so this is something that's got to be
done
in the field
um
so that means we have to conceive
a process
in which
there are 100
by meters by 100 meter area
is able to take
11 billion
actions
and
um
and to do it
in a reasonable time

with a
reasonable kind of cost
uh
the
our our lack of ability to do this is
essentially what has been destroying the
world for the last hundred years or so
um
it was commonplace before that it always
was taking place it was took place very
very slowly
and it was always people who were
intimately
familiar with
are you all right
um
intimately familiar with the place where
it had to be done
we have no idea how to do that first of
all the process of making the
the
controlling the process of
design construction planning
and detailing has has been removed
already from the site
almost entirely
um
and um
so what is
in in order to
solve this problem
a a really gigantic
change in the
steps we go through
the
to make the environment on a daily basis
and that that's really the challenge
that we face at the moment it's a far
greater challenge
than the so-called sustainability issue
of of putting energy
um you know
in
finding energy by sustainable means i
mean that's a very very important
problem
but it's a trivially easy problem
compared with the problem that i've just
described
and
we need to
set our minds to work on on this problem
uh it it and uh
it has huge ramifications of course i
mean you can see that it
affects building contracts it affects
the nature of subcontracts
it affects the nature of specifications
it affects planning law
it affects
the politics of neighborhoods
and
because because the
what it implies
is that the overall distribution of
control
is is to be utterly altered
it's a completely benign
transfer of control
to the people who actually
know what to do and who
will be able to take it on relatively
easily
but resting that control
from government agencies and from the
large architectural engineering firms
and so on is is a huge undertaking
and um
of course
what is needed in order to
make it
happen is not just some sort of battle
with
large
cumbersome
institutions
we need to
visualize
in practical detail
the kind of process that can make this
happen
you were talking before about
the the ugliness
the increasing ugliness of the world and
that this is not just a
sort of
psychological issue
you know a peripheral issue it's
actually telling us something
uh
ecologically profound
right
and and then in talking about the nature
of order
um
and talking about the the issue of
beauty
the same thing is true isn't it that
it's not simply about well i would like
to be in the presence of beautiful
things yes you would
but
the reason you would like to be in the
presence of beautiful things is that you
are well
and they are well
exactly and um yes very well put the um
right
so
that's why i think people are getting
very interested that the more perceptive
ecologists and environmental
thinkers and activists and others are
getting more interested in the nature of
order
is that it addresses that
dimension
and i wonder if you could expand on that
a little bit and your thoughts what what
was your aim and what you see is this
role in in thinking um
more ecologically about
um
our our age and how we live and
and what we need to do to be well as you
put it
well i think it is true that people are
in a state of tremendous um
unease i mean tremendous internal unease
it doesn't matter how many
um
fast cars you've got and
how many
exotic vacations you can take with
ryanair or somebody else
this is not
this is not going to
bring
to you
what you want of life and and i think i
think yes people are
beginning to realize that

and
i think they're aching for it actually i
mean it's a
it's a an amazing and sobering discovery
to make you know when we're so affluent
and when people feel that everything is
sort of okay
it's sort of gradually beginning to get
into people's minds that this is a
serious problem i mean it's not as if it
hasn't been in people's minds before
because after all
young and freud lived almost 100 years
ago
and
they
they opened up avenues
uh that also had to do with this sort of
thing and trying to
help people
cope with their inner life and actually
um
bring their inner life into a state that
would
make them
truly well
so it's been around for a long time

i suppose i'm one of the
i suppose you could say as a pioneer
really
to say
to people look
the shape of the environment
the buildings the rooms
the gardens
all these things
are directly connected
to the degree to which
a human being
can compose himself or herself
and
and in which a group of people can be
together
under
deep and valuable circumstances
it can't be separated from the
environment
uh
i think at one time people thought that
it
was separate i can remember when i was a
student back then
there was a lot of talk going on about
what did the environment
actually influence behavior and so on
and it was being asked always in a very
um
silly sort of mechanical
way
to which the proper answer was no
because obviously human beings are not
automata and and the environment isn't
going to kind of push me pull you
into being something or other thing
but um

nevertheless
i think i've shown in
innumerable ways
how
a person's well-being is dependent on
the geometric
and practical organization of things at
the tiny scale like that and big scale
and gigantic scale of kilometers miles
what have you
um
that's what the nature reward is about
it's about all of that stuff
and
i think people should pay attention to
it
um there were several strands in here
that i want
how do you like this format by the way i
like it okay i think it's fun enjoying
it
um
the uh
you're talking about the
1960s and 50s when you were
active in
writing your first uh
first book
notes on the synthesis of form and
there was this notion of functionalism
which was
not about aesthetics or if aesthetics
was involved it was more a matter of
sort of information processing
and it seems to me what you have really
in your career
taken from that point you've built on it
but you've said
actually aesthetics
in in the sense of
our ability to perceive holes
and to perceive beauty
which is a kind of wholeness i mean
that's what you say that's what beauty
really is
and that actually you can
you can
have a science of that
and you can have an art of that and you
can
build your life around that kind of
understanding
and um and that
actually that's what we had better do
you said at
one point um to be well we must set our
sights on such a future
and

so
i guess that what i'm interested to hear
you
discuss is how you
um how do you think your ideas on that
have changed since the days when you
were in
cambridge england and cambridge
massachusetts
and um
and and what what to me is the most
personally perhaps the most fascinating
part of your work which is the
relationship between structure and
meaning or equality
um
which is intimate you've
shown um
and
how do you see that
where are you in that process now can
can you say a little bit more before i
try to answer sure because i don't i
mean of course i get the general gist of
the of the question
but if you could just sharpen the
question a little bit okay
um
there's there's a um
you know in in philosophy and
mathematics there's a whole field of
of uh structuralism and an understanding
of how
particularly linguistic structures work
but other
other structures
and left out of that equation up until
now really has been
uh
but also sort of lurking in the
background and causing all kinds of
problems
is
value and meaning
and it seems to me that's been a core
focus of your work all along always yes
absolutely
and what um
what
have you done in the nature of order um
to
to develop that
thread further because it to me it has
been a
a central um
am i right oh yes you are yes yes
absolutely um
well
referring specifically to to the to the
nature of order
uh
see it's very very difficult
to
deal with the nature of order
properly without talking about god
i i
i lectured on the nature of order for
years
wrote the books
most of that time i myself did not speak
about god i very
very very rarely so much as mentioned
that subject
in the lecture room
i think there was a certain sense that
it was inappropriate
and i'm
embarking now
on a
view of the world
where
the question of what is the nature of
god can be discussed
thought about
considered
critically
one doesn't need to make um
exaggerated statements about it
one doesn't need to
um

you know believe in visitations
from the virgin mary
one
does need
to consider
what is the nature of wholeness
in the universe
and what are the conditions under which
wholeness grows
what is wholeness
uh and the answers to that
straightforward question
cannot be
given by
mechanistic
thought modes
so the problem is i mean there is this
thing of how the greater whole works
and as i say um
i'm personally quite convinced
that it cannot be
subjected to
analysis by primitive mechanism
on the other hand i'm also convinced
that it can be
approached
through rational
mathematical
thought
it deals with real phenomena
and some
and as i say these phenomena gradually
um
what should i say they gradually sort of
go in transition
towards
touching such questions as the nature of
god
um
and and you may say well but what if god
doesn't exist what if this is all huha
well
the point is
that
there there are these phenomena
of wholeness which is the most important
of all of them
if you rule out
forms of explanation
even
observations of certain kind of
phenomena
and do not allow yourself
to tell
as far as you can the exact truth about
what is going on in these cases
um
but only allow those things to be said
which
which can be
handled
in a mechanistic framework
at this point you're simply doing bad
science
i mean it's not you can't do
science has to do with knowing knowledge
and
um
so there's this huge gray area
and it's which which doesn't so much
have to do with spooks and poltergeists
it has to do with very
fascinating things
about how the whole acts
and how
and and and at the moment for instance
there's been a belief in the last decade
or so
that you can understand how the whole
behaves
as a result of complex interactions
um
between
many many particles or in us
if you
don't want to view some complex system
as a cellular automaton
that by
by
in effect programming the the way that
the different cells interact in that
cellular automaton one can hope to
realize
the behavior of something
in a holistic fashion now there's a
severe limitation on that
it is true that some
apparently holistic phenomena can be
simulated like that and can be reached
like that
but there are other far greater issues
where
the whole is acting
where at the moment there is absolutely
no possib no probability in sight of
being able to explain them
um
in that simple-minded way
and yet
if we're dealing
with such topics as
you were raising a little while ago
about
people's well-being
and and so forth
the wholeness that
is
necessary
to to make a human being
deeply grounded
and
at one with the world around
that is not within the reach of
mechanistic explanations it but it is
not only a subtle but also a very
important problem
which needs to be tackled head on

by whatever means it takes
to come to terms with it
and in the nature of order going back to
that book for a moment
i laid some of the first steps
of a path that goes in that direction
and as i said i'm i'm now embarked on a
on a series of new books about seven or
eight of them
uh which
which will try to complete the journey
and actually make clear how
all this necessarily fits together
you mentioned the problem of
compartmentalization
and you pointed out that really that's
bad science
because ultimately you can't
compartmentalize um
you you might get a nice uh
it might be a nice trick for a while but
sooner or later you've got to start
integrating these areas of knowledge
and isn't that what you're saying when
you're talking about god that
we have compartmentalized
under this
category of god all the things that have
to do with the with the
uh the wholeness of life the meaning of
life the beauty of life that the
divinity of life
and
trivialized it in a way by saying well
that's just something
that's over in the corner
and
yes
go ahead no you you're quite right i
think i think that kind of
compartmentalization is
drastically uh
dangerous and
it's
i mean the id
the idea that it's okay to do
uh physics
um
but the god has to be kept behind closed
doors
is ludicrous in in view of
uh
if you
think about the very
extraordinary
proposals that are currently being made
in in contemporary physics
they're more far out
in many ways
than any religious
thought ever was
there is absolutely no reason to erect
that sort of barrier
and um
it's really just a pretense it's it's
based on wishful thinking about what you
can do with mechanistic explanations
and and um i think to this day a lot of
scientists
can't quite go there
that is they
would like to pursue
the explanations of the phenomena they
encounter
but they restrict
plausible or acceptable
explanations
to those that can be formulated in a
mechanistic way
and of course the issue is very
important is well okay how can you
formulate a rational explanation in a
non-mechanistic way and what does that
look like
and and
that's once again one of the things that
i'm taking up in these books that are
now in preparation
the um
the suppression of this realm of
of life or this compartmentalization
uh it seems to me
um
is coming back
in
to haunt us in in many ways for example
you talked about islamic fundamentalism
and we had talked before about the fact
that um
there's a
clearly a strong motivation
that that many uh of the 9 11 terrorists
for example
said they were
muhammad was a was an urban planner who
was
outraged at the destruction of aleppo
syria by
modern development right
and that their heritage and their
culture and their
um
their metaphysical beliefs were being
shredded trampled yeah
trampled and um
there's that dimension but it seems to
me there's also the dimension of
um what you talked about earlier of the
sort of lack of
satisfaction in our own lives and
happiness in our own lives that we
um
we're using so many resources and and
at such a high level of consumption
and it's not making us any happier and
this is being shown by research that you
know people
there's this wealth plateau where people
stop
getting any happier
and
and this is
this is the penny that's got to drop
with sustainability too
doesn't it because
um how
are we ever going to have a an
ecological or sustainable way of living
if we don't deal with that absolutely
yes quite
it says we've got three minutes okay
let's
stop right there
i wonder if you could
give us your thoughts about
technology and the way that technology
is changing
um
you know a lot of architects today have
a
try to paint a wonderful picture of the
future that we're all going to live in
these wonderful skyscraper cities and
technology is going to save us we're
going to have clean energy and and so on
and some of those architects
are more perceptive about
the biological characteristics of those
structures
some of them are big advocates of
biomimicry and biophilia
and they want to say you know these are
these structures are more
more life-like
what i find fascinating about your work
is that you say no we don't want
technology that's more lifelike
we want technology that is
living that is life
i wonder if you could
well yes i i was just thinking when you
started
asking about technology
when i
told you
in in in that first
tape we made
about
100 meters by 100 meters area containing
some 10 billion
smaller holes that and and those are the
ones that are i'm not incl of course i'm
not including molecules and stuff like
that those are just the ones at the
sort of perceivable
level where you can touch and recognize
and um
and shaping all of those
in such a way that they
they fit together harmoniously and they
really belong together
is a gigantic
technological
task
i mean in other words it is
i suppose that might sound like science
fiction to some people
um
i don't feel that at all
i don't think it's science fiction i
think it is something that will happen
must happen
um
but the whole question is what is
the nature of the way in which that
activity is steered
right you know you on the one hand
you've got various people
who

who know
perhaps even sort of you might say every
bush certainly in blade of grass
and obviously uh
every
paving stone
uh
but it's an incredibly subtle
form of linkage
that is required
where
in effect it's a new technology that is
needed
to

to allow us
to guide that process
and i say i mean us in the plural even
for a relatively small place
um
so that the the thing is developing in
real time
um the peop the players
that is the citizens of earth
are
conscious
of this as an activity
uh are aware
that it is in their hands and that it's
their responsibility
to try to make these
fine
tuning adaptations
it is actually in their hands
to preserve and extend the beauty of
that particular place
but the technological fact remains that
there are
10 billion
entities to be shaped
and it's no good
i mean 10 billion is
10 000 million
so
uh
that's that is a lot of things to pay
attention to
and shape them
and so the technology i'm quite certain
it will be computer assisted in some
form
um
it may even get computer assist
from
the mathematics of structure preserving
transformations
but it's so unbelievably different from
taking a piece of
of wood and cutting it into
lengths
and building
a simple fence
where of course we're also doing
detailed adaptation to every one of
those pieces
um
and very carefully if you know it's not
hard to do in the case of a simple fence
um
it it it will not be helpful for this to
become computerized
in the
sense
of the computer somehow
um
being the surrogate for the actual place
or the actual fence
um
because i i'm i'm certain absolutely
certain that a human being
uh
or several human beings need to be
have their feet planted on the ground
and need to be steering that process
on the other hand because it is so
complicated
um

it will need a huge technological assist
and
i don't know right now
what is the right way to do that
and we've only just at this moment
arrived
at a state of play
where one could contemplate that
question
i mean now we we do we do have computers
that have the capacity to do it we have
um
innovations in complex system theory
uh and i think you know that i'm part of
a
project like that at the university of
york
um
where we can
again contemplate how this may be done
and how people might interact with it
um
that would be the by the most
spectacular piece of technology by far
outweighing
a titanium
spectacle frames
you know in terms of how interesting it
is or how important it is
um
i don't think if once this is achieved i
think it will
dwarf
all other forms of technology
in terms of its importance
and its use
by human beings
so you're really talking about a
um
a step change in how we use technology
and how technology interacts with
with our lives and in our living
processes and and how we understand that
can can you describe that a little bit
you use the phrase of
structure-preserving transformations and
some
some viewers might not
know uh what that is and
perhaps if you could just um
give a short uh short summary of that
and then talk about how that work is is
going on in
in york with your colleagues there
well these structure preserving
transformations or wholeness
enhancing transformations
they're they're fundamental to all the
adaptation
because
when something is
is well done or well made
it starts with the structure that is
there
and then that structure has to be in a
way corroborated
um confirmed
by whatever you do there next
so you cannot wade in and just
do something arbitrary just because you
think it's nice
or a good idea you you really if if you
are
acting in a way that is responsible
you look at the structure that the earth
has at that particular
spot
and
you
you try to discern

what the thing you wish to do
how how it
fits and enhances
the existing structure that is there
which will be almost certainly include
buildings
roads whatever i mean in other words
it's i i'm not talking about nature
solely although the same thing has to be
true of nature
and i mentioned the fence a moment ago i
mean the very first thing you need to do
if you're going to build a fence and
adapt it to the
land
in which it is
of course you have to be looking at the
lie of the land what is a comfortable
and appropriate alignment for that fence
are the
how do you place the fence
so that
drainage water
doesn't
puddle around the posts which will then
rot out
you know so so there's a whole
um
and and usually
you can find
something that
is
that i call a latent centers
to guide you in other words if
if you know you're going to put in a
fence
and then you look for things that are
already
somehow
marked as potentially emergent holes
in the land
and you
then stay okay in that case we'll put a
post here and we'll put a post here and
a post there in the post over there
and have it having and and and if that
is done
so that indeed the structure of the land
that's there when you start
is enhanced by the fence then you have a
beautiful fence and that piece of the
world has become slightly more
harmonious as a result of that action
and
so that's what a that's what a structure
preserving transformation is or a
wholeness uh preserving transformation
um
yeah
um and the
opposite of that approach would be to go
to the big box
shopping center and buy a post kit and
then take that sort of template and just
plop it down right and then whatever
incidental relationship it has with
what's there well that's just what you
get and
that's sort of the way we've built the
modern world isn't it
i mean uh actually i need to get
understand your question more precisely
are you talking about
a ready-made fence
or are you talking about
uh a sort of kit of posts and
and uh and runners a ready-made fence
already a completely ready-made fence oh
yes absolutely because you can guarantee
that um
that that it won't be quite right in in
in any actual given place
but this is how we're building
absolutely this is what people do now
people criticize um
you know cookie cutters subdivisions or
uh but in fact much of of architecture
as well is because it is
essentially template-based isn't it yes
absolutely yes um it's it's rather than
adaptive in some
rigorous way and so
that's why they're so gruesome yeah
yeah absolutely
and and that going back to our topic
yesterday on aesthetics
um
the human um
conscious
the perceptive system is marvelously
able to perceive
these qualities and to find things that
just don't quite feel right you know
unsettling and
you know i mean i i know my my
colleagues in new urbanism struggle with
this all the time in part because they
they do um
designs that are in many ways quite good
and then they sort of turn it over to
the conventional building process and
it's all sort of stamped out in the
visual way and has this unsettling
um artificial
well i don't think they've actually
fully
taken the idea on board i don't think
they really understand this idea that
i'm speaking about
and um
i i want to emphasize one aspect of it
you know it sounds somewhat
perhaps forbidding within with long name
like structure preserving wholeness
enhancing and so forth
and i also said you know that it might
well be
involving computers and and i'm talking
about
11 or 10 million
knowable
bits and pieces within that 100 by 100
plot
and um
i think what has to be emphasized is
they're gorgeous
right there now you just want to swing
the camera and take them out the sun is
shining on those yellow breasts
yeah anyway it's all right
i'll cut to that
okay
um
but uh
the thing is that what i've
just
enunciated is so simple
the idea
that each thing has to be fitted to its
place in the world
is really
of course it's common sense
it's about the most elementary thing
almost that you could possibly say about
architecture
and and and and towns and so on
and yet at this moment in history nobody
is doing it
to well
with the exception let's say of one
percent of the people maybe
and
um
it is
it's not even thought about and yet it's
the most dramatically important thing
there is if you just do that one thing
and nothing else
you're almost home there you're almost
home free
it's so it's it's both
tiny
in its intellectual
compass
and absolutely gigantic in its
consequences
you know
um
yeah
and there's quite an interest now one of
the things i'm very encouraged by is
among
um architecture students there's a new
interesting design build
and then getting out and actually making
things yes and isn't that
uh essential to the whole it is
changed the process of building yes yes
absolutely absolutely
and and that that in turn does require a
lot of uh fine
details of administration and and uh
the flow of money and and the decision
making along the way as you go because
you discover new things to
new adjustments that need to be made
there's just no other way to do it
a lot of people are very interested in
your work in computer science
and so i wanted to turn to your work in
york and and
you're working in computer science more
generally
you're very well known as
developing pattern languages
but i think people may not be aware of
where you've taken that and where you
intend to take that
so i'd be fascinated to hear more about
the cosmos project your work in york and
how it relates to you've talked about
structure preserving transformations
and uh how this work is going forward
with
new computer science
i'm not sure i'm really ready to speak
about it yet i mean i i'm not shy of
speaking about it
but we've only just begun
the
essentially what it consists of is that
we are
trying
to build a computer model of of of
wholeness in in in a given
thing
so that one can then
see if
if
the computer can be instructed
to find the latent centers
in a given configuration i mean that's
very simply the
problem uh
that is what we're
exactly attempting to do week by week
um we're a long way from getting there
uh
and
i remember when when um
how long ago was that it was about 10
years ago i think that that i was um
holding some discussions with bill joy
who used to be one of the owners of sun
microsystems
when he was one of the founders and
talked to him about this and he was
tremendously excited about it
and
and and he said okay fine can can you
can you really do that
and i said well no not yet
no uh we can
we can possibly begin thinking about it
but we can't do it yet and that was ten
years ago and that situation has changed
now
i i
i'm not going to put a bet on how
likely it is that we will succeed in
this even if we succeed in a rudimentary
form
it will be
very important
if i think for an odd reason and that is
that if we can find algorithms which do
that
it's not that that process will then be
computerized but more
it will be possible to tell people
what the search for the latent centers
really is i mean if you can tell a dumb
machine to do that then obviously it
means that we have to understand it and
and there will be a wider understanding
of that very very vital issue
uh and
which will be needed to accomplish the
adaptation that i was speaking about and
there could be all sorts of uh
benefits in terms of
cognition and
neuroscience aesthetics the
understanding of how we yes yes exactly
that's right and also that's one of the
fascinating things about your career
is the way some of these threads have
gone off into

different fields and sort of come come
full circle in a way and that certainly
seems to be happening with computer
science now that um
you know you've you've spawned all these
um
fascinating things and now you're sort
of bringing it back to
uh to to your own work on structure
preserving transformations
what do you think
do you see that this could be
potentially a guide for users in laying
out a community or
yes
absolutely yes no doubt about that hard
to know ahead of time isn't it how what
the applications could be
but
um clearly it's
the effort to make well it's not
actually i mean in other words if if if
somebody it's not hard to to identify
that
if somebody wants to
um
build
20 houses
on a particular piece of land
um one of the reasons you you touched on
this earlier already
if this was done in the way in which
developers normally develop tracts you
know that there's going to be a plan
there which is
independent of what the land is actually
telling it to be
and so of course it feels like a gash no
matter
no matter if it's done nicely or not
it's still going to be a gash
and if if
if
the technology that i've just been
referring to
becomes available
then
uh
immediately there would be tools
available
for a builder or a planner or or a
community
to say well okay
let's pinpoint
the key latent centers in this piece of
land
and let
them tell us
where the major
features
of this thing that we're about to build
where they should be and how they should
be laid out i think that'll become
as commonplace as set
nav systems in the car
you know
which
what 15 years ago it was sort of just
barely
known as a possibility
and now it's commonplace
so i don't think that that's a
particularly a particularly
long stretch
what i find fascinating
is
there's that paper there's um
notes on the synthesis of form there's
some
other writings from around that time by
other
writers like jane jacobs
death and life of great american cities
all pointing to these flaws in the way
the cities were being conceived and
executed in planning
and
here we are
almost half a century later and how much
has changed really
not very much
absol that's right not very much
yeah it's very scary
in some ways perhaps is this a a last
gasp of the
sort of 20th century industrial
approach to making things
but what i
find interesting and wonder if you could
talk about a little bit is
how
how that process of technology of
stamping things out and making things as
sort of
consumer
products
commodities
is creating the crisis that we're in
that at least everyone recognizes we're
in a crisis now yes that's the first
positive step in a way right
uh and that the chickens come coming
home to roost about that crisis are
going to inevitably lead us in the
direction you've been talking about for
years of questioning the whole
foundations of this industrial template
based approach
well yes i mean either it's either that
is going to happen or we are going to
destroy ourselves it could easily be one
or the other yeah and
i'm
it's a bit hard to say
i don't think we really know
what it looks like for for a
civilization to destroy itself
you know i
i mean at the moment i think the general
feeling is that that's something that
happened to other to the that's
something that happened to the other
people it doesn't happen to us you know
and um

i i think there's a very very alarming
uh there
and uh
but at least there is that recognition
as jared diamond points out
that
we
do have the
power to recognize what's going on and
then from there we have the
capability to do something about it and
to
but but in order to do that it seems to
me we have to do what you've argued for
years which is really question the
foundation of
industrial technology and
how humane it really is
and and how
how limited it is in a way
i think
you know the difficulty with the whole
thing is that the is the length of the
feedback cycle
is is bad i mean in other words it
doesn't
bode well
because
somebody
feels
their family is falling apart in a
in an apartment house in chicago
and
the person who's actually experiencing
that
is not
able at the moment
to
pull any
strings
that are actually attached to the system
that is causing all of this
right so that
this the destruction can go on sort of
unchecked
and even though people may experience it
and as you say
whatever whatever you said a moment ago
you know that
there's an awareness growing that that
that that this is uh
very very serious stuff but all the
people's awareness of that
isn't really capable
of pulling any handles to alter the
situation

and i'm not sure what the solution to
that is but i i think that's actually
the problem
um
not whether people are becoming aware i
suppose you can say well that's a first
step it is a first step

and
i've been thinking about this a lot
lately
and i i
i feel
i i may have
more to say on this subject but i don't
have right now
i think it would be extremely
interesting to get
a group of us
that are
willing to try and think the thing
through at that level
but it but it's a very very
mind-boggling task
oh
(Laughter)
about a year ago i think yeah
through the course of
40 years plus
practicing building some beautiful
buildings how to get ces
and the people that have studied and
have been influenced
by you and your work and what cs has
done how do you get to that larger
which to get that happening on a larger
larger scale but we were more talking
that
yes the future of ces
and how we're gonna
talk to people i think one of the
powerful things about pattern language
and also one of the problems with it is
what really convinces us that we can do
this
initially is the images
in the photographs because we look at
these and we say oh my gosh this
actually can happen and then what
actually starts to dissuade us from us
is these images are all from really old
places
so
to me the communication issue is how do
we show this is happening today
so what if the technology can reach a
point
where the technology could integrate
the geometric properties if you would
rely on all these people to help you
there's all of us and a lot more out
there you know doing all the things that
we're doing
so thank you very very much
and you can watch the whole thing
oh

you
