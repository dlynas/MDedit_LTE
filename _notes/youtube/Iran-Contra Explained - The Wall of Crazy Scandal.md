![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6Ucn-Whh4g)

Transcript:
(00:00) in 1985 and 86 the United States government sold military-grade weapons to the country of Iran a sponsor of various terrorist groups as a ransom for hostages held by some of those same groups that Iran sponsored money received from these weapons sales was secretly diverted to fund a covert Army the contras that was fighting against the socialist government of Nicaragua all of these actions were either illegal or contrary to the stated policy of the United States or both this is about as concise an explanation as you can make
(00:33) of the Iran-Contra scandal and by definition an explanation that short leaves out almost everything important particularly the very deep questions of why these events happened what they mean and why we should try to understand them the purpose of this video is to try to delve into some of those very complex questions answer them to the extent we can but also give some context and to give you some insight on these events the two other wise Miss from a more superficial examination of Iran Contra yes Iran-Contra is hellaciously
(01:07) complicated yes any in-depth explanation of it very quickly starts to resemble the famous wall of crazy meme but if you want to understand it if you want to dare to pull on one of the threads of this Tangled historical web you've clicked on the Right video this is not just Iran Contra explained it'll be I hope Iran-Contra deconstructed oh hi I'm Sean Munger I'm a PhD historian and I've done a lot of in-depth historical stuff on this channel from Byzantine history to ships and nautical subjects to historical analyzes of
(01:46) popular movies in my videos I always try to provide as much context as possible and to try to get the bottom to get to the bottom of why things happened as opposed to just what happened that's what I hope to do in this video of the well-known presidential scandals in recent American history from Watergate to the Clinton Lewinsky scandal to the events leading up to Donald Trump's first and second impeachments Iran Contra is a bit of a sleeper it's the one that's the hardest to explain and understand and the one that gets the
(02:19) least attention part of that is because it's incredibly complex I mean trying to make sense of Iran Contra is a pretty daunting intellectual puzzle as a result it sort of scares people off I teach courses on American history and I have to admit reluctantly that I usually don't include much about Iran Contra not because it's not important but because it tends to confuse the hell out of even the most advanced history students and its very time intensive to teach because a lot of not a lot of people know much
(02:51) about it Iran Contra tends to reflect ideological biases in a way that other presidential scandals don't or don't as much arising at a time the political partisanship and tribalism was really beginning to sharpen and intensify Iran Contra is sort of a Rorschach test what you see in it depends a lot on your political persuasion to someone for whom Ronald Reagan was an unqualified hero it's tempting to conclude that Iran Contra was a nothing Burger a smear job by democrats to tarnish the great Gipper
(03:26) and that Oliver North and John Poindexter were Great Patriotic Americans who were unfairly Hillary read for doing their Duty conversely to someone for whom Reagan tends to be a villain it's equally tempting to conclude that Iran Contra is the final evidence of his perfidy a crooked deal from start to finish that he knew everything and covered it all up oh and the same goes for George Bush too I mean George Bush won not literally George Bush too in any event I think you can make a case that the Iran-Contra Affair
(03:57) is one of the most difficult problems in recent American history thus trying to explain and deconstruct it is an unusually tall order but if you want to understand it I hope you'll allow me the chance to do that this is a long video I don't expect people to watch it all at once what I suggest you do is bookmark it and work your way through it over a period of time to help you do that I've broken it up into chapters that are grouped around particular subjects from Context and background to specific
(04:27) chains of events relevant to the story so do look at the chapters as we proceed also to try to help you make sense of this story I'm going to use lots of illustrations and Graphics particularly where it comes to people there's a huge cast of characters in this story and I'll try to remind you of them by showing you their heads and often their names on the screen at Key moments so that for example is Oliver North that is Poindexter that is gorbonifar no smoking in here please sir anyway you get the
(05:00) idea I'm going to try to help you out as much as possible I know this stuff is complex I'm on your side I got your back now as we are headed into one of the densest historical jungles in recent memory I suggest you find a comfortable place to sit top up on your beverage of choice and get ready for a Brain Buster of a story before we even get to Arms deals or Swiss bank accounts or secret armies mucking about in Central American rainforests we've got an unusually large amount of context to get behind us our
(05:32) first stop is the Middle East specifically Tehran by way of Beirut  this is Beirut the capital of Lebanon in the early 1970s that is where Lebanon is by the way on the Eastern side of the Mediterranean just above Israel Beirut was a beautiful city that was highly welcoming to foreigners people used to call it the Paris of the Middle East in 1975 a civil war broke out in Lebanon now if you think Iran Contra is complex enough I won't multiply your pain exponentially by trying to explain the origins of the Lebanese Civil War I
(06:14) don't even fully understand it but suffice it to say Lebanon was ethnically and religiously diverse with significant Christian and Muslim communities it had traditionally been governed by members of the Christian Community but as more and more Palestinians settled in Lebanon many of them driven out of their Homeland by the israeli-palestinian conflict the demographics of Lebanon began to shift the Lebanese Civil War which turned the Paris of the Middle East into a blasted hell hole of crumbling Rubble was not fought
(06:46) primarily by organized State armies but by militias that tended to be ethnically and religiously homogeneous so you had Christian malicious fighting Muslim militias and you had Sunni Muslim militias and Shia Muslim militias and militias with various ideologies from rightist to leftist and everywhere in between it was a huge mess and the war seemed to go on forever let's leave Beirut behind us for now we'll have to return soon enough and shift to Tehran the capital of Iran in February 1979 Iran's King the Shah heavily supported
(07:24) by the United States and a personal friend of President Jimmy Carter was overthrown in a revolution that brought a hard-lined fundamentalist Islamic government to power in the form of the Ayatollah Khomeini Khomeini and most of Iran's people were Shia Muslims just like significant numbers of Muslims in Lebanon Shia Muslims whether they lived in Lebanon or Iraq or elsewhere tended to look toward Khomeini as a spiritual leader hold that thought it becomes important later anyway the Shah who as you recall was Jimmy Carter's friend
(07:59) fled Iran and then came down with a very unfortunate form of cancer which at that time could only be treated in the United States against the Council of most of his advisors Carter decided for humanitarian reasons to let the Shah come to the U.S for medical treatment this enraged the people of Iran who had come to see the Shah as an oppressor in November 1979 a group of these enraged people in Tehran stormed the U.
(08:27) S embassy and took a bunch of its employees as hostages they demanded that Carter send the Shah to Iran to face trial for his crimes against the Iranian people Carter refused though taking the hostages wasn't khomeini's idea he back to the radical group that did it so it effectively became his policy the hostage crisis dragged on for more than a year at one point Carter attempted a military Rescue of the hostages but it failed in case you're wondering the Shaw's cancer treatment didn't work he died but Iran would still not release
(09:01) the hostages let's shift now from Tehran to Detroit yes Detroit as in Michigan unfortunately for him the year that the hostage crisis stretched on through was 1980. the year Jimmy Carter was running for re-election his opponent was Ronald Reagan former governor of California who clinched the Republican nomination in the primaries the guy who came in a distant second in those primaries was George Bush hold that thought it becomes important later you may wonder why we're orbiting this high-rise Hotel in Detroit
(09:34) it's because this is where Reagan and his campaign team stayed during the Republican National Convention in July 1980. and it was where Reagan made a world-changing decision coming into the convention Reagan and his campaign people including his campaign manager William Casey had a bizarre idea to offer the vice presidential nomination to former President Gerald Ford whom Carter had defeated in 1976.
(10:04) a Reagan Ford ticket they thought would be unbeatable but the problem was that Ford who was also staying at this hotel wanted a lot of concessions from Reagan in exchange for agreeing to be Vice President we don't need to go into all that but suffice it to say the deal to get Ford on the ticket fell apart at the last minute just before Reagan was supposed to announce his vice presidential running mate Reagan and Casey were so hot on the Ford idea that they had no plan B when Ford was suddenly out of the running they had to
(10:34) scramble to find an acceptable Vice Presidential nominee in three minutes yes three minutes Reagan made the snap to decision to offer the VP spot to George Bush the guy who came in second in the primaries Bush understood that his political career was over if he didn't take the offer he had no platform to relaunch his career so he decided to take it this snap decision made in three minutes in a Detroit high-rise hotel room changed American and world history after their coronation at the convention Reagan and
(11:09) Bush went out campaigning they pilloried Carter not merely for being weak but for humiliating America in the eyes of the World by not being able to resolve the hostage crisis let's shift back to the Middle East to Baghdad now the capital of Iraq where in the summer and fall of 1980.
(11:30) the previous year 1979 Iraq had been taken over by an ambitious party boss and would-be dictator Saddam Hussein he was powerful but his regime was a little shaky at first Saddam was a Sunni Muslim the majority of people in Iraq were Shia Muslims now remember how I said that the Ayatollah Khomeini was part of The Unofficial leader of Shia Muslims everywhere even outside Iran well Saddam was afraid that Iraq's Shia Muslims would be more loyal to Khomeini than to him partly for this reason and partly for a complex bundle of other reasons which we don't need to go into
(12:06) Saddam Hussein's Iraq provoked a war with khomeini's Iran in September 1980. this would eventually become the most destructive War of the 20th century besides the two world wars in November 1980 Reagan crushed Carter in the presidential election Carter had quietly been trying to negotiate with Iran to release the hostages ultimately there were 52 Americans held in Tehran after the election but before Carter left office his people managed to negotiate an end to the crisis using the government of Algeria as an intermediary
(12:42) the United States ended up unfreezing a bunch of financial assets belonging to Iran comanian any event now had bigger problems to worry about such as that war with Iraq however just as one last gratuitous poke at Carter Khomeini delayed the release of the American hostages until just after Ronald Reagan had taken the oath of office as president of the United States in reality Reagan had nothing to do with the release of the hostages but Khomeini helped him out with Optics that made him look good and which reinforced the
(13:15) appearance of Carter as a hapless whim now there was a conspiracy theory popular in the early 90s about this called October surprise the idea was that officials of the Reagan campaign in some versions of the story George Bush himself negotiated supposedly with the government of Iran to delay the release of the hostages until after the 1980 election these allegations were investigated in the 90s including by a congressional committee and no evidence supporting them was found we have enough real conspiracies in this story of Iran
(13:49) Contra as it is I don't think we need to spend much time on the unfounded ones  Lebanon whereas I hope you recall that brutal Civil War was still going on by 1982 the war had begun to pull in various other factions and countries from outside Lebanon including the PLO Palestinian Liberation Organization which was the chief coordinator of Palestinian resistance to Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip confused yet Syria was also involved in June 1982 Israel invaded Southern Lebanon to try to crush the PLO
(14:33) which was operating from that area in response to this in July 1982 the president of the American University of Beirut a man named David Dodge was abducted by terrorists in Beirut the group that kidnapped him Islamic Jihad was a militant Shia organization sponsored by the government of Iran the idea was to use Dodge an American as a hostage to get the Reagan Administration to pressure Israel real to withdraw from Lebanon you could say that this crime the Abduction of David Dodge was the seed of Iran Contra Dodge was released
(15:11) about a year later in July 1983 but his abduction was the start of a whole new hostage crisis a new spin in the endless cycle of terrorism connected to Iran and the Lebanese Civil War in the late summer of 1982 the United States as well as a few other Western countries did try to broker a ceasefire between Israel and the PLO in Lebanon a multinational Force comprised of troops from the U.
(15:40) S Britain France and Italy went into Beirut to supervise the withdrawal of PLO forces from Lebanon this Force included about 800 U.S Marines on April 18 1983 Islamic Jihad that same terrorist group that was holding David Dodge probably working with another group called Hezbollah carried out attack against the U.S embassy in Beirut a suicide truck bomber blew up 63 people including 17 Americans This was bad enough but an even more monstrous attack occurred a few months later on October 23 1983 iranian-sponsored terrorists again using
(16:20) suicide truck bombs blew up two Barracks buildings containing U.S Marines and French troops the French suffered 58 casualties the Americans 241. the Reagan administration's response to these attacks was incoherent for reasons I'll get into in the next chapter despite talking tough about not being pushed around by terrorists there was no coordinated retaliation although in December 1983 the battleship USS New Jersey which was parked offshore fired some shells at neighborhoods in Beirut where terrorists believed to be
(16:56) associated with those who did the bombing were thought to have their headquarters also in December 1983 iranian-sponsored terrorists staged another coordinated attack this time in Kuwait City believed to be retaliation for the United States and Kuwait supporting Iraq in the iran-iraq war this bombing didn't kill a lot of people some of the explosives failed to go off and the targeting was faulty but the incident was to have a huge effect down the road one of the groups that claimed responsibility for this attack was
(17:30) called the Islamic dawa party after the December 83 attacks Kuwait conducted a drag net and rounded up a bunch of terrorists associated with this group 17 of them went to prison for a long long time they were known as the al-dawah prisoners in 1984 Hezbollah another group believed to be iranian-sponsored began taking more Americans hostage in Beirut and they demanded the release of those all dawa prisoners as Ransom this was is not the only demand made by the hostage taking groups but it was one that kept coming up for example Terry
(18:08) Anderson an Associated Press reporter kidnapped in March 1985 was told that he was being held for The Ransom of the al-dawah prisoners by the middle of 1985 Ronald Reagan was facing a protracted hostage crisis involving Iran that was very similar to the one that had haunted Jimmy Carter and that Reagan himself had used as a political tool to defeat Jimmy Carter in 1980.
(18:36) the Reagan administration's stated policy was not to negotiate with terrorists they didn't really have a lot of options on how to deal with this on June 14 1985 a TWA 727 jet on a long-haul trip from Cairo to Los Angeles was hijacked in mid-air shortly after making a stop at Athens Greece it's not entirely clear who the perps were this time probably Hezbollah but not a slam dunk the terrorists killed one American a U.
(19:07) S Navy enlisted man named Robert steedom and they dumped his body out of the plane onto the runway this iconic image one of the most famous of the 1980s resulted from this attack where one of the terrorists held a gun to the head of the TWA pilot during his conversation with news media the terrorists demanded the release of hundreds of prisoners across the Middle East including the al-dawa prisoners as well as many others being held by Israel after leapfrogging to various airports around the region for two weeks the TWA hostages were eventually released on
(19:41) June 30th Israel had indeed begun to free many of the prisoners at the hijackers demanded but Reagan administration officials assiduously denied that they had pressured Israel to do it even though they sort of did even after the TWA passengers were safe though there were at that time seven America is being held by iranian-sponsored groups in Lebanon the cycle of terrorism brought the issue of hostages to the Forefront of Reagan's foreign policy between the seizure of multiple hostages the TWA hijacking and
(20:16) emotional meetings between Reagan and the families of the hostages by mid-1985 the hostage issue was at the top of Reagan's priority list this was just at the stage for the Iran-Contra Affair before we get there we have to take a brief look at what was going on inside Reagan's White House and even a little bit farther back than that to Reagan's origins in state politics in California Ronald Reagan was a b-list movie actor in The Golden Age of Hollywood before he turned to politics in the mid-1960s
(20:53) elected governor of California in 1966 his appeal was based largely on what today we would call culture War issues standing against the political and social changes sweeping America in the late 1960s Reagan particularly hated College protesters against the Vietnam War his election as president in 1980 is often seen as a conservative reaction to the turmoil of the 1960s and 70s because his background was in state politics and his main focus were identity and cultural issues Reagan wasn't very well versed in foreign policy what opinions
(21:32) he had about foreign affairs in 1980 centered primarily around communism and the Soviet Union he wanted to take a hard line against them and a centerpiece of his first term agenda was greatly increased defense spending to counter Soviet and communist Bloc military power particularly in Europe Beyond this though Reagan really didn't have that many thoughts on foreign policy and it was not destined to be the strong suit of his administration as he constructed it when he got into office in E1 there was a very simple reason for this Reagan
(22:06) chose as his secretary of state George Schultz who had been a minor cabinet official under Richard Nixon he chose as Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger who had also been in the Nixon cabinet and who'd come up in California politics at the same time that Reagan was making his Mark the problem was that these two guys Schultz and Weinberger were exact opposites they disagreed on almost everything and they hated each other personally the results in the Reagan cabinet was paralysis because Schultz typically wanted to do something and
(22:39) Weinberger usually wanted to do the opposite Reagan typically avoided making a decision that would piss off either one of them and thus he just didn't do anything case in point retaliation for the Marine Barracks bombing Schultz wanted a strong retaliation Weinberger argued against it Reagan's solution to have the USS New Jersey Fire a couple of shells at Beirut was a lay same attempt to split the difference and it didn't work Reagan was not fond of Confrontation he also wasn't very Hands-On he delegated almost everything
(23:13) as a result his advisors when they needed a decision from the president carefully controlled the information that he was exposed to and presented him with a limited menu of options to choose from for most of Reagan's first term three advisors in particular effectively gated access to President Reagan these were his chief of staff James Baker Deputy Chief of Staff Michael Deaver and Ed Meese counselor to the president later attorney general in fact these three together were known informally as the Troika but then in early 1985 there
(23:49) was a change at the White House Donald Regan Secretary of the Treasury yes I realized how confusing it is to have a Donald Regan and a Ronald Reagan in the same White House anyway Donald Regan decided to switch jobs with James Baker Baker who is chief of staff was getting burnt out by all accounts Ray Regan sorry Regan was somewhat power hungry the switch which was not Ronald Reagan's idea occurred in January 1985.
(24:18) the age of the Troika controlling access and information that flowed to President Reagan was over now after January 1985 everything went through Chief of Staff Donald Regan Regan who had been the chairman of Wall Street firm Merrill Lynch before coming to government knew bobkus about foreign policy he relied principally on the president's National Security adviser Robert McFarland to handle everything related to Foreign Affairs Reagan was also being manipulated from an entirely different angle he listened a lot to his wife
(24:51) Nancy Reagan who exerted a tremendous amount of control behind the scenes of The White House Nancy had her own Chief advisor a celebrity astrologer named Joan Quigley whom she consulted frequently Quigley would look into the stars and tell Mrs Reagan which days were quote unquote favorable for her husband to make big policy decisions Quigley's influence on the Reagan White House was kept a carefully guarded secret for years now if this all sounds nuts it should Regan knew about the astrologer but he couldn't do anything
(25:24) about it his boss listened to his wife and she listened to Joan Regan was intent on controlling access to the president mainly so he could manipulate the decisions that were being made if anything got done in terms of foreign policy it wasn't because any sort of formal decision got made the Log Jam between Schultz and Weinberger typically prevented that but it would be because Robert McFarland the National Security advisor would make an end run around them and get to the get the president to do what he McFarlane wanted in short the
(25:59) Reagan White House by the middle of 1985 was a pretty Danger place where good policy decision-making processes went to die if you're getting the impression that the Iran-Contra Affair is going to involve Ronald Reagan's advisors doing stuff behind his back without telling him and then backstabbing each other to get a bigger piece of the action you're absolutely right that is exactly where this is going before we get to the arms deals let's delve into one final piece of context that requires a rather
(26:29) radical shift of venue from Washington DC to the rainforest of Central America specifically Nicaragua by way rhetorically speaking of Southeast Asia Ronald Reagan as you recall entered politics in the 1960s when American involvement in the Vietnam War was ramping up he was also a staunch cold warrior and anti-communist his Central Obsession was the very old Cold War idea that the Soviet Union was a giant octopus extending its tentacles everywhere it could in the world and ultimately trying to foment a world socialist Revolution this kind of
(27:13) thinking straight out of the 1950s was the main assumption that led the United States into Vietnam you may have heard of the Domino Theory this was the idea that if one country in Southeast Asia turned communist eventually all of them would this idea Justified vast expenditures of blood and treasure to prevent U.
(27:37) S allies South Vietnam from uniting with communist North Vietnam that it didn't end up going so well the Vietnam War killed 58 000 Americans and more than a million Vietnamese and in the end all of Vietnam did go communist which strangely did not prove to be the end of the world let's shift now from Southeast Asia to Central America even before the the Cold War this region had long been a playground for U.
(28:02) S governments and business interests to throw their weight around and the fight against communism post 1945 made that tendency even worse whenever it looked like a left-wing or even left-leaning regime might come to power in any south or Central American country the United States got very very nervous Cuba after all had become a Soviet client state after a leftist revolution overthrew the U.S backed government there in 1959.
(28:32) if you believed in domino theory in Southeast Asia chances are pretty good that you believe the same thing applied in Central America too this was why Ronald Reagan was really scared of what happened in Nicaragua in 1979 after a revolution and a bloody Civil War a party called the fsln came to power in Nicaragua the fsln was a Socialist Party commonly called the sandinistas named after a guerrilla hero who died in the 1930s and they revolted against the right-wing government of Anastasio Samosa who had been backed by the U.S
(29:08) until Carter ended his support for him leftist gorillas fighting right-wing governments often backed by the U.S was a common thing in Central America it was also happening in El Salvador going then going through its own bloody Civil War and also Guatemala the CIA was deeply involved in these countries often running covert operations to disrupt the leftist Guerrilla factions American policy makers tended to see Central America as black and white democracy versus communism that kind of cold war struggle thereby missing all the Nuance
(29:44) of what was really going on it is time now for the people of the United States to unite with President Reagan to reverse the trends in Central America will you back President Reagan and make your voice heard for peace through strength by signing this resolution when Reagan came to power in 1981 he was alarmed at the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua a strong believer in domino theory Reagan desperately wanted to take the sandinistas out to prevent as he saw it all of Central America eventually going communist but Congress controlled
(30:20) by democrats who by 1981 generally didn't believe in domino theory anymore didn't see it that way when the fsln the sandinistas flipped Nicaragua in 1979 the opposition to them became the Guerrilla Force within that country they were known as the contras but they weren't that unified in fact there were three major factions within the contras that were constantly squabbling with each other in 1981 the CIA started supplying weapons to the contras and helped them run covert operations against the Sandinista government
(30:56) predictably they did not tell Congress about any of these operations the head of the CIA under Reagan was William Casey the same guy who had managed his 1980 campaign and who was involved in the botched effort to get Ford on the ticket a veteran of World War II Espionage operations Casey was himself an unreconstructed cold warrior who wanted to take a hard line against communism and thought Congress and the Democratic process just gummed up the works and Casey loved covert operations in 1982 the democratic-controlled
(31:32) Congress afraid that the Reagan Administration and the CIA were going to get the U.S polled into another Vietnam style Quagmire passed a law officially Banning the United States from giving military aid to the contras this law was popularly known as the Boland Amendment fear of another Vietnam wasn't the only motivating factor the contras themselves were in fact pretty horrible routinely assassinating civilians including priests and health care workers engaging in torture and committing numerous human rights violations the Reagan
(32:09) Administration like most U.S administrations turned a blind eye to these abuses because it thought that the ends Justified the means preventing communism from taking over Central America was to them worth the Carnage a rather cynical view Reagan was incensed that Congress had cut off military aid to the contras he really really wanted to keep backing them in fact this was his pet cause advisors said that mere mention of the contrast caused Reagan to quote go bananas with the U.
(32:42) S government and particularly the CIA banned from helping them enterprising officials in Reagan's government started to think up new ways to keep the lifeline going for Reagan's pet cause one of the ways they did this was to get other countries to give money to the contras on the unspoken assumption that this would buy favorable treatment from Ronald Reagan for example in early 1985 Robert McFarland got the government of Saudi Arabia to donate 24 million dollars to the contras officials also hit up wealthy private
(33:17) citizens in the United States and directed those funds secretly to the contra the chief official in charge of doing this sort of thing was a Marine lieutenant colonel named Oliver North a Vietnam veteran who predictably felt the U.S effort in that war had been sabotaged by liberals at home North had a lot of baggage left over from that conflict though still a marine he went to work for the National Security Agency in 1981.
(33:48) there he was involved in various covert operations we're still not sure exactly what because they were of course of course covert and also because North had a tendency to exaggerate his accomplishments for example embellishing his role in the 1983 U.S invasion of the small Caribbean island of Granada concerning Nicaragua and North's job was basically to run and fund a secret war on behalf of the contras a war that the U.
(34:17) S government was technically prohibited legally from supporting just so you know North was not doing this entirely on his own he was an employee of the National Security Agency an organization run out of the White House not accountable directly to Congress or any cabinet level agency North's direct boss was Admiral John Poindexter the deputy National Security adviser his boss was Robert McFarland who reported directly to President Reagan at this time 1985 there's no evidence that Ronald Reagan even knew who Oliver North was oh I should mention
(34:56) something else because you guessed it it becomes important later all these National Security Agency guys are communicating with each other via computer on a brand new system of interlinked systems called profs or professional office system basically email the whole concept of email was brand new in 1985 and the National Security Agency was using it because they thought it was super secure foreshadowing anyway back to Oliver North when it came to the contrast North was in charge of sending privately raised funds to them and then helping
(35:35) them buy the stuff they needed fancy toys like helicopters and missiles and then basic stuff like bullets and rifles and uniforms North's little scheme went by a couple of names such as the Enterprise and also project democracy it had secret Swiss bank accounts to shift money around without being noticed North was also able to use off the record of course CIA tools to get the stuff he needed to the contras example the CIA had its own private Airline called Southern Air transport that operated secret flights into Central America from
(36:12) various points of origin often dropping pallets of weapons or supplies for the contras that had been purchased by project democracy a man named Richard Secord a former Air Force officer with extensive experience in covert operations and his business partner Albert Hakim were involved in these Logistics remember that it becomes important later I'm getting tired of saying that so you got all this a secret war in Central America officially illegal funded off the books run by NSA Personnel including all over North
(36:47) occasionally borrowing CIA assets to make it all work what could possibly go wrong now finally finally after all this context we get to the arms deals that's the next chapter  on June 17 1985 while the TWA 847 thing was still going on Robert McFarland wrote a memo to the rest of the National Security Council suggesting that the United States reach out to Iran in the hopes of building a relationship with more moderate elements who might be willing to deal with what Khomeini called the Great Satan McFarland
(37:29) suggested that a carrot they might offer the Iranians was quote selected military equipment the memo got a big belly laugh from both Secretary of State George Schultz and Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger who uncharacteristically agreed with each other they both thought it was nuts there were no quote-unquote moderates in Iran's government they thought and in any event the idea of selling weapons to a state sponsor of terrorism was against one of Reagan's most firmly held policies a couple of weeks later on July 3rd 1985
(38:08) a former Israeli intelligence officer named David kimchi and a few other Israelis met with McFarland and had a suggestion they told McFarland that these mythical moderate elements did exist and they could possibly get to them by using as a go-between a man named Manuka gorbanifar an international arms dealer gorbonafar had been born in Iran and left at the time of the Revolution but kimchi and the Israelis said he knew some of these moderates they'd talk with the U.
(38:43) S possibly even about pressuring terrorist groups to release hostages if the U.S sold them a hundred anti-tank missiles to keep American fingerprints off the sale the missiles would be transferred from Israel not the United States Israel bought most of its weapons from the U.S McFarland reported the meeting to Reagan who seemed agreeable to letting McFarland open negotiations with gorbonafar the matter was discussed again a few weeks later this meeting proved problematic because it happened in Ronald Reagan's hospital room just
(39:17) after he had surgery for colon cancer it was never clear exactly what he agreed to in this meeting or perhaps more importantly what others including McFarland and Donald Regan thought he agreed to under existing law Israel could not transfer weapons of American manufacture to a third country without the United States a specific approval when the Israelis trying to put together the deal requested this approval in early August there was another meeting at the White House again both Schultz and Weinberger were uncharacteristically
(39:52) United in agreement that this whole thing was a terrible idea no decision was made at this meeting but a few days later McFarland said that President Ronald Reagan called him on the phone and told him to go ahead there's no evidence other than McFarland's word that this is actually how it happened the White House had no record of the call being made Reagan said later that he couldn't remember it that's going to become a thing in this story Reagan's saying he doesn't remember something on
(40:22) August 20th 1985 Israel shipped about 90 toe tow missiles anti-tank missiles to Iran the actual supposed three-way deal between Iran Israel and the U.S brokered by gorbonafar who collected a big commission naturally called for 500 missiles to swap for all the hostages when Israel sent the first 90 missiles or so gorbonifar told McFarlane that the Iranians were waiting for the other 400 before releasing any hostages McFarland curiously not smelling a rat in this deal agreed on September 15th Israel shipped another 408 missiles to Iran
(41:05) kimchi the Israeli then called McFarland and said well we kind of made a mistake the people were dealing with in Iran don't have the power to release all the hostages but they might release one one hostage was released Benjamin Weir who appeared on a street in Beirut the same day September 15th but that was it McFarland kept hoping that the Iranians would release someone else they didn't the but the whole thing was basically A Swindle expecting all seven hostages freed they only got one and it cost 500
(41:38) tow missiles gorbonafar however pressed for more now he told McFarland that Iran wanted a different kind of missile Hawk missiles more expensive but they could get they meaning the Iranians could get the rest of the hostages out and without Khomeini from finding out about it gorbonafar also hinted that if the missile deals didn't continue the terrorists holding American hostages in Lebanon would kill them in reality they never made this threat gor bonifar who made sweet Bank on commissions on the arms deals was self-interested to keep
(42:13) them going as Israel got involved again in this second deal the Israeli government which agreed to transfer the Hawks pressed McFarland for a guarantee that the U.S would replenish Israel's supply of Hawk missiles after the transfer these requests hit at a bad time Reagan was at the time in Geneva Switzerland for the first of his famous Summit meetings with this new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev once again it's not clear who exactly agreed to what but in Geneva Schultz got wind of the plan and blew up recognizing that it
(42:50) definitely was arms for hostages but McFarlane interpreted the will of Ronald Reagan as deeming him to go ahead but because he was busy working on that Summit meeting McFarland delegated the operational details of the transfer to Oliver North now for some reason I don't fully understand the plane full of missiles left Israel and was supposed to land in Lisbon Portugal before going on to Tehran but the Portuguese authorities refused permission for the plane to go on that plane had to turn around and return to Israel North who apparently
(43:27) believed all the remaining hostages would be sprung at this time scrambled to find a replacement aircraft to get one he turned to Richard Secord with whom he'd worked previously on various Contra operations to get a plane which had previously been used to drop stuff off for the contras this plane was used to take missiles in Israel and fly them to Tehran Secord was really good at this kind of thing that so this is exactly what he did now this was an issue because in order to use CIA assets which c chord was involved with the National
(44:01) Security Agency which North worked for had to have what was called a finding a document addressed to Congress that explained what was going on there was no finding for this Hawk missile shipment which went to Iran thanks to C chord's help on November 25th 1985. for his part running true to form gorbonafar did the Charlie Brown's football thing again he told McFarland after the missiles got to Iran that the Iranians were pissed because they were first the wrong kind of missile and they even still had
(44:35) Israeli markings on them in fact they were so pissed that they refused to release any more hostages McFarland was now at wit's end Not only was this Iran thing blowing up in his face but he thought Donald Regan who hated him was spreading rumors throughout Washington that McFarland who was married was having a an affair with a Washington reporter McFarland also struggled with depression on December 4th 1985 he resigned as National Security advisor honestly you can't blame him but this was the wrong time to change horses
(45:10) McFarland's replacement was his former deputy John Poindexter and the Very day that McFarland threw in the towel North who was eager to impress his new boss wrote a huge memo outlining a bold and broadened plan for the Iran hostage initiative North proposed to swap over 3 000 missile to Iran directly without Israel as an intermediary in exchange for all the remaining American hostages plus a French hostage in this memo North also included the imaginary threat invented by gorbonifar that the hostages would be killed if the U.S turned off
(45:49) the deals in the meantime the CIA in order to solve that little problem about having done the November 25th missile shipment without a finding drafted one that would cover the shipment retroactively which also notably and illegally said that Congress shouldn't be informed on December 6 1985 Poindexter brought this paper to Reagan he signed it without reading it later Reagan would say he couldn't remember signing it and in any event months later Poindexter tore up the only copy of it the day after that December 7th the
(46:24) National Security Council met specifically to discuss the Iran initiative but this meeting was curious incomplete McFarland who was no longer National Security advisor but still in the loop LED the meeting but he did not address the shipment that had just gone through and he carefully avoided any mention of the finding that Reagan had signed the day before Schultz and Weinberger were there George Bush was not Weinberger warned Reagan that this whole thing was an awful idea Schultz also blew up at it all over again
(46:57) typically for his management style Reagan didn't make any final decision except he seemed to McFarland and Poindexter to agree that further talks should go ahead with coronafar to see if the Iranians could be persuaded to release any hostages without getting weapons first in actuality at the very time this meeting was held Oliver North was already in Europe negotiating with gorbonifar for more arms for hostages deals one last thing about these early deals when North was scrambling around trying to find a plane to take that
(47:35) November shipment of missiles to Iran and when he got Seaport involved involved a million dollars of money that Israel transferred to the United States part of the payment for the missiles was shunted into one of North's project democracy accounts one of his Swiss bank accounts this was done in case C chord needed some money to facilitate the transfer in other words bribes well it turned out that Secor didn't need to use much of this fund after the shipment was over there was eight hundred and fifty
(48:07) thousand dollars of this money left North who thought it was just Surplus money transferred it to one of the Contra accounts that was the first time that money had been diverted from the Iran arms sales to the contras and at the time it was kind of an afterthought but it would definitely prove not to be the last diversion because it looked like they were going to do a newer bigger more missiley version of the Iran initiative as per North's December 4th memo the National Security Council needed a finding not
(48:48) retroactive this time to approve it on January 6 1986 Poindexter drafted one and brought it to President Reagan in advance of a meeting that was supposed to happen the next day Reagan didn't realize that the document was a draft not a final version he went ahead and signed it apparently that was not unusual he signed just about everything his advisors put in front of him sometimes without reading the documents first so that next day January 7 1986 the full National Security Council met to discuss the whole Iran thing this time everybody
(49:26) important was there including George Bush and CIA director William Casey just as they had before Scholtz and Weinberger on the same side tore into it everybody else thought it was a fantabulous idea including and perhaps especially bush in later years when pressed on Iran Contra Bush repeatedly minimized his input at this meeting Casey was also enthusiastic this despite the fact that he knew gor bonifar had spectacularly failed a polygraph test he was given and was known to be a liar and exaggerator it was clear that Reagan
(50:07) wanted to go ahead he was especially motivated by the idea that the lives of the hostages were at stake if they didn't continue the deals Donald Regan Chief of Staff who had been opposed to the idea the first time first couple times it was mentioned was now suddenly all for it probably because he realized Reagan was for it the key thing about this new plan was that in future shipments the weapons would not go through Israel gorbonafar would still make his commission as the broker but Israel wouldn't have to be cut in on anything
(50:42) Oliver North figured out that the CIA could buy in quotes the missiles from the Department of Defense for a 2.5 million dollar profit on January 17 1986 Poindexter brought President Reagan a new finding approving the arms sales going forward a final one not the draft that he'd mistakenly signed January 6th tellingly Reagan who kept a diary of his time at the White House wrote this in his journal on that day quote I agreed to sell toes to Iran end quote after meeting with gurbanifar again in London on January 24 1986 North wrote
(51:27) another grandiose memo in many ways this is the most bizarre document in the whole Iran-Contra story gaseous and overblown even by North standards the document proposed a detailed timeline for operation recovery involving transfers of money missiles being flown from point A to point B and secret meetings at the Churchill hotel in London this is the Churchill hotel in London by the way now the Hyatt Regency perfect place for an arms deal isn't it the memo also specifies prisoner releases by Israel payments of millions
(52:04) of dollars to gor bonifar the date all U.S hostages are to be released February 9 1986 and I don't know whether this was intended as a joke or not but a prediction that Khomeini steps down as leader of Iran on February 11th the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution in February 1986 The Wheels on the deals kept turning the U.
(52:30) S army began turning over tow missiles to the CIA gorbonifar got Bridge financing from a wealthy Saudi Adnan kasogi to broker the deal this had happened before and by the end of the month two shipments totaling a thousand missiles wound up in Iran but like previous deals it was a Swindle contrary to North's careful timetable no hostages were released and Khomeini of course did not step down yet astonishingly this despite being burned numerous times now the Reagan Administration officials continued to try to make deals to be sure they were egged on by
(53:08) gorbonifar who kept making false and inflated promises on April 3rd 1986 gorbonafar met with Oliver North and some CIA agents at the Ramada Renaissance hotel near Dulles airport in Washington DC gorbonafar told the Americans that if a delegation came to Tehran bringing weapons with them the Iranians would release all the rest of the hostages after an all-night meeting North wrote up a memo about what had been agreed to hold that thought not only is it important later it's one of the key points of the whole story
(53:44) Poindexter though North's boss was losing patience with the whole thing gorbonafar was clearly unreliable in fact not long after the April meeting he was arrested in an unrelated sting operation he Poindexter wanted North to tell the Iranians that they should Fork over some hostages without getting weapons in advance the NSC team was distracted in April by Ronald Reagan's airstrikes on moammar Gaddafi in Libya said to be retaliation for Gaddafi's sponsorship of terrorism but by early May the Tehran mission was on even
(54:19) though he wasn't National Security adviser anymore Robert McFarland headed the mission the whole thing was after all his baby North was there plus some CIA personnel which I'm not going to name because there's already too many people in this story of you to keep track of on the Iranian side they had been told that they would be meeting with Ali rafsanjani the speaker of Iran's Parliament and also Ali Khamenei the president of Iran both gorbonifar and North had pumped up the idea of the mission as the start of a brand new
(54:51) relationship between the U.S and Iran McFarland and North even brought a cake with them shaped like a key to symbolize the key to better relations they also brought a bunch of spare parts for the toe missiles that they had already delivered and and a plane another Plane full of missiles was waiting in Tel Aviv to be dispatched on McFarland's order the Tehran Mission went off the rails from the word go no one came to meet them at the Tehran airport at least not at first finally gorbonifar turned up as well as Ahmed kangarlu the official
(55:25) buyer of arms for the Iranian government I apologize for butchering the Persian names there but not the top officials that they were expecting they took the Americans to the top floor of the estacial hotel which in the Shah's time was the Tehran Hilton by all accounts the Tehran meeting was a disaster several people who claimed to be Iranian government officials did show up but they used fake names and their credentials were unverifiable once gorbonafar was out of the room McFarland and North discovered that he
(55:58) lied to both sides about what the other had agreed to he told Iranians that the Americans were bringing weapons not just spare parts and he told the Americans that the Iranians were going to release all the hostages neither was true after some drama which we don't really need to go into the Americans left two days later totally empty-handed no hostages No Deal except for the spare parts on board the plane that they'd come to Tehran in which the Iranian government paid for McFarland was bitterly disappointed so was North if
(56:33) the deal had gone through the plane load of missiles waiting in Tel Aviv if that had been delivered it would have meant Millions for the secret Contra project in the meantime gorbonafar who had beat the rap on that sting operation was desperate to keep the deals going on after all he made a big profit on each one of these deals and he had to pay back his Bridge financier Adnan kasogi gorbonafar warned the Iranians that they would lose the opportunity to deal for American weapons that they needed if they took too hard a line miraculously
(57:08) on July 26 1986 another hostage father Lawrence Janko was released in the bakar valley in Lebanon just as a completely irrelevant aside I once met father Lawrence jenko he came to speak to our high school in 1988. although the release of jenko seemed to the Reagan Administration like a miracle the only Miracle really going on was that anybody still believed in gor bonafire's crap he had taken it upon himself to tell Iran that the U.
(57:41) S would agree to send the weapons that were supposed to have come on that plane from Tel Aviv back in May if Iran released a hostage right now after jenko's release Casey CIA director urged Reagan to give something to Tehran as a reward for having released him on North's written suggestion they shipped some Hawk missile parts to Iran which arrived on August 4th 1986.
(58:09) negotiations continued throughout September and October but it was clear by this point that the whole Iran arms deal initiative was a total mess and no more hostages were released after more than a year of shady Deals they had bought the release of two only two Americans but perhaps more importantly at least for Oliver North the arms deals that had gone through had resulted in Hefty profits for project democracy the secret Contra War the diversion of funds from the arms sales to the Contra war was at the very heart of this Scandal that is in the
(58:47) next chapter  exactly when and how the diversion began the two people who knew the most about it Oliver North and John Poindexter weren't exactly trustworthy the stories they told to Congress during the investigation of the Iran-Contra Affair in the summer of 1987 were almost certainly false when he testified to Congress in July 1987 North claimed that the idea for the diversion was hatched at the Churchill Hotel during his meeting with gorbonafar in January 1986 and that it was gorbonifar's idea
(59:32) gorbonifar denied this and he's probably right North was lying remember the missile shipment of November 1985 the one that got screwed up because the Portuguese authorities wouldn't let the plane load of missiles through when North brought c chord on board to solve that one a million dollars was transferred in case C chord needed to bribe officials to get the plane to Iran he didn't need it or at least most of it and eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars of that fund was left over North diverted that money to the contras
(1:00:10) that seems to have been the very first diversion and it was probably North's own idea his day job after all when he wasn't Moonlighting on the Iran missile deals was to drum up money and support for the contras he thought that money belonged not to the U.S government but to gor bonifar the Crooked arms dealer he had no qualms about pinching it and giving it to the contrast we know that he was doing it before January 1986 because the previous month December 6 1985 North told officials of the Israeli Ministry of defense that he was going to
(1:00:48) use part of the proceeds from the sale to help the contras Poindexter said that North told him about the diversion for the first time in January 1986 after that Churchill Hotel meeting Poindexter thought about it for a few minutes and decided yeah sure go ahead that is also probably false it seems unlikely that Poindexter wouldn't have known about the diversions shortly after they began North testified that he thought Reagan knew about the diversion North had written a couple of memos throughout the process that mentioned it we'll talk
(1:01:24) about one particular memo in a minute and some of those memos he believed had gone to the president but there was no evidence that Reagan had actually seen these memos so the big question and the one at the heart of the whole Iran-Contra mess is the obvious one did Reagan know about the diversion was it his idea did he order it if he didn't when did he first find out about it when the whole Iran Contra thing broke open in the fall of 1986 Reagan insisted to the public and to all investigators who ever asked that he knew nothing about
(1:02:00) the diversion was he lying if so he probably should have been impeached if not there was still something terribly wrong because how could that have gone on in his White House in his National Security Agency without him knowing about it this is where the rorschach-like quality of Iran Contra comes into play if you see Reagan as a hero who could do no wrong of course he didn't know or it doesn't matter if he knew because even if he did it was totally okay and he did nothing wrong if you see Reagan as a villain who could do
(1:02:35) no right of course he lied and it was his idea in the first place and it proves he was a Machiavellian and untrustworthy and crooked from the beginning looking at the historical evidence I believe that it points in the direction of Reagan not knowing about the diversion as meaningful as it was in a political and constitutional sense the diversion of Iranian weapons proceeds to the contras fell to the level of operational detail not broad stroke policy or strategy as we've seen Reagan was extremely detached from the
(1:03:12) operational details of governance he only stepped in at the broad stroke level and sometimes not even then his presidency was hands off perhaps even dangerously detached from the operational detail the precept of Occam's razor tells us that all things being equal the simplest explanation tends to be the truth the simplest explanation is here I think that the diversion was all over North's idea and that he got it in November 1985 when he saw there was eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars in extra money sitting
(1:03:46) there after the Lisbon missile shipment the only person exercising oversight over North was Poindexter who loved the idea when North told him about it and he certainly was not gonna tell Reagan Poindexter had to know this business was shady but it was Ronald Reagan's pet project and if any heads were to roll over it he Poindexter would much rather it be his own than Ronald Reagan's so I don't think he would have told him under any circumstance how much money was diverted of a total of 16.1 million dollars that Iran paid
(1:04:22) the United States for weapons in 1985 and 86 investigators think at least 3.8 million went to the contras the idea of the diversion came at exactly the right time North's project democracy was running dry on funds and ideas to get funds to supply the contras in fact few if any shipments of supplies had been made to them by the end of 1985.
(1:04:48) this supports the hypothesis that the diversion was kind of a desperation move a last-ditch effort to keep the secret Contra War alive one of the ironies of the whole around Contra affair is that for their part the Iranians discovered the diversion or at least got close to discovering it even before most Americans did on June 30th 1986 Iranian officials discovered a price list relating to missiles and parts that they'd been buying for a year now and they discovered from this list that gorbonafar had been overcharging them by
(1:05:25) a whopping 600 percent where was the rest of this money going furthermore there's evidence that several people at the CIA knew or at least suspected that the diversion was going on especially after North began organizing contrast Supply flights in the spring of 1986 but no one spoke up about it on April 1st 1986 the secret effort to resupply the contras coordinated by Richard Secord made its first illegal flight to drop supplies into the jungle the meeting at the Ramada Renaissance Hotel in Washington between north gorbonafar and several CIA
(1:06:06) agents took place two days later the next day North wrote up a revised plan for future arms for hostages deals titled release of American hostages in Beirut it was North's usual elaborate spy movie fantasy of arms shipments money transfers and hostage releases just like his ludicrous January 24th memo but on page 5 of this memo the last page there was an unusual paragraph it read quote 12 million will be used to purchase critically needed supplies for the Nicaraguan Democratic resistance forces this material is essential to cover
(1:06:49) shortages in resistance inventories resulting from their current offensives and Sandinista counter-attacks and to bridge in quotes the period between now and when congressionally approved lethal assistance beyond the 25 million in quote defensive arms can be delivered end quote that memo since termed the diversion memo came to light a couple of months later on November 22 1986 when justice department investigators founded in North's files that paragraph was the bomb that blew up Ronald Reagan's presidency
(1:07:26)  the supply flights to the contras organized by c chord and funded by Oliver North's project democracy with Iran's money started flying in early April 1986. the flights were conducted by the cia's private Airline Southern Air transport They Carried weapons expressly illegal under the Boland Amendment and other humanitarian Aid not all of it quite so humanitarian two Contra camps inside Nicaragua on June 25th 1986 Reagan's incessant lobbying of Congress to turn the tap of military aid to the contras back on finally succeeded
(1:08:10) the house voted for a 25 million dollar Aid package but the authorization for military aid wouldn't start for a couple of months North and Secord would keep the illegal Supply operation going until then on October 5th 1986 one of Southern air transports covert aircraft a Fairchild c123 provider was shot down over Nicaragua by a surface-to-air missile the plane full of weapons for the contras crashed in the jungle killing everyone on board except for one CIA man Eugene hassenfuss who was the only one with a parachute he bailed out
(1:08:50) hassenfuss was captured by Sandinista troops and a tape of his capture was broadcast on TV he said to the cameraman my name is Eugene hassenfuss I come from Marinette Wisconsin from the point of view of the outside world this was the beginning of the Iran Contra scandal in reality it was the beginning of the end at first White House officials denied that the Hassan twist flight was part of a secret contribution even Reagan himself denied it at a press conference two days after the shoot down on October 7th Oliver North tipped off by CIA
(1:09:26) director William Casey and North's Own Boss John Poindexter began shredding documents in his office pertaining to project democracy remember that Proto email system called profs that the NSC was using I told you it would be important someone on poindexter's staff remembered that North had written a bunch of memos and emails related to various operations both around both Contra and Iran Poindexter had the wherewithal to order them deleted but this was 1986 before anyone knew how email worked yes what you're thinking
(1:10:06) right now is exactly right neither he nor anyone else on the NSC staff knew that copies of all the emails and documents were stored on the server just waiting to be discovered and become a scandal while the administration was dealing with pesky questions about the secret Aid to the contras incredibly North was still putting together arms deals with Iran he'd finally gotten a clue and got gor bonafar out of the picture and was now dealing directly with Iranian officials on October 28 1986 another shipment of 500 tow
(1:10:44) missiles went to Iran uncharacteristically this one did result in the release of a hostage David Jacobson let loose on the streets of Beirut North thought the Iranians promised more hostages but typically none were forthcoming the day after that November 3rd 1986 the final piece of the expose finally came a Lebanese newspaper Ash Shira ran a small article detailing Robert McFarland's secret mission to Tehran the previous spring bringing weapons and trying to barter for the release of the remaining hostages
(1:11:21) story was leaked to the newspaper by an Iranian official opposed to the arms deals if the hasenfuss shootdown had caused a minor blip in the world's press the ashara story caused a hurricane suddenly the cover on the secret Iran arms initiative was blown and at exactly the worst time the next day November 4th was election day in the U.
(1:11:48) S though probably not because of the exposure Republicans lost the senate for the first time in Ronald Reagan's presidency anticipating a political fuhrer the chief architects of the deals McFarland North Poindexter and other members of the NSC staff started writing down a detailed chronology of everything that had happened with the Iran arms deals sort of a script that Reagan could work from when dealing with the Press there was just one thing though the chronology was deliberately inaccurate and in some respects outright false the NSC people
(1:12:23) were building their cover-up at first North thought the Iran initiative could survive the political Firestorm but on November 8th the government of Iran made clear that there would be no deals for the release of future of further American hostages unless the aldawa prisoners being held captive in Kuwait remember them were released since this was one of the original demands made by iran-connected terrorist groups when the whole hostage thing started back in 1984 basically they were back to square one working from inaccurate and incomplete
(1:13:00) information some of it given to him by Poindexter Ronald Reagan gave a speech to the nation on November 19th in which he insisted that the United States had not traded arms for hostages he later followed this speech with a disastrous press conference in which he made several statements that various members of his administration including Secretary of State George Schultz knew to be false show in fact had a come to Jesus meeting with Reagan Schultz who as you recall opposed the whole idea from the get-go told Reagan where he had
(1:13:36) misspoken the president said that he was telling him things about the Iran initiative that he Reagan never knew Schultz replied that if he was telling him things he didn't know he Schultz didn't know very much something was terribly wrong on November 20th in advance of the testimony that was going to be given to Congress by CIA director William Casey Edwin Mease attorney general decided that the White House had to know what everybody knew and had to get its story straight so he Meese dispatched two informal justice
(1:14:11) department investigators Reynolds and Richardson to collect documents and talk to the principals mainly North Poindexter and McFarland North was tipped off that the investigators were coming north and his secretary Fawn Hall who incidentally was the daughter of Robert McFarland's former secretary had already begun destroying or altering documents earlier in the month beginning on Friday November 21st and continuing through the weekend which was the weekend before Thanksgiving they shifted into high gear they fed reams of
(1:14:45) documents into a paper shredder jamming it and eventually destroying it Fawn Hall set to work altering records of financial transfers but she did it badly missing several key and telling details even as investigators were approaching their office Hall remembering documents that she had forgotten to destroy stuffed them into her boots and the back of her blouse before she left the office the key moment was on Saturday November 22nd when Reynolds and Richardson were going through the documents they requested from North the ones that he hadn't
(1:15:20) shredded altered or had smuggled out of the office North and Hall were pretty bad at destroying evidence because the justice department investigators found voila right there in black and white the diversion memo of April 4th and specifically the paragraph I mean the paragraph the one that I quoted earlier any attempt at a cover-up was Suddenly at an end the justice department guys reported the memo to their boss Ed Meese attorney general who could only pray that it was just a proposal that hadn't been acted upon unfortunately for him it
(1:15:58) wasn't nice had no choice but to tell his boss Ronald Reagan the disclosure was made in the presence of the chief of staff Donald Regan he later said that he was sure gauging from Reagan's reaction that he hadn't known about the diversion Reagan wasn't as good an actor as everyone thought he was to his credit Regan argued that they had to make it public as soon as possible the only one who disagreed with that was Casey who said predictably though the lies of the hostages might be at stake if they
(1:16:29) blabbed no one was listening to Casey anymore by this time events followed Fast and Furious after that Reagan called Oliver North at his office now eerily quiet after years of buzzing activity you're a great American hero Reagan said it didn't change the fact that North was fired Poindexter handed in his resignation Reagan made an appearance before the Press on November 25th announcing that the diversion had been discovered and that North and Poindexter had been cashiered the Press of course went bananas on November 26
(1:17:05) 1986 the day before Thanksgiving Ronald Reagan appointed a special commission to investigate what had happened this commission would be headed by former Texas Senator John Tower and his was in addition to congressional committees that were already investigating Reagan then went off to his Ranch in California for the holiday he seemed dazed an aide remarked that it seemed like he was living in a dream world on December 1st a New York Times CBS News poll found that Ronald Reagan's approval rating had collapsed more than 20 percentage points
(1:17:41) in a single month the most popular president in living memory had lost much of his credibility with the public on December 20th just before the Christmas holidays the cold open of Saturday Night Live the guest that week was Star Trek actor William Shatner featured a musical number in which Shatner portrayed Ali North the mute Marine North fearing criminal prosecution had taken the fifth amendment in response to Congressional questioning about the affair for all of his talk of Duty at last North's own interest for self-preservation had
(1:18:16) finally surfaced Ronald Reagan was slow to react to the crippling damage that Iran Contra had done to his presidency but he did react a senate select committee released a report on the mess on January 29 1987. the tower commission's report followed February 24th both told largely the same story the Iran Contra matter had occurred they concluded because of a failure to manage staff by the White House which led to ambitious underlings such as Oliver North and John Poindexter to commit great wrongs in furtherance of
(1:19:01) what they perceived was the president's policy and there was never a leash to pull them back Robert McFarland Reagan's former National Security adviser who had gotten everybody into this mess in the first place blamed himself just before his scheduled testimony before the tower Commission on February 9 1987 he tried to kill himself with a deliberate overdose of Valium he survived another key player in the Scandal wasn't so lucky on December 15 1986 CIA director William Casey suffered a seizure as a
(1:19:36) result of a brain tumor he was hospitalized he did not recover and died on May 6 1987. whatever he knew or did not know about Iran Contra died with him recognizing that his own failure of leadership had caused the disaster just after the tower report came out Reagan accepted the resignation of his chief of staff Donald Regan a move that Nancy had been urging for a long time despite screaming I deserve better treatment than this Regan eventually slinked out of the White House Reagan replaced him with former Senate Majority Leader
(1:20:13) Howard Baker who had been once one of the lead investigators on the Watergate Affair a dozen years earlier Baker had presidential aspirations himself but realized that by taking the job Chief of Staff especially in a White House spinning out of control he would most likely never have a shot at the top job he took chief of staff on the express understanding from Reagan that there would be no secrets and that he could clean house as he Baker saw fit with no interference Reagan agreed Baker told his own staff that he had three
(1:20:48) objectives first to get to the bottom of Iran-Contra second to get an arms control deal with the Soviets and third to elect a republican presumably George Bush president in 1988. one of the first things that happened on Baker's watch was a televised address from the Oval Office by the president on March 4th 1987 after months of Silence Reagan came clean on Iran Contra he said quote a few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages my heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true but the facts and
(1:21:26) the evidence tell me it is not as the tower board reported what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated in its implementation into trading arms for hostages this runs counter to my own beliefs to Administration policy and to the original strategy we had in mind the tower commission was finished but the investigations were just getting started on December 19 1986 Lawrence Walsh had been appointed by Edward Meese independent Council to investigate Iran Contra and congress's hearings were just ramping up Baker in the meantime
(1:22:04) conducted his own internal investigation in the White House to his credit Ronald Reagan cooperated fully the public perception and the political perception in the halls of Congress was that Baker was cleaning house and that Reagan was making a sincere effort to learn from his mistakes and conduct business differently going forward this was in Market contrast to presidential responses to other scandals Watergate and the Lewinsky scandal later specifically Walsh the independent Council was focusing on the two most
(1:22:36) likely culprits in the mess Oliver North and John Poindexter as early as May 1987 he interviewed President Reagan specifically about that December 6 1985 meeting where the Iran initiative was discussed when asked about various things Reagan kept repeating I can't remember he was probably not stonewalling he legitimately couldn't remember especially when it came to details on May 5th 1987 the day before William Casey died of brain cancer Congress has televised hearings on the Iran Contra matter got underway they
(1:23:13) dragged on through the summer of 1987. I remember seeing them on TV constantly in July Oliver North the mute Marine finally spilled what he knew or with what he wanted others to think that he knew having been given partial immunity from prosecution he testified that he believed Reagan knew everything about the diversion and was privy to all the operational details he admitted he destroyed documents at the suggestion of William Casey who being dead was in no position to refute it North didn't seem to be bothered by anything that he'd
(1:23:47) done and in fact was very proud of it the contra's secret war was worth it he thought on July 15th it was poindexter's turn he claimed he had deliberately withheld knowledge of the diversion from President Reagan to give him plausible deniability certain points of North and poindexter's testimonies were refuted by copies of the prof's notes and messages the emails copies of which had been found on the National Security agency's computer server by White House communications agency investigators thus
(1:24:20) Iran Contra was the very first political Scandal that involved scandalous emails Schultz was up before the Committees on July 23rd he testified about his vocal opposition to the whole arms initiative in the first place and notably in this case all the notes and memos that anybody could produce backed him up Schultz had been almost forced out of the White House in November Regan in particular hated him but he managed to hang on and he told Congress that he was sure Reagan had been fed a bunch of crap by his out-of-control advisors and that
(1:24:55) he knew nothing about the diversion Schultz remained Secretary of State until the end of Reagan's term in January 1989. Richard Secord who ran the logistics of the Contra resupply operation perjured himself before the Committees he told Congress he did not profit personally from the operations in fact he did to the tune of two million dollars c chord later pleaded guilty to account of lying to Congress for all the Sound and Fury of the hearings the Congressional investigations which reached there can which released their
(1:25:28) reports in November 1987 didn't add much to the public understanding of what had happened the Congressional investigation was Riven with partisanship and ended up filing two reports a majority and a Minority Report the majority basically agreed with the tower commission the inmates particularly North and Poindexter essentially had taken over the Asylum and the warden Ronald Reagan was asleep at the wheel The Minority Report the one from Republicans predictably blamed the whole thing on Democrats saying that Congress had been
(1:26:01) too strict and Technical with its wording on the kind of Aid it banned to the contras that argument didn't gain much traction except in conservative Echo Chambers the Iran-Contra Affair ultimately did nothing to fix the hostage crisis that the whole arms initiative had been created to try to solve in fact it seems to have made things worse in January 1987 Four new American house were taken in Beirut possibly as a result of the exposure of the deals another hostage was taken later in the year and still more were
(1:26:36) abducted in 1988. what few hostages Reagan's deals had managed to free were quickly made up for by new abductions in a scandal so complicated so Arcane with its hinge the diversion of Iran arms money to the contras buried so deep in the level of operational detail it's tempting to dismiss the whole thing as irrelevant at least in comparison to the harsh realities of more modern scandals I keep bringing up the metaphor of Iran Contra as a Rorschach test you see in it what you want to see and what you want
(1:27:20) to see is colored heavily by your partisan political Viewpoint was Watergate worse was Clinton Lewinsky more scandalous were the issues in Donald Trump's two impeachments deeper and more fundamental than whatever was at stake in Iran-Contra it's tempting to say yes and to dismiss this old 1980s Scandal as quaint and irrelevant times have changed in 35 years but I don't think we can dismiss it it's worth a few words to try to understand why it is important and it matters the biggest issue at stake in Iran-Contra was
(1:28:01) constitutional legitimacy several of the participants in the affair especially Secretary of State George Schultz made this argument at the time yes the United States Constitution gives the president basic powers of conducting foreign policy but the Constitution is explicit and it goes out of its way to specify that the power of appropriations of funding lies with Congress specifically the House of Representatives when the Constitution was created in Philadelphia in 1787 its framers were careful to separate the powers among the various
(1:28:39) branches of government and departments within those branches Congress was given the power to tax and to raise money directly a power it had lacked under the Articles of Federation but the check on that power was that taxation and appropriation Powers resided in the House Legislative chamber that was thought closest and most accountable to the people when Congress passed the Boland amendment in 1982 prohibiting military aid to the contras the powers of the executive branch were checked however much Ronald Reagan or Oliver
(1:29:14) North disagreed with that decision they were Bound by it Congress did not want American taxpayer money going to fund a war a secret war in Central America the Boland amendment was attached to the defense Appropriations act which Reagan signed on December 21st 1982 he accepted it it was law what North and Poindexter did was to make an end run around the Boland Amendment they took government property paid for by the taxpayers and sold it to a foreign power Iran the money the government took from that sale it gave illegally to a foreign army this
(1:29:54) was not a covert operation in the traditional sense Congress does fund covert operations by the CIA and others the CIA submits a proposed budget and often doesn't tell Congress what its spending taxpayer dollars on that may seem sketchy but it is legal and it is constitutional Iran Contra though wasn't that this was not part of a black budget appropriated however blindly and spent however craftily by CIA bureaucrats this was a sale of U.
(1:30:29) S government property to fund an illegal War Oliver North said he believed the money he diverted to the contras belonged to Iran at one point George Bush made a similar argument but that argument is wrong once Iran gave money to the United States whether in exchange for weapons or as a donation or a bribe that became Federal money subject to appropriation by Congress conversely the executive branch in the form of the NSC couldn't just take what it wanted from public coffers and give it to a foreign power even if the Boland Amendment wasn't in the picture that
(1:31:07) would still be true the way that North evidently found to be able to live with himself telling himself that the cause of the contrast was so important that it was justifiable to disregard the laws against it doesn't ring true for one thing the contras were themselves terrorists associated with numerous atrocities and human rights violations they were never able to shake the public perception that they were funded by drug trafficking but even aside from that issue to claim that supporting the contras was so vital that it Justified
(1:31:41) overriding the basic fabric of the Constitution was simply an appeal to Authority Ronald Reagan's Authority if an leader can do no wrong if his judgment is or should be law simply because it's his that gets us dangerously close to the crime that the insurrectionists at the Capitol on January 6 2021 were trying to commit that is the subjugation of the Constitutional order and the rule of law to the will and indeed the whim of a single man in a Democratic Society there must be accountability there must be
(1:32:19) checks and balances yes there are unjust laws and unwise laws but democracies tamper with constitutional checks and balances at their Hazard George Schultz understood this so I think did Ronald Reagan if Oliver North did nothing wrong why did he destroy documents why did he take the Fifth Amendment for so long why did he play the role of the mute Marine if the whole thing was right and proper why did Poindexter work so hard to keep Ronald Reagan in the dark simple politics Reagan he was a master politician he could handle politics he
(1:32:57) needed no help from North or Poindexter or Fawn Hall stuffing documents into her blouse like him or hate him Ronald Reagan was ill-served by his servants whatever anybody's political stripe in 1987 almost everyone could agree on that thank you Iran-Contra had a very long tail this video could be half as long again as it already is if I went into great detail so we're going to tie up the loose ends as concisely as possible Oliver North was indicted in 16 felony counts of various crimes related to Iran Contra in
(1:33:40) May 1989 he was convicted of three of those counts including lying to Congress and destroying evidence the problem at least for the government was that he had received partial immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony to Congress in 1987 and his immunized testimony may have tainted the trial his conviction was vacated in 1990 the next year the remaining charges were dropped John Poindexter was also indicted and convicted of similar crimes and very similar to North's case his conviction was also questioned as a
(1:34:17) result of the role of congressional testimony for which he had been immunized at least partially in 1987. poindexter's convictions were reversed on appeal in 1991. Robert McFarland pleaded guilty in 1988 two misdemeanor charges for lying to Congress he got two years of Probation and a fine  Richard Secord pleaded guilty 1989 lying to Congress sentenced two years probation numerous others involved in the Scandal were indicted some convicted some pled guilty people like Elliot Abrams Dwayne Claridge Thomas Klein's
(1:34:57) Etc I have elected not to focus on them just to try to keep this story from becoming so unwieldy with characters George Bush the vice president was never able to shake the Specter of Iran-Contra it hung like a dark shadow over his own run for president in 1988 as investigations were fading from headlines but criminal indictment for the principles were just ramping up bush had been briefed several times on the Iran arms initiative most notably in July 1986 by omiran near an Israeli official involved on Israel's side of
(1:35:32) the deal all of the documentary evidence indicates that bush generally approved of the arms deals with Iran and he may have had a greater understanding of their scope and purpose than President Reagan did but again as with Reagan evidence is lacking when it comes to knowledge of the diversion of funds to the contras Iran Contra did not catch fire as a campaign issue perhaps in part because his Democratic opponent in 1988 Michael Dukakis was extraordinarily weak and generally inept at exploiting any political opportunity against Bush the
(1:36:07) sitting vice president won a lopsided Victory against Dukakis in November 1988 but it was something of a hollow Victory Bush never clearly articulated his vision for the country and and was generally regarded as the executor of what was essentially Reagan's third term that wasn't how it turned out in the end but many people did think that was going to be it at the time Bush took office in January 1989 Bush inherited the Lebanon hostage crisis from Ronald Reagan it did not occupy the same amount of his
(1:36:39) attention as it had Reagan's the Lebanese Civil War was ramping down there was an agreement called the Taif agreement signed in early 1989 although violence continued in Lebanon throughout the next two years it gradually tapered off the contras never managed to win their war against the Sandinista regime in 1990 the sandinistas were voted out of power in a more or less peaceful election when Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega was defeated by Violetta Chamorro the sandinistas returned to power Again by election not Conquest in
(1:37:14) 2006 the domino effect that Ronald Reagan feared no never came to pass as of the time this video is being made in early 2023 Ortega is still president of Nicaragua Ayatollah Khomeini died in June 1989. his funeral was such a circus that people literally ripped his body out of its coffin the so-called moderates in Iran that McFarland thought he'd been dealing with never materialized in August 1990 Saddam Hussein the dictator of Iraq invaded Kuwait intending mainly to loot it and to cancel the massive debts that Hussein had run up with
(1:37:52) Kuwait during the iran-iraq war the Iraqi Invasion incidentally solved the issue of the al-dawah prisoners who as you recall were among the main Ransom demands for the westerners held in Beirut after the multinational Coalition of military forces led by Bush ejected Hussein from Kuwait the hostage crisis fizzled the last American hostage Terry Anderson was released at the beginning of December 1990 one having spent six years in custody two Germans the last Western hostages of all were set free in June 1992. the Persian Gulf War did not
(1:38:29) end the Iran-Contra Affair Bush felt dogged perhaps even persecuted by the ongoing investigation of Lawrence Walsh the independent Council Who was appointed in December 1986 and whose investigation stretched on incredibly through the entirety of Bush's term in office as the years wore on Walsh became increasingly interested in Casper Weinberger Reagan's former Secretary of Defense although a minor player in Iran Contra Walsh investigated Weinberger for making false statements to Congress and impeding investigations
(1:39:05) in June 1992 when Bush was running for re-election Walsh indicted Weinberger on five counts pursuant to this investigation Walsh arranged to interview former president Ronald Reagan one last time he was not a target of Walsh's investigation but was a potential witness on July 24 1992 Walsh and his team interviewed former President Reagan at an office in Los Angeles the interview was shocking Reagan was very much aged and his mental acuity had declined precipitously he barely remembered who George Schultz was
(1:39:42) he remembered nothing about TWA 847 he recalled meeting Gorbachev but very little else far from being useful as a potential witness and a trial against Weinberger Reagan's memory was significantly gone it would still be two years before Reagan's public statement that he had Alzheimer's disease but it was clear that its symptoms had manifested long before then possibly even beginning in his second term in office if Reagan ever knew anything substantive about Iran the Iran-Contra diversion he quickly forgot it Reagan of
(1:40:17) course died of Alzheimer's disease in 2004. Walsh issued one final indictment against Weinberger only days before the 1992 election many Republicans believed this indictment coming into the news cycle so shortly before the vote insured Bush's defeat I really don't think it made a difference Bush's re-election campaign in 1992 was limp and lifeless he seemed tired and out of touch as in 1988 he failed to convey any coherent picture of where he wanted to take America and his main attack on Challenger Bill Clinton was that Clinton
(1:40:53) dodged the Vietnam draft and was apparently not a fervant enough believer in American exceptionalism all the polls showed Bush significantly behind going into election day and the third party candidacy of Ross Perot was doing him no favors nevertheless Bush was bitter about his defeat and especially the role he thought Walsh might have played in it partly to end the nightmare of Iran Contra and perhaps partially out of spite Bush issued pardons to Casper Weinberger and a few other Iran Contra figures on Christmas Eve 1992 after the
(1:41:29) election but before Clinton took office Walsh wound up his investigation and his stint as investigative Council ended on August 4th 1993 nearly seven years after he'd been appointed Oliver North tried to go into politics emphasis on the tried in 1994 he ran for a senate seat in Virginia against Charles Robb who incidentally was Lyndon Johnson's son-in-law Rob trounced him North wound up in 2018 as president of the National Rifle Association but he quit that job after a feud with NRA chairman Wayne LaPierre he now writes books after
(1:42:06) poindexter's criminal convictions were reversed on appeal he went into the defense contracting business working for various high-tech firms and on defense projects he's still alive and is today an election denier pushing the baseless conspiracy theory that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump Robert McFarland also became a consultant especially on International nuclear issues he died in 2022 Donald Regan Reagan's disgraced Chief of Staff wrote a kiss and tell Memoir of his time in the white house which publicly exposed
(1:42:40) the Scandal that the Reagans were heavily influenced by kooky astrologer Joan Quigley Regan died in 2003 Quigley in 2014. Manuka gor bonifar the Iranian arms dealer is still alive he popped up in a couple of different Capers Loosely related to the war on terror in the 2000s but it's not clear what he's up to these days Eugene hassenfuss the CIA a man shot down over Nicaragua was sentenced to 30 years by a Nicaraguan court but was pardoned as an act of Mercy by Daniel Ortega and he returned to the United States many decades later
(1:43:17) he served time in Wisconsin for indecent exposure the plane in which hasenfuss was flying that day was incidentally turned into a pub in Costa Rica fond Hall and Oliver North's former secretary briefly dated actor Rob Lowe and she also dated the son of one of the leaders of the contras in the 90s she married Danny sugerman former manager of the doors and author of The Jim Morrison biography no one here gets out alive he is now deceased Fawn is still alive living quietly in LA foreign 1985 and 86 the United States government
(1:43:57) sold military-grade weapons to the country of Iran a sponsor of various terrorist groups as sort of an indirect ransom for hostages held by some of those same groups that Iran sponsored money received from those weapons sales was secretly diverted to fund a covert Army the contras that was fighting against the socialist government of Nicaragua all of these actions were either illegal or contrary to the stated policy of the United States or both that's the basic summary of the Iran-Contra scandal but I hope you
(1:44:30) understand now as complicated and impenetrable as this Scandal is the wall of crazy personified in real life that it does matter in history it matters not only to the legacy of Ronald Reagan but to the political and constitutional History of the United States as a whole I made this video because I fear that the Iran-Contra Affair is in danger of being eclipsed or even forgotten in popular historical memory in all the momentous events that have occurred since 1986 most of them bigger flashier and more memorable something like Iran
(1:45:06) Contra is in real danger of becoming just a Dusty little detail on the bottom page of a history book that no one reads it shouldn't be that now you know something about it too if you liked this video or learned something from it please do all the things you normally do for a video you like click the thumbs up button or subscribe you know the drill I have several other Deep dive videos on my channel such as the comprehensive early history of the Amway multi-level marketing tools cult a video essay on the meaning of the Titanic disaster and
