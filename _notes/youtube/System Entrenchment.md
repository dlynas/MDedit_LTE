System Entrenchment

## Transcript:
why does entrenchment increase over time
naturally
and when can entrenchment be disrupted
peacefully
which is oftentimes what economists call
creative destruction and i'm reading
this book right now i'm actually not
that far into it but i had some thoughts
and wanted to
lay out a video just
laying out the basics of entrenchment
now i think it's helpful to think of
entrenchment both in the business
setting and also in the government
setting
because entrenchment is going to
increase in both places over time the
question worth starting with if we want
to understand this is going to be
when is entrenchment a good thing
and of course if we think of
entrenchment on this spectrum where one
end of the spectrum has
flexibility of a system
responsiveness of a system to the people
involved in it the people that that
system serves
and then on the other side of the
spectrum we have rigidity and sort of
lots of paperwork
difficulties and barriers in place for
changing the system or for getting
things done or for responding to
changing environments obviously
entrenchment is on one side of this
spectrum
but we might acknowledge that there are
places where we actually want
entrenchment
um and and the reason for that is we
want systems that have some stability we
want systems that are not super easy to
manipulate
from people who come along who are very
power hungry who have their own agenda
who want to sort of bend the system in
their favor
and entrenchment can actually protect
against that kind of overtake now the
business example i would like to point
to
has to do with a social media startup
that has certain protections for your
privacy and for the way your data will
be used you would actually want some of
those privacy protections to be
entrenched in the system
and at the same time if it's a startup
that system has to figure out ways of
being flexible ways of adapting to its
competitive environment
ways of figuring out what people want
and delivering that
and sort of the problem that startups
have to solve is how do you make your
system flexible enough so that it finds
its niche and the market so in general
with most systems there are going to be
parts of the system that you want to be
entrenched and difficult to change
and parts of the system that are much
more flexible the government example
here might be if we go back to the
beginning of the country of the united
states
they actually didn't have term limits
for the president of the united states
so george washington chose to step down
and later they implemented term limits
and we might think about it and realize
actually a lot of systems have been sort
of overtaken by dictators who get rid of
the term limit
piece of that constitution
so to protect from dictators taking over
we might want term limits to be
absolutely entrenched that would be a
good thing
our next question is why do systems
increase in entrenchment over time
and there are some good reasons for this
and some bad reasons for this
so the good reasons have to do with the
fact that when a company or a new
government is first getting its feet off
the ground
the people running that don't know
exactly what the perfect system is going
to look like
because in both cases the system sort of
is embedded in a social network and has
to interact in that social network and
put structure on that social network
in a way that works well with the people
it's serving
and pretty much the only way of doing
that is putting a system out there
and figuring out where the system's
working and not working and updating the
system to make it work better in that
social setting or that competitive
setting
and
um being really flexible to begin with
but then once you figure out things that
both work and that are important to
maintain that's the point at which you
entrench those parts of the system
systems learn over time
and part of the entrenchment process
is learning what works and what doesn't
work and entrenching the things that
work while leaving the things you
haven't quite yet figured out
a little bit more flexible and part of
the deal here is that it takes a lot of
energy to experiment in a system
you have to have people who are
comparing people who are thinking
carefully about any experimentation
you're doing
and you don't have infinite resources in
a system
so you want to channel those resources
towards the things that could benefit
most from improving you want to channel
the attention of all the workers in that
system all the people who are in charge
of making it work you want to channel
those optimally
so once you've figured out that
something is working really well
the best thing may be to entrench that
so that nobody has to pay attention to
it nobody has to
maintain it or do all the upkeep it's
just fully entrenched
and therefore your people can go and pay
attention to other problems that matter
to improve the system incrementally so
that's the good reason for entrenchment
to increase over time
what about the bad reason well the bad
reason is basically about gaming the
system
you're always going to have people that
recognize the power of a system and come
in and try to
use the system to serve their own
purposes
so over time and as the system sort of
gets more transparent as the system is
out there for more people to figure out
all of the different mechanisms that
play
you're going to have more and more
people figure out how to work the system
how to game it and as long as those
people are sort of giving advantages and
bringing people into the system that are
their collaborators their
co-conspirators
then that group of people is probably
going to entrench the system to their
benefit over time
so this gets at the answer to our next
question which is when does entrenchment
become a problem
and there's basically two reasons
entrenchment could become a problem the
first and the most obvious is this sort
of
people using the system to serve their
interests rather than the interests of
the the entire community and then the
second potential problem is that the
system is entrenched in a way that works
well in the past maybe when there's
horse and buggy or maybe when there's
phones or maybe when just the world
looked different maybe the system has
entrenched the parts of the system that
work well in that past environment
but the system does not work that well
in the new constantly changing
technologically innovative world so the
second one is actually a way a system
can be entrenched even without bad
actors and if we're thinking about how
this works a lot of times entrenchment
happens through
rules and red tape and
many different layers of people whose
approval you need to get something done
and this happens both in companies and
also in governments where
i'm sure you've interacted with a
company where you need some kind of
customer service and you're constantly
going in circles on the phone trying to
get the right person constantly hearing
it can't be done
there's rules against that that's
against that the legal jargon that's at
the bottom of this contract you've been
part of systems that do that now in the
business setting a lot of times there's
a trade-off between the size of the
business and this kind of a red tape
because there are obviously competitive
advantages to being large there's
monopoly power there is economies of
scale
but the larger a system is the more
parts of it need to be entrenched for it
to actually function
and of course the same thing is true of
government bureaucracy where there's all
kinds of sludge the book sludge is
actually a great book about just sort of
government inefficiencies and
barriers that are in place to try to
to try to protect the rules but which
can really get in the way of making a
system functional now our last question
is how do entrenched systems get
disrupted
and when can that happen peacefully and
when does it require some kind of
rebellion or some kind of major
um conflict now on the business side of
things we have mechanisms for creative
destruction
and creative destruction is where you
recognize that a system is pouring
energy into something that is kind of
wasteful and so creative destruction is
basically getting rid of that waste and
creative destruction can happen within
companies
for example leaders might shut down a
unit of the company if they do an
analysis and recognize oh yeah people in
that part of the company are not really
contributing in a meaningful way
so good leaders can recognize where
there needs to be creative destruction
now almost all destruction is going to
be painful to someone like there's going
to be someone who loses their job or at
the very least loses what they've
developed skills in over time even if
you move that person to a different part
of the company now competitive markets
can also generate creative destruction
simply by having new businesses come in
and out compete businesses that are
really entrenched
that's also not a painless process
people do lose their jobs leaders of the
companies lose their positions
but it's a natural part of the economic
environment that people have kind of
accepted in the political environment
obviously we have elections that act
similarly in terms of creative
destruction where if you have leaders
who are feeding an entrenched system
without
investing in the needed updates those
leaders can be voted out of office and
hopefully the idea would be that the new
leaders would come in and
uh and do and take the steps necessary
to get rid of the entrenched parts of
the system but of course if you have a
lot of money being exchanged behind the
scenes
people being set up by perhaps
corporations or big money to
serve their interests
you could get a situation where even
though elections sort of overturn the
people in charge the people who end up
winning the elections are all so deeply
connected with the system and the money
and
the the sources of entrenchment that
nothing actually gets creatively
destroyed and in some ways that's where
rebellion comes into place
of course rebellion is going to be
dangerous because
if you rebel and and try to overturn
parts of the system
what is going to rise up in its place
and that thing that rises up could
um could be bad could be good it's
something we've never seen before
