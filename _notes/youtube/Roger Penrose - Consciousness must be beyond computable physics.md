Transcript:
(00:00) the Big Bang was the conformal continuation of the remote future of a previous Eon and maybe we maybe others produce a very very Advanced civilization which will learn how to send signals into the next eon so Roger thank you for talking to new scientists making time for this one thing I wanted to ask sort of leading off was about black holes because this is where you started your career effectively and then of course you know we're now in the era where we're taking photographs of black holes and so I was
(00:37) wondering how it felt to you when you first saw the the photograph of a black hole I think it was a sort of a splodge in the middle that's right yeah so it didn't they didn't make much impression on me because I was expecting these things by then the reaction that many people was quite well let me give you an example of this Bob Dickey who is a well-known cosmologist physicist a very distinguished man and he came and slapped me on the back and said you've done it you've shown general relativity
(01:07) is wrong and that was quite a common view that the fact that you got these singularities oh and I I suspect that even Einstein would probably have had that reaction because he was very much against the existence of singularities Einstein I think would have thought no no we can't have singularities there must be something wrong with the theory I think the view had been that it would swish around and come swirling out again and this show that's not what happens that's what I proved it wasn't really
(01:35) even black holes now it's you know accepted that we have singularities you know they're very much Central to cosmology um at the time when you were looking at like was it an odd thing to be looking into at the time the quasars had been observed and the strength of the signal indicated that they must be enormously large but also small because the variations in signals show they must be small large and small indicated that something like what we now call a black hole so it did suggest that we had out there these quasars were
(02:13) things that were very compressed concentrated bodies down to the sort of level where you would see this kind of problem arising I just didn't think the arguments were that likely to prove convincingly that that you didn't have singularities so what I thought about it my own way which is certainly very different from the way other people were thinking about it yeah see what people were thinking about was either um looking at exact models and the the schwartshot solution which was this fairly symmetrical one known very early
(02:47) on and the Cur solution and which is now believed to represent a a rotating black hole the Exact Solutions have a role to play but they don't tell you what's going to happen in general complicated collapse or you could look at complicated computer calculations computer calculations were very much in the rudimentary form at the time yes of course yeah but even so they don't tell you that singularities are coming up they really say well look with a computer programming everything's broken down is that because it's sort of
(03:19) run out of your memory or calculations of have given up all this time later you get The Nobel Prize in 2020. did that come as a surprise to you and has it made any difference to how you work or or the opportunities you have no I hadn't expected it at all 2020. there was a good thing and a bad thing because of the lockdown I was able to sort of work out on certain ideas that had been buzzing around in my head and I hadn't had a chance to work and so I wrote down some notes and sent them around to colleagues and and this didn't end up
(03:53) being a paper this was I would say the good thing the bad thing was getting the Nobel Prize because it stopped the whole thing dead because I'm being unfair really it wasn't entirely that what the citation said it was black holes are a robust prediction of Einstein's general theory of relativity what I really showed was singularities a robust prediction of general relativity see the thing that that we don't know is whether you get singularities that are hidden behind Horizons which is a black hole and
(04:27) that's what we believe or whether you could get naked ones it's the singularities which are just there and information could come out of it and I in a sort of way rather hoped in my wild sort of um view that maybe snake and singularities might occur but as far as I'm aware there is still no proof the general Community sort of resigned to the ideas what you get this is black holes yeah it was in a sense of the more boring situation obviously you know you've got Decades of work behind you but presumably you're still active and
(05:02) interested in stuff now and working on things now you know so what are you currently interested in well conformal cyclic cosmology oh yes which is the view that the Big Bang which is not actually the origin of the universe yeah but the big bang was the conformal continuation of the remote future of a previous Eon you see the in this Theory there are Cycles it begins with a big bang each one has its own Big Bang it continues the universe expands and expands and then indulges in this exponential expansion which we now see for our own
(05:40) eon so the conformal cyclic Universe idea has been around a long time and as far as I can tell it doesn't get a lot of pick up from the rest of the physics Community is that fair to say you're absolutely right it does not get a lot of pickup I find that when I give talks to people who are not physicists they could be scientists then they latch onto it much more easily than the people who are are conventional cosmologists very few of them I would say take me seriously I don't fully understand the conformance cycle
(06:13) of cosmology is an idea which does have observational implications I think people should worry about science in a way I hate to say this because the evidence for it is really quite strong the strength of the signal we see is a 99.98 confidence level which is pretty strong yeah what we've claim to see in this paper is what I call clocking points hmm now what is the Hawking point one thing single black hole gradually swallows most of the cluster until the universe gets colder colder than the black holes Hawking temperature that
(06:56) temperature becomes the hottest thing around when the universe gets colder than it and then it radiates away all that radiation carries away the entire Mass pretty well of that black hole that radiation is concentrated in one tiny little point all that energy bursts through onto the other side it takes 380 000 years before light can escape finally the photons can escape and that's the microwave background that's the earliest thing you actually see can I move on to another of your um controversial ideas which is uh the idea
(07:29) that uh Consciousness involves Quantum effect is that something that you still um believe in and and are working towards I'd written my book The Emperor's New mind thinking that it might stimulate young people to do physics that's what I hope all the letters pretty well all the letters I got for old retired people we try to focus a bit of a come down but I got a letter from this crazy person I thought first and this is Stuart hammeroff this was Stuart hammeroff and he was had the view that Consciousness had to do with
(07:59) not with nerve transmission as everybody else seemed to think but as in terms of microtubules these little tiny structures much much smaller the nerves so we got together and did things we didn't quite know what we were doing there are certain rough edges to that argument which need to be thought about but the general argument is still what I believe whatever understanding is is something which must be Beyond computable physics and you if you think Consciousness is non-computable does that mean that you think it's beyond
(08:32) what science can no discern not necessarily Beyond silence no it's just um not Beyond it's beyond current science my claim is much worse much more serious much more outrageous than that it's quantum mechanics in the brain people say oh Quantum against in the brain it can't be that that's worse I'm saying no it's not quantum mechanics it's where quantum mechanics goes wrong it's where it's a theory which we don't know yet I would say that of the main mainstream views about what
(09:08) Consciousness is I don't know there are about four of them and one of them is us that's a bit of a shift there are also experiments now looking at effects to do with Quantum effects and to do with effects of General anesthetics and there do seem to be some connections there so it's it's it's coming into the area of experimental confirmation or refutation so I find that exciting you've spent decades obviously thinking about the structure of the universe thinking about Consciousness and really you know I
(09:49) guess in that respect what it means to be human and to think about the universe so I was wondering whether any of this sort of comes together and gives you any sense of whether there's inherent meaning in the universe for you does it make you in some sense spiritual to think about those kinds of things well it's a difficult question to answer mainly because I don't know the answer I don't believe in any religion I've seen so in that sense I'm an atheist however I would say that there is something
(10:18) going on which might resonate with with a religious perspective but I think the presence of Consciousness put it like that is not an accident in a certain sense and it certainly has connections with the few people that people often have that you've got these constants of Nature and nobody who knows where they come from and if they didn't have the particular values that they have then we wouldn't have maybe interesting chemistry we wouldn't wouldn't have life I find that a little bit of a difficult argument
(10:55) to make clear because we don't know what kind of if the numbers were different what kind of a thing might call Life there is that question about CCC do the not constant nature get jumbled up each time you go around into the next Eon it's an interesting question which relates to a paper which I did write with my one of my collaborators while he goes again where we look for signals coming from the previous Eon mainly the collision between supermassive black holes and they produce gravitational wave signals which we should be able to
(11:24) see the implications of in our Eon and the claim is we do again people dispute this very much but I think they're pretty strong arguments there's something going on there so in some ways the purpose of physics is to be able to communicate with the the next generation of universes and warn them to be better than we are better than we have yeah that might be it yes sure take our civilization and not all that are optimistic that we're going to go on for a huge length of time I mean the probability that something
(11:56) will trigger a nuclear catastrophe is not that tiny in fact I think we're pretty lucky to be around now but maybe other civilizations will be more sensible than US settle down I think some version of seti you know looking for different civilizations maybe we should look at the really successful ones which would be they were very late in the in the previous year that's maybe more promising in some respects maybe we maybe others produce a very very Advanced civilization which will learn how to send signals into the
(12:30) next eon probably gravitational wave signals are the best bet I had thought in terms of very very low frequency electromagnetic signals which might get through too it might be there's anything don't do that you stupid idiots that's what we're doing oh yes yeah it's quite possible so I think we can conclude that physics is far from finished it's far from finished absolutely right Roger thank you so much for your time it's been a fascinating conversation
