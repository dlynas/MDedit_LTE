Norman Finkelstein on Debating Alan Dershowitz (FULL INTERVIEW)

## Transcript:

foreign

give us some some background on uh on
this debate this is happening in uh 2003
on Democracy Now
well
I'll try to be brief because obviously
any topic you ask that can go on through
eternity and but that would then preempt
the actual debate
uh when I originally picked up the book
uh the Case for Israel I didn't attach
any significance to it it just seemed to
be pretty uh
pretty simple-minded and
preaching to the choir
but I did notice something at the very
beginning which kind of amused me and
what I noticed was that he was because I
know the book from time immemorial like
the back of my hand that was published
in 1984 and the book was a hoax and I'm
widely credited with having exposed that
hoax it was a major national bestseller
very influential for a period of time
and I basically took it apart and
demonstrated that from many different
angles the book was complete nonsense
and when I picked up uh Alan
dershowitz's book the Case for Israel I
couldn't help but notice that at least
in the initial chapters uh large
sections were simply lifted from that
hoax from time and Memorial
and that to me was was kind of amusing
but beyond being amused by it uh I
didn't attach much importance to it
um but then the books start to gain a
lot of momentum and it became
influential I think it was on the top of
the New York Times bestseller list or
near the top of the New York Times
bestseller list and it was being widely
distributed on college campuses the
campus hillels were buying it up in
large numbers and I think at the time my
memory is I could be mistaken they were
being given away free
and so at that point I realized that
there is
um there is a political
task to be completed namely exposing
this rather silly little book
uh and then I I knew Amy Goodman and I
suggested to her that she'd do a program
uh she contacted Alan dershowitz and he
agreed to be on the program though I
think he was hoping he would be debating
either Professor Noam Chomsky or
Professor Edward Syed
I was what you might call a very low
third
in that ranking
but it was me that he debated and then
he had a second problem
which is not to take away anything from
Professor Chomsky for for be it for me
to do so or Professor Saeed but I am
very conscientious I do my homework and
I do my homework again
which is to say I read the book once I
read the book twice and I felt confident
that I would be able to Prevail in the
court of public opinion in an exchange
with him
now I'm going to just say two more
things uh so as not to belabor my
presence
number one
many people said afterwards
what did you expect would happen namely
after the debate he went after me with a
Vengeance
um as Professor Chomsky put it he went
on the Jihad to try to destroy me
professionally
and a lot of people basically said
I got what was
to be expected would be coming to me
and I would want to respond to that
by saying and I think I could say this
with complete
uh skirtitude
I'm not engaging now in some sort of
uh exculpation or cover-up
I honestly believe
that it was going to be a Tit for Tat at
the scholarly level
I would level my claim he would level
his claim he would go back and forth I
did not anticipate
that it would degenerate into a
um
ajihad to destroy me professionally
so I don't think it's fair to hold it
against me that somehow I am feigning
innocence and I didn't know what I was
getting into when I publicly
um claim that large parts of the book
were in various forms fraudulent
um there was a second point I wanted to
make maybe it'll come back to me in a
moment that seems pretty strange like uh
you know to think that doing a debate uh
where you you know Quest like
question the originality of the book I
mean that seems like the sort of thing
that it's like what you know what I
would expect to be coming as a result of
that is maybe later he writes an article
where he tries to clear his name and
he's really vicious or something like
that right that would be the sort of
thing I would expect you know I wouldn't
I wouldn't expect I mean I think nobody
really at the normal course of things
certainly on most issues would expect
that that would lead to an attempt to
destroy somebody's academic career
yes I
I honestly did not that I'm in any way
truthful about what I did but a very
close friend of mine in high school she
since passed away uh she was featured in
a documentary film on my life
now I never actually watched the film
it's called American radical I for some
reason I just couldn't summon the inner
wear with all to watch it but many
people told me afterwards that this
friend of mine from high school she
eventually moved to Israel and lived
there for the past 30 years until she
Premed Charlie passed away her name is
Maxine and she says in the movie in the
kind of indignation what did he expect
to think would happen what did he expect
would happen
and actually maybe I was naive but I
expected that we were going to have a
real tit-for-tat points Counterpoint it
would be a vigorous exchange because I
was confident in the end I would prevail
uh so that's what I expected
and uh
okay
so I think that's the background there
was one on the point but it'll come to
me
just
oh you're muted I think
uh okay what are you what were you
saying in any case oh uh well just as a
side note that documentary is quite
moving I thought um but yeah I just did
a
I was I just had a question for Norm if
that's all right uh I was wondering if
uh
you had published anything before this
debate if dershowitz had any awareness
going into it of what uh your findings
were or what you'd or what you were no
no
the last footnote the date in the book
if you look at the footnote excuse me
the end notes in his book the Case for
Israel
the last date was I think June 13th or
June 15th 2003.
we did the debate in September
which means at Max three months elapsed
from the point that he the manuscript
was submitted and we did the debate now
that's important for a certain reason
the reason is some people claim well he
forgot some things he had written in the
book that happens the authors do forget
and that's true I am perfectly willing
to acknowledge that that sometimes I'm
surprised oh I said that in the book I
forgot
but this was just a three-month elapse
between when the book was submitted and
when we met so the excuse of the author
having forgotten
I don't find very credible in this case
now I want to make another Point these
are all my new points where they
actually add up and trying to understand
what happened
publishing has radically changed in the
last 20 years
in particular
when you did a book back in 2003
you had first proofs second proofs third
proofs and then final proofs a book went
through after you've already submitted
your final manuscript
a book went through four stages first
second third and final proofs why do I
mention that because each time in each
stage the manuscript manages to get
botched up by the typesetter or somebody
else you have to read it again and again
and again it was a total complete
nightmare especially because even today
the transition from Say a Word document
to typesetting is not smooth
and so all sorts of things get botched
up
so now you have two considerations
consideration number one at maximum only
three months have elapsed between the
time he submitted the manuscript for
publication
and the actual publication of the book
and number two
by the time you're done with the final
proofs you are dreaming about every page
in the book you've been driven
completely mad by this book you loathe
it you hate it you want to toss it into
the nearest bonfire you are so sick of
that book
so the idea that he quote unquote forgot
so much that was in the book is not very
credible
had he written it or read it
uh the other point I wanted to make was
after the the date was over
I had made many Brash allegations I had
leveled nutty Brash allegations which
obviously in the course of an hour or
two you can only skim this surface in
documenting
and I know everybody knows the standard
Debaters trip the standard debater's
trick is to say
this book is complete with arrows as not
the Hassan said to Matt taibi ever after
Ever After Ever and then the standard
the beggar's trick is to say but for
reasons of time I can only illustrate it
with two examples in fact two examples
is all you have
but you make it sound as if for reasons
of time or reasons of space I can only
illustrate it with two examples and I
understood that bad faith technique
and so after I completed the debate I
felt I had a responsibility
if I am a serious scholar
too copiously
comprehensively thoroughly
document the claims which as I said
would rather brush in the uh Pro program
and so I produced a rather large book
entitled Beyond hutzpah on the misuse of
that the semitism and the abuse of
History
now there's an interesting footnote to
that story the book was scheduled to be
published by University of California
press which is a very respectable
Publishing House
and then professor dershowitz
went to the governor of California
Arnold Schwarzenegger because he's he
was because it's University of
California press he sits on the
overseers for the press and went to
Schwarzenegger to try to get him to
cancel publication of the book
uh Schwarzenegger refused he said it was
a matter of academic freedom whether he
knew what that meant only God knows or
his lawyers just told him and then
uh Professor dershowitz threatened to
sue the Press
and there was a funny there was a long
uh correspondence which I had access
which I gained access to
so the charge of plagiarism
was ultimately placed in the first
appendix of the book where I document
the plagiarism
so professor dershowitz
for his lawyer
sent the letter to University of
California press
and that he said in the letter quote
if you don't remove the appendix now
it's going to be a very painful
operation later
it was just a kind of Mafia
like statement I mean it was so
breathtaking if you don't remove the
appendix now it's going to be a very
painful operation later
and I have to say
it through my Publishing House into a
panic
and we reached an impasse a crisis
erupted
because they wanted to eliminate the
appendix
and I said no because then he's going to
go around declaring victory
that even the University of California
press removed the appendix because they
knew the charges of plagiarism were
false
and
um they said to me look Norman we are a
small University perhaps which is true
perhaps it's a small operations
relatively speaking
they said to me if professor dershowitz
sues us meaning University of California
press sues Us in New York
they said we don't even have the money
to fly out our staff for a trial
and so they really feared
that he would bankrupt them
that was a very serious issue for them
how it was finally resolved I don't want
to uh go through the fine details but
the point being
that I not only leveled the accusations
and he was not we can say
uh particularly impressive in his
replies
but I then took the next step
and I fully documented my claims
and rather than try to reply to them
he tried to suppress publication of the
book
I would also add
I always fear I go on too long and there
are three other people here no I also
add about 10 years more than 10 years
about 15 years later
I met him in the Chinese rest excuse me
yeah an Indian restaurant on the Upper
East Side
and I had some Norm finkelstate
meticulousness got to get no it was an
Indian restaurant all right
I I had very conflicted feelings
about sitting with him at the table
and I'm going to tell you why
um maybe you won't be able to fully
apprehend
when the whole
issue of
um
that the uh appendix the plagiarism
charge and everything else
when it arose
uh Professor dershow would start to go
around saying
that my late mother was a Nazi
collaborator of cockroach yeah
and
um
he was he was kind of vague either she
was a capo a Nazi collaborator or I
believed she was his his
um wording was ambiguous there
well
um
I you know my mother was very protective
of me she was a Jewish mother uh
okay
exponential Jewish mother exponentially
increased Jewish remember very
protective me however
and there was one area
where
her personal integrity and dignity
prevailed over her Jewish mother
adulting
and that was when it came to anything
having to do with her experience during
World War II
uh without going into the Gory details
she was a witness at the last major
trial of
Nazi concentration camp guards for my
Dominic concentration camp
there was a trial in Dusseldorf in 1979.
and she had to confront the guards
and I unfortunately got in the middle of
it and it got very ugly
so
I knew
that she would lose all respect for me
uh if in the face of that accusation
that she had collaborated
with the people
who had exterminated her family
that if I didn't do anything in the face
of that accusation that was now posted
on Professor dershowitz's Harvard Law
School website
if I didn't react
I knew her regard for me would
precipitously
plummet
I think that's redundant would
precipitously fall or plummet
and so
I was very conflicted
about sitting down with him
in a restaurant table
and I'm being very literal here
and not throttling him
because now I it was a part of me that
felt it was a betrayal
of my
parents martyrdom
but I did
and I'm not going to deny it I did sit
and talk to him and at one point
I said Tim
why did you say those things about my
mother
so he said to me well you wrote a star
you well you wrote
I stopped him short
and I said
Professor bershowitz don't go there
by the way if you have any doubt about
what I'm saying I have the tape it was
take the conversation
so I'm retelling it but if you have any
questions I'm happy to give it up I said
to him
Professor dershowitz don't go there
I said to him
I know
your background
and I'm perfectly willing to acknowledge
it's impressive
you grew up in Borough Park a very
modest lower middle class Jewish
neighborhood I grew up with I was born
the same neighborhood we were born with
an eight blocks of each other
you then went to Brooklyn College a mod
a good but modest College
and then you went to Yale Law School
and you graduate number one in your
class I said I have
no doubt that's an impressive
achievement
I recognize that just as I recognize
Charles Schumer's achievement Chuck
Schumer he went to my high school his
parents were his father was an
exterminator
he was came from a very modest
background
and through sheer brilliance
well also being a complete crook but the
Brilliance was there the points is there
no question about he was valedictorian
in my high school and so forth and I I
said I acknowledge I said now look
Professor there schwitz I read
everything you've written in the last 40
years
and
it's obviously worthless
it was interesting his reaction you know
how he reacted
he just Shrugged his shoulders like that
like
yeah what could I do about it he didn't
deny it I said
but you're clearly literate
sufficiently literate you know I never
wrote anything like that
you know that was the complete line
and you know how he responded
he said
after what you did to me on Democracy
Now
what did you expect me to do
in other words
he knew it was whether you're still was
a lie
but it was to protect
you besmirched my name
I'll besmerch your name
it wasn't interesting
don't find him a particularly
interesting personality I find him
rather dope he's um
he's a
a
computation of two Jewish archetypes
the Jewish Town knew this
because what is a communist a tamudis is
commenting on the commentary of the
commentary of the commentary of the
commentary the whole talmud is about
twisting words it is it's about how to
manipulate words to lend them meanings
which are very hard to discern by the
naked eye
and that's who the lawyer does
you hire a lawyer to prove black is
white night is day cold is hot
Etc totally short that's what the lawyer
does a lawyer a lawyer is paid to prove
that the text does not say what it
clearly says that's a lawyer's job so
here's a combination of the talmudists
the commentary and the commentary and
the commentary in the commentary trying
to prove this sentence does not really
mean what this stuff it seems to me this
word does not seem to mean and the other
Jewish archetype the shyster
he's a combination talmudist and shyster
and that's for the lawyers
that's where the lawyer is a lawyer is a
combination of those two Jewish
archetypes and that's why some of the
Jews are lawyers
it's absolutely true no it is it's a
very striking fact if you go on the
subway nowadays
there's only one group of people who
still read books one group of people
only one
Orthodox Jews
they're sitting there and reading the
Cowboys
it's deeply impressive
deeply impressive
the discipline no cell phone no iPhone
and the commitment
it's our religion
and they sit and read and that was you
know we used to call it you would call
it um
Yeshiva yeshiva's the Jewish school
Jewish Day School a Yeshiva Booker
b-o-c-h-e-r a Jewish reader reader and
that was and that's the uh dershus but
he's not an interesting personality no
he's not I don't know you know not
everybody has to be an interesting
personality but he he just happens not
to be
um I still found that conversation
insightful even as I I had with him in
the Indian restaurant even as I have to
acknowledge my mother would probably
have loved me
or maybe even to the point of
of disowning mean though
but losing a lot of respect for me
and you know what I think she would be
right
I let my vanity get the better of my
principle
does that uh you said that was recorded
as that is that uh public
uh
I don't know who was ever made public
but I haven't yeah I I there was a
Lebanese cell who invited me I couldn't
afford any restaurant in the Upper East
Side I couldn't even afford to eat the
leftovers thrown out in the garbage Moon
but he invited me and he quietly
recorded it
at least you had the opportunity to
confront him
yeah but you know what
it's totally meaningless to him
Notions like honor integrity
respect for the Dead
hey look he's he's a lawyer a high price
lawyer
he takes all the dirtiest cases
well it literally is his name is the
image that's conjured up when I think of
a devil's advocate
and a man who's claimed that he isn't
litigious okay you're a defense attorney
a number of defamation suits
I have to say that's one of his funniest
lights I'm not hilarious he's suing
everybody and someone who also is a
self-avoud defender of the First
Amendment who comes after your right
that's what I was thinking because uh
I'm old enough that I can remember a
time when I had you know vaguely
positive feelings about Alan dershowitz
because you know this is before all of
this this is before he uh he started
talking about torture warrants and
things like that during the uh the war
on terror uh because back you know in I
don't know I mean like in the 90s when I
was a teenager I remember
um
you know he I think
I made a lot of his branding was that he
was a big civil libertarian that that's
why cases you know it was totally false
you're absolutely correct that was his
branding but it was totally false
he projected himself as a civil
libertarian crusader but if you actually
look at his cases
his cases if you take his book The Best
Defense which was his first major work
the first case in the book
was two members of the Jewish Defense
League
which was a far right-wing Jewish
organization now that doesn't mean
anything because the whole country you
know lunatic right alt right but at the
time Jewish Defense League was a
far-right uh Jewish organization
uh without going into all the details at
that time there was a very famous what
was called impresario name Saul Uric and
Sal Urich was involved in cultural
changes cultural exchanges between the
Soviet Union and the United States
at that particular moment the whole free
Soviet jury movement had arisen
and so Uric was seen as a traitor
to Jews because he was calling for
cultural exchange when organized Jewish
uh life was calling for a boycott of
Israel and sanctions you know if not
Israel of the Soviet Union to free
Soviet Jews let them go essentially let
them leave the Soviet Union and go to
Israel because these organizations
didn't want them to come here they want
the Jews to go to Israel
uh in any event what's his first case
the jdl these two members of the jdo
they planted the bomb and saw herrick's
office he wasn't there at the time they
killed his secretary
and their insurance boasts
that he got these two guys off that's
the first chapter of his best known book
at a time the best defense he boasts
about the fact that he got two Jews
Jewish Fanatics off after they killed a
totally innocent secretary in South
huron's office
then what are his other cases in the
book this is not me I'm just calling the
book
he was
um
you remember the Queen the Queen of Mean
you remember
um
where uh Helmsley
um
I forgot her first name
Melissa Helmsley what was it Melanie
what was helmsley's wife's first name
what ryota
yeah Leona Helmsley he was known as the
queen of Maine she abused all of her
staff and so forth and then she was
involved in some lower case maybe taxes
I don't remember he got her off that was
another big case for him then there was
this guy Rabbi Bergman Bernard Bergman
he was uh uh under investigation for
abusing senior citizens in senior
citizen homes actually that was the big
case that got Geraldo Rivera on the map
he reviewed he revealed the abuse of the
senior citizens in Bernard bergman's uh
nursing homes
dershowitz got him off
then you have the whole slew he did a
lot of the pornography cases he was the
lawyer for I am curious yellow that was
the first porn film to be imported in
the U.S from uh France yellow
he then did deep throat
he was the lawyer for deep throat
then he was the lawyer for Harry rings
when Linda Lovelace
us uh accused Harry reams of having
abused her on set during the making of
deep throat so he did a lot of the
pornography cases
he then did of course
the O.J Simpson case
he did the
van the Mike Tyson case
the Klaus van buelo case and Van built
almost certainly murdered his wife
said you know we could disagree on this
but
oh
I just find it look I don't want to get
into an argument here but if something
goes up to Mike Tyson's apartment at 4am
what do you think is going to happen
you're going to be reading the talmud
very unlikely but he got accused of
having right there I see you're giving
me a skeptical look fine I'm not woke so
uh I say these things but Mike Tyson
Klaus from dulo O.J Simpson
wife murderers wife batterers
can you tell me what that has to do with
civil liberties
read his books which I've read
he did a couple of capital punishment
cases
if that woman disappear on me
well the Sheldon seagulls having a
connection issue oh okay yeah he
disagrees with me she should disagree
shut up that's okay I don't mind trust
me
um
yeah I cut out there that wasn't in
protest I promise
um he did the um
he didn't do anything so he did a couple
of capital punishment cases
and he did he claims he gave like 10
minutes of his time for Angela Davis who
knows I don't even know that's it there
was no civil liberties he got the civil
liberties reputation because he defended
pornography and at that point in time
pornography was technically a civil
liberties issue because it was defended
in the Supreme Court uh on the grounds
of the first amendment I thought the
grounds were completely stupid it's
called the Stanley case
s-t-a-n-l-e-y well that's when the
Supreme Court you know ruled uh uh um
pornography to be legal
uh so the pornography got conflated with
civil libertarian civil liberties in
that era otherwise he had nothing to do
with civil liberties almost all of his
cases have to do with some sort of
abusive women up to and including
murdering them and he didn't have much
care for the civil liberties of
prostitutes who he thought should be uh
taken to court in other John's there's a
lot of information about everything that
you're saying now in an article I think
from 2019 in the New Yorker it's really
yeah I was a car with my Connie Brooke I
had been in touch with her when she was
right She interviewed the main
um party who was suing their shorts at
the time with the whole Epstein Affair
and she said to me she found the witness
credible I didn't know what to make and
as you know that case was finally
decided out of court there was a uh out
of court settlement nobody knows what
happened but you know knowing their
shorts like their shorts is a criminal
lawyer and criminal lawyers what do they
do they hire detectives to dig up dirt
on the other side and her lawyer was a
guy named David Boyce
b-o-e-i-b-o-i-e-s boys and boys is as
big a crook as dershowitz
so you can imagine
each is taking up dirt on the other side
and then they finally decide to settle
out of court
um what to me is the most interesting is
okay I will credit you uh Ben Burgess
and I noticed that on your uh
um
your uh website you have Ben slash
Burgess which leads me to believe that
those are your pronouns and I find that
they are I say very peculiar okay so
now for now
do you have a question for uh for Norman
I just I I wanted to say that you know
Ben you can be excused in the grounds of
Youth but
in the case of Harvard
when he finally left
now they claim he retired I don't
believe that I think that they knew
Harvard knew what was coming down the
pike with the whole Epstein stuff and
they told them to leave us I was going
to say that because he he had
dershowitz's demeanor leading up to
Epstein's let's say for the sake of
argument suicide uh was
um
sort of defensive in a sweaty and
strange way I think it would be fair to
say
um he made a big point of saying that
you know he'd never because was there
was like he'd had a massage but he kept
his underwear on oh yeah let it be known
yes yes
right uh also I'll note in uh
sleep tonight I want to have nice dreams
I think you're gonna have nightmares
after we re-watch this frankly the uh in
the late 90s he also uh editorialized in
favor of uh lowering the age of consent
uh which can conclude from that what you
know
uh what you want but
um but yeah I have uh and I will I will
tell Andy who designed that graphic that
uh he was he was suggesting that uh that
my uh giving sir to answer my pronouns
uh but uh but Matt it's going to say
when you finally left Harvard they had
three consecutive days three consecutive
days of the who's who of Academia
singing his Praises with Martha minnow
the great feminist legal scholar leading
the the uh Orchestra
praising him and the pretenses you know
what's his name uh
oh God
what's
oh God what's the guy who Jeffrey
oh this is ridiculous the guy who was
quite uh pleasuring himself during a
video in the New Yorker a video
conference in the New Yorker you're
talking about yeah I don't remember his
name but I remember that oh yeah Jeffrey
he just came out with a book tubing
tubing
yeah that's right he was caught tubing
um which is close to gooning but just
that's true
uh well tubing is referred you know
reserved for the sophisticated
um and then the events o'tooleman writes
this article when uh dershowitz starts
defending Trump what happened
as if he had been an exemplary civil
libertarian who suddenly underwent this
metamorphosis and turned into a monster
it was always a monster
under the stuff he wrote in Israel
Palestine he was defending by denying
defending by denying that Israel was
engaging in massive torture of
Palestinian detainees there was no
question about that and in the book
beyond Hood school I go through the
cases where he was constantly called as
a witness
by Israel or its Defenders
in order to prove that Israel's record
on these sorts of things was exemplary
but they make it out as if he did this
sudden Vault to face and he had become
evil now
it was always evil you knew he was evil
you didn't care
stop with these fake pretenses
of
sudden a sudden about face with uh
Professor there she was just look at his
cases
look at who he defended and you'll get a
very clear picture of the person and I'm
very impossible deniability at that
point for your own defense
I think that's more about the plausible
deniability of whoever is making the
claim that he became evil yeah
uh uh can I just add to you I just want
to jump in for a second
um on this point uh dershowitz also
got his start uh defending the or sorry
opposing the Vietnam War
um or at least he was critical of it uh
to my knowledge and he also is as
self-identifies as a civil liberties
lawyer
um and he really like takes every
opportunity to slip that into the
conversation especially I mean it
doesn't happen more it doesn't happen as
much in the debate with you but I've
noticed in other
um you know public appearances or
debates uh particularly where the
audience might be liberal or in the
center he always makes sure to include
that very often make sure to include
that he he was opposed to the Vietnam
War and he's a civil liberty when was he
a Paul he does that I think he does that
because uh I think he does that because
he wants the audience to like uh stop
and think about the license that affords
him to argue for whatever uh horrendous
uh uh atrocity that he's about to defend
he also um uh in the years after this
um uh maybe 10 years later uh when the
Snowden leaks came out uh he went around
the country basically defending the
security and surveillance apparatus and
he leaned heavily on his title as a
civil liberties lawyer to do that
um and um
and he then after that uh was the few
years where he went around doing uh TV
talk show tour uh basically auditioning
to be Trump's lawyer and uh the Epstein
stuff happened and um and yeah my own
view was no I can't prove it
I thought he was defending Trump because
he thought he might be convicted on the
Epstein stuff and he wanted Trump to get
him out he would get to get out of jail
free card I thought that was his motive
otherwise it was very unclear why he
would have defended Trump but but
basically just to to piggyback on your
point um I think uh you know one of the
reasons that prompted me to recommend
this debate to Ben is because I think I
was watching some talk show host that
like a podcast or I don't remember
wouldn't say their name anyways but they
said something like uh they had played a
clip of dershowitz saying something
really crazy and they said something
like what happened to this guy you know
you know nothing happened to the guy and
yeah for decades before and decades
since this uh uh decades before and
decades after this debate he's been uh a
pretty disgusting person the whole time
and one other thing I just wanted to say
real quick is uh this goes way back to
something you said earlier about you
were talking about what he'd said about
your mother and he said other pretty
disgusting things about you too and he
also incited I mean there was um
I think a Jewish organization that had
posted flyers in your building calling
on your landlord to evict you is that
accurate yeah I don't think he had
anything to do with that that was well
no not that he had anything to do with
that but I just wanted to make the point
that um people often use charges of
anti-Semitism to like uh Crush like to
silence arguments against Israel or
criticisms of Israel and some of the
very main people who do that have in my
opinion said like pretty gross
anti-semitic things about you and uh so
I just wanted to note that that was from
way earlier in the conversation I
believe he lumped you in with Holocaust
denial as well
he also called Bernie Sanders a
self-hating Jew he's called Norm that
too he called Norm that yeah yeah
um I mean it's also like
that would be uh I I think you know
whatever uh you know whatever other
flaws Norm has I think I think he grew
up in a household would be very
difficult to be a
holocausted
that's been my defense all along I I say
um given my family background
if I were a holocaust and I I would have
to be
certifiedly insane entirely no you've
heard me talk or you've read what I've
written does it sound to you I think I'm
certifiedly insane because that's the
only possible conclusion you can draw
from the fact that uh I'm not that I'm a
holographic denier giving my family
background it's just you know it's so
it's so wild now my friends
growing up they might rightfully accuse
me of being a holocaust or firmer just
to say
you know it was my family or what was
left with my family
but Holocaust denial is like
sort of wild
yeah
write a book about the
instrumentalization of the Holocaust and
deny it at the same time
I think you're a prime candidate for
Moscow
you can't write a book
the the flooring the instrumental
instrumentalization of a holocaust and
say it never happened
by the way he absolutely did do
something along the lines of the I don't
know Vietnam War uh antagonism I had
never heard of that before but in um the
beginning of of the debate that we're
hopefully going to watch soon
he likes to come out and say that he was
against the Israeli land grabs in 1967
on I think he said
article about it did he uh did he go on
TV to say it was bad did he uh yeah who
knows
were these Just Thoughts
he says that he helped write UN
resolution 242. yeah Lord Carrington
you know they used to say about Richard
Nixon how do you know when Richard Nixon
is lying answer whenever he moves his
lips
exactly I think he also called you a
propagandist but he also says in the
interview that he cites in his book you
know some pamphlets from aipac so oh
yeah yeah well that's actually when he's
being accused of uh plagiarizing a quote
from Joan Peters no I took it from
somewhere else no look the same quote is
in the uh APAC
exactly
like get into it too much before it
happens but the same Jewish office in
Israel and wrote the book Yeah my two
sources are Joan Peters and APAC
all right well I hope you enjoy I
haven't watched it in many years but I
have to say some of the lines still make
me laugh I re-watch value today yeah
right my favorite line is
you can book you claimed uh what do you
mean Clinton
uh oh trouble heck I never be able to
get this get out of this before I have a
new lawsuit and I have a lot of lawsuits
on Natalie Portman come on
and I'm gonna end it there because you
have to watch the debate and I have to
do my homework Natalie Portman is an
interesting story what homework are you
doing Norm uh I'm writing stuff in
affirmative action okay
okay
so
um as you know
one of the people thanked in the
acknowledgments of the Case for Israel
gershwitz's quote-unquote book
one of the uh persons is Natalie Portman
but with her maiden name hirschlag
hershlog yes
and there's an interesting story there
which I've always wondered about yeah
now Natalie Portman or herschlug was a
very smart young woman
she attended Harvard she got her degree
in French literature
and
I always wondered as you know or may
know
she herself did an about face on Israel
because she was one of the researchers
for the case of Israel she was a fanatic
and within a short period of time
she became
hypercritical of Israel
to the point
that she was awarded Israel's highest
award
the Israel price
she turned it down
and I've always wondered
whether
that drama that unfolded between myself
and professor dershowitz
and then the subsequent publication of
my book
when I went through the Case for Israel
line by line by line literally
I went through its sentence by sentence
by sentence and showed it was afraid
I always wondered whether that
particular episode since she was one of
a handful of research assistants
whether that episode was in any way
influential
and causing her to do an about face
to the very smart then probably yeah
because that's what I felt she's smart
she probably was curious what is in this
book
and then discovers holy toledo
he lied about everything yeah
so much
she might have written it so we that's
all that is or copied it my personal
favorite line from the entire interview
is when you said
that you'd you'd read uh the Case for
Israel twice and then you corrected
yourself and said actually I've read it
four times or six times because I've
read Joan's books
amazing
of course there was a little high
permanently there I did read John
Peter's Book fourth I read many more
than four times by the way but uh I said
it was only the in the first chapters
which were played your life but you know
for the sake of a joke you're allowed to
exaggerate a little okay so thank you
for the snake in the joke forgive it uh
Norm gonna do your homework I really
appreciate you uh really appreciate you
sharing this much of your time with us
this was fantastic
um I'm a little confused by one thing I
was confused about Ben Burgess with the
slash because I've never heard those
pronouns and I thought I was pretty up
on pronouns but I have never met a Jew
named Jordan especially a woman
that's interesting and Israel actually
yaldin is a very popular name
specifically for women but I made a joke
to Ben earlier and I really regret not
coming on and doing my friend rusher
voice so there would be no confusion
like hello Dr Norman Finkelstein then
you would have just taken but my
grandparents are are from your
neighborhood as well first generation
Americans via uh Russia and Ukraine so
really yes and I did I lived in Israel
for 14 years I haven't even been back in
America for one yet almost so really oh
I know the the nose gets me by
an interesting trajectory yeah I live in
we recall around here a little Odessa by
the sea
so I uh speak to the ukrainians every
day
it's been an interesting transformation
you know at the beginning of the war
a lot of flags
a lot of people in cars with the flags
honking their horns
now
you'll see in the whole of Little Odessa
by the Sea we counted it yesterday there
were just two lonely Flags
and then the Sunday night
everybody's on the boardwalk they're
dancing they're making music
but it was very noticeable to me
no one was collecting money for Ukraine
that's interesting even though the
neighborhood now is about 80 percent
Ukrainian
a special draft age ukrainians who came
over in the last year well the the uh
the Jewish side of my family uh came
over from Ukraine and uh
you know before I knew that Russia was
actually going to invade but it seemed
like it might be you know it might not
actually happen the joke I often told
that I now feel a little bit bad about
giving all the bloodshedding last year
is uh you know my main my main position
on the situation in the Ukraine is that
if they wanted me to leave out the
definite article they should have been
nicer with my family but uh
uh the different article what if they
wanted me to leave out the definite
article they should have been nicer to
my family
but
it's a subtle joke you really
paid for your usual audience
until people started to correct me I
didn't even know it okay
