why study behavioral economics and in
particular
how can behavioral economics help us
overcome some of the biggest problems
that the world faces
today and just just to remind you
behavioral economics is a field of study
of economics
that relaxes the assumption of
rationality
so it's going to build people's
irrationalities
into our economic models and even though
we collect
data and behavioral economics and do
experiments it is often with the
purposes of
improving our theoretical models so
why do we need a theoretical model in
the first place and just to remind you
of this
theoretical models allow us to simulate
the counterfactual
compare policies and how they might play
out in the future so theoretical models
allow us to make predictions
theoretical models speak well with data
so they allow us to
construct a worldview in the model and
test it
using data and contextualize different
pieces of data in the context of that
model so theoretical models
are super powerful in which case we want
theoretical models
that accurately portray what's actually
going on in the human heart
now i will add an asterisk there you can
have models that
do not accurately portray what's going
on but still
are good at prediction and i might do
another video on that
i just want to acknowledge that but it's
certainly reasonable to assume that if
you build more accurate
portrayals into your models those models
could get
better they could predict things more
accurately they could just do a better
job of the things that models do
but i would like to talk about why
behavioral economics is
especially important in a world of big
data
and in a world where social media and
different platforms online are beginning
to manipulate human behavior
in a meaningful way this era is the era
where we most
need behavioral economics compared to
the past
and that's what i'm going to try to
explain so a number of people have begun
to notice
that social media is having a negative
impact on people's mental health
now just because we're being manipulated
does not mean
that there's an evil manipulator behind
the technologies it's
possible to have a technology that
ends up manipulating people in a
semi-evil way
with no evil actors so let me explain
that
i'll call this evolutionary manipulation
i think that's a
reasonable way of describing it and it's
basically just where
someone gives the algorithm a goal and
maybe the goal is profit maximization
maybe the goal is maximizing time spent
on the platform
but it could also be actually a good
goal like it could be
maximize the number of meaningful
connections
that people make on the platform it
could be any number of things
and the algorithm goes out and
basically does guess and check over
different techniques that might
maximize this goal and over time as it
observes behavior it sort of learns and
gets better at this
and if it's going for the one goal then
there could be
all kinds of negative consequences even
if that one goal is
a good thing like human connection and
oftentimes the people who are setting up
the algorithm to begin with or the
people who own the platform
have no idea what mechanism is
underneath these algorithms and the
algorithms of course they're not
conscious so they don't know that either
so often times the way these algorithms
work are really black boxes
we don't know what parts of the human
psyche are they
tapping into to achieve their goal and
if we as humans cannot see inside the
black box of the algorithm and what it's
doing
to achieve its goals then we
can't apply ethics and this is where
behavioral economics comes into play
behavioral economics gives us a set of
tools
for setting up a framework for what
might be going on
underneath the guess and check process
of the algorithm
so behavioral economics can provide a
hypothesis
we can test that against what's going on
with the algorithm or against
other sets of data so we need
policymakers and this is both
policymakers
in the government and also just
policymakers inside these private
companies that are developing these
platforms
we need policymakers to regulate the
algorithms
with behavioral economics we can look at
what's going on with an algorithm
and say oh wait a second this algorithm
seems to be tapping into some instinct
related to loss aversion
and the algorithm additionally has
figured out
that loss aversion or loss version
coefficient is higher
immediately after a disappointment so
the algorithm
seems to be pairing disappointment
related news
with threat related news or fear related
news to sort of get that
click out of us and
if we have a framework a mathematical
framework for measuring the loss
diversion coefficient
we can measure when does it go up when
does it go down
and when is it scary
going back and forth between our models
of actually what's going on that
might be exploited by these algorithms
that have no idea they're doing that
and once we know that once we have that
framework
we can figure out what limits we need to
put
on these technologies on these
algorithms we can say okay the algorithm
is doing some great things
social media brings a lot of good into
the world but it's also tapping into the
vulnerabilities of people
and so we need to tell tell these
algorithms
you can't mix disappointment and threat
you can't mix those because it's too
manipulative
that's just an example and i like some
of the things that jaren lenier has said
about this
he's pointed out that the positive parts
of the human experience
love trust relationship building
generosity community those things
are slow those are slow building over
time
they're not reactive and strong whereas
the negative parts of the human soul
are reactive so if your algorithms are
rewarding
immediate reactions they're going to
emphasize the negative
they're going to emphasize the
experiences
where we're in a state of threat and
that's likely
to increase mental health problems now
if we think about that paradox and we
think about
retooling our algorithms so that they
point us more toward the positive we
have some problems actually
in fact there's a reason why the
immediate reaction
is used so much in these platforms it's
because
if you have these algorithms that need a
closely tied
match time match that is between cause
and effect
to know that this this cause and effect
actually go together
these evolutionary models want to know
if i do this
it will create this response in people
and we're going to use that in our
platform
now we could turn around the algorithms
and say okay we
we want to build algorithms that
actually build
relationships that build trust that
they'll love that build these things
that are
that are positive experiences for humans
if those have a longer time span though
it's going to be
harder to build the algorithms because
the longer the time span
the more unsure the algorithm is about
the cause and effect connection if you
have three days a lot of things happen
in those three days
how do you know if it's if it's what
happened on the platform as opposed to
everything else that happened and so
it's going to be
harder for our algorithms to work if
they're
set toward enhancing the human
experience by tapping into the positive
parts
of the human psyche and what that means
is we need
more sound theoretical models to be
working with the algorithms
if we're going to set up a system that
has better
responses so this is just a case
for behavioral economics as one of the
important features if we're going to
retool
social media and other platforms online
so that they don't manipulate us in as
negative a away so that they actually
manipulate us toward the positive
