3 key principles for great conversation | Emily Chamlee-Wright

## Transcript:
- Think about the last
conversation you had
where you thought,
"Golly, that was such a great
conversation, you know?"
What did it feel like?
Why did it seem like a
really great conversation?
And the chances are good
that it was a kind of conversation
that left you feeling smarter.
It was the kind of conversation
where you felt like you
discovered something new,
that it left you deeply
curious about something else.
It might have been a conversation
that challenged you in all the right ways.
You know, that's a truly
great conversation.
It's one where we
genuinely learn something
or we come to a deeper understanding
about why someone else
holds a particular point of view, right?
That deeper understanding
and that learning
is what we're after with
great conversations.
And so, one of the things I'm
interested in is, you know,
what are the design principles
of a great conversation?
What are the essential elements
that make a conversation
truly a great conversation?
And humility would be one
basic design principle
that we should all start from.
Now, with humility,
I don't just mean deference
to expertise, right?
That, "You are so much
smarter at that thing,
so I'm gonna have humility
with respect to you
on that thing because you
know more about it than I do."
Now, maybe that's true, right?
But that's not the kind of
humility I'm talking about,
because that's the sort of humility
that could come to an end, right?
I could learn as much about
that particular topic.
And therefore, with that kind of thinking,
I would say I can set aside my humility.
The kind of humility I'm talking about
is the kind that you can't set aside,
'cause the world is an
incredibly complicated place.
None of us can ever have
the full lock on truth.
We can only see the world from
a particular vantage point.
And that means that our knowledge
is going to have special insight
because of our vantage point,
but it's also gonna be limited
because of our vantage point.
And so that sort of like limited knowledge
that we can have about the world
means that we must enter
into any conversation
with a deep sense of humility
because I need you to help me
fill in my knowledge gaps, right?
And you need me.
And that's the cool
thing about conversation
is that it is mutual in the sense
that both of us look at the same world
from different vantage points.
And that means that we each
have something to offer the other.
And that's true whether one person
is the expert or not, right?
We have the opportunity
to gain in our knowledge,
to learn from anyone.
With this way of thinking about humility,
anyone can be your teacher,
whether it's your professor
or whether it's an elementary
school student, right,
who's lived on the planet
in different circumstances
than you've lived on the planet, right?
That elementary school student
can teach you something
that you can only get
by talking with them-
that's that deeper level of humility.
Some of the other key design elements
of a great conversation
would be, for example,
critical thinking and
sympathetic listening.
Now, there's a lot that gets
said about critical thinking.
It's that ability and eagerness
to identify gaps in logic
or shortfalls in
evidence-based argumentation.
It is the cornerstone of what it means
to have a liberal education,
is to engage in that kind
of critical thinking.
Now, less often discussed
and surely less often celebrated,
is what I call 'sympathetic listening.'
And I use the word sympathetic
in the way that Adam Smith
used the word sympathetic,
which is, you know: "Am
I really understanding
from that other person's point of view?"
That commitment to
understanding the argument
from the other person's perspective.
Now, what sympathy in this case means
is not that I feel what they feel,
it's that I'm willing to set aside,
even if it's just temporarily,
that hunt for the slightest
misstep in logic or reasoning;
setting that aside for a moment
so that I can listen really carefully
to what my conversation partner is saying,
so I can understand,
from their perspective,
what their intellectual project is,
or why it is that they are looking
at the same world I'm looking at,
but coming to a very,
very different conclusion.
I should assume that that person
that I'm having that conversation with
is intelligent and is exercising reason,
so when I enter into
the conversational space
with that good faith that
they're exercising reason,
then what that means
is that I need to set aside for a moment,
my hunt for the slightest
misstep in logic,
so that I can really hear why
it is that this smart person
came to a different
conclusion than I came to.
