![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oysJD4v2Bt4)

Transcript:
(00:01) hi there my work schedule has changed once again so the video I originally planned on will have to wait how about another response SL analysis sort of thing I threw the question to my patreon supporters and they decided on this this will be a reaction to jubilees video titled can socialists and capitalists find Middle Ground aside from the nonsensical title I have an issue right off the bat unless you own capital in some regard you aren't a capitalist you might follow a political ideology that believes in the supremacy of capital but
(00:33) that doesn't make you a member of the capitalist class all it makes you in fact is a boot licker really you'll quickly see that this conversation is actually really poor and I personally think this is better used as an example of how not to talk to liberals than anything else regardless let's take a look we actually aren't looking for a middle ground with capitalism we're not looking for the lighter gentler oppression exploitation racism we are seeking Revolution I'm glad someone already has some sense he's right there
(01:04) is no middle ground between socialism and capitalism any compromise with capitalism only benefits capitalism socialists in essence demand the dismantling of  capitalism both definitions are all right there could be further explanation but that goes for everything really my name is Liberty I'm studying psychology at UCLA I'm 20 years old I'm Sean I'm 24 years old and I'm in the Socialist Party my name is Mimi uh 2016 I was the Socialist party's presidential candidate uh I'm Shay and I'm with the
(01:48) Socialist Party and I'm 28 my name is Jack I'm 19 I go to Community College my name's Richard 19 I go to Cal State Long Beach as a chemistry major with a music music minor notice how there are no capitalists there only those that for whatever reason consider capitalism the system predicated on infinite growth on a finite Planet a superior alternative humans are inherently selfish selfishness is sort of one word for it but looking out for yourself your own Survival and your own gain um and of course that includes the gain of those
(02:27) you love is one of the main motivators of people a really good way that we could figure out human nature is by comparing it to animal nature and stuff like that and you see you know animals doing whatever they can to survive it's just culture that has changed us but I believe at its core that yes humans just like any other animal are I sish despite the fact that not only civilization but practically most higherorder animals have predicated their existence on extensive cooperation Humanity being foremost the question itself is flawed
(02:59) your shaped by your material conditions in one instance you can be extremely selfish in others you can be quite selfless the seed for every consideration is within a human being what determines your attitude fundamentally is the condition you find yourself in those that own Capital naturally reject a system that advocates for the collective ownership of it those that own no Capital naturally are drawn to that very system now the question of people who are still for capitalism despite owning no Capital leads into a
(03:29) conversation of hegemony and other lovely gr chain Concepts but that can wait for another day capitalism a system built upon personal gain at the expense of others naturally en cultures a sort of selfishness I think it isn't controversial to say that in a finite World in an increasingly precarious situation it's better to advocate for Mutual cooperation and gain rather than a strict me me me attitude at the expense of others society and the environment I mean I think even if you look at if you spend any time in a
(03:58) social democracy you know let's say you go to Norway and you spend time there where the people see um the collective good uh as tied into their own personal well-being you know I think we have so many examples like that society's working collectively toward a a greater good the thing about the Nordic countries in my opinion is well since they're very very ethnically homogeneous they all have very very similar culture I knew this had happen you shouldn't be bringing a conversation about socialism
(04:30) to the Scandinavian social democracies firstly because they aren't socialist secondly because their existence is a relic of geopolitical jockeying against the Soviet Union and non-revolutionary political trends of the second International Al and thirdly because social democracy is a broken system capitalists will always and I mean always defund repeal replace and Destroy any and every public institution if it means profit from Greece to Britain and everywhere else public program are moved back and defunded because reforms do not
(05:04) work Luxembourg solved this question over a century ago in her Landmark work reform or revolution I recommend you check it out if you haven't already as a second point though does the ethnically homogeneous line strike anyone else's strangely racist firstly a lot of immigrants exist in those countries first and second generation too unlike in the US where a large percentage of immigrants are multigenerational and assimilated it almost seems like a learned talking point of a water down dog whistle about blacks and SP being
(05:30) too rowdy to share or something it's unsavory I think competition brings out the best in people especially when you know we're competing for something like let's try to com create this compound that could help you know the masses in some kind of Health relation form you have all these research Labs trying to figure out what's the most efficient way to figure out this process what's the most efficient way to do do this I think we need more that sort of sense of competition especially in the sciences
(06:04) and whatnot this isn't the point against socialism though within the USSR for example they held competitions for all sorts of things from tractors to tank designs numerous design bureaus and Labs all competed to develop the best version of what they were tasked with that's why the first man in space was Soviet from a country that just three decades before was the most backward in Europe that turned itself into the second largest economic scientific and Military superpower in the face of Nazi destruction multilateral Invasion
(06:32) constant sabotage diplomatic isolation and international vilification also capitalism's brand of competition is just that a brand competition isn't done for things that will solely benefit it's done for things that will yield profit first that's why the vast majority of the amenities we enjoy in our modern existence emerged out of public tax-funded military and government research and not private labs and offices I've said it before and I'll say it again bilateral development of the same exact technology isn't wasteful
(07:01) you think read the entrepreneurial state by Mariana mikato you know we frequently hear about the evils of monopolies it's because you know with when you control an entire Market why even bother being better at anything you've got no competition you've got nothing to strive for and and no one can choose anything else in competition the end goal is of course a winner that's what people always seem to forget you can't hate monopolies when the very system you support has an inbuilt tendency to
(07:31) create massive monopolies try this for yourself think of any industry literally anything look at how many producers that commodity existed in say the 1950s or the 1970s and compare it to now nine times out of 10 it's a lot fewer with the largest of which having bought out quite a few of the smaller ones even in countries that have laws against that sort of thing but that's interfering in the market T dis you'll have two or three companies that decide to conveniently not compete with each other through either back room deals or even
(08:00) flagrant public declaration phone contract companies Pharmaceuticals industrial producers of military equipment the media the list goes on and on today everyone has the opportunity for Success all right if we're talking about the United States and we're talking about financial success then yes I would believe so if we're talking about the world it doesn't necessarily have to mean Financial well-being or like stability I think that it really just means how you're happy and how you're okay with yourself and you know you make
(08:35) a goal and you pursue your goal and if you fail or aeve that's exactly what I was thinking I find that there are so many resources out there that you can enact on it's just there's some people who just don't do anything about it oh Lord the median personal income in the United States is around $33,000 the median household income is around $64,000 given standard living costs housing Insurance education and dozens of other costs it's a miracle people manage to save anything at all in reality they don't save much many
(09:06) Americans can't afford a $500 emergency let alone a bank loan for several tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to start a business when it comes to entrepreneurs all you hear them talk about is hard work and pulling one up by their bootstraps they say this because the reality is far less glamorous the only common denominator between the musks and bezos's the trumps and Gates is generational wealth and convenient political and business connections simple as let me ask you how many people watching this have parents that can
(09:36) spare half a million dollars to invest in your fledging company that based on mainstream predictions will most likely fail not many that's surprising cuz basis parents good how about asking your dad for some of that apari Emerald mind wealth oh you don't have any surprising cuz musk does how about the infamous small loan of a million dollar H you know where I'm going with this this isn't even beginning a conversation on people worldwide who barely have a roof over their head let alone an education
(10:04) opportunities for deriving investment develop infrastructure to facilitate business and hundreds of other considerations my my first thought here with this question is you got to be  kidding me uh you know um so many people in this country who solely because they exist uh they're under threat whether it's through you know the police they're just trying to survive uh this is doing a bad job I don't know if it isn't just cut that way but he's coming off too aggressive don't take it
(10:35) so personally man these people don't know any better they're raised in the capitalist Zeitgeist that has demonized the lightest whiff of socialism since grade school it'll take a minute tedious conversations on human nature and M competition are boring but very necessary sharpen your tools read Theory and learn to present your arguments clearly quickly and convincingly there are no shortcuts sadly so everyone's very different again everyone has different opportunities to what they can even consider success in in the US
(11:03) though there are a lot of opportunities for most people though of course you can't s and there are always those who are extremely unfortunate and should be helped this Dynamic is strange these are questions of Statistics not opinions I'm sure every one of us has sat in a restaurant before Starbucks those people work their asses off any of these low income jobs are not easy and they they work for pennies if something goes wrong with their car they're done you know if they have a health problem they're done
(11:36) you're you're talking about financial success though success is extremely relative and can be defined in many different ways in a capitalist society that isn't financial success the most important thing oh I like him though where were you hunting this guy no I I've worked in the food industry for a number of years and I can not say that any one of my companions was ever happy to be doing that and if they're going on top of that you know soing full and on top of that they're going to school
(12:05) and paying school I would consider that successful if you can go to school and you can maintain your GPA and you can also be working a part-time job and somehow affording your school yeah you're doing well in life what just what do I really need to explain why that thought is all sorts of  up no dude working a grueling 40-hour job on top of full-time School while drowning in debt isn't doing well in life he seems to value personal responsibility as an important factor in life hey I do too that doesn't lend well
(12:33) to supporting capitalism though historically capitalists have tried every which way to avoid it actually either by dodging taxes dodging prison sentences or Environmental Protection and workers rights laws they always find a way the capitalist side remember none are actually capitalists funnily enough seem confused more than anything else is this how the conversation goes in the US usually Society should help the underprivileged that sort of saying if he give a man of fish Etc holds true um and also who should do the helping and how was very
(13:15) important not all acts of service are equally beneficial I I would agree to that I myself you know I'm sorry to use a personal an anecdote here but I've personally dealt with the fact that oh giving someone this much Aid they become they become lazy my father is an alcoholic so we since due to an injury in his leg he gets SSI and what's what ends up happening is he receives enough SSI to the point where he's not he's not motivated to do anything else Beyond just going home drinking a beer or
(13:52) something like that and I think yes people should help people especially if they're under under privilege or they need the resources to push them put to what end that's that's the fine line but your personal anecdote only only covers the small demographic of the of the alcoholic most of the people that that every example you guys have brought up has been specifically about people who are particularly poor when most of the country is middle lower middle class and up that's actually that's not a fact but
(14:24) that that you would focus on this in a in a city one that gives more than half of its budget to the police in a country uh that just passed a military Bill a spending Bill uh that's almost $1 trillion that money goes to defense contractors the government paying for things is not capitalism all right a lot to unpack first yes a personal anecdote doesn't cover the whole Spectrum a lot of people simply feel alienated and that's a big issue mental illness has been on a city rise and that isn't a
(14:56) coincidence not only this but the welfare leads to laziness line has been disproven time and time again as for the woman's claim that most of the US is middle class well another bit of hegemonic nonsense middle class mythology is just that mythology the American middle class is disappearing fast that is if you believe it ever really existed for the vast majority of Hispanics blacks Natives and other minorities it never did real incomes have been stagnant even for white middleclass families and haven't gone up
(15:24) since the late '70s finally her point about the government paying for things isn't capitalism hm I wonder if she'd extend that to all the tax subsidies companies like Tesla and Amazon Etc get pack it up boys we've reached communism look it isn't socialism either but fundamentally the state is a mechanism of class rule under capitalism we live under a dictatorship of the Bourgeois and the military and police are but violent arms of the capital state to enforce its will and what will yield it profits both at home
(15:52) and abroad police exists to protect Capital at home and the military exists to protect and even secure Capital abroad but we're in a capitalist system uh uh where the government pays huge amounts of money for things you're talking yeah I'm not in favor of those things how about instead of spending the money on the military how about putting those back into basic needs Healthcare education housing I agree the government taking our taxpayer dollars and funneling it into they're paying for things that the military explicitly says
(16:21) that they don't need that's not capitalism is about prices and transparency and and choices when the government takes our money capitalism working that is not that might be what you call capitalism but when I come here saying I'm a capitalist I'm not saying I'm in favor of that well you're just wrong then first of all you're not a capitalist unless you own Capital if you don't you're just advocating for a system that does you no good secondly it's an inbuilt function of modern capitalism monopolies
(16:52) imperialism through force or the loan the violent suppression of workers movements and so much more is the natural mode that capitalism in its modern form operates the other guy she's talking with is a little too hot-headed and is arguing at a slightly higher level in my opinion he needs to calm down and explain what he's saying clearly I'm sure you could have a good discussion with him with people more familiar with these conversations but a bunch of college students with no formal study of theory need a little more
(17:16) patience and a lot more care I don't think he was a good pick in my opinion profit and ethics are opposing motives so I think it's core to profit uh you have to exploit uh and again there is nothing ethical about exploitation yeah I mean I can't think I I'm really having trouble thinking of a situation where uh someone could profit off of something without exploitation being in the mix and I just I'm running out of ideas if you're running a business and you know you're you're the
(17:50) one up top you would obviously walk away with more money if you pay your employees a little bit less I think that profit and ethics can be intertwined when seen with the corporate social responsibility module when they treat their employees better they give them more benefits they raise their wages and in turn it motivates the workers to work harder see this is what happens when people don't re Theory you can't have social responsibility under capitalism if you do you'll be outcompeted in the market those who are
(18:27) most ruthless who suppress weight the most who extend the workday the longest who find cheaper sources of materials and faster methods of production Dam to be the toll on the environment and the workers those are the ones that win that's why jobs are shipped overseas that's why for example car companies will lie about the emissions of their cars also again the guy is operating a high level of discourse to many exploitation means the colloquial term the action or fact of treating someone unfairly in order to benefit from their
(18:54) work the Marxist definition on the other hand is the extraction of surplus value from workers a fundamental difference and one that requires explaining which he doesn't do maybe he did but it was cut out who knows but again when discussing with people yourselves take more time explain everything and be empathetic and kind arrogance butting heads and frivolously throwing out terms won't get too far treating your employees better than  is not necessarily ethical like raising the quality does not mean that you've raised it to a
(19:25) sufficient standard of of treatment cuz if you're paying someone less than a living wage that is unethical a solid Point all I'm saying is it is to some degree more ethical and can be seen as more ethical to be beating competition by raising the wages of your employees and giving them better benefits you don't beat competition that way you lose out to it that way also one must be paid slightly less than they are making in worth for a company for it to be worth it to hire them at all you see they fundamentally understand the basics
(20:01) you just need to place the framework at this point an excellent segue can be made to discussions of capitalisms intrinsic faults move away from moralist arguments and discuss things that are Universal the falling rate to profit capitalism's inherent crises of over production resulting in boom and bus cycles and the active destruction of commodities for Recovery how the very system is predicated on infinite growth on a planet with finite resources on and on talk about the irrationality of it all if you can't pay your employee the
(20:28) minimum amount of money that they need in order to live uh you have no business being in business um and I think also there's a tendency from the conservative side to skew away from sort of objective fact I mentioned the MIT living wage calculator right yes um that's a scientific model that 2925 so as a company if you can't afford to pay your employee a living wage that's just the minimum that they need in order to live right uh get the  out of business see is already turned or off from whatever sense he could be
(21:01) making no matter how well of an argument you make from this point on by personal insult she probably wouldn't internalize it or engage with it in good faith he turned an opportunity for radicalization into a who's right competition please keep the disheveled hot-headed socialist stereotype a stereotype there's only room for one jij in this world why are we even talking to you when you have all the facts and we don't know anything my point exactly he  up please use this as a learning experience getting
(21:27) argumentative won't get any one anywhere turn down the Zeal those aren't your enemies and this isn't how you build class solidarity I don't know it's hardly worth my time well we would sure it's hard to really lean towards one side or the other if everyone is just sort of stating all these coherent biases and not accepting any sort of thing from any other particular side which is why I'm sort of just I'm trying to understand your side and I'm trying to grasp that's really my side of it and again going
(22:01) back to sort of that Mutual understanding of what can we do next nothing this isn't a middle ground discussion it's either we sacrifice the Earth to Relentless over production or we coherently plan production in line with environmental standards it's either we further destroy workers movements and forcefully underpay people for further profits or we develop an Economy based on Mutual benefit for all in the Spheres of Education Healthcare social well-being women's rights on and on capitalism outlived its usefulness over
(22:29) a century ago and now has permanently overstayed its welcome this is no longer a discussion of political Choice it is now as Luxembourg said all those years ago Socialism or barbarism Humanity or Extinction that sort of mutual understanding needs to be there if if we're going to ever continue to see what's best for for the US I think one reason why you know you often see like folks on the left the Socialist Communist anarchists are Etc uh there're so passionate and there is anger you know um seeing uh the
(23:04) suffering and the oppression and the exploitation racism Etc you sort of feel this urgency you know like we're constantly under sort of this self-criticism and self-reflection about like well how do you package what can be complex ideas into ways that are very palatable and I think that's me every hour and I think like if there's a failure on the left that would be one of them I don't understand how he can be so self-aware and not at the same time I understand his anger I'm a recipient of
(23:35) imperialism myself both military and through the IMF loan but at the same time we need to know how to properly discuss with people be smart have good points and pick your battles some people you can be unrelenting with the propagandists and shamans of the system if you see Dennis Prager on the street go all out why not but when it comes to Everyday People learn to modulate and discuss in the best manner You know despite that we definitely disagree on pretty much everything it's good to know the the real Common Ground here is we as
(24:06) like Millennials and gen Z and stuff we're actually we're actually like talking about this like whether we were able to convince the other side of anything or not at least we give a  about it you know this is stuff that we need to talk about this is stuff that we need to be aware of especially giving our leaders so yeah this guy was my favorite excellent work really you don't convince people in one conversation but in discussions with educated arguments presented with empathy really do win
(24:31) people over
