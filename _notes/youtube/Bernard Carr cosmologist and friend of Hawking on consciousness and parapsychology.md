Transcript:
(00:00) The normal view is that the material world is  real; we're localized in three-dimensional space,   we're looking around, we can reconcile how we see  the world. The trouble is that's wrong because   Einstein told us that, actually, reality is  really four-dimensional.
(00:17) We don't notice it   because you only notice it if you're moving near  the speed of light or in a strong gravitational   field. That's standard physics. What I'm saying  is that, actually, the reality is more than   four-dimensional: there are higher dimensions  and these higher dimensions have to do with   mind. It's Mind with the capital 'M' as distinct  from my individual mind with the little 'm'.
(00:39) This   has the important implication that the brain is a  filter rather than a generator of consciousness.   And that is a view, which, I imagine, 90% of  neuroscientists at least wouldn't accept. But   I think there is evidence... I think there is  evidence for the filter theory. "I don't know...  
(00:56) but they constructed this three-dimensional  space inside their five-dimensional reality.   You've seen the time is represented here as  a physical dimension. The physical world, the   material world is like a four-dimensional slice:  it's called a brane - b r a n e. And it's in this   higher dimensional bulk - that's just the term  they use - and in what's called brane cosmology,   w
(01:24) hich goes a bit beyond that. That says how...  because cosmology is the large-scale structure   of the universe. This sheet, this brane actually  moves through the bulk. If the world is really   say five-dimensional, as like the bulk, and  we're only on a slice of this five-dimensional   space - what else is there in the rest of the  space of the bulk? Well, the only thing I'm aware   of is my mental world: my dreams, my memories,  my visualizations, my out-of-body experiences,   my near-death experiences.
(01:54) So, to me, it's very  natural to try and say that these experiences can   be described in terms of this higher-dimensional  space. I mean there's ESP (ed. extrasensory   perception), where one mind is communicating  with another mind. There is clairvoyance - when   the mind is perceiving what is in the physical  world. There is precognition - when the mind is   perceiving what's in the future.
(02:17) But the key  point about all these phenomena is that they   are not explained by conventional physics. As a  physicist, I want to know whether physics can be   expanded to accommodate these phenomena. Well, you  have all these physicists say, and sometimes my   friends will say: "Psi (Ed.
(02:34) psychic phenomena)  can't be real because it's incompatible with   the laws of physics. I don't even need to look at  the data because I know it can't be true." To me,   that's a terrible attitude but it's an attitude  some people say: "I don't need to look at the   data because I know it can't be true.
(02:52) " In other  words, they refuse to look through the telescope;   going back to Galileo where people wouldn't look  through the telescope. We don't have a final   theory of physics. We know the quantum theory -  which works so well in the microscopic domain,   and relativity theory - which works in the  macroscopic domain. They work beautifully in   their own domains but we know those theories are  not compatible.
(03:13) The final theory of physics has   to go beyond relativity and quantum theory, and  we don't know what that final theory is. That's   what everyone is looking for: the final theory  of physics, which some people are looking for.   We cannot possibly say that the final theory  of physics is not going to allow consciousness   because we don't know what that theory of physics  is.
(03:34) And my own view - and I'm echoing what Roger   Penrose says here - my own view is that the final  theory of physics will make some reference to   Consciousness and Mind. Welcome to the Essentia  Foundation Channel. Thank you for watching. Today   we'll be talking to Professor Bernard Carr.  He's a professor of mathematics and astronomy   with a personal interest in parapsychology and  we will be asking him the following questions:   Can there be a theory that encompasses  everything that happens in the universe? What is   consciousness? What role can science play in the  study of parapsychological phenomena? So, Bernard,  
(04:15) welcome! Thank you! Thank you for taking the time  to talk to us about these topics. And I wanted to   start by asking you a bit more personal question.  So, for more than 50 years you were involved in   the activities of the Society for Psychical  Research in the UK, and we should add here   that this Society was founded in 1882. Indeed.
(04:46)   Yes, and its members included eminent scientists,   Nobel Prize winners, and even Britain's Prime  Minister right? That's correct? Yes, Balfour.   And you took various roles within the Society as  an education officer and chairman of the Research   Activities Committee. And later on, you became  president of the Society. So my question is how   and why you as a scientist, become involved with  parapsychology in the first place? It goes back to   my school days. I was at a boarding school called  Harrow and on one occasion I misbehaved. And as a  
(05:21) punishment, I was confined to my room, which meant  that I wasn't allowed to go anywhere except for   lessons. And having nothing else to do I read some  books. I read three books and those three books   really determined the course of my life.
(05:41) Now,  the first book was called The ABC of Relativity,   which was about relativity theory. It was written  by Bertrand Russell. And that got me fascinated in   physics. The second book was called An Experiment  with Time by J. W. Dunne. And in that book,   he recorded his various precognitive dreams  and his theory to account for them. And that   got me interested in psychical research because  premonition is one of the phenomena studied by   psychical research. The third book was - it was  called The Third Eye by Lobsang Rampa.
(06:15) And he   was allegedly a Tibetan Lama who'd taken over the  body of a Cornish fisherman. Well, to be honest,   it probably wasn't true but nevertheless it was  fascinating because he gave insights into some   of the ideas of Tibetan Buddhism and some of the  psychic phenomena associated with that.
(06:39) And that   got me interested in religious studies. So really  these three books, which I read in one week, got   me interested in science, in psychical research,  and in religion. And in some sense psychical   research, I see as a bridge between science and  religion, between science and mystical experiences   if you like. Because it's trying to analyze  phenomena in a scientific way.
(07:05) But it's also   analyzing phenomena which is sometimes thought  of as mystical. So that's how I got interested   in psychical research but as one of three areas.  And throughout my life, I always tried to relate   those three areas. But as regards psychical  research, I think it was shortly after that   that I did my first experiment at school and this  was a boarding school.
(07:30) And the experiment was:   I had a group of people to record their dreams  over a one-week period. So I had about 100 boys   recording their dreams and the idea was simply to  see whether they had shared dreams. So A dreamt of   B and B dreamt of A in the same circumstances. Or  A dreamt of C and B dreamt of C.
(07:51) So the idea was   to show that there was a link, a telepathic link  if you like when people dream. So, to be honest   it wasn't such a good experiment because people  could cheat, they could collude. But nevertheless,   it was the first experiment I did and at the time  I reported that it got very significant results.  
(08:11) And I wouldn't be so confident today but at the  time I was very excited about it. Shortly after   that when I was still at school I got interested  in out-of-body experiences. There was a famous   book on out-of-body experiences and I started  practicing that and, to be honest, I did start   having out-of-body experiences.
(08:36) But I found it  rather frightening, so I stopped doing that for   a while. Then I went to Cambridge University as  an undergraduate and I immediately joined three   societies: I joined the Astronomical Society -  the scientific side, the Society for Psychical   Research, and the Buddhist Society. And then I  started meditating... things like that. And really   ever since then, those have been my three areas of  activity in life.
(09:05) But when I was an undergraduate   I was actually spending more time on psychical  research than I was on studying mathematics,   although I was officially a mathematics student.  And we did lots of experiments. One of the first   experiments I did was to try and weigh the soul.  There have been reports that when people die   their weight goes down by a few ounces.
(09:33) Now, I  think the evidence for that is not very good,   but nevertheless, I read that. And because I  was interested in out-of-body experiences I   was thinking: "Right... if it's true when I have  a dream that my soul leaves my body and it moves   around, then that means my body weight should go  down by a few ounces when I'm dreaming.
(09:51) And then   when I come back again, it will go up by a few  ounces." So, I did a simple experiment in Adam   Brooks Hospital, in which I basically weighed  people when they fell asleep to see if their   weight went down when they fell asleep and went  up again when they woke up. And if that was the   case it would be evidence if you like for the  soul or the astral body or whatever you want   to call it.
(10:20) And it wasn't a really good experiment  because, I mean, I made up this apparatus to weigh   and it was made of elastic bands. It wasn't  a very good apparatus. But you could do it in   principle but you'd have to spend 10,000 pounds on  a sophisticated weighing machine. However many of   my friends remember me as the person who weighed  their souls, and I did at the time claim to detect   the effect actually.
(10:46) Again, in retrospect, I  don't think it was such a good experiment because   I don't think the technology was good enough  for the weighing mechanism. And then through   the Society - the Cambridge University Society of  Psychical Research - we did many experiments. And   I won't describe them, it would take long. But  these were all basically experiments to look for   evidence of telepathy for example - mind-to-mind  communication, and evidence for psychokinesis -   mind over matter. But besides doing experiments we  would also go on regular ghost hunts for example.  
(11:21) The president of the Cambridge Society was a  friend of mine called Tony Cornell. He was like my   mentor in psychical research and he became a good  friend. And he was the leading ghost hunter in   this country, by this country meaning England. And  he died some years ago.
(11:41) But he used to take us out   to haunts and we would visit mediums and things  like that. So, psychical research then involves   both experimental studies but also what we call  spontaneous investigations, where we're studying   psychical phenomena as they occur in real life.
(12:00) It  might be a ghost or it might be visiting a medium,   who is giving you information apparently coming  from someone who's died. So, really after that,   then in my professional career - there were no  jobs in parapsychology. So, in my professional   career, I became a physicist, I became a  cosmologist and I did my PhD with Stephen Hawking,   which of course got me off to a good start.
(12:25) He  wasn't so famous in those days but he was known to   be a very brilliant physicist. And so that started  my career as a cosmologist. And of course that's   taken most of my time but I've always continued  my interest in psychical research and indeed   in spiritual experience.
(12:46) And as I said, I joined  the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) in 1972,   just over 50 years ago. And I've had various  roles within the SPR, which you described in your   introduction, and indeed I was very honored to  serve as president for a period I think from 2000   to 2005. So, that's a rather long answer to your  question.
(13:08) I will only say in the last 50 years I   have continued my interest in psychical research.  But really my main interest in the last 50 years   has been to develop a theory of Psi, but we may  come on to that in a later question. But so,   what I hear you're saying is that for you  psychical and scientific were intertwined,   if not the same interest, right? You can't really  separate, in your case, interest in psychical   research and in science as such.
(13:43) Correct? I  had a personal interest in psychical research   and science, so I naturally tried to link them.  But the whole point about psychical research is   that it does aspire to be a science. Because when  the society was founded in 1882, it was founded   with the intention of studying in a scientific  manner those phenomena, which seem to involve   anomalous cognition or influence on the world,  which can't be explained in conventional terms.  
(14:12) But the whole point was to use the methodology  of science. And many of the founders and the   eminent people in the early days were physicists  even. And so that's important. On the other hand,   you have to bear in mind that mainstream science  is still very skeptical about psychical phenomena;   not many of my physics colleagues even believe in  Psi.
(14:38) That doesn't bother me because they haven't   studied the evidence, and most people who are  interested in these phenomena are interested   in it because they've had experience and they  want to explain the experience. But not everyone   has these experiences and so, I understand why  they're not interested in the phenomena. And so,   it doesn't bother me at all when my physics  colleagues are skeptical.
(14:59) Well, no, it doesn't   bother me when they're not interested in the  phenomena and they can't be bothered to read   the evidence in the literature. I only get annoyed  when people know nothing about it and still say   it's nonsense.
(15:18) But what were the most interesting  cases that you studied or were involved in? Well,   it depends on what you mean by cases. I  mean, I could talk about the experiments,   which have been done. But when one talks about  cases one is normally talking about, what we call   'the spontaneous cases', which are like visiting  mediums, and haunted houses, and things like that.   There were quite a number of those.
(15:40) I suppose  one of the most famous cases was what's called   the Enfield Poltergeist case. Now, probably  in Holland people haven't heard of this but   this was a case in London in Enfield, which was  a poltergeist case involving... centering around   a family and in particular focused on a young  girl. And this attracted enormous media attention,   and it was investigated by some colleagues of mine  in the Society for Psychical Research, and it's a   famous case. It just went on for so long; it went  on for nearly a year and it was recorded. I mean  
(16:14) the people were there filming and recording events  very scrupulously. So, we have very good records   and, sometimes, it's reported to be the best  poltergeist case of the century. Having said that,   some people were skeptical; some people thought  it was the children playing around.
(16:30) But on the   other hand, other people were convinced this  was really a poltergeist effect because we know   poltergeist effects tend to be associated with  adolescents very often. And the idea is that the   poltergeist case is - it represents the ability  of psychokinesis, mind over matter - because   physical phenomena occur: objects move, lights go  on and off, electricity anomalies, and all sorts   of things. The point about poltergeist, it's a  physical effect.
(17:00) And some people think that it   is a physical effect generated by a human; an  adolescence who's going through some personal   tensions or something. Other people think though  the poltergeist involves spirits because that's   what it literally means - 'noisy spirit'.
(17:20) And  in the Enfield case, there was some evidence   that perhaps there was a spirit involved because  someone who died in the house, was coming through   the children. But on the other hand, you might  say it was just the psychokinetic effect of the   children. And a skeptic will just say: "It was the  children playing around.
(17:37) " But what's interesting   about this case, I did actually visit on one  evening, and it attracted a lot of attention.   There have been two feature movies made about it.  There's even a play on in London about the Enfield   case. And just last month a drama documentary  came out on television about the Enfield case.   And I found that particularly interesting because  I only visited there one night.
(18:02) But they actually   included my visit in the reconstruction, and they  have tape recordings of all the events and all the   visitors there. So, in this film, they have my  voice as recorded at the time, though I'm played   by an actor. So, it was really quite fun to watch.
(18:23)   But things happened on that evening when you came   to visit? Well, things apparently happened but I  wasn't quite at the time... I wasn't so convinced   at the time, I wasn't convinced the children  weren't playing around. But that was just one   evening, and I wasn't an experienced poltergeist  investigator, and I was there with Tony Cornell   and Alan Gauld - who's another famous investigator  of ghosts.
(18:44) And we weren't actually convinced at   that time, but that was only one night, we  weren't convinced it wasn't the children   playing around. But later on, I rather changed my  mind because there was so much data eventually, so   many recordings, that it was hard to believe that  it was all down to fraud. So now, in retrospect,   I think it really was a genuine poltergeist case  probably. You never know for sure, but probably.  
(19:04) On the other hand, you have to be careful because  some of these movies are obviously sensationalized   for dramatic effect. So, I've just isolated one  case because that's the case, which is actually   quite topical at the moment.
(19:18) What was happening  in the house actually, when you were there? Well,   that would take a long time to describe. But  just to give an example of the most unusual   activity... Basically, furniture would move,  the girl, who was the focus, would start being   thrown out of bed and levitating. And that  was recorded? The girl levitating? It was   recorded - there are photographs of this. But  of course, photographs can be manipulated...  
(19:39) Of course, for sure, these days you can do  anything... be on Mars if you want to. But   there were really countless physical things.  It would take too long to describe them all,   but they were typical of a poltergeist case. But  it was just that this poltergeist case went on for   a long time, and the events were well-recorded.
(19:59)   So, you got to the bottom of it actually,   in this case? So, you figured out what was  the reason, the root cause for it? Well,   it depends on what you mean by 'got to the bottom  of it'. Exactly! We've not got to the bottom of   any psychic phenomena in the sense - we don't have  a clear theory for how it happens.
(20:14) If you mean 'we   got to the bottom of it' in the sense that we know  it was real? Even that might be ambiguous. I mean,   I personally think there was a genuine phenomenon  going on but it's still contentious, even after 50   years.
(20:29) It was contentious at the time, even  some members of the Society for Psychical   Research said: "We don't believe this is a genuine  case." Even now, 50 years later, we don't know for   sure. If you ask me personally, I would say it was  genuine. But often at least you've got a mixture   of genuine phenomena and maybe people helping the  phenomena along. But I don't know for sure.
(20:51) But,   I mean, Tony Cornell - who was the world's... one  of the most famous ghost hunters in the world - he   was very skeptical. He would always go to a case  assuming it wasn't genuine, assuming there was   some natural explanation. And I think that was  even his impression of Enfield.
(21:12) Nevertheless,   he had investigated hundreds of cases, and he  came away convinced that some fraction of those   cases were genuine. It might only be 20%, but some  fraction of the cases were genuine. And that's why   he spent his life studying the phenomena.
(21:31) So, yes,  I personally do believe some of these phenomena   are genuine. But there's always an element of  uncertainty, and some of my friends - even friends   who visited it - are skeptical. That's part of  the fascination of the whole subject of psychical   research, not just poltergeists - whether they are  real phenomena, or whether it's due to imagination   or misinterpretation, or even sometimes due to  fraud.
(21:54) I've really been addressing the question of   whether the phenomena are real. I mean, you asked  me whether we've got to the bottom of Psi. So,   the first question you ask is - are the  phenomena real? Because there's no doubt that   opinions differ about that and again, you've got  to say: "Well, what do you mean by Psi?" Because   there are many different phenomena involved  in Psi.
(22:16) Generally, Psi represents the mind;   the word Psi means 'mind'. So, they're phenomena,  which involve the mind and consciousness. But   there are various different types, I mean, there's  ESP (Ed. extrasensory perception) - where one mind   is communicating with another mind.
(22:30) There is  clairvoyance - when the mind is perceiving what   is in the physical world. There is precognition -  when the mind is perceiving what's in the future.   Psychokinesis - when the mind is actually  physically affecting the physical world. But   the key point about all these phenomena is that  they are not explained by conventional physics,   they don't involve a conventional interaction as  studied by the laws of physics.
(22:57) And that's why of   course, many physicists are skeptical about their  existence because they know the laws of physics   work well in one context, and they don't want to  think the laws of physics are being violated. So,   that's a very broad definition of Psi, but the key  point about it is, that because it's a science,   one is assuming these phenomena are natural,  they're not supernatural.
(23:20) Sometimes we're   saying... people portray these phenomena as being  supernatural and that they can't be explained by   normal laws of nature. But I, at least, start  off with the assumption that they are natural,   but they just involve a form of physical or a  form of process, which is not well understood   yet, because science is always expanding and  accommodating new phenomena.
(23:48) But in particular,   as a physicist, I want to know whether physics can  be expanded to accommodate these phenomena. So,   when you ask: have we got to the bottom of these  phenomena? If by that you mean - have we got a   theory of them, and in particular a theory of  physics? I would have to say NO. And that's one   of the reasons why mainstream science remains  skeptical of these phenomena because we don't   have a theory. Even if you've got the data - until  you've got a theory - it doesn't really qualify  
(24:17) as a proper scientific... domain of science,  because science requires theory and it needs   experiments to test the theory. Now, this doesn't  mean there isn't a theory. I mean I have my own   theory - what my passion has been actually ever  since I was at school; my passion has always been   to expand physics to accommodate mental and indeed  spiritual phenomena.
(24:46) So, I have my own approach,   which we may talk about later, but I can't say  'cross my heart' this is definitely the truth.   It's my particular approach to how physics can  be extended. But what I do... however it's going   to happen I do feel passionately that physics  must expand to accommodate these phenomena and,   in particular, to accommodate consciousness.
(25:08)   Because the key point about psychic phenomena:   they involve mind, they involve consciousness,  they involve a first-person as opposed to a   third-person account of the world. So, I think  physics has to expand to accommodate that. Not   all physicists would agree with me and even if the  physicists do agree they might not agree with my   particular theory. But that's what I feel rather  passionately.
(25:33) So from your experience, what we can   say is that the Psi phenomena are not... not all  of them are fiction. So, they do exist and they   are real, and they are not fraud, and they are not  hallucinations or any of that... My personal view   is that at least some Psi phenomena are real.
(25:51) But  you've got to be aware of the fact the word Psi   is used in a very broad sense, and some people  accommodate all sorts of other phenomena, like   pyramid power and UFOs (Ed. also known as UAPs)  and all sorts of... Everything that we cannot   explain I think? Exactly! And then that's part  of the problem. People say psychical research is   rubbish, because they're thinking of a particular  topic, which may well be rubbish.
(26:19) And the trouble   is, all psychical researchers have their own  bubble threshold. So they will believe certain   things and not other things. But if you put  everything together under one heading of course,   you just say it's all nonsense but that's... you  have to discriminate. And I have a policy in life,   even in physics not just in psychical research, to  never believe or disbelieve anything completely.  
(26:39) So I won't say I'm 100% certain telepathy exists  and I'm 0%, and I'm 100% certain that pyramid   power is wrong. I would never do that. But I have,  in my own mind, I have a sort of probability,   so I will bet you 90% that telepathy is correct.  I might bet you 50% that psychokinesis is correct.  
(27:00) If you ask me whether survival of consciousness  after death, which is a problem sometimes   discussed by psychical research, I'm less certain  about that. I tend to believe that but I might   only say 30%. So I think that's really the true  skeptical approach to these phenomena is to keep   your mind open and to just try and get a balanced  view.
(27:28) So the people who believe a 100% or believe   0% or disbelieve a 100%, I think that's a very  unhealthy attitude. I think you have to be open   and somewhere in between... But yet critical and  skeptical. Critical skepticism. As opposed to the   skeptics who are just completely closed-minded.  Unfortunately, the word skeptic now is used   in a different sense.
(27:54) The word skeptic has been  taken over by the people who are sometimes called   counter-advocates; they think it's all nonsense.  But so when you say someone's a skeptic that says   they don't believe any of the phenomena. The  real word skeptic merely mean you're critical,   you study the phenomena but you don't make up your  mind completely, you have a critical view.
(28:11) And in   that sense I'm a skeptic and I think everyone  should be a skeptic. But I do nevertheless   believe some of these phenomena are real and if I  didn't - I wouldn't have spent 50 years studying   t
(28:32) hem. And do we actually... I understand that we  don't have a theory explaining at least some of   those but do we have better tools, scientific  tools that allow us to study it now? Or are we   still in the dark and just taking photographs?  Or there are other better ways now, comparing...   You're looking at this 50 years now down the road,  right? Where you started and where we are today:   do we have better tools, better methods?  50 years from when I started but remember,   the Society (Ed. SPR) started 140 years ago.
(29:02) Of  course we have better tools but it depends what   sort of experiments and evidence you're talking  about. When you're talking about experiments in   the laboratory, we have much more sophisticated  machines: we can look for different sorts of   psychokinetic interactions, effect on random  number generators, we can look for more subtle   forms of telepathy, which might involve altered  states of consciousness in meditation or ganzfeld   or different sort of state of mind which can  be induced.
(29:34) So we can do experiments in a more   sophisticated way. We can study the brain in a  way we couldn't before; we can understand what   is going on in the brain when people have these  psychic or weird experiences - altered states   of consciousness. When it comes to spontaneous  events such as investigating a haunted house,   again we've got more sophisticated machinery; so  now we have very sensitive cameras and devices,   which can measure sound and electromagnetic  fields.
(30:10) And so, the technology is vastly better   now than it was 100 years ago for example. On the  other hand, you got to be careful because better   technology also increases the possibility  for fraud, for people to play around. You   can take a photograph or film and you can create  something, which never happened by photoshopping   a
(30:43) nd things like that. So, the technology it  comes either way... it's a double-edged sword;   it's a plus and a minus. But by and large of  course, it's not surprising that after 140 years   we have made huge advances, even though we haven't  convinced all the skeptics, the counter-advocates   that Psi is real.
(31:03) We have got far far more  evidence now, and, in my own mind, the evidence   for some of these phenomena like telepathy and  clairvoyance, precognition... I think the evidence   for that is pretty overwhelming, and it's partly  because of the more sophisticated experiments   and instrumentation. And also we have a better  understanding of statistics, for example. Because   a lot of the evidence comes down to statistics  and analyzing, trying to determine what is a mere   coincidence and what requires an explanation. And  the other thing I should say is that we somewhat  
(31:35) expanded what we mean by Psi, because when I was  talking about Psi, I was talking about telepathy   and PK (Ed. psychokinesis). But there are also  experiences which you might describe as more   mystical or spiritual than psychic. I mean if you  have out-of-body experiences. I talked about that,   as some got me interested in the subject.
(31:58) Or  if you have a near-death experience or mystical   experience - you might describe that as more  mystical than psychic. So, there's a semantic   issue of what you include under the term psychic.  Some parapsychologists, they don't like to talk   about mystical experiences because they want to  focus on experiments, which have a psychological   a
(32:25) spect rather than the spiritual aspect. Because  some psychical researchers... I pointed out they   form a bridge between science and spirituality  in a way, but that makes you... that's an   uncomfortable position because the scientists  think you're too spiritual, and the spiritual   people think you're too scientific. And so, some  people in parapsychology, they deliberately avoid   getting too spiritual.
(32:45) The word spiritual is a  taboo word because that's going to make them less   credible to the scientists. However I think now  we're coming to the appreciation that you need a   broader view of psychic phenomena, which does  incorporate the spiritual, as well as the mere   psychic.
(33:03) You remember I started off saying - I've  got this interest in the three worlds if you like:   matter, mind and spirit. And I think you really  need... whatever your final theory is going to be,   even this extended theory of physics... to me  it's got to relate to all those three worlds.   I mean we traditionally think of science  is being associated with material world,   but the whole point of parapsychology is - you're  expanding science to include the mental world.
(33:30) And   that's not such a crazy idea now, I mean because  of developments in quantum theory and cognitive   science and things. But parapsychology itself  - we now think there is an extended science,   which includes mind.
(33:52) But I think we also need to  include the spiritual realms but that's much more   controversial. There are lots of physicists  like Roger Penrose, who are happy to extend   physics to accommodate mind and consciousness  but probably aren't so happy to extend it to   include the spiritual domains. But I am - because  as I explained at the beginning I've always been   obsessed... well, intrigued by these three worlds  and trying to connect them.
(34:18) I had a question but I   think I already have an answer. Basically I was  wondering, when I was preparing the questions,   I was wondering if somebody has a strong  scientific background, is it a hindrance   or is it more of a help really to investigate and  to explain these parapsychological phenomena? But   I think you kind of already answered it.
(34:41) No, I  would like to answer that because it's actually   both. I mean first of all it's a help because  of course science has a way of proceeding,   a way of understanding the world; you focus on  certain phenomena and you try and produce theories   and then you do the experiments, which will modify  the theory. And we need to know that. If you want   to study these phenomena scientifically, you  need to have a scientific background and in   p
(35:15) articular if you want a theory... if I want a  theory of physics, which is going to accommodate   these phenomena, I have to understand the  normal theories of physics. And of course,   I am a physicist and in a funny way I sort of  became a physicist because I thought: "Well,   if I'm going to extend physics to accommodate  Psi, I better understand physics." That's why I   became a professional physicist but so, obviously,  being a scientist helps study these phenomena,   and indeed being a scientist will help you study  any phenomena, which is in the scientific domain.  
(35:44) It's a hindrance in the sociological sense, that  most scientists don't believe in these phenomena   or at least if they do, they're not prepared  to talk about it. And I actually think more   scientists are interested in these things than  will admit publicly. Because parapsychology,   psychical research is a taboo word and even to  express an interest in this subject can get you   into trouble in the academic context; you might  lose your job, you won't get a research grant,   you won't get a promotion. So, from a  sociological perspective, the fact that  
(36:26) most scientists - I don't know, I would't say most  - but a large number of scientists and physicists   in particular don't believe in the phenomena that  does affect you. That is a hindrance and it's   i
(36:46) n some sense... it's for the individual a bit  concerning if you know... If I know most of my   physics colleagues don't believe in the phenomena;  they think I'm wasting my life. So obviously,   that has a negative effect. But more practically,  if you don't get grants to study the phenomena   that also affects things because you've got to  realize that, although psychical research has been   going on for 140 years it has tiny resources.
(37:08)   The amount of money it gets for research,   the number of people who are involved in research  is tiny if compared to mainstream psychology,   let alone mainstream biology and other areas. So  I would say science is both a plus and a minus:   it's a plus from a theoretical perspective but  it's a minus from a sociological perspective.
(37:27) But   it is interesting to see that actually within the  UK at least, there has been a lot of progress; you   can now do a PhD in parapsychology, and believe  it or not, there have been more than 100 PhDs   in parapsychology in the United Kingdom alone.
(37:53)   They're working in psychology departments, and now   about a dozen universities where you have courses  on parapsychology. So that's progress. And quite   a lot of those PhDs have gone on to get academic  jobs; they're professors in parapsychology now.   So, there has been progress.
(38:10) So, although I'm  saying there's a mainstream opposition to it,   I don't mean complete opposition because there  are PhDs and professors in the subject. So,   there's been a huge Improvement. But I have to  say within physics, I think there have been no   PhDs and they're no professors of paraphysics for  example.
(38:26) So, it depends which academic area you're   looking at. Well, when you say... I'm thinking  out-loud... when you say they don't believe,   you don't mean it like believe in God? You mean  it 'believe' in a sense - they're not open-minded   t
(38:43) o accept the possibility that it can be real,  right? That it can be... In that sense 'believe'?   When you say 'believe' - it could be religious.  We don't mean religious believe in something that   we cannot prove or we cannot explain? Well that's  an interesting question because I would say the   extreme skeptics, the ones who don't believe  in the phenomena at all, I would say they are   rather like the extreme religious people.
(39:08) You  have the fundamentalist Christians for example,   and and I say they have a rather narrow view of  the world, where they have the truth that nobody   else has. That's fundamental religion. Blind  dogma? Blind dogma, and I would say the skeptics,   although they're anti-religion, they're normally  atheists as well.
(39:25) I would say the blind skeptics   are equally fundamentalist because they have...  their skepticism is almost based on faith. And so,   for example, you'll have physicists  say, and sometimes my friends will say,   Psi can't be real because it's incompatible with  the laws of physics. I don't even need to look at   the data because I know it can't be true.
(39:50) To me  that's a terrible attitude but it's an attitude   some people say: "I don't need to look at the data  because I know it can't be true." In other words,   they refuse to look through the telescope -  going back to Galileo, where people wouldn't look   through the telescope. And so I think people like  that are refusing to look through the telescope.  
(40:06) It's almost opposite of science isn't it? Exactly!  Because science should be open to explore all the   avenues and all the roads. It should be open  to explain the reality, all the reality not   just a segment of it. Absolutely. It should be  open and it can be skeptical in the sense that   i
(40:28) t's always questioning, but I think that is  really crucial. But on the other hand...well,   and I should say these people, the physicists  I'm talking about, some physicist will say   these phenomena can't be real because they're not  compatible with the laws of physics and the laws   of physics have been tested with great precision  in both quantum theory and relativity theory.  
(40:46) But we don't have a final theory of physics;  we know quantum theory - which works so well   in the microscopic domain, and relativity theory  -which works in the macroscopic domain. They work   beautifully in their own domains but we know  those theories are not compatible. The final   theory of physics has to go beyond relativity  and quantum theory and we don't know what that   final theory is. That's what's everyone is looking  for - the final theory of physics.
(41:10) At least some   people are looking for it. We cannot possibly  say that final theory of physics is not going   to allow consciousness because we don't know what  that theory of physics is. And my own view - and   and I'm echoing what Roger Penrose says here - my  own view is that the final theory of physics will   make some reference to consciousness and mind. And  that's what I think is so important.
(41:34) But there's   another group of physicists though who don't  dismiss the phenomena. They merely say: "Well,   I can accept these phenomena are real but they're  just not part of physics." They will say: "Well,   physics is to do with the third-person description  of the world and experience consciousness involves   the first-person description.
(41:59) " And they  will simply say: "That's fine, I accept   that these experiences happen. It's just not part  of physics." And maybe a third of physicists take   that view... more than a third actually, maybe the  majority take that view. I though take the view   that physics can be expanded to accommodate these  phenomena: consciousness and the PSI and even   spiritual experiences.
(42:28) That's more controversial  but I would say with time the number of people in   that third category is growing okay. And I think  that's important. But you also have to realize   that every time you expand physics, you indeed  expand science because physics is just a subbranch   of science.
(42:49) Every time you get a new paradigm  - because that's what we're talking about - a   new paradigm to accommodate consciousness.  Every time you get a new paradigm in physics,   in science you're subtly changing the nature  of science itself. And it may be when you've   got this expanded paradigm, which accommodates  mind and spirit, it may not be science in the   way people used that term previously. So, that's  the caveat I would add.
(43:13) But in some sense I want   to expand science and I want to expand physics  to accommodate these phenomena. I was wondering   if some of the psychical phenomena that you  investigated or studied could be explained by   the phenomenon of time or a concept of 'specious  present'? And maybe you could explain a little   bit what that doctrine is first? Okay, well, many  phenomena, many Psi phenomena do involve time.
(43:43) For   example, a premonition - where you see the future,  obviously involves time. Or retrocognition - where   you see something in the past, it involves time.  But not the normal physical time because this   isn't compatible with a normal concept of physical  time. Apparitions - people see ghosts.
(44:03) You know   the traditional ghost story is that you visit  the haunted house and they see the same ghost,   enacting the same scene. It's as though  you're seeing a film clip from the past. So,   in some sense, it's as though the past has been  frozen and and somehow is being shown again in   the present.
(44:29) There's a whole range of phenomena,  which involve what you might call synchronicity;   coincidences, which again - a synchronicity  means two events... happening at the right time   also. Yeah, so it seems to me, no doubt that  time is crucial to Psi and indeed I would say   understanding time is crucial to the understanding  of consciousness. If we're going to have a final   theory of consciousness it's going to have an  understanding of the final theory of time as   w
(45:00) ell. Because although physicists understand time  to some extent, they don't have a final... They   understand time in the physical world - but that's  only part of it - and there are many features of   time, which we don't understand as physicists. The  most fundamental question is - what is the passage   of time? Consciousness means we're aware of the  flow of time: you know, the future becomes the   present, becomes the past.
(45:27) But the problem is that  passage of time cannot be described by relativity   theory. Relativity theory is the physicist's way  of understanding time you know. It merges space   and time as part of a four-dimensional spacetime  and that works very successfully. But relativity   theory has what they call the block Universe  -where the past, present and future coexist,   there is no passage of time.
(45:53) And so many  people conclude that the present moment,   which is what we experience as conscious beings,  doesn't really exist from a physical perspective;   it's purely a feature of mind. Many philosophers,  almost most philosophers conclude that the passage   of time is an illusion, or at least it exists  only as a result of mind, is not a feature   of the physical world.
(46:20) And a lot of physicists  will agree that there is nothing in the physics,   which actually tells you what is the physical  moment 'now', because if you have the ordinary   laws of physics, the past and the future are  determined entirely in terms of the present. So,   there's no distinction between now, there's  nothing to highlight now. That's what some   physicists say. But I know there is a passage of  time, I do experience the passage of time.
(46:48) Also,   I don't believe in the block Universe because I  think I can make a decision whether to go left   or go right. Whether to continue the interview  or stop the interview - I can make a decision.   And that is not compatible with the idea of a  block Universe because the block Universe says   t
(47:12) hat there is a definite future, which you cannot  avoid. Well it may be my...No free will then? No   free will! Now, it maybe that's an illusion, maybe  I only think I've got a decision as to whether to   carry on being interviewed or disappear. But  I don't think that. I think there is... But my   argument is that you have to go beyond relativity  theory, you need another time dimension.
(47:29) I say   that the experience of time requires another  time dimension - it's mental time if you like,   rather than physical time. And in my view,  mental time is different from physical time,   so you actually have a five dimensional picture:  you've got the four-dimensional spacetime - which   physicists study, the third-person domain.  But there's also this fifth dimension.
(47:50) So,   you really got a five-dimensional model: and one  slice of that if you like - is the physical world,   and the other side - is the mental world.  That's my own view. Again it may not be   the the mainstream view and so in my own theory  you've got to go beyond relative. You have to go   beyond special relativity. You have to invoke this  extra dimension.
(48:21) And what's interesting of course,   is that physics itself talks about extra  dimensions now. There's M-theory for example,   has got 11 dimensions. M-theory is the current  favored model for a theory of everything and   it's got 11 dimensions. So, you've got the three  dimensions of space and the one dimension of time,   so those are what we call the macroscopic  dimensions.
(48:44) But you've got these extra dimensions,   which are all wrapped up but they're... in  the simplest picture they're all wrapped up,   very small; they're compactified on a scale of  what's called the Planck length, which is very   very small, 10 to the minus 33 centimeters.
(48:58) So we  never see these extra dimensions because they're   compactified but nevertheless they exist according  to some of these popular theories of physics. And   not all physicists believe these theories. Some  people say - it's just mathematics because they've   not been tested, but the fact is that some of  the smartest physicists on the planet think about   these things. So that's extra dimensions coming  from mainstream physics.
(49:24) One of these theories,   a version of M-theory, says it you extend one of  these dimensions; so instead of being wrapped up   very small, it's extended. So you've got a  five-dimensional model and in this picture   the physical world, the material world, is like a  four-dimensional slice, it's called a brane - b r   a n e. And it's in this higher dimensional bulk,  that's just the term they use.
(49:49) And in what's   called brane cosmology, which goes a bit beyond  that. That says how... because cosmology is the   large scale structure of the universe. This sheet,  this brane actually moves through the bulk. Well,   I relate that to my higher dimensional model of  time, because if you can think of four-dimensional   spacetime, it's sort of moving through this fifth  dimension associated with mental time.
(50:14) And you can   see that's rather similar to the idea of a brane  moving through this five-dimensional bulk. So,   I actually associate this extra dimension, which  describes mind and consciousness, with this extra   dimension that comes out of physics. I have to  say this is my own theory.
(50:31) I don't know if any   other physicists believe in it or many brane  cosmologists will like that theory, because by   and large they don't want to bring mind into it.  But my feeling is this - if the world is really   say five-dimensional, as like the bulk, and we're  only on a slice of this five-dimensional space,   what else is there in the rest of the space  of the bulk? Well, the only thing I'm aware   of is my mental world: my dreams, my memories,  my visualizations, my out-of-body experiences,   my near-death experiences. So, to me, it's  very natural to try and say that these  
(51:08) experiences can be described in terms of this  higher-dimensional space. The only thing is that,   it may not just be five-dimensional. There may  be more than five dimensions. So, the key point   is the realization that there is a reality,  which goes beyond the normal material reality,   which is just that four-dimensional brane.
(51:35) But  nevertheless, it's a higher-dimensional reality,   which is still being described by equations and  by laws of physics, because they're coming from   the physicists who study M-theory. And that's why  I'm saying this is in some sense an extension of   physics to the mental domain. And that's what  I feel rather passionate about.
(51:57) What is then   the relationship between time and this mental  domain or consciousness, whatever we want to   call it? Well, in the picture I've just described  to you, the fifth dimension is actually the mental   time. So, this extra domain actually contains  mind and mental time because there's this link   always between time and consciousness.
(52:27) And so  you see, the normal view is that the material   world is real, okay? The table is hard and I sit  on the chair. So, what we mean by that is that   this is the real world in the sense that we are  all perceiving the world. But we perceive it from   different directions and different ways because  we're localized. But nevertheless there is a   three-dimensional real world out there, and the  existence of that world explains why all of our   views of the world are concordant, okay? You and  I, we're seeing the world in different ways.
(52:58) But   how we see the world is consistent because  there is a three-dimensional reality. So,   we say what is real three-dimensional - that's the  classical view. And we have the same apparatus so   to speak. We have the same... we're two brains,  we're localized in three-dimensional space,   we're looking around at your teacup and  three-dimensional space.
(53:20) And once we know   where we are and where the teacup is, we can  reconcile how we see the world. The trouble   is that's wrong because Einstein told us that  actually the reality is really four-dimensional.   We don't notice it because you only notice it  if you're moving near the speed of light or in a   strong gravitational field.
(53:40) But actually, the only  way to consistently reconcile how people observe   the world is to say it's four-dimensional. So,  you've got a four-dimensional reality and that's   standard physics. What I'm saying is that actually  reality is more than four-dimensional. There're   higher-dimensions and these higher-dimensions  have to do with mind.
(53:57) Now, you see the standard   view - the sort of materialist-reductionist  view - is that my mind is just inside my brain,   your mind is inside your brain. So, our minds  are completely separate and it's a result of   neural activity. It's a result of neural activity.  So, there's a physical world out there, signals   c
(54:22) ome in through the eyes and go into the visual  cortex... but the idea is that my mind is entirely   inside my head and your mind is entirely inside  your head. If what I'm telling you is correct,   that there's this higher-dimensional mental space,  our minds are just part of a bigger mind, okay!   It's a Universal Mind if you like, with a capital  M, and it seems we just in our heads because by   and large we can't see beyond, outside of our  senses, except in altered states of consciousness.  
(54:50) So, we get the impression that our mind is in  our head but I argue that, actually, the mind   isn't in the head. I mean clearly there are things  going on in the brain, which correlate with your   experience. But my claim is that the Mind itself,  the experience itself, is not in the head. In   fact, from my perspective, the experience is the  outside, is spacetime.
(55:14) When you talk about the   physical world, the experience is spacetime itself  and it's just there as a correlation with what   goes on in your brain. But your phenomenal space  isn't actually inside your brain. Your phenomenal   space really is the outside world, although  distorted in various ways.
(55:32) But that's when   you're dealing with the physical world. But what  about these other realms: the mental and spiritual   realms? I claim they're also part of a connected  reality, of what you might call a Universal Mind.   But it's Mind with a capital M, as distinct from  my individual mind with a little 'm'.
(55:53) Or if you   like, it's Consciousness with a big C as opposed  to the consciousness with the little 'c', which   I have. So, you're actually equating the  word mind with the word consciousness? Well,   that's a bit complicated; consciousness could  be understood in different ways.
(56:08) But certainly   mind... consciousness - if you're dealing with  contents of consciousness - that relates the   mind. So, obviously the two ideas are linked.  But the point is to me that's the prime message   of parapsychology actually, the phenomena of  parapsychology, that our minds are connected;   they're not just separate, they're part of this  Universal Mind.
(56:35) Now, we don't notice that because   the brain is designed to cut out all of this other  psychic information if you like... Unnecessary I   guess, right? In other words, it's saying that  the brain is not the generator of consciousness,   the brain is a filter of Consciousness okay? So  you got the big C, which is filtered through the   brain because the brain is sufficiently  sophisticated to generate memories and   images of... Localized experience basically ..  Localizing it, exactly! Localizes it.
(57:06) But to me,   the message of all the psychical research and  other experience is that the mind is non-local;   the minds are connected. So, it would be rather  like if we were all in prison cells okay? You   think all that exists is your prison cell because  you can't see anything outside your cell. But,   actually, we know the prison cells are all  connected as part of a physical world.
(57:30) It's   just that you haven't opened the prison door and  being let out. I think minds are like that: we're   locked into our own little prison, so we think  that's all there is, and they're disconnected.   But once you open the door and all the prisoners  are let out, they find they're all connected.  
(57:45) That's my view anyway. And I think that's a  fundamental finding of psychical research. Not   just psychical research, more natural phenomena:  creativity, genius, mystical experience. I think   all of these are evidence that you've got  non-local mind but this has the important   implication that the brain is a filter rather than  a generator of consciousness.
(58:12) And that is a view   which I imagine 90% of neuroscientists at least  wouldn't accept. But I think there is evidence   for the filter theory. I think there's evidence  that sometimes, when the brain is shutting down,   your experience is more real and brighter.
(58:32) I mean  the obvious example is a near-death experience;   your brain is dying, is flatlined and yet you're  experiencing things as vividly as ever. Amazing!   Yeah, there are experiences where psychedelics...  where the bits of the brain you might think will   be activated or deactivated and yet you're seeing  a whole new experience, the realm of experience.  
(58:52) There's terminal lucidity: people are suffering  from Alzheimer's, and yet, just before they die,   they suddenly become lucid. It's as though the  closing down of the brain actually makes them   more aware. And to me, that is fascinating.
(59:12) And  it's not so easy experimentally to distinguish   between the producer and the filter theory  of consciousness. But I think if Psi is real,   I think that's the message that it's a brain  that is a filter. There is a Universal Mind,   and that's why our minds are connected through  telepathy and clairvoyance. This Universal Mind   also contains the material world because it's  just one slice of the material world.
(59:36) That's at   least my own view. Now, you originally asked  in your question about the specious present.   Before we go there, I have a burning question: is  time objective or not in this case? Well! Does it   exist? What if we hadn't existed? Because we  have singularity, where there is no time. The   question is which time do you mean? Yeah, what's  time then? if you mean time - the physical time,   which is measured by clocks in the physical  world, one would say that it's objective, it's   part of the third-person description of standard  physics that's described by Einstein's relativity  
(1:00:19) theory. And certainly that is describing what  is objective. If by objective you mean in some   sense consensual reality, okay - because the word  'objective' says there an outside reality - and   physical time is part of that consensual reality.  So, it is objective in that sense. However,   if you ask about mental time, the passage of time,  many physicists would say: "That is not objective   because there's nothing in physics, which says  this is now." There's nothing in physics, which  
(1:00:54) describes this passage and so a physicist would  say that time is not objective. But, remember,   that's because you're associating objectivity with  this lower-dimensional level of reality. If you've   got a higher level of reality, and that higher  level of reality contains another dimension of   time, that has an objectivity.
(1:01:23) Because the whole  point about this approach is the distinction   between subjective and objective is being removed;  you think there's an outside world there and the   subjective world in my brain. But what I'm  saying is: "No, it's not inside your brain."   The subjective world is actually a reflection in  the objective world, and even the mental world,   which you experience in dreams and altered states  of consciousness.
(1:01:42) I'm saying that it's also part   of a communal reality and therefore, in that  sense, it's also objective, if by objective you   mean real. So, I would say that time is objective,  once you adopt this extended view of reality. But   it's not objective... well, mental time is not  objective from the current view of physics,   w
(1:02:13) hich just focuses on the material world. Now...  But what is time then? What is time? Well,   what I've said to you, what I claimed to you -  and of course this could all be wrong because,   remember, philosophers have been debating this  for a thousand years - but what I'm saying to you,   when you say: "What is time?" - you have to  distinguish between the different levels of   time.
(1:02:32) I mean it's easy to answer your question  as a straightforward classical physicist, I say:   "There is just time is the thing measured  by clocks." But what I'm saying to you is:   "No, it's not as simple as that. Because when you  talk about mental experience, you have to invoke   another time - even if most physicists aren't  happy with that and nor is it as simple as that.  
(1:02:47) Because actually, I would argue there's more than  one mental time. I would argue there's a hierarchy   of times and to explain that, I have to get into a  discussion of specious present. Would you like me   to talk about specious present? First of all,  I should preface this by saying I'm going to   say something, which most of my physicist friends  probably won't take seriously.
(1:03:14) But the point about   conscious experience is that it not only involves  a passage of time, which I've explained with   this extra dimension, it also involves a specious  present. And the specious present is the shortest   time you're aware of. In other words, you can't  resolve it into past present and future.
(1:03:33) Now,   for a human being the specious present is about  a tenth of a second okay? So, what I mean is...   I often do a little demonstration with a light but  I'm going to do it with my finger. You imagine a   light goes around. You see that as motion if the  light goes around more than 10 times a second.
(1:03:53) You   don't see it as motion, you see a continuous  light - in other words time in some sense has   become space perceptually, because our brain can't  resolve things on a time scale less than a tenth   of a second. And actually, if the light goes  around too slowly you won't see motion either.  
(1:04:12) That's to do with a memory time-scale, which might  be many hours or something. But the point is,   our experience of the passage of time only  involves a very narrow range of time scales   okay? And in particular, this specious presence  - is a tenth of a second. And humans very   arrogantly assert that this is the only level  of consciousness in the universe.
(1:04:35) They assume   that homo sapiens is the culmination of evolution.  Aren't we? We are conscious! I don't think so. We   are on this planet, yeah, but maybe not in the  universe. But they assume that we're the only   level of consciousness in the universe. But how  do we know? Because the point it's rather like...  
(1:04:54) look... light - you know we only observe in the  optical range, which is a very narrow wave band,   compared to the whole range of electromagnetic  radiation. I'm saying the same thing about   consciousness. We assume that consciousness,  our consciousness with a specious present of   a tenth of a second is all there is.
(1:05:16) I don't see  why there shouldn't be levels of consciousness on   all sorts of physical scales, with very different  specious presents. Because there are structures,   physical structures in the universe, on all sorts  of different scales, not just human beings. And we   can't exclude the fact that they're, in some  sense, conscious and alive.
(1:05:32) But the specious   present would be very different. You might even  argue that the planet Earth - this will sound   very New Agey - but you might argue, the planet  Earth is a sort of collective consciousness.   Because it's got a collective memory, a collective  intelligence, a collective stupidity - as seen by   all the wars going on and things like that, by the  fact we're destroying ourselves.
(1:05:55) But nevertheless,   there is a sense, in which, you could argue, the  planet Earth has got a sense a personal identity.   I'm not going to say the Earth is conscious but  it could be on some level. And then, it could be,   when we start making contact with aliens in the  galaxy, other civilizations of the galaxy, maybe   we become part of the Great Galactic Internet.
(1:06:15)   And so, in some sense, maybe we become part of a   great Galactic Consciousness but on a much longer  time scale. Or maybe eventually we'll become part   of some great Cosmic Consciousness, which operates  on a cosmological time-scale. But we can't prove   these different levels of consciousness exist,  because the whole point is that consciousness   with the (different) specious presents can't  interact with each other; you can only interact   with the consciousness having roughly the same  time-scale, you know. If mountains talk to each  
(1:06:42) other on a time scale of a million years, you're  not going to be able to speak to them. I'm not   claiming mountains are speaking to each other,  but I'm just trying to illustrate that. So,   it seems to be incredibly arrogant, and I don't  see why there shouldn't be consciousness on a time   scale of a million years, you know.
(1:07:02) Maybe, some  extra-galactic civilization has a specious present   of a million years. Or maybe there's a form of  consciousness on a time-scale of a nano-second...   people argue about whether computers are going  to develop consciousness. Well, maybe they will   develop consciousness but maybe the specious  present will be a nano-second, because they   think much faster.
(1:07:26) So, I take the view that the  Universe, even considered from a physical point   of view, may exhibit consciousness on all sorts of  different levels. But we just wouldn't be aware of   it in a normal state of consciousness, because  our normal state of consciousness is a specious   present of a tenth of a second.
(1:07:43) Well, you might  say well, that's not very useful because - how do   you prove it? Well, why? It's interesting. Because  I think there are certain altered states of   consciousness, in which we can change our specious  present. I mean this is incontrovertible to some   extent - we know our specious present changes  in certain experiences; if you're falling off a   mountain - the time seems to slow down. I'm not  talking from experience.
(1:08:10) Yeah, people say that   but... I did fall... I was doing mountaineering.  You have fallen down? Well then... Yeah, you do   fall; when you come down you do through a set  of falls. Well, I wonder, I should now be asking   you the question. But the point is that it's a  different experience than on the ground.
(1:08:25) That's   fascinating. So there are situations where your  time actually... the outside world slows down. So,   your specious present, in some sense, becomes  smaller. It's expanding actually, internally.   Yeah, but your specious present becomes smaller  so that the external time seems to slow down, you   have many internal moments. I can't judge, because  all you have is an inner experience.
(1:08:52) And that   inner experience is actually expanding. There's  a feeling of expansion. But this is a semantic   point: if the outside world slows down that means  you have many internal moments for each external,   so your specious present is then shrinking.
(1:09:08) That's  correct! But you also have experiences where your   specious present expands. And there's a nice story  of someone, who was ill with a fever and saw this   flickering light by the window. And it turned out,  it was the rising and setting of the Sun. But it   had been speeded up and the reason was, because  his specious present has expanded, okay? Which   meant that in a certain amount of his internal  time a lot of external time flows.
(1:09:35) So, that's   an expansion. Now, presumably, those effects  can be described by what goes on in the brain,   because there probably some form of clock inside  the brain. But there're more dramatic experiences,   w
(1:09:56) hich I suspect can't be described by what goes  on in the brain. If you have... there's a famous   case, where Rupert Brooke was pouring tea for his  girlfriend and all of a sudden time froze. And so,   it was the solid... For him? For him time froze...  this tea was solid, just solid, just static coming   out of the teapot. And he wrote a beautiful poem,  which was inspired by this mystical moment.
(1:10:20) Now,   I know you filled your teacup a short time ago, so  maybe you can do it again and see if time freezes.   But nevertheless, this was an experience he  had and we would describe... Spontaneously?   Spontaneously... not a meditation or anything  like that? He didn't expect it to happen,   it just happened. As a result of this...  and it inspired a poem.
(1:10:38) And then later on   of course he went back into real time and it  started flowing again. But that's a situation   where your specious present sort of... it  basically freezes to zero, it shrinks to   zero because only now exists. But there are other  situations where your species presence expands;   you have a near-death experience and you see your  whole life in one go.
(1:10:59) No distinction between past   and future. Yeah, that's what people say.  It just you see your whole life in one go   and that's because in this way of talking your  specious present has expanded to something like   100 years. So, I think there is evidence that  the specious present can actually change and   that when it changes like this, I would say your  consciousness has gone beyond the brain.
(1:11:22) Remember,   I talked about the brain being a filter? I  would say this is evidence actually that the   brain is a filter because you're now... there  are these different levels of consciousness and   in some sense you become... you've lost  your individual identity and you become   merged with this higher level of identity.
(1:11:45) So,  once you've got this higher level of identity,   you are no longer yourself, you are no longer  Natalia, you are actually a higher level of   self. But I would claim you can experience that  either through falling off a mountain... well,   no, falling off a mountain probably has a simple  physical brain-based explanation. But I would say,   i
(1:12:08) f you have a near-death experience or a mystical  experience, I would say that you can... or even a   cup of tea... I would claim that you may be able  to access these different levels of consciousness   and different levels of identity. So, if you were  to ask me what is the evidence for these theories,   I would say it comes from experience, not through  scientific experiments, because we can't do that   yet. But I would say it comes from experience.
(1:12:30)   But I think as long as the brain is functioning,   you know, in any form or shape, people can say:  it's the brain, which is doing that, right? So,   I think the closest to a proof, if you could  say that, would be a near-death experience,   where there is a flat-line in the brain and people  experiencing all kinds of things...That is true.   I mean, I was sort of saying the very fact that  you're experiencing your whole life, means you   have to go beyond the brain.
(1:12:55) But that was meant  to be independent of whether you flatlined in   some sense. But I was arguing just by the very  nature of the experience; it can't be explained   by the brain. How can the brain present your whole  life in one go? But certainly it can't predict   your future life; and sometimes people see their  future life, as well as their past life.
(1:13:11) However,   that's more contentious, some people say: you  know, we don't understand the brain. How can I   say the brain can't experience the whole of your  life in one go. So, maybe I'm wrong there, but the   flatlining of the brain is perhaps more relevant  to say that it goes beyond the brain.
(1:13:27) But I just   think though that there are... that consciousness  - is a hierarchy of consciousness and that,   although, normally we're locked into our brain,  sometimes - even when you're alive - you're able   to access those higher levels of the hierarchy.
(1:13:45)   And I have my own theory, which is even more   speculative than anything I've said so far. In  these higher dimensional theories of physics,   the extra dimensions are compactified. You  remember that they're normally compactified   on the Planck scale but in one... you extend one  theory... one dimension is extended in the brane   picture... the brane in the bulk picture.
(1:14:09)   And so, I like the idea that, actually,   all of the extra dimensions are compactified  on different scales. And in some sense,   the hierarchy of scales of compactification in  my model corresponds to the hierarchy of specious   presents and the hierarchy of consciousness.  But this is my picture. It's not the mainstream   picture of physics nor is it the mainstream  picture of philosophers or indeed the mainstream   p
(1:14:37) ictures of mystics. It's just my particular  model but it's just... it may be wrong, it may   be crazy but it's just a way of illustrating  how, in principle, you may be able to relate   physics to experience. Well, you might ask: "How  does this concept of the specious present explain   certain psychical phenomena?" Well, that's quite  a big topic.
(1:14:57) But, just to give a simple example,   the point about the specious present is that  there's no distinction between past, present and future. And therefore, from an experiential  point of view, within the time scale of a   tenth of a second, there's no distinction between  past, present and future. And a funny way in this   theory - I'm associating consciousness almost with  closed time-like curves - you have what are called   closed time-like curves, which loop in time - and  in this approach, I am associating consciousness  
(1:15:28) with a closed time-like curve. Which is a  rather strange concept but that's, nevertheless,   the picture. But then you ask yourself: What  happens if the specious present gets longer?   Say my specious present instead of being a tenth  of a second, say it expands to an hour. Well,   then what is in the future for the rest of  the world, an hour ahead, for my experience is   current. Because there is no distinction between  past, present and future.
(1:16:02) And so maybe even I   extend my species present for a day, and then  I'm seeing what's in the future by a day. So,   you can see how one particular psychic phenomena  - premonition, might be explained by extending   my specious present. But then, and that's to do  with if you like passive psychic experiences -  seeing the future.
(1:16:31) There are other experiences,  where you're actually affecting the physical   world. In that situation, I argue, the specious  present is shrunk. Again, the reason for this is   a little bit technical. It's just that in certain  models, when you affect a physical object like...   I
(1:16:54) focus on a cup and I move the cup, if you  believe that phenomena... most physicists don't,   but if you do - I think you have to say that  you're imparting information rather than   energy. So you imagine all these atoms, you're  telling all of the atoms to move to the left. So,   you're giving them the information to  move to the left. So, if that's true,   it's only one model of Psi... if that's true, it  means PK (Ed.
(1:17:13) psychokinesis) depends on transfer   of information. But information... if it's coming  from the brain... the brain can only generate   information at a certain rate. Now if you decrease  the specious present, the information rate can go   up and so on. In this argument, you would say  that PK was associated with a decrease of the   specious present. But the various forms of ESP  (Ed.
(1:17:40) extrasensory perception) are association   with an increase in the specious present. So,  that discussion may be rather too technical   and no one else may believe it except me. But at  least, I think that that's one possible model,   which relates the change in the specious  present to various different types of psychic phenomena. I would like to ask you a question.
(1:18:05)   Yeah, go ahead! Natalia, I was fascinated when you   said that you would experience the slowing down  of time when you fell off a mountain. Would you   like to elaborate on that? I don't know... I can't  even describe that it was slowing down. It's just   almost stopped... that was the feeling. It's an  inner feeling of things expanding within.
(1:18:25) So, you   don't register external world normally, the way  you normally register. And things are expanding,   and it seems like stopping is slowing down... a  little bit like that. When you say time stopped,   you meant in what sense? In the sense that the  outside world stopped, it slowed down so much?   When you fall off a mountain the outside world  slows down.
(1:18:50) So when you say 'time stopped',   do you mean the outside world froze? I can't  even describe it...maybe another example would   be better. I started diving some long time ago and  the first time we went diving into the depth - so   it was 40 m underneath, and even though I had  a prior experience of rock-climbing - when I   looked down and under me was the depth, something  happened... It's just all expanded, you know.
(1:19:27) I   had this feeling of an enormous, how to say it...  Like an out of body experience? I can't even say,   I just felt this Universe is so enormous, that  everything is so vast and I'm just part of it,   yeah. Maybe a unity experience, I don't know how  you call it.
(1:19:47) That is a common feature of mystical   experience. And at that moment the feeling is that  the time either doesn't exist at all or it just   froze. Yes. It's just not in a picture at all. I  mean first of all this experience of becoming one   with the universe - that's a common feature of  mystical experience.
(1:20:05) But the time is gone, it's   completely out of picture. Yes, but then sometimes  people say time ceases to exist. And I would only   say, you have to be very careful between time  ceasing to exist and your specious present   changing. Because if you see your whole life okay  in one go, as you do in a near-death experience,   you might say time ceases to exist.
(1:20:33) But it might  just mean your specious present is so long that it   looks like your whole life exists at one moment.  But you're still... the very fact you're still   conscious in some sense may mean there is still  an internal time. So it's a distinction between an   internal time, which you're experiencing, and the  outside time, which is a description of your life,   w
(1:20:59) hat you're seeing. But you know, Bernard, I  can relate a little bit... it's not exactly the   same... but I can relate... There is this movie  where, I don't remember the name. It was with Jody   Foster I think and about... they're building  a special craft, where they dropped her in a   capsule. Yes, of course. Where they dropped her in  a capsule.
(1:21:16) And she experiences all kinds of things   and when by the time she arrives... the passage  of time... Exactly! Outside was kind of normal,   right... almost normal. I know the movie very  well. You know, right? But inside - she had   her own experience, she had no feeling for time  outside. And that's a little bit the experience   I'm describing; you have no feeling for time  outside, you just expand within, you have your   own inner experience. Exactly! I think that movie  was called "Contact". Yeah, could be "Contact".  
(1:21:45) And the whole point was, as you say, her internal  time is vastly different from the external time.   But again, she's not transcending time, she's  just experiencing time in a different way. So,   I was only questioning whether one really is  transcended time or merely transcended the   normal experience of time. That's all I'm asking.
(1:22:08)   But it's interesting when you refer to movies,   because there are a lots of movies that have this  concept. I mean, for example, there's a lovely   movie called "Inception", which is all about  hierarchy of dreamings. Dreams within dreams   within dreams and how they each... in my language  they each have a different specious present.
(1:22:25) So,   that movie to me really encapsulates this whole  concept of a hierarchy of specious presents.   There's also the movie "Interstellar" - a more  recent movie - which I thought was a great movie.   But you might remember in that movie the person  goes into a black hole, and then goes back in   time. And this movie invokes in some sense this  extra dimension to get back in time.
(1:22:52) But what's   interesting about that movie - because the idea  of closed time-like curves arises in relativity;   there are solutions in relativity theory, which,  in some sense, allow you to go back in time. Not   all physicists like it, they try and exclude it.  But it's... in principle, they're allowed.
(1:23:11) And in   the movie "Interstellar" someone goes back in  time. But what's interesting is that the movie   explicitly associates this idea of going back  in time, this higher dimension if you like,   with mind.
(1:23:29) Because it's a mental experience and  that's what I personally found fascinating about   that movie. I'm not sure if it was intentional  but it was in a certain sense making a link   between mind-space and physical space. It's  actually raised one of the questions I have,   because we also interviewed Donald Hoffman,  Professor Hoffman, you know. And he just said   that time is just a dial on a dashboard.
(1:23:55) And  once we hack it, we will be able to manipulate   it. Would you agree to that? Well, this is very  interesting because I certainly agree with some   of the things that Donald Hoffman says. But this  last point you raised is particularly interesting.   What Donald Hoffman says is that, ultimately,  physics - the final description of physics - will   transcend space and time altogether.
(1:24:19) I talked  about the final theory of physics; that's to do   with quantum gravity, okay? That's when you merge  relativity and quantum theory, you have the theory   of quantum gravity. And the crucial question is:  in your final theory, what will be the role of   space and what will be the role of time? Some  people take the view that space is emergent and   time is the only reality.
(1:24:43) Other people take the  view that no, time is emergent and space is the   only reality. This sort of corresponds to string  theory and what's called loop quantum gravity.   But there's another view, which simply says that  both space and time are emergent. In other words,   in the final theory of physics they won't play  any role.
(1:24:59) But they emerge obviously; they're part   of our description of the world now. But if you  go back to the Big Bang or when the final theory   applies, space and time don't exist. And and that  could well be true. There are eminent physicists,   who argue that the final description of physics  will not involve space and time.
(1:25:21) So, what Donald   Hoffman says is, he says:" Right! Because we want  our description without space and time... that's   how consciousness is going to come in, because  some experiences seem to transcend space and time.   So, that might seem rather natural.
(1:25:41) So, he pushes  the view that the way, in which you're going to   reconcile mind with physics, is at the final level  where there's no space and time. Now, my approach   is subtly different because I'm saying: "Actually,  mental experience, spiritual experiences do   involve space and time, but it's not the normal  space and time; it's an extended space and time.
(1:26:02) "   And so that might seem to be different. But it's  an interesting point. I've been talking about   these experiences as so they involve a change in  the specious present. And I've been emphasising   that when people think they're transcending time,  maybe they're only just experiencing time in a   different way.
(1:26:24) However, what's interesting to  me is, if you look in the some of the religious   literature, it claims there is a mystical state in  which you really do transcend space and time. Your   specious present may become so small, almost zero,  that only the now exists. That's one mystical   state. But there's another mystical state in which  your specious present almost becomes infinite.
(1:26:45) So   the whole history of the Universe is seen in one  go; so, not just your life is seen as one go,   the whole history of the Universe has seen as one  go. So, this gives rise to the idea that well,   maybe there is an ultimate state in which  space and time are transcended. It's just   that these other lesser states like near-death  experiences etc.
(1:27:10) , they're just a step on the way;   they involve an extended view of space and time  before you get to the completely timeless state...   timeless, spaceless state. And I have to stress,  I've not had any of these experiences. I should   ask you if you have. But I've not had any of these  experiences, so I'm just talking hypothetically.  
(1:27:26) But I do think that when you go through the  hierarchy of states of consciousness... I do   think there may be an ultimate level where you  actually transcend it altogether, you know; you   transcend space and time altogether. That will be  what Donald Hoffman is referring to... but I would   argue, there's this intermediate state, which  still involves a sort of space and a sort of time.  
(1:27:51) So in that sense, I've got a different view from  Donald Hoffman. But, on the other hand, I do agree   with many aspects of his theory, which basically  says that, you know, our reality... in a certain   sense, you can say it's all a dream.
(1:28:11) So many of  the religious philosophers has preached that the   material world is just Maya - it's an illusion,  it's all a dream. And I don't mind if at a certain   level the physical world is a dream. The whole  point about these sorts of higher-dimensional   theories - as everything is ultimately in Mind  - mind-space encapsulates physical space and so,   in a certain sense, you might say everything is  a dream.
(1:28:38) Because if everything is in mind-space,   in a certain sense, it's semantics. But  you might say - everything is a dream! But   the point is there's a hierarchy of dreams so,  maybe, the whole physical worlds as a dream in   a certain sense of the word dream. But there're  also dreams, which I have when I fall asleep,   and that's a different type of dreams.
(1:28:59) So it's  dreams within dreams within dreams, as with "Inception". Regarding the specious present  concept... how would a person for whom the   world froze, for example that teapot you were  describing, that everything, the tea just became   solid almost, right? So, how that person then can  interact with the world, which is at a different   specious present rate so to speak? That's a very  interesting question.
(1:29:31) Let's take another example,   where it's not quite as dramatic. Let's take  the example, where you're in a car crash:   you're driving along, you're in a car crash, and  then what happens is that the outside world seems   to slow down.
(1:29:49) Remember, that your specious present  is actually getting smaller, but that the outside   world therefore seems to slow down, okay? Because  you have many internal moments for each external   moment so to speak. But then the question is:  if that's the case, is your body able to react   f
(1:30:11) aster? Can your body... because you might think:  "Well, the external world is slowing down, so I   can move around and I can avoid the accident, you  know. I can steer the steering wheel, and things   like that." On the other hand, you might say: my  body is part of the physical world and therefore   my physical body is also slowed down.
(1:30:30) So when I  try to move my hand, maybe, to turn the steering   wheel, my hand is also moving very slowly. So  I'm seeing the other car in slow motion but my   hand is also moving very slowly. Now, I have not  had this experience, so I don't know the answer,   and I don't know if any research has been done  into this.
(1:30:50) I suspect though, because simply from   a consistency point of view, that it probably  means that your hand is also restrained to move   slowly. So, on the other hand, people who've been  in car accidents do affirm that they can think   more quickly, relative to the outside world,  and they know what evasive action to take to   minimize the damage.
(1:31:15) So, even if they can't turn  the steering wheel, they can analyze the problem   more quickly. And it's interesting, because having  a car accident is rather dramatic and rather   negative. But I think even in sports, you see this  variation of the specious present. If you're a   tennis player, you've got to react to a tennis  ball coming at 120 miles an hour.
(1:31:33) In theory,   that's far too fast to react if you're acting on  a specious presence of a tenth of a second. So,   I think that even sports people are experiencing  a very different speed and some of them say that   they see things in slow motion.
(1:31:53) And I think  that's part of success in sports that people   actually change their specious present. I'm not  an expert on sports, so I can't really claim that,   but this is what some people claim. Now, there  in some sense... I don't think it's... it's not   actually making you move your hand any faster  but it does mean you're reacting and sending the   signal to your hand quicker.
(1:32:20) So, I think there is  a subtle interaction between your physical body,   even if it doesn't mean the actual body itself  moving faster. Because, you know, if your hand   isn't moving any faster when you're playing tennis  at top level but your reaction - the time you   tend to send the signal to the hand - is getting  faster. So, it's a very difficult question.
(1:32:40) One,   which I can't answer very clearly. But I think  there is an indication that, in a certain sense,   you can improve your physical reaction, even  if your body itself still seems to move in   slow motion. But what if our specious present is  expanding? How does the body react then? Well,   let's take the particular example of the person  lying in bed with a fever, who sees the flicking   light as the Sun rises and it sets.
(1:33:16) From my  perspective, the implication of that is this   person is unable to interact with the world on the  normal time-scale. Precisely because he cannot do   anything to interfere, because he can't. If he  wants to move something in the room, if he wants   to move the glass by his bed or something like  that - the implication would be, he can't do it.  
(1:33:37) Because his moment of now has expanded so much,  that he can't actually do anything on a time-scale   less than that... When I said the point about a  specious present is that you can't interact with   a consciousness on either a much shorter or  a much longer time-scale. This applies to the   interactions of your own body as well.
(1:34:11) So, I would  argue that in either case, you're not able to   actually do anything physical. When your specious  present is expanded, that means you're not able to   do anything either because you can't interact with  your body on a shorter time-scale. You see, this   experience of the flickering Sun, in a way, is no  different from what happens when you fall asleep   or have an anaesthetic. If you have an anaesthetic  - you lose consciousness.
(1:34:44) You wake up - no time   has existed in-between. So, now, imagine that  every 12 hours you're given an anaesthetic: so   you see the Sun rise, you're given an anaesthetic  - time doesn't exist. You wake up - the Sun sets.   You are given another anaesthetic - you'd have  the same experience. So.
(1:35:01) in principle, there's   no difference between this strange state and the  state is having lots of general anaesthetics. But   the point is... if you ask your question, then  how can you interact? I would say you can't,   when you're having a general anaesthetic; you  can't move your body.
(1:35:20) So it's the same argument   again: in either case, if you change specious  present, it limits the extent to which your body,   your own body, can interact with the rest of  the world. But this is all speculation because   I've not had any of these experiences. I've not  even had a general anaesthetic. And then, again,   we are back to: isn't it just a brain illusion or  is it really a change of state in comparison to   the other (outside) world... yeah... objectively  speaking. Yeah. I have another question. Every  
(1:35:58) scientist... physicists, mathematicians, they say  that our universe seemed to be such a finely tuned   system, however way you look at it; mathematically  or from the point of view of physics. Is it all   by design or is it random? Well, this is a  subject, which I'm very interested in.
(1:36:20) In fact,   I wrote a paper with Martin Rees in 1979 about  these so-called anthropic fine-tunings. And again,   it was rather controversial at the time,  because a lot of physicists didn't like   the idea of fine-tunings. Because it sounded too  philosophical or even theological. But the fact of   the matter is that there are these relationships  between the constants of physics, which seem to   be necessary in order for us to be here.
(1:36:54) Necessary  in order to have galaxies, and stars, and planets,   and chemistry. And to me, that's indisputable  - there are these fine-tunings. But they're   not explained by normal physics and that's a real  puzzle. Because if you chose all your constants of   physics randomly, life wouldn't be here, we  wouldn't be here asking questions about the   universe.
(1:37:24) So the question is - how to explain  that? It's called the anthropic principle by   the way. Anthropos is the Greek word for man,  not sexes, I mean human, if you like. But it's   a bad term, because this is not really anything  to do with humans in particular, but it's that's   the word we're stuck with.
(1:37:46) So the point is, how  do you explain those fine-tunings? And broadly,   there are two different approaches. One is to  say that there was a Creator, who tailor-made the   universe for life, and so the God, if you like,  designed the universe, so we could arise. So,   obviously, that's a theological perspective -  physicists don't like that, because physicists   don't want to bring God into it; physics is trying  to get rid of God and explain things in terms of   natural law.
(1:38:20) But the other explanation, which  even way back in 1979 I think we were aware of,   is to say well actually maybe there are just  many universes, maybe millions of universes,   in all of which, the constants are different;  may be randomly distributed. That's called the   multiverse. And then, it's merely saying we have  to be in one of the universes, where the constants   are appropriate for life.
(1:38:48) So, that saying  fine-tunings is a natural result of the fact   you've got lots of universes. So, you see, to have  a choice between God and one universe, or no God   and millions of universes... Now, by and large  physicists prefer the multiverse because they   don't want to invoke God. Now.
(1:39:11) But cosmologists  are split about the multiverse too, because some   people... Just as some people thought God is too  theological, some people think the Multiverse is   too certainly too philosophical. Because it's  equally mysterious. Because the point about the   m
(1:39:26) ultiverses - all these other universes, which  you can't see... So, is it science if you can't   see? How can it ever... if you can't prove they  exist, how could it ever be regarded as science,   if I can't see something? Well, it's not quite as  simple as that, because physics is full of ideas,   full of things, which you can't see but you  still believe in.
(1:39:41) You can never see inside a   black hole but it's still physics. You can  never see a quark, the subatomic particle,   but people still believe in quarks. So, it's not  true to say that something can't exist because you   can't see it.
(1:39:55) Because there quite a lot of things,  which we believe in physics even though we can't   see them. But it is certainly a philosophical  issue as to whether we regard the multiverse as   proper physics or philosophy. But it isn't...for  me, in fact, the evidence for the multiverse is   these fine-tunings because I've written a book  about the multiverse: Universe or Multiverse? I'm   a fan of the multiverse, that doesn't mean I don't  believe in God because, actually, I don't see why   God can't exist as well as the Universe. If you  believe in God, if he can create one universe - he  
(1:40:27) can create a multiverse as well. But the strange  thing is, I can write about the multiverse and   publish articles about it in the journals of  physics. And I can publish a book about it,   and now it's relatively respectable, I mean, it  was a taboo idea when we first wrote about it   in 1979.
(1:40:53) But now, it's relatively respectable; a  lot of very famous physicists like the idea of the   multiverse. People like Stephen Hawking and Steven  Weinberg and Leonard Susskind, and many famous   physicists are very happy with the multiverse now.  But the irony is that I regard the multiverse as   just as speculative, as anything I've said  about models of Psi and higher-dimensions.   But for sociological reasons, and in fact the  things I work on in physics like: black holes,   and time machines, and the many worlds, and  quantum theory are equally exotic and equally   speculative. But, somehow, I'm allowed to work  on those things without getting into trouble. If  
(1:41:30) I start talking about higher-dimensional Mind -  I'll get into trouble. I can talk to you, but if   I start talking to my physics friends.... so it's  an interesting sociological phenomenon. You know,   the argument of Stephen Hawking in his last book  against God was that time began with the Big Bang.
(1:41:53) And so God didn't have time to create anything.  Therefore, there is no God, right? But then,   there is this argument... so, at the same time,  this string theory says that there is an infinite   number of universes, where Big Bangs happen  all the time. So, then, there must be something   before Big Bangs. Yeah.
(1:42:24) So, is there something  before a Big Bang? Let me just say first of all   that string theory has this concept of a string  landscape, which have different values of what's   called the cosmological constant. So that's  a particular realization of the multiverse,   which I was just talking about. So, string theory  provides one particular version of the multiverse.   There are actually many different versions.
(1:42:49) But  another version of the multiverse is that, well,   there's one example of the multiverse is  you have a cyclic model, where the universe   expands and recollapses. And then, the idea  is that every time it collapses to a crunch,   big crunch, the constants of nature get changed.  So, the idea is that every cycle the constants are   different. And then, most cycles the constants  don't allow the existence of observers.
(1:43:13) So,   they're still born, if you like, but every  now and then the constants are right,   so that you can produce - the universe lights up  and becomes aware of it, like a light bulb. So,   that's a multiverse in time, okay? There's  also a multiverse in space. You have,   what's called the inflationary model of the early  universe, which says the universe expanded very   fast. And in that case you have our whole visible  universe is basically in a bubble.
(1:43:43) But there are   lots of different bubbles, okay? And, so each  bubble is one of the elements of the multiverse,   but that's a multiverse in some sense spread out  in space. The string landscape says: you've got   different universes, which have different values  of the cosmological constant.
(1:44:05) So, that's another   version of the multiverse. And there's another  version too, which corresponds to the many-worlds   interpretation of quantum mechanics. But that's  another issue. So, there are many different types   of multiverse.
(1:44:21) But I mentioned that because one  of the multiverse versions is the one, where you   have a universe, which is cyclic: expands and  re-contracts, expands and re-contracts. Now,   let's now go back to the question you originally  asked about whether time begins with a Big Bang. Hawking and Penrose discovered the  singularity theorems, which says that basically   the universe began with a singularity.
(1:44:49) If you go  back in time, there must have been a singularity,   which is basically a point where physics breaks  down. Relativity theory breaks down and that's   because density's become infinite and things like  that. And it was a remarkable discovery, this goes   back to the 1960s, that Einstein's theory predicts  its own downfall. And that was really important.  
(1:45:10) You also have singularities in black holes but  that's a separate type of singularity. Now,   people used to say: "Well, we just don't know  what happens at the singularity, because all   known physics breaks down." And you could just  say, therefore, that's beyond physics. So,   actually, when it was first suggested the universe  began with a Big Bang, this was taken as evidence   for God, because it was argued that this is like  genesis. And the Pope even said that this means,  
(1:45:45) you know, we can take... we can go back closer  and closer to the Big Bang. But we can't explain   the Big Bang itself; you need someone to light  the fuse. And so that was originally interpreted   as evidence for God. But physicists didn't like  that. But this is what the Pope said.
(1:46:05) But then,   that means that God or whatever Force there  is, operates outside of any laws of physics;   outside of space, outside of time, outside of  anything at all. Exactly! Because the idea would   be: physics breaks down, but therefore God - who  lights the fuse - has to be outside physics. Yes,   exactly! That would be the implication.
(1:46:32) Now, then  Stephen Hawking comes along and having proved   the existence of a singularity he then, 20 years  later, returned to the question of what happens to   a singularity. Instead of saying: we don't know,  physics breaks down. Let's try and understand what   happens. And that's what's called the domain of  quantum cosmology.
(1:46:48) And Steven and his group were   able to actually formulate a theory of physics,  which was able to describe what happens at the   Big Bang. And that's more complicated because it  involves quantum cosmology; so relativity theory   and quantum theory, merging them together.
(1:47:11) But one  of the features of his particular theory, which he   worked on with James Hartle and other physicists,  was that when you go back to the beginning of   time, to the beginning of the universe, time  in the technical sense, become space-like,   so because of the distinction between time and  space in relativity theory. But in some sense,   when you get back to the Big Bang, time becomes  space-like and this means that there is nothing   before the Big Bang.
(1:47:45) It's rather like saying:  what is north of the North Pole? When you get   to the North Pole, you've gone as far as you  can go. And so this is saying basically that   time itself begins at the Big Bang and so Hawking  and Hartle say the universe, time and space, are   born with the Big Bang, that's what happens at the  singularity.
(1:48:08) But now he's got a description within   physics itself, because quantum cosmology is part  of physics. So then he says: "I don't need God;   the universe explains itself." And he wrote a book  called Stephen Hawking's Universe and a TV show,   which basically had the view that everything...  the universe explains itself.
(1:48:28) You don't need   God. So, then he went back to the Vatican, and  he spoke to another Pope, and he gave a talk,   which was more or less saying: we don't need God.  Although I don't think the Pope probably heard   it that way. But then, you've got to realize  that actually Hawking may be wrong. I mean we   don't really understand what happens in quantum  cosmology.
(1:48:50) He was arguing that time begins at the   Big Bang. Other people think that the universe  actually... there was a big crunch, that before   the expansion phase there was in a contraction  phase. This is the cyclic model, which I referred   to before when I was talking about the multiverse.  So, it's not clear that time begins at the Big   Bang.
(1:49:12) Some people think that time existed before  the Big Bang but you were just in a collapsing   universe. So, the answer is - we just don't know.  I mean a singularity basically means you don't   know for sure, even though we're trying to answer  it... so some people quite like the idea of a   cyclic universe. Now, the point about a cyclic  universe is it may sort of go on forever.
(1:49:30) So,   you postpone the question of how was the universe  created. Because if the cycles go on indefinitely   in the past, you never have to ask where did the  universe come from, because it just carries on   forever. It was always there... You only have  a problem creating the universe if it began at   this finite time.
(1:49:54) I can't imagine 'forever'!  Nor can I! There must be a genesis, there must   be a starting point somewhere, right...even in  the cycles. Exactly! But you're now appealing   to sort of intuitive argument. I personally don't  like Infinitis either; I don't believe in, I don't   like the idea of a universe that goes on forever,  and has existed forever.
(1:50:13) Infinity is a feature of   mathematics. I suspect it never really arises  in physics. When you get Infinities in physics,   it's only because the physics has broken down; you  get an infinite density - it's a singularity...   because the physics is broken down. In reality,  the extended physics is going to get rid of   t
(1:50:35) hat infinite density. So, I don't like... I I'm  quite happy with a psychic universe but I prefer   a psychic universe, which still has a beginning.  And it's rather like we don't know whether the   universe is going to expand forever or recollapse.  It looks at the moment as though it's going to   expand forever, but I don't like the idea of going  on forever.
(1:50:51) I'd like to think the universe will   recollapse. So, my own view is: I like the psychic  universe, but which still has a start. After all,   most cycles do have a start and maybe an end. So  what I'm saying is, the whole history of whether   you need God is very interesting. At first, the  Big Bang seem to support God.
(1:51:13) Then the Big Bang   and the multiverse seem to do away with God,  and remember if you got a multiverse, it's not   just one Big Bang anyway. But in my own model,  remember, I think of these higher dimensions,   which represent mind. In my own model, these  higher dimensions - we don't normally see, but   when you go back to the beginning of the universe,  these higher dimensions become manifest.
(1:51:40) And so,   when you go back to the beginning of the universe,  the universe is higher-dimensional. Well,   in my picture those higher dimensions are  Mind, so what you really saying is the   universe comes from Mind. Again, that's not  something the physicists will like but if you   start accepting that the higher-dimensions are  associated with Mind, you are saying that what   came before the universe - Mind.
(1:52:11) And if you want  to in some sense go even further you might say,   well, if Spirit precedes Mind, you could say even  Spirit as well. So, obviously you're getting to   a very dangerous theological domain now, where it  is like saying God created the universe. However,   it all depends what you mean by God because the  word God is very vague.
(1:52:29) I've talked about this   Universal Consciousness: Consciousness with the  big C and obviously you might want to identify   that with God in some sense. Some philosophers  were saying that this was a necessary existence,   of itself and in itself, that does not need  any explanation. This is what most scientists,   m
(1:52:54) ost physicists, Hawking would like to say,  that you don't ever need to invoke... No,   there is God, so they say there is God but it's  a necessary existence - The One. Oh, people who   believe in it. Yes, of course, you can tackle that  question from a philosophical perspective. Yes,   neoplatonic... I'm not a philosopher so, in some  sense, I can't get involved in that discussion.  
(1:53:10) But just from a physical perspective, I would  say that if you think of my model of Mind as a   physical model, it's saying... if you think of  this Universal Mind, in some sense, as being   God or part of God - you're putting God into the  picture as well. But it all depends on what you   mean by God. Exactly! But we're using so many  terms.
(1:53:35) And often we talk about consciousness,   we talk about mind, we talk about spirit. Maybe we  start with consciousness? What is consciousness to   you? Well, you know, that is a very complicated  question because you can ask a 100 people what   consciousness is and you'll get 101 replies.  That's why I said: to you.
(1:53:52) The word consciousness   is used in so many different ways; all these words  - Mind, Spirit, Soul, God - they're all used in so   many different ways. Unbelievable, yes! And a  lot of the disagreements arise because of the   fact they're being used in different ways. You  also have to distinguish between contents of   consciousness and consciousness itself.
(1:54:14) Normally,  when I'm talking about my higher-dimensional   space, which accommodates mental experiences, I'm  talking about the contents of consciousness. Now,   that's different from the consciousness  itself - the first-person awareness itself, because that is what's related... Whatever  consciousness is, it involves a sense of self and   it involves the passage of time.
(1:54:42) But then the  question is - what do you mean by the sense of   self? Because as I said, there's a hierarchy of  levels of consciousness and that corresponds to   a hierarchy of levels of self. So at this level  you and I, Natalia and Bernard, are different   beings in this space. But at a higher level of  consciousness you and I, and maybe everybody else,   they're part part of a single self; sort of bigger  self.
(1:55:08) And maybe when you get to the highest level   of all, there's only one Self, with a big S, which  you might want to identify with God. And all of   these are different levels of consciousness. So,  when you say what is consciousness, my answer is   inevitably going to depend upon my particular  theory of what consciousness is. And someone   with a different theory of consciousness will  give you a different answer.
(1:55:30) But within my own   theory I can answer what consciousness is to some  extent, and it has this hierarchical structure.   But another person, who didn't believe my theory,  might well have a different theory. This is true   in general in physics. Your answer to the question  depends on your theory. That's true.
(1:55:53) You know,   it's like asking a physicist what is energy  or what is... the answer will depend on his   own theory of what energy is. You know, it's  like one of the questions I have. When I went   to school and I had physics classes, it was all  clear; we had laws of nature, it was all solid,   you know. You just follow, you know, the equations  and you will arrive at the same results.
(1:56:20) Now,   I listen to all kinds of scientists and looking  at the quantum physics, they say: "No, no... there   are no laws of nature. There are tendencies  and trends." Is that true? Do we have laws of   natures? Or we don't? Or we have both? That's  a very interesting question because the point   is that the laws of nature only apply in certain  domains.
(1:56:46) The way, in which we discovered the laws   of nature within physics is by, in some sense,  only observing a certain part of the universe.   You consider this universe in isolation... this  part of the universe in isolation, and you don't   have to worry about other sort of complications.  Then you come to understand this system, how...   what the laws of nature are.
(1:57:10) And so, for example,  Newton discovers his laws of mechanics and the law   of gravitation. And that is observed to work very  well, when studying the solar system and things   like that. But then, what you find is that as  you go on, as physics progresses, you find that   your laws weren't completely comprehensive; they  only applied in a certain context. If you have   a bigger context, other factors come in and they  require a slightly more complicated picture.
(1:57:36) So,   Newton knew about gravity. Then you had to  accommodate electromagnetism, when we discovered   the forces of electricity and magnetism. Every  time you look at a new phenomenon or expand   the context you find you have to change the laws  somewhat. So, for example, Newton's Laws prevailed   for 300 years.
(1:58:02) Einstein comes along and says: "No,  we have relativity theory, which applies at high   speed." And then you have to have a different set  of laws. But this different set of laws contain   the first set of laws. So, it's not as though the  first laws were wrong they were right in their   context. It's just that you have to broaden the  context.
(1:58:19) And then general relativity came along   and showed this special relativity was only an  approximation. So physics progresses by changing   the paradigm progressively. And every time you  have a new paradigm, you show that the previous   laws were actually... just weren't the full story;  they applied only in a special context. Now,   the most dramatic illustration of that came with  quantum theory: we discovered at the beginning   of the 20th century quantum mechanics, which is  the description of the micro domain.
(1:58:53) And that's   completely different from the classical picture.  Particles aren't like billiard balls - as they   were in Newton's model - they're described by a  quantum wave and that collapses, when you make   an observation. And so they then become localized  or attain a certain state.
(1:59:17) But there're many other   anomalies associated with quantum theory. You  have the so-called entanglement: objects can be   separated by a large distance but still connected  even though that seems to be inconsistent with   the laws of relativity, and things... well  I won't go into the complications of quantum   theory because it's a complicated issue.
(1:59:40) But the  point is, quantum theory and relativity theory are   completely inconsistent. They're incompatible:  quantum theory works on the microscopic level,   in the microscopic domain, with amazing precision.  You know, you can test it to 12 places of decimals   and it works.
(1:59:58) Relativity works in the macroscopic  domain to incredible precision; to 12 places of   decimals. We detect gravitational ways of things  - a wonderful proof of relativity. However,   the remarkable thing is: these two theories are  not compatible. So one - it works in that context,   the micro context. That works in the macro  context. That's why we're looking for the   final theory, which I referred to earlier on in  the conversation, which marries these two theories   together.
(2:00:26) That's the theory, I hope, which  is going to accommodate consciousness in some   sense. But is it possible at all? Some people say  it's not possible... Well, I mean the point is,   there has to be a final theory. I mean we  don't agree. No one has found the theory yet,   it might take a thousand years. There has to be a  final theory, I mean, which is going to reconcile   these two theories. Whether it's going to contain  consciousness - I don't know.
(2:00:50) But it's only,   to me, a question of when we find this theory,  and whether this theory is going to contain   consciousness. There must be such a theory  because the physical world... physics works   so beautifully, it provides such a comprehensive  unified explanation of the world. There has to   b
(2:01:16) e a final... well, it may not be a final theory  in the sense that it may just be what... You see,   what particle physicists call a theory of  everything is just a theory of particles;   it's a very pretentious phrase a theory of  everything, and the normal theory of everything,   is the part physicist use... it doesn't make any  reference to consciousness at all. When people   talk about the triumph of physics, they're not  actually talking about Consciousness and Mind at   all. That's why I think physics has to be expanded  to accommodate my experience of the world.
(2:01:48) But   some physicists will think of theory of everything  as just being a theory of elementary particles.   What I'm saying is: "No, the theory of everything  has to include consciousness!" But we don't for   sure know who's right.
(2:02:05) It may be the first set of  physicists correct, even though they are rather   ambitious. But I hope they're wrong. But the point  I'm making is that, paradigms, physical paradigms,   are really just mental models. The theory of  physics now, the picture of the world from   physics, has no connection with our common sense  view of reality, okay? The common sense view of   reality is the classical Newtonian picture of  three dimensions with clocks.
(2:02:32) That's wrong,   but that's common sense reality. So, what physics  has done it's gone through a series of paradigm   shifts involving, for example, well, the split  between classic and relativity, but also involving   higher dimensions: from three to four to five  dimensions - Kaluza-Klein theory - all the way   to 11 dimensions in M-theory.
(2:03:00) And so, in a certain  sense, when you refer to the fact that the laws of   physics are always changing - that's correct.  But it doesn't mean all the previous effort   was wasted, there're steps on the way. They're  just - it's a progression of mental models. And   I always say: "What's interesting in physics is  not whether your theory is ultimately right - all,   most things are wrong in the end, but whether  it's useful. Whether it's a step on the way.
(2:03:22) And   so I argue that there will be a theory, I don't  really like calling it a theory of everything   because we don't know it's everything - what is  everything? But I think there will be a theory,   which merges relatively and quantum theory and has  consciousness.
(2:03:37) But that in itself, may not be the   final theory, you know. There may be a theory,  which goes beyond space and time altogether,   who can tell... Maybe the journey never ends, so  maybe, what I'm saying... instead of saying it's   a theory of everything - it's certainly a theory  of much, it's theory of more than what we've got   at the moment, to put it that way.
(2:04:00) It's a theory  of more than just matter - it's a post-materialist   science. I was wondering how can we incorporate  consciousness into a theory or a way of doing   science? Because consciousness by definition  means a first-person perspective and today the   scientific method is objective, so it means it's  a third-person perspective, almost always. So,   the moment we do incorporate it, would it not  become just a subjective exchange of ideas I would   say? Well, how do you see that? Would we not loose  science? It is true that conventional physics,   maybe conventional science, but let's just  talk about physics... Conventional physics  
(2:04:39) does have a third person description of the  world, even though it involves observations,   which are made by individuals. The physics itself  is describing the third-person perspective.   So when you say you want to expand physics to  incorporate the first-person perspective, well,   when you say you want to take the first-person  perspective, you might argue, by definition,   that's beyond physics.
(2:05:15) But that depends on your  concept of physics, because the distinction   between third-person and first-person is that  third-person is associated with an objective   reality and first-person is thought to be  associated with a subjective experience in   your head, as we said before. But what if that  subjective reality is itself part of a high...   well, what if that subjective experience is itself  part of a reality, which goes beyond the normal   m
(2:05:53) aterial reality? Then the distinction between  first-person and third-person no longer... you can   no longer exclude first personhood. It's rather  like I mentioned that time, the passage of time,   goes beyond... people say, philosophers say:  "The passage of time is a feature of mind and   not a feature of the physical world.
(2:06:16) " But if you  have a theory of physics, which includes Mind,   then it also includes the passage of time. So,  your expansion of physics actually is going to   accommodate certain features of first personhood,  because the mental... it's so... the assumption   that third-person is real and first-person is  imaginary - that's what I'm disagreeing about.  
(2:06:36) I'm saying even your first-person experience,  even your mental experience, is also part of   a higher-dimensional reality. So, I'm extending  the concept of reality. That still doesn't answer   a
(2:06:55) ll the questions because it's... there's a very  profound question, which I often ask, which is:   "Why am I Bernard and why are you in Natalia?  Even if you believe there's only one Mind and,   ultimately, we're one Eye. But if this one Eye,  this one Mind is fragmented into billions of   little minds, you still got to ask the question:  why am I Bernard and why are you Natalia? And   that's a really difficult question.
(2:07:24) You see,  I always give this example, imagine you and I   are born at the same time - I mean you're younger  than me, but let's imagine we're born at the same   time - in the same maternity ward. Your brain  lights up and my brain lights up at exactly,   at the same time, okay? So, the question is: why  am I in my brain and you're in your brain? Now, a materialist, who believes that the brain generates  consciousness, would say that's not even a   meaningful question because it presupposes there  is something outside the brain, which somehow gets  
(2:07:55) anchored in a brain. But that's meaningless...  if you believe the brain generates consciousness,   that's meaningless. And yet how can it be  meaningless because I am me and I'm not you. So,   to me the very fact of my being me, disproves  the view that the brain generates consciousness.  
(2:08:18) Because if the question is meaningless within that  standard paradigm - that paradigm must be wrong,   in my view. So, that to me.... But you see, it's  the first personhood, which raises this issue.   Because I am me - as first person you're Natalia  - as first person.
(2:08:42) And then the question is:   how do you explain first personhood? And, in my  theory, it's all to do with the nature of time;   I as you know, I've argued that you  need a higher-dimensional view of time,   in order to explain first personhood.  But first personhood is complicated,   because there's a hierarchy of first persons.
(2:09:05) But  the point is, I am using an extension of physics,   which does now relate to first personhood. Whether  you want to call it physics is another matter   because... different people will define physics  in different ways. It's not normal physics. I'm   talking about, this higher-dimensional physics,  as opposed to the physics on the brain.
(2:09:26) But it's   physicists themselves, who are invoking these  higher dimensions... But even physicists,   some disagree, I mean, some physicists think  that M-theory is mathematics rather than physics   because it doesn't relate to the physical world.  But there nothing in physics now really relates to   the common sense physical world.
(2:09:50) So, I take  the view that the new physics will actually   accommodate first personhood. But in all these  statements I'm deviating from the mainstream view. That's in your view a direction forward?  If we are to expand and create such a theory   that would reconcile all these elements  and include everything that we exclude   today from the scientific method? Yeah,  I mean, the question is how do you test   these sorts of things? Exactly! I mean, if you  say what's the evidence for extra dimensions?   Yeah. There could conceivably be evidence from  physics, because physicists are looking for  
(2:10:21) these extra dimensions. They looked at them in  the Large Hadron Collider - they haven't found   them! That doesn't mean that they don't exist.  It just means that there is a different scale,   that we haven't reached the energies required to  see the higher dimensions.
(2:10:38) Now, it's conceivable   you'll never have the energy to see these extra  dimensions - that'll be rather frustrating. So   the people who criticize M-theory because there's  no evidence for it; well, they may be so right in   a thousand years - that would be rather sad.
(2:10:52) I  like to think there will eventually be evidence,   but until then, I would claim that the evidence  for the extra dimensions actually comes from   experience. I would say people experience extra  dimensions in the first-person even if they   haven't yet demonstrated their existence in the  third-person. But it's an intriguing thought that,   if ever they do discover extra dimensions in  the Large Hadron Collider, in some weird way,   this is probing Mind. Sounds crazy but that's  some of the implications of this idea.
(2:11:26) What do   you expect will be the biggest breakthroughs in  physics and in astronomy in the coming years? Do   we already know what we don't know? Well, I  mean, you're now asking me a question in my   conventional cosmological capacity. Yeah, as  a scientist with broad interests. Undoubtedly,   as an astronomer I know what the key problems are:  what is the dark matter, what is the dark energy,   w
(2:12:02) hich is causing the universe to accelerate?  Because most of the universe... 70% of the   universe is in dark energy. 25% of the universe is  in dark matter and 5% of the universe is visible   matter, like you and me. So, it's very frustrating  that most the universe - we just don't know what   it is.
(2:12:23) But nevertheless, cosmologists are working  on this and trying to find out, you know, what it   is. And I think we will know eventually, we'll  know eventually what the dark matter and what   the dark energy is. We don't know for sure what it  is - I have my own theories but that goes beyond   the current conversation.
(2:12:37) So, undoubtedly, that  will be an important breakthrough and astronomy   is always making developments, you know. Detection  of gravitational waves is giving us all sorts of   insights into those sorts of questions. I think  what happens at the Big Bang - I think we're going   to get more evidence about that.
(2:12:53) We're going to  know whether there was a previous cycle - I think   observational evidence will come to bear on that.  That's within cosmology. Within particle physics   we're going to, I think, to find out whether  you've got super symmetry. You know the most   recent development was the discovery of the Higgs  boson - the so-called God Particle, which sort of   verified the standard model of particle physics.
(2:13:18)   But we know the standard model of particle physics   isn't complete either. And that's why you invoke  other ideas, such as what's called supersymmetry,   and that's part of the way to M-theory, the final  theory maybe. But so I think within particle   physics, there may be exciting developments:  verifying supersymmetry or finding the particles,   which make up the dark matter - if that's what  the dark matter is.
(2:13:46) Supersymmetry? Just for people   to know what that is...Oh, supersymmetry... you've  got two types of particles in nature: you've got   the fermions, which are the actual particles like  protons and electrons and neutrons, which make up,   you know, the solid matter.
(2:14:04) But then there're  the bosons - which are particles associated   with the forces between those particles. So, for  example, electromagnetism reflects the photons,   the strong force is transmitted by gluons,  and the gravitational force is transmitted by   gravitons. So, all of these particles, they are  called bosons and technically they have a spin.   And this graviton is... spin two, the photon - is  spin one... but that's getting too technical.
(2:14:42) So,   those are the bosons on the fermions. So, the  fermions are the particles you're made of. The   bosons are the particles that transmit the forces  between them; they're separate because they have   different spins. The fermions have got spin half  okay whereas the bosons have got integer spin.
(2:15:04) But   there is a version of particle physics, which  amalgamates the bosons and the fermions, and   that's called supersymmetry. Well, that's a theory  but it still hasn't been experimentally verified   yet. Because if it's true, there are all sorts of  other particles, which haven't yet been found.
(2:15:23) But   that's getting a little bit technical. So, that's  developments in particle physics. For me the key   thing is going to be experiments, which find  the higher dimensions because for me at least,   these higher dimensions are really important.
(2:15:43) And  if you could get experimental evidence for that,   I think, that would be a gainer, a huge paradigm  shift. If they do find the extra dimensions,   I of course, will jump in and say: "Ah, they're  the extra dimensions I need!" If they don't   find the extra dimensions, I can't do that. So,  obviously I hope they find the extra dimensions.  
(2:16:01) But the point about physics is, you often can't  anticipate what the next breakthroughs are going   to be. I'm just telling you what at the moment we  are anticipating. Yeah. But I was thinking about   l
(2:16:22) ike... gravity, you know, even Aristotle was  still observing some correlations between objects,   and at the time, when gravity wasn't even named  or formulated in any way, right? Then Newton   came - formulated it as a force. Then Einstein  came - formulated it as a field. But even at the   time of Aristotle, they were already describing  some things happening. So, they already knew that,   y
(2:16:44) ou know, something exists, they couldn't name  it yet. So, that's why I say... Absolutely,   and that's true of phenomena in general; you first  observe them and you might just be wondering about   it for a few hundred years. And you get a theory  of them, and then that theory might not not be   c
(2:16:59) orrect. In a few hundred years you get another  theory. So but the phenomena... it's rather like   when we talk about psychic experiences; people  have been having psychic experiences for thousands   of years. You can go back to the ancient Greeks  and they all talk about near-death experiences   and telepathy, and things like that.
(2:17:15) So, the idea  is very old and it's just the way, in which you're   able to investigate the idea and then begin to  theorise about the idea. That's what's developing.  Yeah. So, having worked in academia and on  parapsychological phenomena, what recommendations   or advice could you give to your young colleagues:  how to approach and how to do science going   forward? Well, this is interesting. It's a  sociological question.
(2:17:43) When I was graduating,   I had to decide whether to do a PhD in  parapsychology or cosmology. At that time there   were no jobs in parapsychology and therefore I  went... and I was fascinated in cosmology as well.   So it's not as though it was second best. But  so, there was no question, I would do cosmology,   and I was advised, I was told - establish your  reputation first in a conventional field.
(2:18:11) And   then, when you start talking about parapsychology,  people might listen to you. You see, people might   think my ideas about Mind are crazy but they will  listen to me when I talk about cosmology. So,   they might say: "Oh, well, he might not be  completely crazy because he's written a good   paper about black holes or something like that.
(2:18:34) "  So that's advice I was given: establish yourself   in a respectable area of science, and then you  can later on talk about these other things. Well,   now I'm retired, you see, so I can now talk about  these other things without losing my job. But the   situation has changed a bit.
(2:18:49) I mean, in a way,  that's the sad state of affairs because you'd   like people to be able to work on these things  now, because people are constantly saying,   I'm fascinated in these ideas: matter, mind, and  spirit. I want to do a PhD in them, where do I   go? The situation is better now; I referred  earlier in our conversation to the fact that   there have been 100 PhDs in parapsychology but  that's in psychology departments, not in physics   departments.
(2:19:16) I would look forward to a time,  when you've got the post-materialist paradigm;   when actually people can do a PhD and publish  papers in mainstream journals on these topics.   The problem even at the moment, I can't recommend  someone to do a PhD in this subject if they really   w
(2:19:35) ant to pursue a conventional academic career,  because they're not... It will be hard to get   a job as a post-doc and than as a professor,  if they've been working on a controversial   area. But the thing is, and it'll be hard to  get funds for it as well... but the thing is,   that what is conventional changes with  time. So, over the passage of 100 years,   the situation changes; consciousness was a taboo  word only 30 years ago.
(2:19:59) Physicists would never   talk about it. Now they can talk about it. So,  they can do a PhD in neuroscience and even the   physics of consciousness. The 'anthropic' - I've  talked about the fine-tunings, that was a taboo   word certainly 45 years ago.
(2:20:19) Now people talk about  it, because the multiverse is, in some sense,   respectable. So, you can now start talking about  the anthropic; we never called it 'the anthropic',   we used to call it 'the A word', okay? But that's  becoming respectable. So, there's a C word, which   is becoming respectable. There's the A word, which  is becoming respectable.
(2:20:35) You still really can't   talk about the P word, which is parapsychology  or the G word, which is God or even the S word,   which is spiritual in certain quarters. I mean,  I'm talking about physicists, so but it's a   gradual (change). So, the situation in another  20 years may be different, and I hope there will   be this new paradigm.
(2:21:00) And then, when the paradigm  has come, that will mean you can do your PhD and   get a professorship in studying this extended  physics. But that's not... still not the case   at the moment. But the situation is improving,  so you can still do a PhD on, well, neuroscience   and quantum theory and things like that. So,  I would still say to somebody - and I do say,   because people do approach me - I'd say: "Look,  only do this if you're really passionate about   it. You should only ever do a PhD if you're really  passionate about it. But I can't promise you'll  
(2:21:31) get a job at the end of it. And so, if you're  thinking about your long-term academic career,   even now, you probably shouldn't be working  in this area because there's still a great   bias against it. For me - a completely unjustified  bias, but there is a bias there.
(2:21:55) And I don't mind,   I know most of my physics colleagues won't take  seriously some of the things I have talked about   this afternoon, but doesn't bother me at all.  Because I don't feel any great need to convert   them, they're doing their thing.
(2:22:09) Stephen Hawking  was my friend and supervisor - he wouldn't have   accepted any of this, he didn't believe in Psi,  he didn't believe in the God or anything like   that. And that was fine, because we disagreed, but  Stephen was a great physicist and he was a genius   at what he did. I didn't want him to get put his  mind into all... in these other directions.
(2:22:27) So,   I'm quite happy for physicists to be doing  what they're doing, because science is all very   narrow now. You can only... whatever your area of  science, you can only focus on a very narrow area   a
(2:22:47) nd you can't be aware of all the other things.  So, I don't have any great... that doesn't bother   me. But it does mean that I wouldn't have been  able to get a career, if earlier on in my career,   if I'd done my... if I was writing my PhD on this  topic, I would never have got a post-doc position,   I would never become a professor.
(2:23:10) So, even though  I don't mind if people don't take me seriously,   it does upset me the fact that I couldn't have had  an academic career, if I'd been writing papers on   it. And so, that's still true I think today. So,  sort of: follow your heart but keep in mind your   career choices as well, still.
(2:23:26) Yeah, because,  after all, I've always worked on my ideas,   but I've done them in my spare time. Because, you  know, we only work eight hours a day, whatever it   is we work now, to get our salary. So, it's not  our whole life is given up to your professional   c
(2:23:41) areer. And now I'm retired of course, I have even  more time for it... Yeah, but in any case, I think   we would expect from science to be maybe a little  bit more open-minded than the mainstream science   currently is. And I think that when... because it  is becoming more open-minded. I mean the history   of science is the history of science becoming  more open-minded and expanding the domains of   science to areas, which were originally thought to  be beyond science.
(2:24:03) So, the situation is improving   but it's improving on a quite a long time-scale -  a 100 years, so that's sort of... We should change   our specious present! Exactly, exactly! With a  bigger specious present. That would help, yeah!   Bernard, thank you very much for this rich and  very insightful conversation.
(2:24:20) Thank you Natalia!   You asked many interesting questions. Thank you!  And I would like to ask you more questions. But   maybe next time... Over a cup of tea. Yeah, over a  cup of tea! And let's hope the tea freezes. Yeah!   And we're in the same specious present.
(2:24:38) Thank you!  Thank you! Thank you for watching! We hope that   you enjoyed this conversation. I've had quite  a few WOW moments and I wish the same for you!
