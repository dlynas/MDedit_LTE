without further ado it is my pleasure to
welcome beau
thanks very much um
dana and thanks very much everyone for
having me um
i'll start today by
just noting um
what a particular pleasure it is to be
addressing the how to
academy for
a really long time
the working title that i had for this
book
which came out as good arguments in the
us and
the art of disagreeing well in the uk
they're not two separate books
the working title i had for it was how
to disagree well
and
i thought it was a selling title i was
wrong about that
but
i wanted and i think the final product
still has in its dna
um that desire to be useful
to give people more souls of information
and steps they can take to be additive
in their disagreements whether it be at
home or in the workplace or
out in the public square
but more substantively that title points
to
um
two things that animate this project
that i think i sort of share with the
how to academy the first is
that arguing is a skill
that we're used to thinking about
disagreements as just a fact of life
as a description of the way things are
if you feel one way i feel some other
way we're in a state of disagreement
we sometimes think about disagreement as
like a natural disaster that just
visits upon us now we're in a
disagreement now what do we do
um
whereas
i think one of the things that has
allowed
our public conversations to get
as divisive and painful as they are
today
is that we've forgotten that disagreeing
is also a skill
it's a craft
it's work
it's a kind of an art
and um
and perhaps
restoring the quality of our
conversations requires us to step back
into that and so to be in a forum that
talks about the how-to of it i think has
done a part of my job for me which is
convincing you that this is something
you can get better at
the second part of it is
and a part of what animates this project
is just a belief of where i think
the site of action can be when it comes
to
improving the state of our conversations
which is responsible in large part for
the health of our organizations and even
the health of our
society
and
my view is that it starts with
people like us
right it is true that
a lot of debaters end up in very
powerful positions in government and
business and so on
but i think it's also true at this
moment that
um
the cultural elite the political elite
and the kind of
example they set for
how we hash out our disagreements in
public
have proven lacking in a lot of ways
and
you know sometimes people ask me whether
debating is a kind of an elite
activity
and i think i might have a dimmer view
of the elite than that
and and part of my
hope is
when we as individual citizens as
members of families members of
workplaces
um
start to relearn some of these skills
that we can through one conversation at
a time um start making things better
so
with that in mind i'll try and do three
things um
just to get the ball rolling today
um i'll go on for about um
maybe 40 minutes
and then we'll have a dedicated q a at
the end um but i've now been on the tour
with this book for about two months
which is um
sort of a purgatory experience and so
uh rather than kind of talking at you
i'll i'll invite
um
some engagement throughout the
presentation
so the way to do that um is through the
q a
box
um or the chat box i think i can see
both um so please feel free to start
dropping in questions now if as they
occur to you if you think you'll forget
um but in times where some engagement
would help um
i ask for your
patience and and and cooperation
so i'll try and do three things
the first is i'll tell you the story of
how it is that i came to write this book
and i'll weave in throughout four
lessons um that
give you a flavor of of of the kind of
teaching i want to do with the book
um and
and and can hopefully be useful
takeaways unto themselves that um that
you can
um go away from this presentation
knowing and and feeling a bit more
confident about using
then i'll tell you a bit more about
what's in the book
and then i'll
offer two questions
that i think i'm still not
terribly sure about on this subject
matter
and that uh
i would ask for
your input and and your thinking and i
think those are two questions that might
be of particular relevance to this
audience
so how did i come to
write this
book i moved
when i was eight years old from south
korea to australia with my parents
and i didn't speak english at the time
and
i quickly learned that and some of you
might have had that experience of of
moving across borders or
or even different linguistic communities
i learned that the hardest part of doing
that
is adjusting to
real-life conversation
which are nothing like
what you see in the textbooks
of the rabbit asking the bird what time
it is or something like that
um and
uh
and i also learned that the hardest
conversations to adjust to were
arguments
because that was when passions tended to
run
and people's facial expressions stopped
matching
what was coming out of their mouths
the rhythms of ordinary speech began to
break down
and people started to interrupt
and i
since then even as a kid
um what a lot of newcomers to a place i
think feel which is that
their belonging
to that new place is conditional
um
it's
it extends only in so far as
you don't rock the boat
too much
or
you don't challenge the way things are
that you put in a good faith effort to
assimilate and and fit yourself around
the surroundings
um
and i felt that voicing any differences
that i had with my peers would
mark me out as an outsider
and would unsettle
what foothold of belonging i'd been able
to achieve and and though i i
experienced that in a very particular
way through the experience of migration
um
i think this is an experience we all
have when we go to a new place a new
workplace
um a new neighborhood even a gathering
where we don't know very many people
and
the same thing that happens to us in
those
situations happen to me which is i
resolve to be
very agreeable
i learned to smile
and nod my head
and keep most of my thoughts to myself
and i thought i would that would be the
kind of the groove
in which i would ride out most of my
life
and the thing that broke me out of that
that posture of
conflict
diversion was something that my year
five
teacher
my elementary school teacher told me
which was
on
the debating team
in debating
when one person speaks
no one else does
and to someone who had been spoken over
and interrupted and spun out of
conversation
that sounded like a kind of salvation
so the first thing that i learned about
debating that brought me into the
activity
was that every disagreement
should start with some agreement
and that's agreement about how we're
going to have the conversation
that we're going to give each party an
equal amount of time to speak
that we're not going to interrupt
and instead we're going to take turns
right so i get a go
you get a go
but i'm going to get a chance to respond
so i don't have to interrupt you right
away
and that that amount of agreement
created a kind of an acoustics
um
that gave me the confidence that i might
be heard
so the first lesson that i wanted to
share with you today
and i'm going to try and share a screen
here
and this i'm going to ask for some
participation here
is that every
disagreement should start with some
agreement
that's agreement about the rules of how
we're going to have the conversation but
it's also crucially
agreement about what it is that we're
going to disagree about
right what it is that the conversation
is about
so i'll try and illustrate this point um
here
and if you're um if you're having issues
seeing it
um
please just
bring it to my attention through a
flowery of texts or um
or something else
so the first lesson i wanted to share
today is
that
when we go into a disagreement
we should start by
naming the disagreement
and i'll give you an illustration of how
this works in debating how i think it
might apply to everyday life and how it
helped me when i was um
when i was that kid who was just
starting out on the debating team
so
think about a a disagreement like this
um which um
a lot of my friends who are young
parents um
often have
um which is
whether we should send the kids
um to the local public school and by
public school in this instance i mean um
government government school i know it
hasn't in
um it's in it might be inverted in the
uk but government school
so on the face of it this seems like a
fairly
simple dispute
and if i had to highlight the one word
that
the disagreement pivots around
it's this idea of send should we send
them all on
right
but i want you just to have a look at
this sentence
think about
the two sides and the people who might
disagree
and if you can just take a minute and
put in the chat or or put in the q a box
what do you think this argument might
really be about what it might come down
to
and to give you a clue it's often the
case that one argument contains many
arguments that one disagreement contains
many disagreements within it
um so if you can
um
please throw in some suggestions and
i'll give
uh you a minute and then i'll start
reading out a few of the suggestions
okay so
um
some really terrific
um
suggestions here and i'll share a few so
christine says
it might be about
income differences
right and and
i'm not sure whether it's the income
differences
um with the other children at the school
or um at the school they might be going
to if it wasn't the local um government
school
but whatever it is that's not
necessarily obvious from the text of the
disagreement right it's something kind
of simmering underneath um sharon says
politics and or money similarly it's
sort of a
uh
that that's less simmering underneath
then it almost sets the context for the
disagreement
um
anonymous says how to bet it's to
educate our kids so that's really a
point about the children
um and not even really about
the schools and the standard of um
of education
and um
uh ale allen maybe um
says it could be something very specific
like are the teachers
well prepared
um
and
there are suggestions about cultural
ambitions
um
resentment
and says elitism
um
these are important kind of political
communal concepts um
that formed the background too so
notice how when you look through these
suggestions
we're starting to broaden out well
beyond what seems like a really simple
disagreement about
the choice to send or not
and
um i'll give you my take on it and and
all of those suggestions um
uh if they're not covered by
my read
they also exist in addition
so
another place to put the pivot point in
this disagreement may not be sent but it
might be about kids and this is quite
similar to what ale um
suggested so
we might disagree about what our kids
are like
right
are they shy are they introverted are
they uh
you know
people kids who would really thrive with
a lot of extracurriculars are they very
academic we might have disagreements in
our judgments of what our children are
like
we might also disagree about what our
children need right
is the thing that they most need
um a lot of attention from their
teachers is it
exposure to a wide diversity
within the student body it could be
different things
and you can go through this exercise for
almost all of the words um
in this sentence so we might have a
disagreement
um around the word we
right what are our obligations as
parents
is our obligation primarily to
our kids do we also have to think about
the health of the local
government school system for example
and as many of you have pointed out in
the thread we might disagree about the
local government school we might
disagree about the kind of education
they would get there there may be just
straightforward factual disagreements so
i might think
they do have a music program you might
think they don't
um and
those disagreements could form the
background
um they could in fact be the kind of the
beating heart
of
what seemed on surface just to debate
about whether we send kids to the school
or not
so
uh one of the things that
we learned to do in debating is not only
to name our disagreements
but then to name the disagreements
within the disagreements
and
once you've done that
i think you can do two things the
first is
you avoid misunderstanding
of conflicting a disagreement where
there isn't one
you can
get to the heart of
what the disagreement is really about
and it may well be that
if you can resolve the factual
disagreement about
whether the school has a music program
or not if you can resolve the
normative disagreement about whether you
have an obligation to contribute to the
local government school system or not
then
the
most visible disagreement about whether
we send the kids there or not kind of
disappears it gets resolved
because that wasn't the heart of the
matter it was a flow on disagreement
that comes from a more fundamental
dispute
right
you
