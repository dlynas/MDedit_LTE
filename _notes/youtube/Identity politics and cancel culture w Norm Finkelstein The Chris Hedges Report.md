Identity politics and cancel culture w/Norm Finkelstein | The Chris Hedges Report - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:22) Chris Hedges:   There are very few intellectuals who have been  as attacked, censored, and blacklisted as long   and as ruthlessly as the Middle Eastern scholar,  Norman Finkelstein. He has been hounded out of   universities, denied speaking engagements, and  had his books and scholarship either ignored   or dismissed.
(00:57) It is surprising, perhaps,  that Professor Finkelstein's latest book,   I'll Burn That Bridge When I Get to It! Heretical  Thoughts on Identity Politics, Cancel Culture, and   Academic Freedom is a savage attack on identity  politics. He likens the current woke culture   of the left to red-baiting when his heroes, Paul  Robeson, Pete Seager, Rosa Luxemburg, Paul Sweezy,   and Annette Rubinstein were marginalized,  and in the case of Luxembourg, assassinated.
(01:21) "The cancel culture of my childhood, targeted,"  he writes," in the name of anti-communism,   popular leftist movements rooted primarily in  class politics. The new cancel culture still   targets class politics but this time around, in  the pseudo-radical name of identity politics.   Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose.
(01:47) Whereas  class politics has historically focused on a   massive redistribution of wealth from the haves to  the have-nots, identity politics (racial, sexual,   etc.) in the uppermost tier of a social structure  left largely intact in all its steep gradations.   The primary vehicle of this politics is the  Democratic Party, the mass base of which was   once the white working class, but which is now in  transition to becoming an identity-based party,   in which identity displaces class as its  organizing principle and base constituency.
(02:18) " Joining me to discuss woke culture is Professor  Finkelstein. Woke culture, he calls a civic   form of McCarthyism, and we will discuss how  it buttresses the ruling capitalist class.   So you ask the question, very early in the book,  whether one's ethnoracial identity possesses a   vital essence to be protected and preserved,  or, you ask, "is it a fluke of nature that   was instrumentalized to oppress, and in an ideal  world could potentially be eradicated as a social   marker?" You quote Frederick Douglass, who you  note was canceled by Afrocentrics, in his day,  
(03:00) for lacking Black pride. Can you talk about that? Norman Finkelstein: I should begin by saying,   it's not a simple question. As I point out in the  book, many of those who came to identify with the   left, many African Americans who came to identify  with the left, also strongly identified with being   African American. And there was a question of how  you navigate these, so to speak, two identities.  
(03:31) In the case of Paul Robeson, he at one  point commented in his little autobiography,   people have often asked me, how do I navigate  these two identities of being number one,   a champion in the rights of African Americans.  But number two, being closely aligned with the   Communist Party, and becoming a genuine hero,  a folk hero of the international working class. 
(04:01) And that's not in some rhetorical sense. If you  look at, for example, the Welsh miners totally   revered Paul Robeson. There's a wonderful film in  which he stars, as a miner, called Proud Valley.   And you could see wherever he traveled, he made  special dispensations to be certain that working   people had access to his art and access to his  music.
(04:33) If he would speak at Prince Albert Hall   in the UK, he would also have a separate  concert for working people. You can see it   on YouTube. When he goes down to Australia to  perform, he goes to a building site to perform   for the Australian working class. So he asked  himself, how do I navigate these two identities?   And his response always struck me as of some  interest.
(05:14) He said, the more conscious I became   of myself being a Negro – The term of the time  – The more I felt in solidarity with the working   classes of the world. He says it may sound on the  surface like a contradiction, but in real life,   it wasn't a contradiction. He was able to find  some sort of balance between the two identities.  And I found it particularly poignant in the  case of W.E.B.
(05:43) Du Bois because as you know,   Du Bois devoted his whole life in a very serious  way, not in a showy way. In a very serious way, he   had resolved the purpose of his life was to erase,  what was called back then, the color line. And he   engaged in very serious, scholarly pursuits to  that end.
(06:10) Now, at a certain point, he had become   radicalized and came close to the Communist Party.  He joined the Communist Party, at the very end.   But I thought that was mostly thumbing his nose at  US imperialism before he went off to Ghana. But he   certainly came close to the Communist, Marxist if  you want, position.
(06:35) And at the end of his life,   Du Bois, who was a very proud person, you couldn't  call him W.E.B. Du Bois, you had to call him Dr.   Du Bois. He did not accept anyone referring to  him without that title, Dr. Du Bois. He's around   80 years old and Du Bois finds himself brought  before the government legal system for being   loyal, being a foreign agent of the Soviet Union,  because he was a strong member, a prominent member   opposing war between the Soviet Union and the US. And he found himself handcuffed, at 80 years old,  
(07:19) and brought before a judge. Well, you can imagine  a person of his pride and a person of his stature,   who had all the claims to being a respected  person, suddenly at age 80 being handcuffed.   He says at the very end – He wrote several  autobiographies, mostly because he didn't   expect to live so long.
(07:53) He died at a very ripe old  age, he actually died the night before the March   on Washington, in 1963. Literally, the night  before, which causes you to believe that maybe   there is some order in this universe. And at the  end of his life, in the last chapter of that last   autobiography, it's a very poignant scene because  he goes through everybody who deserted him.   He said, when it comes to his 80th birthday, none  of the leading Black figures, none of the Black   college presidents of the HBCUs, historically  black colleges and universities, none of them   would send greetings in support of him. And then he says at the very end, I found  
(08:44) a new friendship, a new world, and that was the  world of people on the left; Not necessarily Black   people of the left, internationally. And he said  that was my new community and that to me was a   revelatory end, that he discovered all of the – He  said his name had become unmentionable among young   people. Nobody had heard of Du Bois, anymore. His  name was literally whited out.
(09:22) There was only one   college, by the way, only one college – It was  Berkeley in the very early '60s and maybe the late   '50s – Put one of his books... Some professor  put one of his books on their curriculum and   he said he was astonished that he was actually on  a college curriculum.
(09:46) And he said he found a new   world, a new universe, and that was the universe  of people who have shared ideas and ideals.   And the identity thing, which he had devoted  his whole life to trying to eradicate,   from an intellectual point of view  but also from an activist point of   view. He was the editor of The Crisis,  which was the magazine of the NAACP. 
(10:14) He, too, discovered that there was a world  beyond color. I don't want to be dismissive   of the challenges. Trying to reconcile these  various identities, you have to always be   careful of crossing the line to something  that comes across as self-hating, or...   I'll call it self-hating.
(10:52) So how do  you claim this universalist identity,   without coming across as trying  to escape your, so to speak, local   identity? I don't think those things are very  easy to navigate. Frankly, to speak candidly,   since we're having a serious conversation here,  I wasn't altogether happy with how Frederick   Douglass turned out at the end.
(11:24) He became  a Democratic Party hack, an apologist for   Ulysses Grant's corrupt government. Then he was  looking for all of these high honors: He went over   as a representative of the US to Haiti and then he  had some position in Washington DC, I can't recall   q
(11:50) uite what. I wasn't too happy. And there was a  little bit... I felt like yes, the arguments he   made for a universal identity were very eloquent. Actually, the passage excerpt in the book   that you've read comes from a much longer  passage. And I gave it to a friend of mine,   Deborah Maccoby. I asked her, can you cut it  down because I can't print the whole speech.   And she said she found it very hard to do  because it was so eloquent and compelling.  
(12:21) Douglass was a very impressive figure when  you consider that he couldn't even read,   legally, until he was 18. He digested, apparently,  Robert Burns, Shakespeare, the Bible, and Dickens,   and you could see it. And I thought he was a  little too, in my opinion, it was very elegant   but it was also a little bit too glib, for a  complicated question.
(12:53) Which anybody who comes   from a "non-majoritarian group" has to wrestle  with. Not because I'm oppressed as a Jew,   in the US – It's completely ridiculous. I'm  not oppressed as a Jew – But on the other hand,   I have to always be careful about over,  so to speak, bending the stick too much in   the other direction. And it comes across as  self-hating and you don't want to go there. 
(13:24) So it's a complicated question, personally, but  where I have differences with the current focus   in identity politics is, the arguments  they put forth, they have no content.   It's not like the arguments are wrong, there's  no argument at all. It's completely vacuous.   It's completely empty. It's filled with internal,  blatant contradictions.
(13:53) Now we all know that life   is a complicated place and it cannot always be  reduced to clear, lucid formulas. The problem is   that the stuff you read is so  blatantly, flagrantly, contradictory,   and devoid of any... There's what you might  call a rich contradiction, that is to say,   a person contradicts themself but it reflects a  reality, which is, you have to wrestle with that   contradiction. These aren't rich contradictions.  This is completely vacuous, intellectually. 
(14:31) Chris Hedges: I want to read a little quote from  your book that is about that point. You write,   "Affirmative action relies on generic racial  categories, but unless each generic category   intrinsically correlates with distinct  experiences, outlooks, etc., those admitted   under it don't necessarily bring anything beyond  themselves to the mix.
(14:56) " You quote Gore Vidal,   who was gay, talking about the gay community.  And Vidal says, "What in God's name do Eleanor   Roosevelt and Roy Cohen have in common?" Which we  could add, what in God's name do Clarence Thomas   and Martin Luther King have in common? And I  wanted you to speak about that fallacy of a Black,   Brown, woman, Asian, Jewish, a gay perspective,  the idea of proportional representation. 
(15:23) Norman Finkelstein: Again, I admit and I want to  be clear about it, these are complicated questions   and I have no problem with acknowledging that.  So I'm sure you'll agree with me if I say   the choice is between no affirmative  action and teaching an all white class,   and affirmative action, and teaching a "diverse  class," you'd prefer to teach in the diverse   class.
(16:01) You don't want to walk into a classroom  that looks like the junior version of the Ku   Klux Klan. It's not nearly as exhilarating an  experience as when you have a "diverse" class.   When you have a diverse class, it's a sense of  your, so to speak, cultivating the humanity of   the future.
(16:31) People get along, people communicate  with each other, they argue, they disagree,   but they're respectful. Also, before class  and after class, there's real camaraderie   and warmth. It's a special feeling. I'll give you  an example, and then I'll return to the question.  I currently, or this past semester,  I was teaching at Hunter College.   Hunter College is the City University of New York.
(16:56)   And it's all first-generation college students,   sons and daughters of immigrants, overwhelmingly.  But also working-class kids, in addition,   all of them keeping down one or two jobs. So  it's the rainbow, every imaginable type of   person is in the class. One of the things that  strikes me, I try to help students gain some   self-confidence by learning to stand up in front  of the class and to speak.
(17:27) Sometimes students do   wonderfully and sometimes students bomb. But even  when they bomb, everybody in the class breaks out   in spontaneous applause when they're over,  when they're finished. A warmth, generosity,   and also there but for the grace of God go I. I  could be up in front of that class and bombing.  And for me, that's a wonderful human experience,  to see the solidarity among students who, as I say   by any reckoning, represent every possibility,  every combination and permutation of humanity.  
(18:03) So that having been said, the problem with  affirmative action – At least as the court, the   US Supreme Court sanctioned affirmative action,  approved of it – It approved of it only under   one condition: Our Supreme Court says you can't  use affirmative action for rectifying historical   wrongs. You can't use affirmative action to  be compensatory for currently existing racism.  
(18:35) You can't use affirmative action because  you think if you have more Black doctors,   they'll necessarily be willing to serve in Black  communities. The court discounted all of that.  What the court said is we'll accept affirmative  action on one ground and one ground alone. And   that is, different life experiences will enhance  the educational experience of everybody, at say,   a university.
(19:23) And the problem is that,  let's say you admit two African Americans   into a medical school class. So let's say you  admit six on the basis of affirmative action.   Who exactly are they representing? Are they  representing African American people? Well,   not really because there's no consensus among  African American people on virtually anything. You   could say African American people broadly support  police reform. Okay, that's fair enough.
(19:54) But then   when it comes down to a policy question, how do  you support police reform? Do you want to support   defunding the police? Well, that's very unpopular  in the Black community. Do you want to support   increased police presence in the Black  community? Well, that's actually quite   popular among segments of the Black community.
(20:21)   So when it comes down to policy questions,   when an African American is in class, say in  a law school class, when he or she speaks up,   theoretically, according to the Supreme Court,  he or she is representing African Americans.  But of course, that's not true because there's  no consensus among African Americans on these   particular questions.
(20:49) If a gay African American  speaks up in a Harvard Law School class in   favor of gay rights, is that representing  the African American community? Is that   representing Baptist African Americans? Is that  representing evangelical African Americans? No,   it's representing this particular person.  So the premise of affirmative action,   at least as the Supreme Court laid it  out, the premise is simply wrong.
(21:12) An   individual does not represent the group.  The individual, at the end of the day,   represents the individual. That's it. Nothing  more and nothing less. Race is refracted   through a particular individual with a particular  life experience, and therefore, with a particular   position on any of these questions.
(21:48) Even though I will emphatically stand by,   I would prefer not to teach in an all white class,  that's not the world I want to envisage in the   future; It's not a world I want to help bring  about. I want to help bring about a world that   is genuinely, at all of its levels, representative  of humankind.
(22:14) I prefer to be at Coney Island on a   Sunday than at Martha's Vineyard. At Coney Island,  Coney Island the beach, on a Sunday you have every   imaginable shape and color of humanity. Everybody  getting along, as Rodney King famously said,   can't we all get along? Well, Coney Island, the  Sunday, are Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Russians,   Muslims, practicing Muslims. Everybody gets along.
(22:46)   I'd rather be a participant in that, so to speak   experiment, than an all white class. But to be  perfectly honest, I don't think you can make a   rational argument for it. I think the Supreme  Court tried, I think the Supreme Court failed.  Chris Hedges: So woke culture comes with very  clear delineations and rules and guidelines,   for those who perpetuate it.
(23:14) And I want you  to talk about how it was used effectively   to elect Barack Obama and how it was used to  discredit the candidacy of Bernie Sanders.  Norman Finkelstein: The Barack Obama presidency  – And I know I'm going to use the word, but many   people may take offense – It was basically,  in my opinion, it was a scam. The US was   in a crisis in 2008 both internationally with  the disaster of the Iraq War and domestically   with the Great Recession, as it came to be called.  And Americans were hungry for a change.
(23:51) They were   actually hungry for a radical change. They wanted  a rupture with the past. Along came Barack Obama.   Barack Obama was basically marketed by David  Axelrod and David Booth. He was marketed as   a morality tale, that is to say, it  was a litmus test for the electorate,   a litmus test for the electorate.
(24:26) Are you  a good person, or are you a bad person?  Obama himself admitted he stood for nothing. It  was one of the most amusing parts of his memoir,   The Promised Land. He called it a neat trick, the  neat trick. That's his words, not mine. The neat   trick was, he said, I stood for nothing. And of  course, he only stood for one thing. He was Black.  
(24:51) And so it became a morality tale. Normally,  elections are referendums on the candidates but   this election was reversed; It was a referendum  on the electorate. If you're a good person,   you'll vote for Barack Obama. If you're a  bad person, you'll not vote for Barack Obama.   And the Americans, about half of the  whites, first of all, wanted the change.  
(25:27) And it seemed as if electing the Black  president wouldn't be the end of the change,   it would be the first step towards a real change  that would break with the past. And so Americans,   both for self-interest – Our country was in  very bad shape – But also, there was a letting;   They let their better angels control their worse  angels.
(26:01) And they took the gamble, gamble in the   sense that their worst angels were racist. That's  okay. And took the gamble with Barack Obama.  But that was what everybody who voted  for him thought would be the first step   towards a rupture with the past, turned out to  be the last step. In fact, Obama, if you read his   memoir, if you read his campaign managers, Booth  and Axelrod, if you look at who he chose for his   cabinet – Right from the beginning, Robert Gates,  Hillary Clinton, Timothy Geithner, a critical role   for Larry Summers–- It was clear that there wasn't  going to be any change beyond his identity, beyond  
(27:01) the fact that he was Black. And that's awfully  thin gruel when you're suffering in the economic   system and you're hoping for real radical change. Chris Hedges: Let's jump to Sanders because I   only have a few minutes left.  Because as that woke culture   anointed Obama, it was used to destroy Sanders. Norman Finkelstein: Yeah.
(27:29) What happened was   Sanders represented what you might call the  paradigm of a non-Obama campaign. Obama was a   totally me-centered, identity politics platform.  Bernie Sanders was an us, it wasn't a me, it was   an us, we campaign. And was completely based on  a class, I don't know, a class struggle. But a   class-based platform. It was very straightforward,  with no ambiguity.
(28:09) Medicare for all, Green New   Deal, abolish student tuition, abolish student  debt. Very clear cut. It wasn't the neat trick,   or as Obama elsewhere called it, he called  his campaign the ultimate Rorschach test.   Everybody saw what they wanted to see  in it. No, in Bernie Sanders' campaign,   what you saw is what you got. It was very clear  what he was running on.
(28:32) It was a very interesting   phenomenon. Which, for me, was one of the most  striking things as I was writing the book,   was to notice that both in 2016 and 2020, the high  priests and high priestesses of identity politics,   Kimberlé Crenshaw, Miss Intersectionality, a  Ta-Nehisi Coates, a Whoopi Goldberg, a Joy Reed.   They all coalesced to denounce Bernie Sanders. And that was most visible, by the way.
(29:06) It was most   visible, not just in these individuals, but in  the New York Times, which became, during the Trump   years when the resistance was declared by Nancy  Pelosi, the Times became this hyper-woke organ and   it was hyper-woke, exactly, simultaneously, with  being hyper anti-Bernie.
(29:33) And that to me was a very   revealing fact. The sectors, the individuals who  were most woke, were also vehemently, viciously,   virulently, anti-Bernie Sanders. And that, to me,  I quote at some point in the book, Leon Trotsky,   who describes all of these sects, which are very  radical, radical, radical, hyper-radical, super   radical, and cutting edge. But he says at the  moment of truth, they reveal their true colors.  
(30:08) And the two campaigns in 2016 and 2020, the  Ta-Nehisi Coates, the Angela Davises, the New York   Times, the MSNBC, all revealed their true colors. I'll give you one example that struck me today.   So you know Jeffrey Goldberg, this editor of  the Atlantic Magazine. He was for a large part   of his life a stenographer for Benjamin Netanyahu  and he called that news: Interviewing Netanyahu,   or interviewing Netanyahu's generals, and  repeating what they have to say.
(30:51) And of course, he   had some cachet. He got all of these interviews.  He then became the go-to person for Barack Obama.   Barack Obama invited him quite often to the  White House, he was Jeff. Jeff. He would have   David Remnick there and others and he would tell  them if you have any questions, go ask Jeff. So,   Jeffrey Goldberg, was an Israeli prison guard in  Gaza and an accessory to torture, in Gaza.
(31:30) Then   he became a stenographer for Netanyahu. Then he  became a stenographer for Obama. And now, in the   latest issue of Atlantic Magazine, he's become  the stenographer for Zelensky, and the Ukrainian   so-called leadership – I'll use the word, you can  disagree – The puppet leadership in the Ukraine. 
(31:52) And it was very striking to me. So now, he's  calling for an all-out war against Russia,   Russia has to conquer Crimea. He says,  along with Applebaum who's a lunatic,   he has to conquer Crimea. And here's the thing,  here's this super hook, with this long pedigree   of apologists for murderers, himself an accessory  to torture, and at the same time, and here's the   point, at the same time, his magazine is the  main venue for woke people.
(32:35) Ta-Nehisi Coates,   Goldberg promoted him to national correspondent.  A month ago he published this absolutely wretched   article by Ibram X. Kendi on the martyrdom of an  intellectual. First of all, the idea that Kendi   is an intellectual is laughable, itself.
(32:59) But then  his martyrdom, martyrdom? He got $10 billion from   Jack Dorsey, the ex-CEO of Twitter. Martyrdom?  He probably earns about $1 million a year between   being the director of the anti-racism center at  Boston University and being the Andrew Mellon   Scholar in the Humanities, charity humanities.  And he gets $30,000 for speaking an hour and a   half when he goes to universities to speak.
(33:32) In any event, the same person who's this   madman, stenographer for war, former prison  guard, he's also, his magazine is a vehicle for   all these woke people. When Ta-Nehisi Coates  and he speak, as they did at one conference,   Goldberg refers to him as T. T, T. He's so  cool. He's so chill. He's so down with the   hood and he also happens to be a warmonger and  an accessory to torture.
(34:12) It's such a perfect   fit. It's such a perfect fit between these  folks who won to sabotage the Bernie Sanders   campaign and these folks who are wading in  lots and lots of money. A friend of mine at   Harvard wanted to invite Angela Davis to  speak because he's active in Palestine   solidarity.
(34:46) And he wanted to have an event for  Black Palestinian solidarity and he invited   Angela Davis. And she wanted $35,000. Chris Hedges: We're going to stop there,   Norman. That was Norman Finkelstein on his new  book, I'll Burn That Bridge When I Get to It!   Heretical Thoughts on Identity Politics,  Cancel Culture, and Academic Freedom.
