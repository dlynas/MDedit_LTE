Transcript:
(00:01) (slow, calm music) - War used to be simpler, violent, yes, always violent, but more straightforward. It used to be about large groups of men fighting with their muscles, their spears, and eventually their swords and their crossbows, and then their guns and their cannons. (cannon fires) But then we hit a point where it just started to change so quickly, faster and faster until (mysterious music) eventually we got this, private corporations who make unfathomably powerful death machines and then ship those weapons to every corner of the globe.
(00:48) (airplane revs) I once heard about these guys who would make weapons and sell them 150 years ago, sell them to anyone who would buy them. These were industrial weapons, and sometimes they were sold to the opposite sides of really big rivalry's conflicts. I heard these guys started World War I, though I'm skeptical of that.
(01:14) (soft music) This is something I've wanted to understand forever, the arms trade. As a student of conflict, it's something I feel like I have to understand, and I recently found a way to better understand it. In an old bookstore in Portland, Oregon, I found a book that has changed my perspective on this.
(01:39) It's called "Merchants of Death", and it is surprisingly relevant to today, even though it was written in 1934. This book has been the center of something I've been thinking about and studying. Why do countries, especially the United States, make and sell weapons to every corner of the globe? That's what we're gonna get to the bottom of, and it all starts with this book.
(02:12) So I'll start with planting seeds, just emailing experts. We're trying to map arms trade. Data is a huge part of this, like I wanna make a map, I wanna see it visually, and there's not a lot of clear maps out there, so we're gonna make our own, but that's not easy. Look at my beautiful art here.
(02:31) Talk to the team, loop them in, let them know what we're up to. Testing one, two, three, four, five, big lines coming out of either side. Oh God, I dunno what I'm doing here. (mysterious music) All right, let's put the mapping aside for a little bit, turn back to this book. This book is what hooked me on this topic, and there's a lot here.
(02:56) (coffee splashes) Okay, videos like this take a really long time to make and there's a lot of really creative, amazing, talented people who work on them. The ability for us to do this deep dive data journalism is made possible because of sponsors. Media is always made possible because of sponsors, and this is the part of the video where I'm going to thank today's sponsor who is betterhelp.
(03:25) Longtime viewers of this channel know that, in addition to talking about international relations, I am also a big fan of therapy. I got into therapy a few years ago and it really sort of changed my whole outlook on life. I didn't go to therapy because I had some clinical diagnosis like depression or anxiety.
(03:45) I went because I was struggling just in my mind with a lot of different things, and therapy turned into this like place where I could learn how my mind works, what is happening in my mind, why it's happening. Betterhelp is a platform that makes therapy more accessible. It's online. You sign up, you tell the app a little bit about yourself and what you're struggling with, and then it matches you with somebody in their network, a licensed therapist.
(04:09) They've got like tens of thousands of licensed therapists in their network. They match you with the best one. You can choose to communicate with your therapist over the phone, which is what I do. I do my therapy while I'm like walking around in the forest, or you can do it just as messages if you don't wanna talk to anyone, or you can do it as a video call.
(04:24) If your therapist isn't a good fit, you can use the app to find a new one. Ultimately, betterhelp's goal is to make therapy more accessible to all of us. I believe that in 20, 30 years, therapy will be seen as the same way that we see exercise today, something that we used to think was not necessary, but now we realize is actually incredibly necessary for our mental health.

I'm gonna dive back into this long journey of figuring out what's going on with weapons and the United States government.
(05:03) Here we go. (somber music) Our starting place is that point in history where war dramatically changed. Instead of large groups of men fighting with handheld tools, war became much more about fighting with machines bigger and bigger. This was made possible by the massive amounts of energy that were found stored in coal and oil.
(05:27) Now warships could be pushed by steam instead of wind, shielded by iron instead of wood. Armies and supplies could be brought to the battlefield on trains. Out with the horses and in with the trucks. It's the late 1800s and the fires are burning hotter than ever. Metal is taking the shape of souped up cannons and guns and ships, tools of war that were never thought possible now flowing in abundance.
(05:52) (somber music) "Arms makers engineer 'war scares.' They excite governments and peoples to fear their neighbors and rivals so that they can sell more armaments. The simple, relatively inexpensive weapons of earlier ages were displaced by highly scientific death machines, and the cost of these, together with the upkeep of huge armies brought a rapid increase in national war budgets.
(06:23) " So that's when it happened. And overseeing all of this, this production of industrial weaponry, not governments, but businessmen. "But the arms merchant doesn't see himself as a villain. According to his lights, he is simply a businessman who sells his wares under prevailing business practices.
(07:00) The uses of which his products are put and the results of his traffic are apparently no concern of his, no more than they are, for instance, to an automobile salesman." Still haven't heard back from a lot of experts, and still just kind of intimidated by this data set. "One British arms manufacturer compared his enterprise to that of a house furnishing company, which went so far as to encourage matrimony to stimulate more purchases of house furnishings.
(07:31) The arms maker felt that he too was justified in promoting his own particular brand of business." Hey Steven, Happy New Year to you. I'm curious if you can help us crunch this data. We'd love your thoughts and we'll go from there. "The arms industry is undeniably a menace to peace, but it is an industry to which our present civilization clings and for which it is responsible.
(08:04) " (intense music) SIPRI is this organization that shows all of the weapons being transferred from every country to every other country. So here's Chat GPT's initial take on the dataset. It's really disheartening how horrible it all looks at first. So these lines are telling me nothing, and you know that at some point it will get into a pretty place, but it's not there, not even close.
(08:35) (upbeat music) First up, Hiram Maxim, world famous as the inventor of the wholesale killing machine, a type of machine gun. Maxim invented this gun that could fire 666 rounds per minute. That was very fast and crucially, it didn't jam like most machine guns. With his amazing invention, Maxim takes his gun out on the road all over the world to try to pitch it to different governments.
(09:15) He's in South Africa and France and Switzerland and Italy and Germany. His gun selling missionary efforts eventually take him to Russia where he was almost thrown out for looking like a foreign Jew. Man, that's like kind of aggressive, but then eventually he was able to stay and show them his gun, but they were skeptical.
(09:33) They're like, "No gun can shoot 666 rounds a minute," but, (gun fires) and they were incredibly impressed. His fame became so great in Russia that the Czar invited him to visit him, which he did. He was also decorated with other Russian orders. The British eventually start using Maxim's gun in their big adventures in Africa.
(09:58) They were taking over modern day Sudan and started using this gun against the locals who were fighting with swords. The British newspaper giddily reported that when the Maxim gun was turned on the Arabs, "A visible wave of death swept over the advancing hosts." (mysterious music) "In most of our wars, it has been the dash, the skill, the bravery of our officers and the men that has won the day, but in this case, the battle was won by a quiet scientific gentleman living down in Kent.
(10:35) " Yeah, this book is so good. War was changing and Maxim was on the front lines of it, and he was making a (beep) ton of money in the process. China hears about the Maxim gun and immediately sends someone to go check it out. The Chinese representative gets to the UK and the first words as he stepped off the ship on English soil were," I should like to see Hiram Maxim.
(10:55) " The Danes passed on the gun, the king himself, saying that it would, "bankrupt my little kingdom in about two hours." But the King of Persia, the Shah, wanted some of these guns, so he asked the Prince of Wales to gift him some, and this is a key moment. The Prince of Wales says that he actually is not authorized to give the king of Persia any of these guns because they belong to Hiram Maxim's corporation.
(11:21) Pause here for a second. Do you see how this works? Back in the late 1800s and early 1900s, governments couldn't sell weapons. It was the corporations that sold the weapons. They were the ones who were in charge. It was a free market of weapons and the weapons kept flowing to everyone on earth, and these guys kept on making a lot of money, which gets us to our next character in the story, our next merchant of death, Basil Zaharoff, AKA, the SuperSalesman of Death, AKA, The Mystery Man of Europe because he was "a shadowy figure".
(11:55) This guy has an insane story and someone should make a movie about him because his story is wild, but he was the SuperSalesman of Death. He went around Europe and around the world selling guns and submarines and all manner of weapons to anyone who would purchase them, including two sides of the same war like Greece and Turkey, which was the Ottoman Empire at the time, were definitely like arch rivals, and they would sort of break out into conflict at any moment.
(12:22) Zaharoff first goes to Greece and sells them some outdated submarines that the Great Powers didn't wanna buy, and then goes right to Turkey and says, "Hey, Greece just bought a bunch of submarines. You need some too." And they buy some submarines, and then he goes to Russia and does the same thing.
(12:36) "Hey, Greece and Turkey have these submarines. They're in the Black Sea. You probably need some." And indeed, Russia bought one because of that, and this guy's commissions go through the roof. It was rumored that Zaharoff became one of the richest men on earth because of the arms trade. (upbeat music) Luckily, I have very skilled map friends that are gonna help me make this data look pretty including Marcus.
(13:06) - (Marcus) Hey Johnny, this is a multi-level problem, so I'm gonna try to break it down. - Who invented the mapping tool that we use called geolayers? - (Marcus) So I've transformed your data, and I have imported it here, and right now we can create a data-driven style. - So you have all these international businessmen that we're making lot of money off of this new demand for industrial weapons, the Krupp family and their steel, the DuPont family and their gunpowder, Remington making guns, and of course, Alfred Nobel, the dynamite king,
(13:39) (dynamite explodes) who did go on to repent for his sins by creating a Peace Prize in his name. Peace, brought to you by killing machines, the paradox of the heart of international relations and the theme throughout this entire video. These men got richer and richer. The weapons got better and better until one day it all blew up.
(14:01) (explosion thunders) (siren rings) "The number and variety of death machines had never been equaled. All of the sinister engines of war invented and perfected in the previous half century were used in the fighting, and naturally enough, there was further development of these during the war itself. The machine gun was improved, artillery was motorized, and its range became longer.
(14:32) Sights and fire control apparatus became more scientific and more accurate. Many new implements of war were invented. The tank, a combined American and French invention was first used by the British. Hand grenades were supplied in the trenches and rifle grenades increased the range of these deadly missiles.
(14:53) " (somber music) The first World War took place between 1914 and 1918, and thanks to all these new deadly chemicals and weapons, it was easily the deadliest conflict that the world had ever seen, tens of millions of people killed or wounded. It was after this war that the world woke up and realized that making weapons a free market to be sold to who the highest bidder was probably a bad idea, and that's when this book came out, the 1930s.
(15:25) It was a part of a larger discussion and critique of the international arms trade. Some of these critiques went so far as to say that it was the arms makers themselves that exacerbated tensions between countries and caused the war, though most historians just say that the arms trade actually just exacerbated the violence by putting more weapons into the system.
(15:45) But then in the conclusion of this book, you have this kind of prophecy moment. (soft music) "The future may very well bring fiercer and more destructive wars and increased business for the arms makers. If war continues, it is not at all fantastic to predict that the arms merchants will grow increasingly important.
(16:07) Already the stage of national affairs has been reached where the largest item on national budgets is for past and future wars. Already war appears the greatest and most important activity of government. The economic consequences of this new nationalistic militarism will soon be apparent in the arms industry.
(16:28) " "This new nationalistic militarism," it was new back then. It's not new anymore, but this is where it started. So now it's time to fast forward and see how right they were. (mysterious music) All right, this is for MJ. This is the pass off for you to make a beautiful map. - Okay, so Johnny just sent me over the direction for the next map.
(16:52) This one is a bit complicated. (upbeat music) I think I finally have a good map update to show you - Today the United States is the global superpower and the country who exports more weapons than any other country and by a long shot, and this is what we've been working to try to map. (upbeat music) All this data hunting and trial and error, is to try to see what this looks like.
(17:20) Today private companies still make and sell the weapons, but, unlike in the "Merchants of Death" era, weapons sales go through a government approval process, which means that weapons are no longer just a product that make money for businessmen. Instead, they are a currency that countries use to purchase influence.
(17:39) In this case, the United States being the top country. (rocket launches) Thanks mostly to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute or SIPRI, we know where these weapons come from and where they go. This has been the bedrock of our data hunting and I'm happy to say that, after a fairly long process, we have mapped this.
(18:01) So let me show you what it looks like when the global superpower uses weapons as a currency for influence around the globe. (intense music) (soft music) This map is pretty beautiful and I'm really grateful for the team that helped me make it. We've got a great team and it's helpful for seeing one really important thing, which is the expanse of US arms trade, how far it goes, how wide it goes, the thicker the lines, the more weapons flow, but this map only shows us the first layer.
(18:42) In reporting this story, I've realized that there's a deeper way to understand this map and it's gonna take a little extra reporting, which is why there's gonna be a part two of this video, which dives into the modern arms trade, what it looks like when the US sells weapons all over the world, and why they do it.
(18:59) The purpose of this video was to introduce you to the "Merchants of Death", so that they could teach us about how the business of war came to be, and what happens when that business goes too far. Part two will be coming out really soon, and in part two we're gonna talk to arms trade experts, as well as get some help from my new colleague, Sam Ellis, the creator of our new channel Search Party, all with the hope of drilling deeper into this map to understand why the United States sells weapons
(19:26) to over 100 countries, and what effect that has on conflict in this world. So stay tuned for our next video, which will be part two of the arms trade, and thanks for watching today. (soft music) Hey folks, thanks for watching today's video. This was the journey. I tried to document the whole journey, and I hope you enjoyed that process.
(20:05) It's a very different way of making stuff for us, but I find value in bringing you into how it's all made so you can see how we got all this information. Big shout out to Search Party. I mean Search Party, our new channel, is such an amazing journalistic project. Sam Ellis is excellent, and he really contributed a lot to this story, so go over, subscribe to Search Party, watch what they're up to.
(20:34) Sam focuses on geopolitical explainers, but also brings in global sports, which kind of maybe doesn't seem like it fits, but it actually does more and more. Sports are becoming a geopolitical thing, as you can see in places like Saudi Arabia, and it is worth paying attention to how the business and the geopolitics of sports are evolving in our world, so thank you to Sam and Search Party for being a part of this vid.
(21:02) I also wanted to let you guys know that we have an in-house composer here, Tom Fox. I've worked with him for like five or six years. He makes all the music for all of our videos. Him and I collaborate on a lot of music, and we publish that music, and you can use it in your videos for free. By free we mean you can use it in your videos.
(21:19) If you monetize those videos, it will flag it, and we'll share whatever revenue you have in it. If you wanna license the music, you can do that as well, but for now, look at the link in the description where you can go download as much of the music as you want and use it in your videos. We just opened that up to everyone and I think we're gonna keep it open for anyone to use the music in their own videos.
(21:39) Big thank you to all the supporters over at The Newsroom, which is our Patreon. I am so grateful for those who support every month. We publish a behind the scenes vlog for all of our Newsroom members as well as our scripts and some other perks that you get, but really it's about supporting the independent journalism we're trying to do here and we're very grateful for those supporters.
(22:01) We have a poster I think is still in production. It may be sold out at this point. I do not know, but it is called All Maps are Wrong. It is a poster of all the different map projections put onto one grid. I designed it last year, and I'm a map nerd, and I like this stuff. If you like this stuff too, go buy the poster, help support the channel, and that's it.
(22:24) Big shout out to everyone on the team here who helped bring this story to life. As you can see, it's a big operation. It's a lot of effort. Big shout out to the experts we talked to, as well as SIPRI, which is the think tank we were able to get a lot of this data from. So grateful for those doing this kind of work so that we can take it and turn it into something magical.
(22:46) Hope you all are having a good year so far, and I'm excited to share with you a lot more. We've got tons of different videos on lots of different topics. I will see you soon in the next one. Have a good one, guys.
