![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuRtKDDVV10)

## Transcript:

hi and welcome to unplanned the show
about cities and how they work i'm sam
your host today we are going to dig into
a fascinating person in urban planning
and architecture and actually in
computer science
a man named christopher alexander and to
help us understand who he was and what
his importance was
he died recently
we are joined by brent ryan who is a
professor of urban planning
urban design and public policy at mit
there you have it
brent welcome to unplanned thank you sam
uh and thanks
for joining us to talk about this very
interesting guy christopher alexander
who you have done
uh certainly plenty of thinking about
over
time um
why don't you give us a little
introduction to who he was and then
let's dig into
what he means or meant
to the field of urban planning
architecture
computer science etc okay so why don't
you just dig us right into it and then
we'll go from there well christopher
alexander was born in the uk
um
and originally he studied mathematics
but also architecture so i understand it
he became influential
early in the 1960s
with a book
short book called the city is not a tree
that was hugely influential it was one
of a variety of things coming out in the
60s that was
essentially constructing a critique of
modernism
what we might call high modernism this
was the
still see its effects to this day
this was the idea that you could in
essence completely design a city
solve every problem through
top-down reshaping of the built
environment
and alexander had a problem with that he
wasn't alone jane jacobs was not a fan
of this approach either
many other thinkers of the time
bernard rudolfski
gordon cullen other thinkers who
maybe faded away a little bit but
they weren't too favorable toward this
approach either but alexander really
probably because of his mathematical
training
and his position as an architect
constructed
the most well-rounded
complete and voluminous critique of this
idea he in essence continued publishing
almost to the end of his life he also
built several works that represented his
ideas well you're going to be our guide
to all of this because anybody who
studies or even approaches the field of
architecture urban planning runs into
his work at some level and i certainly
did
but not at the depth that i think you've
thought about it um
one of the books that everybody gets and
we were joking earlier is the book that
they wanted everybody to buy was a
pattern language that's probably his
most famous work
is that uh the work you'd want to start
with as we begin to dig into what he was
all about
and and maybe before we do that i'll
just add a little bit more biography
born in 1936 in vienna austria
alexander
was raised there but was not raised
there left
two years later to england
because of the nazi takeover
lived in england went to trinity trinity
college cambridge
and then came right here to cambridge
massachusetts first to harvard and then
mit in the late 50s
and then spent many years out of the
university of california berkeley where
he taught yes he was a professor of
architecture there there until he became
emeritus
and uh and constructed what he called
the center for environmental structure
at berkeley which was a kind of a
laboratory with many uh
adherents to his thought
right so
i'm going to be a little bit the guru
sitting on top of his um
well the pattern language is a manifesto
right and uh
puts itself out there as one right and
and there are many
who
having read the pattern language as
alexander intended them to feel that
they have discovered a kind of
foundational truth
and the analogy of religion is direct
and they um
they follow it in that direction well
let's let's dig into it then let's let's
look at that book um he has some others
that are that are famous uh
a timeless way of building is that the
correct kind of companion to the pattern
language but let's start with the
pattern language because that that is
the one that's most well known um what
can you
tell us about that you're starting to
tell us a little bit about it what what
is it about that book that made it so
impactful for people
um it's it's
simultaneously simple but behind it
enormously complex
um it
it is in essence a kind of
lexicon
of a belief system
if that makes sense you can open the
pattern language at any page it's it's
about
330 or so patterns i probably have the
number wrong but it's somewhere in the
somewhere in the multiple hundreds 280
320 something like that
and you can just read one
or you can read a cover to cover you can
read it backwards forwards in any
direction
but i think that the average person who
reads the pattern language will find
things that say
things that are so simple but so
profound like
a room should have windows
on two sides
or
every community should have a gathering
place
or
create a special place in your home
and then he provides maybe
500 words of text usually a very well
chosen image he's very visual person so
unlike jane jacobs who refused to
provide any images in her books and said
look around
alexander says no
most of what you see is is not
where you should be going let me show
you
good examples and in that sense he's a
true designer designers operate through
paradigms
an architect doesn't say look at every
house and find beauty alexander would
say no look at the best examples
and
the book was
research
so these were these patterns that he
called them ranged from the scale of a
of a city either a neighborhood all the
way down to the scale of a room
so there's many powerful ideas
in that one is that
a lot of these
ideas you can realize yourself
so if you want to improve your own home
you want to improve your room your dorm
room
your home or you want to improve your
neighborhood
just take some of the ideas you don't
even have to take them all they operate
independently of each other
well let's uh so let's take a minute see
the power of these ideas well absolutely
so there's uh and what was the number
you said 300 plus
possible patterns here's the book we're
actually talking about
um it is uh
let's see
oh i i over counted
253 ending with
things from your life so these are
patterns now let's dig into this a
little bit so these are patterns that he
and his research cohort because to be
fair there are other names on the book
jacket he's the famous operators in the
center for environmental structure
who produced this book now you describe
it as research
let's try to understand how did he
identify what
an instance of a pattern
and then what made him choose that
pattern over another possible pattern
that you might see out in the world how
how did he collect how did he end up at
250 well that's a very good question um
you have to remember that alexander
began as a mathematician so when a city
is not a tree he proves mathematically
that
think
objects or elements within a set of
relationships have certain relationships
to each other
and those relationships can be either
tree-like
in a sense linear in which
something within a subset is only
connected back to the parent of that set
or they can exist in a lattice
that's a mathematical
truth that he saw happening in the built
environment but he described it what we
you know what we would call
qualitatively so he said
you
and you meaning
you or anyone that's you
you can look
at your world and you will know
when you're seeing true
beauty
and beauty
is truth
and there is truth in beauty
and the goal of the pattern language is
to clarify those truths
and if you build those truths you will
achieve
a truly beautiful world well i'm going
to pull out a quote from the timeless
way of being 1979 book his 1979 book
which is quoted in in the wikipedia
article about him which opens with this
sentence this quote opens
there is one timeless way of building it
is a thousand years old and the same
today as it has ever been
the great traditional buildings of the
past the villages and tents and temples
in which man feels at home have always
been made by people who are very close
to the center of this way so it yeah i
mean that's quite a bold statement say
there is one timeless way of building
yes but it sounds very much along the
lines of what you're describing right
now yes who who would uh
not find true beauty in the taj mahal
or in the parthenon
what alexander was saying was this
you're not going to the parthenon and
finding it to be beautiful because you
like ancient greek ruins there are a lot
of them out there
there are a lot of mogul tombs
these builders
discovered and constructed
a lattice
interwoven set of physical design
principles and they combined it in a
collective way
where they achieved the true beauty
that's possible
in design and so you can find many of
the patterns
in these
buildings these are canonical buildings
by the same token
you can show that what you think of as
an ugly building probably lacks most of
those patterns now that's a subjective
to some extent
conversation but beauty is not really
subjective
everyone agrees the taj mahal is
beautiful some people say it's the most
beautiful building in the world
some people say that clothing is
beautiful a person is beautiful
instagram is filled with things they get
more likes why because people think
they're more beautiful
we aspire to beauty it's a goal so
alexander's 253 patterns are the result
of
exhaust of investigation of multiple
scales
of
you know aesthetic into relationships
and and clarifying them in other words
it's the
it's the reflections of the whys
now let's um we're going to just stay on
this notion for a half a second longer
because the parthenon
and the taj mahal
look very different from the outside
both in terms of their rectilinearity or
their curvatures or whatever
we might find but it sounds as though
it's
a set of relationships that make them
beautiful regardless of their specific
instances whatever it is about them
they actually incorporate these
relationships that he is he christopher
alexander is noticing and is recording
in his book is that is that a fair
description of what he's arguing it is
in his later work he talked about what
he called centers
and holes
and so he he
encouraged
anyone to
examine a photograph or to look at a
plan
and you could start to draw uh
whole circles that repre and that
existed within all of these different
relationships that represented
interwoven scales of complexity
that's fascinating now let's let's
go through some of the scales because
he's he's very well known
at the kind of planning scale for sort
of the village center and it's
interesting because
uh
new urbanism is a sort of offshoot in
some ways of his thought pattern but
let's spend a minute on the different
scales that he looks at before we get
into some of the ways in which people
took these ideas and then ran with them
they're clearly laid out in the pattern
language he
he describes them
let's see
towns buildings construction is the
subtitle of the book
uh the scale of towns the scale of
buildings the scale of construction so
he would say there are three scales
construction
is maybe the sub building level of
design that would be your dormitory room
my office
it could be
part of your home it could be an outdoor
space an outdoor garden that's added on
to your home buildings would be a larger
ensemble maybe
the taj mahal
and its immediate surrounds and then
towns would be the entire
web of human settlement that comprises
whatever we perceive of as uh
as that settlement whether it's a
village a town a city etc now in a
pattern language when i was flipping
through it the other day to uh to get
ready for this discussion i think he has
a section on the village inn or the
village inn meeting room so it's it's
this notion that there is a thing that
is a meeting room that you encounter
when you're traveling
and that's a
one of the patterns i think that he
identifies
help us understand what he's getting at
not just in that specific instance but
in this notion that you
our our built world is is in a sense a
set of building blocks that we sort of
fit together into different
uh
i suppose well alexander was
acknowledging the reality that humans
are a social species
and that there are
scales of human interaction that we find
to be pleasurable
it's kind of what everyone missed when
we were in zoom rooms
like a group of friends
sitting in the corner of a bar or
a classroom full of students
a village meeting
a baseball game these are scales of
human groupings
that have spaces that support
those groupings let's say alexander was
most seduced by some of the smaller
scales i don't recall him talking a lot
about
baseball stadiums he would have been
talking about football
soccer stadiums instead
but he was very captivated by places
that could support
positive human interaction
maybe outdoor seating outside your house
maybe a room within your house
maybe a place within a room in the same
sense that frank lloyd wright always
said the fireplace is the center of the
home if you look at every single every
single frank lloyd wright house
he would design a gathering place around
the hearth he said the hearth is the
heart of the home
it was traditionally when we depended on
fire but it remains so today and we have
some relationship to this people still
like to gather around a gas fireplace
well let's spend a second on
one of his offshoots which is
maybe unfair to sort of lump it on him
but this whole concept of new urbanism
which is
uh
i would say but you feel free to correct
me which sort of took off in the 80s
into the 90s and this notion that
we've lost in in that
again maybe as a critique of modernism
and sort of we've lost that human scale
and there is a way to refine that
um but it produced some
interesting examples in say florida and
other places um i'm curious what your
thoughts are about that just that whole
topic of alexander but also his
relationship to
this other phenomenon new urbanism
well in uh in the book a new theory of
urban design which came out in the
late 1980s 1987
and so this is 10 years after the
pattern language
alexander is providing additional
clarifications about larger scale human
settlement design what we would call
urban design or we could call it city
planning or town planning whatever term
we want to use
he described
rules for growth that he said would
generate
highly satisfactory human settlements
the same kind of satisfactory
settlements that dwani and others
others before him and after him have
argued are really the most satisfying
positive
human environments alexander believed
that by
examining rules for growth and by
constructing communities
in a holistic way where those rules were
followed as opposed to breaking them
which also implies a kind of
incrementalism
and a kind of corrective behavior
perhaps correcting mistakes as you go
along
you could achieve
this highly satisfactory
beautiful
place
the growth of larger holes
positive urban space
formation of centers piecemeal growth
these are some of the the principles
they're laid out in more detail in the
book
what's interesting about it
is he carries out uh uh an example which
takes up much of the book in san
francisco like an empty piece of land in
san francisco and says
let's try it out right
we're going to create a demonstration
and alexander to his credit always
believed that these were not abstract
rules
these were buildable
and you can and should build them and he
built several buildings that exemplified
his principles he wasn't simply looking
at
the past he was saying no
it's also the future well it's
interesting in this wikipedia article
about him they mention i believe it's
the same project in san francisco where
the rule was for the students
you can only follow the local
laws
you can't go back to sort of master
planning principles and impose your will
on the space you have to follow the very
specific and directive laws that might
exist in the zoning code for example and
then out of that my understanding anyway
from my brief read of the wikipedia was
out of that will come something that
works at that human scale yes alexander
would say
mostly that zoning and uh a lot of what
we think of as contemporary standards
were what we might call bunk
that they
really detracted from the creation in
fact may have forbidden the creation of
satisfactory human environments and
andres dewani feels very similarly and
it's why
new urbanism has shifted into
essentially a set of regulatory
strategies the smart code and its its
descendants alexander
wasn't that practical he was a builder
he was an architect he left code reform
to others people like dwane who in a
sense
have more patience and can engage in
this process piecemeal it's also
piecemeal reform
what happened though was interesting
when alexander actually tried out his
community he said
it's beautiful we succeeded but it
looks like in a medieval italian village
and in that lies
some of the critiques of alexander's
work that it's really incompatible with
not only the rapid scale
with which we build and to some extent
have to build human settlements today
but that it romanticizes
a certain period
and pattern and form of design which is
the quaint medieval
settlement or you could say the
marblehead massachusetts type settlement
or maybe
the the japanese temple
it wasn't that he was firmly fixed on
european culture although people have
made eurocentric critiques of the work
he was looking at examples available to
him you know in his time in the 70s
well and that gets us into so many other
conversations because of course
i think modernism itself was a critique
of that older way of certainly was and
so then to where's the highway right and
also this notion that the the
i'm going to get this all wrong but the
form is the function so if you can
um we're building of steel right we're
building in concrete right we can
we can have light and air we need light
and air right where is that in a
medieval italian village right and i i'm
in philadelphia right and i think i read
recently that when gropius came to
harvard to teach he wanted to get rid of
the history of architecture as a as a
course of study just to say
we don't care that's not what this is
about anymore this or never was maybe
which is a radical break with the past
that maybe modernism went too far
well leaving that aside because that of
course is a whole other topic that we
might uh get into at some point in the
future
let's assess alexander from our
perspective now in 2022. he died in
march of this year um
uh in england um and that's part of the
reason for doing this
episode of unplanned but
help us understand what what does he
mean to us today and what does he mean
to this next generation of urban
planners urban designers people who
people are going to be grappling with
who are grappling with all these issues
it's like it's a great question and um
i'll tell you a small anecdote that once
upon a time when i was a doctoral
student at mit i asked one of the
professors of architecture a man named
julian beinart who taught
a course called theory of city form i
said julian
how important is alexander really
and julian beinart said he was probably
the most profound
thinker
in architecture
and that has made architects extremely
uncomfortable with him
and the reality is that by the time of
alexander's departure
his work is very little discussed in
architecture in formal architecture
schools
i would say students mostly don't know
about his work
i would say many practicing architects
would regard themselves as uncomfortable
with it
and we have to ask ourselves
how is it that we can look at a book
where each individual element seems to
make so much sense
where principles of human comfort are
obviously critical
where a benevolent relationship with
heritage in the past is something that
we increasingly recognize is important
where community participation is held up
as a mantra in urban planning
how is it that we can find the work of
someone like christopher alexander to be
marginal
i find that troubling
says something about the state of the
architecture and design professions that
we
can't reconcile alexander's thinking
with the other
critical mission of moving the field
forward and of constructing contemporary
i don't want to say modern but let's say
contemporary
design that allows us to utilize things
like technology that accommodates
building codes for the disabled the
visually impaired how do we provide all
of those mandates but also the mandate
to utilize the technology we have
to do the things we know how to do like
building a building that's 100 stories
high how do we reconcile that with the
humanity alexander is calling us to
build in a humane way
i think we would all say that's
important
and yet somehow we don't refer to his
work on a daily basis and that's a very
interesting paradox
well brent ryan i want to thank you for
helping us at least just scratch the
surface of this guy who was very
impactful i remember before i even
thought about urban planning for myself
as a sort of area of interest
being introduced to his work and it does
have that sort of powerful
almost like a bell ringing that
resonates somehow deeply within you and
you you get it even if you don't you
don't have a sort of a background in it
it makes sense and there's a sort of
power to the argument
uh by its simplicity in a way yeah
there's a humbleness to the work it's
intended for you to
learn as much or as little as you want
in the same way that jane jacobs is but
i think alexander has many many more
lessons for designers than
someone like jacobs
and
i think alexander will have his day
again
the work will is not going to diminish
because many of the so-called truths and
he may have gone too far in claiming
that he had discovered truth as others
have before him
these truths will return as
areas that designers think about
and we'll see when that occurs
well
thank you for joining us on unplanned
let's get you back on for some other
topic my pleasure sam thank you

you
