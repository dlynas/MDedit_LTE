Contemporary Commons and Changemaking with David Bollier
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqEOlDcfiX0)

## Transcript:
welcome uh this is the webinar on
contemporary commons and change making
with david bowlier
i'm jeri koch gonzalez co-director
co-founder of sociocracy for all
sociocracy for all is a
nonprofit organization aimed at looking
at the approach to governance how do we
make it more
egalitarian
and
sociocracyforall.org is our website we
have tons of resources there i won't
explain much more about what we do
um
we
this is a supported webinar through your
attendance and so we invite you to make
donations
there'll be a link in the chat for
donations and also if you aren't already
on our newsletter
please sign up for our newsletter there
will be more webinars we just heard that
we may have a webinar with otto scharmer
theory you in the fall
there's lots of one of the things that
we would like with this webinars is to
start weaving these different frames of
theory use and
solidarity economy and commoning and so
that all informs the work that we're
doing in sociocracy for all and see the
bigger picture of kind of all the
different ally movements
coming together
this particular
webinar this idea came together
from kind of from early from a number of
several number of years ago
david and i was just talking how we
we've sort of heard about each other
through i think mutual friends the
information network that happens we're
both in the same town in amherst
massachusetts
um
ted and i uh
a friend of mine jenny ladd sort of told
me about austrian principles and commons
and then ted and i took a car trip with
uh scott reed
to a new economy coalition gathering and
there we heard about the austrian
principles and by the time we came back
from our trip we had half written an
article on the the relationship between
sociocracy and the austrian principles
so then meeting david just kind of
confirmed moore's like wow this is so
inter interconnected these two frames of
sociocracy and commenting wanting
commoning i mean wanting sociocracy in a
sense isn't that the governance
framework for commons wouldn't it be
perfect wouldn't it be a perfect fit uh
so we have been kind of in contact off
and on over the last few years
um
david has published a number of books of
which i only have a few but
wealth of the commons this book is 10
years old i just realized this so it's
10 years of this and this i don't know
how how much before you wrote
but then you know these are the three
ones that i have patterns of commoning
which has got lots of different uh
stories in it and then the latest one
this last year's book uh the commoners
catalog for change making
and so you know just thinking about
comments not just as an interesting
abstract idea of ownership but is also a
process of social change
um what else do i want to say here
oh i just want to put a plug in for
david's podcast frontiers of commoning
i've listened to most of the podcasts in
there we were podcast number four
um and if you want to understand
sociocracy for all through david's eyes
of questioning i think i thought it was
a really wonderful podcast
so um go there
okay and what's going to happen in this
session is going to turn it over to
david in a moment
and he will
do a presentation
uh after the presentation
we will um
david and i will just continue from the
presentation just having a dialogue a
conversation between the two of us then
we'll do a breakout so that everybody
gets the chance to talk to each other
for a few minutes before coming back and
doing a more extensive uh q a
comments that people want to make
and then we'll wrap
so that's the plan
so
here is david
he's the director of reinventing the
commons program at the schumacher center
for uh new economics
he's an activist independent scholar
author of some of these books that i
just mentioned
and um
with that david you can well thank thank
you for having me i really
appreciate the chance to share
my ideas about the commons and
the overlaps significant synergies
between sociocracy and the
commons let me briefly introduce myself
a little bit more and then i will put
some slides up just to
help
glide through a lot of different themes
because i want to cover a lot of ground
in a short period of time
and then we can
uh have
some questions and follow up with that
because i find the topic
has so many dimensions that it's hard to
uh to uh cover them all at once but
i hope this will be a nice introduction
to it
i should just say that i've been a
you might say an activist a scholar
strategist
um author
on the commons for about 20 years now
and i came out of the washington policy
activist world especially with ralph
nader
and i've never quite been able to get
into the academic perspective of it all
because so often that's not as
practitioner driven or based on actual
commons even though there is significant
important work there
i fell in with
an international network of commons
project leaders and activists
and worked a lot with europeans uh in
particular where i found that it was
more nourishing to me than i could find
in a lot of places here in the u.s
um
so
with that let me just get into my slides
and uh sort of lay out some of the
basics of the commons and we can get
into the more uh
subtle dimensions of it in the question
and answer let me share my screen
i work with the schumacher center for
new economics and they're very uh
deeply involved in various types of
commons and particularly community land
trust csa farms and alternative
currencies the berkshires among other
things especially with our emphasis on
localism which i find is an important
element of the commons as well
but let me just start with the general
proposition question that i think we
need to confront is can the commons help
us imagine new pathways for growing a
new world and i obviously think the
answer is yes but how that happens what
in what realms
what with what different logic and ethic
and practices
that's the real question to discuss
and so often the discussions get bogged
down into capitalism versus socialism i
find that kind of a
red herring because both of those are
based on
the state driving the change
whereas the commons is really about a
communities creating an entirely
different context
in dealing with the state only as
necessary either defensively or trying
to allow commenting to be legal or to
have some legal sanction for it which is
sometimes necessary
and the commons is often misunderstood
because the state and the market are
seen as the only significant forces of
power or production
and the commons is just seen as a
medieval relic of no particular
relevance for modern times and i think
it's misunderstood and invisible um
although interesting just yesterday i
saw there was a major article in the new
yorker on land and commons which goes
into the history of it i really from the
my brief review of it i really recommend
it it's a solid piece
um
part of the problem of the commons has
been the misunderstanding that garrett
hardin
put forward in his 1968 essay in science
journal
uh called the tragedy of the commons and
everybody of course has heard of this
idea that
if you have a comma a shared piece of
land no individual farmer will have the
rational incentive to hold back and
therefore
everybody will over graze and
over-exploit and ruin the commons the
so-called tragedy well this was
basically a non-empirical
parable
which astonishingly for a science
magazine journal
was not based on a lot of empirical
evidence and uh
one historian and commentator of the
commons lewis hyde says
it's really about the tragedy of
unmanaged laissez-faire common pool
resources with easy access for
non-communicating self-interested
individuals in other words a lot of
buried premises in the idea of the
commons which really is more accurately
describing the market the tragedy of the
market because a commons is not a
free-for-all it's not an open access
regime it's a bounded community with
rules
and
certain boundaries around the resources
and community itself with punishment for
transgressors of the rules
and so forth and so
uh well a lot of us have had to overcome
this popular misconception about the
commons that hardin's essay has
propagated along with economists and
politicians who like to make the point
that shared resources will always fail
and so you need private property and
markets and maybe as a last resort the
government
so this is the burden we have to
overcome
and the major force in overcoming those
misconceptions was professor eleanor
ostrom who was an indiana university
political scientist who spent her life
work studying the commons especially
natural resource-based commons in the
global south
and she this book governing the commons
was one of her major books in 1990
she won the nobel prize in economics in
2009
for her work
essentially showing that cooperative
behavior of communities can be entirely
sustainable and not a so-called tragedy
and that it can be economically
consequential which of course runs
against the premises of homo economicus
and self
self-interested individuals being the
only driver of economics
she uh i think that
her win in the award was significant in
2009
uh one
uh it was coming on the heels of the
2008 financial crisis and they wanted a
different type of economist to uh to
showcase
and she was the first woman to win and i
think that had something to do with her
being more attuned to relationality
within economic life which most
economists male economists ignore
now it's important to understand that a
commas is not just a resource even
though it has that tradition within
economics it's a social self-organized
social system
so it consists of a community a re a
resource that's shared
and the social norms and practices and
protocols and rituals and traditions and
other things by which that community
uses the resource
in limited ways
so it's more than just a general sharing
and cooperation it's arguably more than
arguably it is a social institution
that is often ignored
and as i've come to see it relationality
is what counts within the commons about
how people relate to each other how they
relate to their so-called resources how
they relate to the earth as a living
system
and i think this requires us to
reconsider how we view the world and to
get out of the economistic paradigm that
we tend to
default to
in talking about things
and i take some guidance from people
like thomas berry who says the universe
is a communion of subjects not a
collection of objects well of course
economics sees the world as a collection
of objects in private property rights
held by isolated individuals
which move around through transactions
called economics but you know seeing it
this way you start to see
the commons as a living system which is
very different from a market
and similarly another key
little phrase that resonates with me
from andreas weber an eco philosopher
science and economics are unwilling to
acknowledge creative aliveness as an
ontological foundation of reality
and he's a
you might say dissenting biologist who
doesn't regard living systems as
machines with mechanical processes but
more as dynamic living systems with
creative aliveness

so
there's a symbiotic relationship and
cooperation within commons that creates
value
and this is kind of counter-intuitive to
the people steeped in capitalist
modernity
that you can actually have something
that's generative and creating value
outside of markets and state hierarchies
so
you have to realize we're starting to
enter into a different world view with
the different ethos a different
operational logic
than uh we're accustomed to in the
modern world

now
the commons is often thought of as an
ideology uh and i like to think that
it's really a more open-ended
evolutionary uh process that's based on
bottom-up experimentation
it's not an ism where there's a standard
of
which i say universal philosophy but
something that always has the markings
of its own context
of so that a community forest in north
america will be very different from a
community forest in africa or india or
eastern europe but they will socially
have many similar dynamics but they will
also have the markings of their
geography their culture their traditions
and
other idiosyncratic things of their
place and that's what i think
distinguishes it from a lot of universal
universalistic type philosophies
and it it helps also to see that the
commons is really an activity and not a
thing as historian peter linebaugh has
said there's no commons without
commoning so it's the activities and
practices that are paramount and it's
hard to sort of
uh

express those in some universal grid uh
they take on very many different
inflections depending upon where it
happens

uh you know in a related
way we need to see that the value
created by these living systems is
mostly invisible to the standard
economics and state power
as you can see from the top of the
iceberg this is a image that the
community community economies research
network has developed and which is kind
of the core of their work
that wage labor commodity markets
capitalist enterprise
the stuff that standard economists talk
about is the tip of the iceberg but
there's huge amounts of things that
happen that create value
that is not necessarily transactional
that is more social
and sometimes
commons based and it's important to
understand that because it opens up a
whole wealth of
fruitful activity that the standard
analyses miss
oops hold on why am i
let me give a brief tour of the commons
verse to get we need some examples to
get things going first of all it's
helpful to understand that really uh
an estimated 2 billion people
historically and now depend upon commons
for their everyday livelihoods
subsistence is often denigrated as uh
you know survival or barely getting by
and sometimes that is the case but
really what is more important to mean is
that it's a household uh it's serving
households in ways that are not directly
market driven so forestry fisheries
farmland irrigation water pastures wild
game all of which are arguably more
stable and ecologically benign than the
standard development models for
agriculture with its monoculture and
pesticides and so forth
and this is happening not just in the
global south but
more recently in the
north america europe lots of local food
sovereignty movements as indicated by
some of these uh
particular types of permaculture agro
ecology and so forth
so it's an attempt to
re-integrate relocalize how food
production occurs and have the culture
of people
be part of that

the city as a commons
is a growing phenomenon especially in
europe where
getting tired of absentee
investors and airbnb and uber
driving the future of a cities a lot of
people are saying we need to create
these alternatives for citizen direct
citizen control without the state simply
acting in collusion with the corporate
and investment world
alternative currencies is a is a growing
field some of it like
has been eclipsed by the reputation of
bitcoin but there's all sorts of
community embedded locally uh driven
currencies uh
i work with the schumacher center as i
mentioned the berkshires in the upper
right corner here is a
very robust phenomena in western
massachusetts they've recently moved to
a blockchain based
digital version of it that could be work
on smartphones blockchain not in the
sense of a capitalist speculative
currency like bitcoin but blockchain as
an efficient way for clearing
transactions in a trustworthy way
uh the web while social media like
facebook and and twitter and google and
so forth get a lot of the visibility as
major corporations
the web is really a hosting
infrastructure for all sorts of commons
whether they go by that name or not we
know a lot of these through the open
source software revolution of linux and
some of the software programs used to to
drive the internet itself and things
like open office and
libreoffice and others
this is sort of a major
modern phenomena that helped revive the
idea of the commons as a different form
of
meeting needs outside of the market in
the state
and one facilitating tool in this has
been the creative commons licenses that
authorize legal sharing of contact
content without them
copyright law
dictates that everything is born as
private property and there's no
convenient or easy way to legally share
things except by hiring an attorney or
or waiting uh
a lifetime and plus 70 years for
something to so-called fall into the
public domain so this was like a huge
major innovation about 20 years ago to
make sure sharing of content of whatever
sort
if you're the copyright holder to make
sharing uh
easier and a default

there's been outgrowth of this idea of
some you might say second generations of
both open source and the creative
commons ethic
cosmo local production where design and
knowledge is shared among global
communities and then you can have local
production of physical things like farm
equipment that farmhack and open source
ecology has been doing
a wiki speed car and other types of
vehicles have used these principles
arduino is a set of electronic circuit
boards that
uh while they are
sold under a trademark the designs
themselves are entirely shareable
and fab la i have mentioned fablabs
because they're kind of an international
phenomena that helps drive a lot of this
sharing and co-learning about innovation
in tech

and i should point out there's no master
inventory of commons commons can arise
anywhere when a group of people decide
they want to manage their shared
resource
uh with a night with an accent on
fairness inclusion participation making
their own rules and being beneficiaries
of that work so there's howl around
theater commons in boston which is
non-commercial theater and
internationally they help coordinate
sharing and convenings of that
there's the open source seed initiative
to try to prevent seeds from being just
propertized the way big ag is doing and
to make it shareable there's in in peru
this vast biodiversity of potatoes which
again
the corporate world is trying to
take would love to take that genetic
information there's a potato park that
allows the indigenous peoples to control
that and prevent it from being uh
patented and take
appropriated by first world
corporations
and uh i'll just mention guitar
catalonia there's actually a region-wide
wi-fi system that's run as a commons not
as a corporate telecom affair
i tried to collect uh
sort of a lot of the more provocative
interesting and
proven examples of commons in my
commoners catalog for change making
which came out about five or six months
ago
uh it i was based on the whole earth
catalog format and sensibility i wanted
to sort of have short snippets to show
how diverse the commons is
in one swoop and something that
my mother could understand and as
opposed to a more academic treatment of
something
um

so we come down to a question of well
how do these commons work and and
i found that while the the ostrom
literature has a lot of deep academic
insight some of it deals with it as
economic resource management as opposed
to a social system and
my co-author silke helfrich and i in
this book free fair and alive which came
out in 2019
we wanted to
approach the commons as a social system
and identify what we called patterns of
commoning
and we we used the idea of patterns of
commoning
from christopher alexander who some of
you may know as the inventor of the
methodology known as pattern language he
was a
spiritually inclined urban design urban
planner and architect who saw
said why do certain patterns of urban
spaces and buildings persist over
history
and across cultures
and his answer was that it serves
certain inner needs and functions
that took to recurrent problems
and so
he developed a
methodology of pattern languages for
identifying these patterns and clusters
of similar solutions to some to
recurrent problems
and this was a way
that my co-author and i silke and i
realized could help explain
the
similarities of commons across
history and cultures
while still acknowledging and honoring
their differences
in their place and traditions
so we used a pattern language to
identify
patterns of comedy in three major areas
the social life of a commons the
provisioning of a commons and the peer
governance
the provisioning we used as a as a
term a substitute term for production
because production is so often
conjoined with consumption
and we think that the two are really
kind of um
you know commons are conjoined
provisioning and consumption are
together so we use the word provisioning
um
let's see i don't want to go through
obviously i don't have the time to go
through all these different uh patterns
but suffice it to say these are specific
things we've seen
in a large number of commons that we had
witnessed where people
uh
for example in the social life of the
commons contribute freely with each
other they ritualize their togetherness
they trust their own situated knowledge
um and you you get the idea in terms of
governance which is kind of of interest
hold on a second let me just try to
stop the noise i hear outside right now
i'm sorry for this
interruption here
okay i'm back i'm sorry i think that i
think i can uh
that that will not persist
so um
let me just go back to the
so
uh we were talking about governance uh
pure governance a few patterns
um
we
as silk and i studied a variety of
different commons we noticed certain
patterns
that seem to be recurrent whether you're
dealing with a software code or land or
you know different types of of resources
and
some of these i've mentioned a few of
these to give you an idea of the types
of patterns we identified in pure
governance one was about bringing
diversity into shared purpose people
come from different places have
different temperaments different
motivations
a commons doesn't work unless you can
bring those into alignment and have
individual self-interest
align with the shared purpose of the
of the collective so that's a really
important pattern that was our lead
pattern
there's also things like assuring that
commoners have consent in decision
making at a minimum
many commons are small enough that you
can have more than just consent you can
have active participation and in in
creation
but others of a larger scale
might need uh
certain minimal hierarchies and but you
still need to have the legitimacy and
trust that comes from uh at least an
affirmative consent
uh ensuring transparency in a sphere of
trust not just disclosing stuff the way
you might in uh say a liberal democracy
and then of course you get attacked for
disclosing it but something about being
able to share difficult or even
embarrassing information and having a
sphere of trust so that people
understand that person's not necessarily
to blame and even if they are to blame
the relationship
needs to be honored and
nourished but you need to deal with
difficult information in the commons and
not just uh ignore it
sharing knowledge generously in the
style of open source software that's
really important uh because the
collective wisdom has to be has to
emerge through these the sharing of
knowledge and then relying on
heterarchies which is a more horizontal
flattened more modular role that people
have as opposed to
very rigid and hyper-articulated
hierarchies in the manner of a
bureaucracy
so these were you know give you an idea
of some of the patterns we discovered
and
one of the others
there's a few that deal with dealings
with the market and money and that's
especially important because money and
markets can colonize and disrupt and
basically destroy the integrity of a
commons so it's important for commons
and commerce to be distinct it's not as
if you can't interact with the market
it's just you have to be very careful
that the market doesn't start to drive
the motives and purposes of the commons
and or even change its internal social
dynamics
and the idea of relationalizing property
in other words not just considering
property as a
market commodity for example but
treating it as something that is part of
your identity and the community's
culture
for which you have an affective
relationship matters in in india for
example people
love the forest it's part of their
livelihoods it's part of their
you know traditions marriages and things
like that
so there's a well the notion of
relationalized properties is important
in the course of our thinking about this
we so can i realize that the idea of
resource and property was in some ways
the wrong term
and we came up with the word care wealth
because
you care for it and that's different
from simply a resource or property which
often you can just slap a price on it
you don't care if it gets sold but in a
commons you care about your resources
and so there's a different
feeling that it has
and it's also important to understand
that commons governance is not defined
by legal or organizational forms even
though even though those can have very
important role
it's the social practices that matter
because i've seen
robust effective commons that are
limited liability partnerships which of
course are generally used for business
purposes but it's the social practices
within that
uh the legal and organizational forms
are sometimes often necessary simply to
deal with the realities of capitalist
life and tax law so um you know i
respect and honor that but
it's wrong to say oh i'm a co-op and so
we've solved that
because the culture matters a great deal
the practices so i mentioned some of
these other types of
organizational forms which
uh
you know
an open source software community being
on the internet will have different
types of behaviors but there are
similarities among all of these despite
the differences of legal form
or
organizational form
and so i might add that sociocracy
really as jerry said uh
dovetails and has synergies with many
commons many commons use sociocracy as a
way to uh
share knowledge freely to develop the
trust and legitimacy that a commons
needs to uh
bring people into shared purpose of
diverse persuasions into shared purpose
and so forth it's a it's a wonderful
tool for doing that because it's very
systematic and methodical in
paying attention to those social needs
so the upshot of all this is that the
commons is a different framework for
creating
usually non-monetized value or if it's
if it is monetized it's not becoming the
dominant dimension of the commons
along these priorities there's a pure
governance there's fairness as an
important motif
responsibilities of individuals are
linked to entitlements
it's about meeting basic needs first not
just sort of
the way the market has all these arcane
specialized things it's about meeting
needs that people have
it's about shared wealth that is
inalienable it's not necessarily and
usually for sale
long-term stewardship is an important
element of it it's not rip and run
private gain
and custom and tradition are kind of a
moral gyroscope that keeps
that keeps the commons steady over the
long term

and as i mentioned in one
a few words like research the word
resource
sometimes we need a different vocabulary
to reorient us to help us understand
commons i mentioned care wealth we came
up with the word nested eye to point to
the fact that we're not just individuals
we're nested within communities which
affect how we behave and the point is
not to deny individuality but more to
align it and bring
align it with collective needs and
interests as well
ubuntu rationality you know we found the
idea of economic rationality
absurd or anti-social the fact that it
makes right it's makes rational sense
for an individual to destroy
a shared resource because he can get
more of it and destroy the environment
in the process you know that's insanity
ubuntu is a term that means it's from
south african bantu people who use it to
describe the phenomena of i am because
we are we are
and so it
expresses a different kind of
rationality
um
well i won't go through all of these but
you i think you get the idea that
there's different ways for approaching
the commons and understanding those
dynamics i think you know in some
commons
asserts a politics of belonging in a way
that uh
often doesn't happen
and i think
arguably is one of the crises of liberal
democracy and market capitalism today
which uh of course you don't belong
unless you have money to be uh have
consumer demand
it it's about an economics of
sufficiency so it doesn't require
endless growth and therefore it tends to
be more
benign in
its use of various
ecological resources
and it's a culture that tries to
decommodify
lessen its dependence on markets
and
encourage as much sharing and
collaboration among
co-participants as possible
so for me the commons verse
represents a
resilient parallel economy that
sometimes intersects with the mainstream
economy sometimes has to have its
workarounds and hacks
to
be compatible or at least not be
destroyed by the mainstream economy but
it has this different ethic
of things like its richer collective
wisdom
power is distributed it's got dense
social and ecological relationships it's
got more trustworthy feedback loops so
it's basically internalizing what
markets would otherwise externalize
it has preemptive protections against
enclosure meaning the the
commodification and privatization of its
shared wealth
and it's talking about long-term
holistic value as opposed to short-term
narrow micro-economic value
and a lot of people say to me well how
do commons scale
and i think the the answer should be
reframed as
um the next big thing will be a lot of
small things and how will those small
things horizontally interconnect and
collaborate
the phrase that silk and i have often
used was
emulate and federate
keep the appropriate scale of commons
projects but emulate them elsewhere and
then federate them the way we see all
sorts of digital commons communities
doing from
you know open science to open source
software to open educational resources
they're all
dispersed geographically and have their
own quasi-autonomy but they also
federate and help each other and i think
that's really is going to be the pattern
for the commons growing in the future
but what we need more of are the
infrastructures
of finance of partnerships with the
state of law and others to
make commoning less of a heroic
historical accident
or simply a indigenous traditional
phenomena to make it more normal and
easy
for people to create commons
just the way markets have tons of
state support to make them function
that's a longer more complicated
conversation but i think that's
that's where i'm heading in my thinking
about it
and then these are just uh some of the
books i've written
the the two all of the
books on the right are available online
for free
uh if you do a search for them there's a
book page so the contents can be uh
viewed online
um
and with that uh i will let jerry or
others moderate a conversation and we
can have a
discussion about some of these things or
i can try to answer some of the
questions you might have
let me just stop sharing the screen here
hold on a second
oh you already did that great thank you
all right
well we'll start just uh david you and i
can have a bit of a chat and then we'll
go into the break up so that people can
just reflect with each other and come up
with questions or commentary they want
to make
based upon you know what you've been
presenting
one thought i'm just as a as i hear you
speaking i'm thinking about the world we
live in now and
the the centralization is happening at a
rapid pace as well as decentralization
um
and um yeah how
i guess maybe in that context this
you've been working in this field for 20
years
what have you
how are you witnessing the the change
the process of what's happening now that
wasn't happening 20 years ago in this
field of study or practice of commoning
and and maybe you can elaborate some
more and where do you think this is
going or what's your vision of where you
want wish this to go sure
well i think that the internet
helped
popularize a lot of these ideas or make
made it more of a social reality so
people could say oh this is a different
way of doing things but i think that
conceptually
the commas didn't start getting ahead of
steam for the pat until the past 10 or
five years uh because the language and
some of the analysis needed to migrate
out from academia some of it needed to
be popularized
and
part of what i've been trying to do
coming from a washington political and
activist background is to make it
intersect with the political economy
because i think that the commons has
both a political critique of capitalism
but is a platform for constructive
alternatives so it's not just critique
it's also
guidance for how to create a different
type of moral and social economy
so in the past five years especially
internationally and especially in europe
and especially as the discourse of the
commons has grown
uh there's been a greater awareness of
the commons
i mean the the new yorker piece that
just appeared yesterday would not have
happened or if i had pitched it to a
reporter would not have happened so i
think there's a little bit more buzz and
cachet
in the commons um or at least interest
in the in as a practical matter there's
actual
diversities of commons from agroecology
to currencies to digital to like well
the commoners catalog
tries to portray that
what's what's happening though is
the existing the legacy systems of
western law
of state power
of finance
are inhibiting their growth or
criminalizing uh certain types of
commons behavior
and as i mentioned in my closing remarks
there's not the infrastructures to make
it easier
uh so i am i'm sort of more focused on
that these days puzzling out
how that can be done how
aggregations of commoners who share
similar problems might create their own
infrastructures which i think
interestingly in the digital spaces you
do see because it's less of a heroic
activity to do that
they realize that you know having github
as a place for finding and
and collaborating on
software projects is easier uh and so
they they they more easily can they can
more easily create their own
infrastructures but the rest of us who
are running into
property law for land
or
state bureaucracies that claim a control
over social services or care
or other things like that we need
to navigate some of these complications
and um
and i think that requires a lot of
cultural education and commitment to
place
in developing coherence as your own as a
commons yourself so that you have a
sense of what you're protecting and what
you're aiming for and this is a longer
this is a frontier
of the commons world these days so it's
not easily encapsulated and in fact
there's a lot of answers that i don't
have yet so i'm exploring this area a
lot
i i share the concerns sometimes i talk
about trying to
make sociocracy safe within the legal
world because you know the kind of
shared ownership which sociocracy is you
know is about how do how do we
manage you know our organizations um
without all the structures of the state
that demand prop you know property
ownership privatization
and um
i might add there's people like uh
janelle orsi the sustainable economies
law center in oakland which are
fantastic
working attorneys trying to craft
ingenious
cooperative and commons-based
legal structures and but i mean so i
just cite them
both for themselves as well as the
example of the kind of legal hacks we
need to do to make the world safe for
sociocracy and other types of
cooperative activity
yeah i find myself writing bylaws
to try to you know create and insert
sociocratic practice and frames within
the legal systems and make that more
possible
one of the things i was listening to as
you were talking about um
the commenting was language
and uh just just the uh
just thinking about the social change
shift of shifting language you know the
coming up with new words to describe
things that will capture perhaps the
meaning and capture people's imagination
or in uh inspire people's imagination to
think differently
um just wondering if you want to say
anything more about kind of the
linguistics of the languages yeah
in the course of um
of writing the free fair and alive uh
silke and i realized at a certain point
that we were
captives to
discourse in that we were choke i was
joking on the word resource
because that's not the way commoners
were treating their quote resources
yet it had all these economic and market
valences of meaning that i knew we
needed to get out of and so
once you make the shift seeing the
commons as a social system these things
become more evident if you continue to
approach it as an economist would as a
you know the oceans the air the internet
our commons well no they're not commons
they're potentially shareable resources
that need a commons governance regime
but don't have one
you know once you move into the social
system these subtleties of social
dynamics become more evident and it
becomes you start to approach it as a
living social system
and the language we have we need
language to to describe that we don't
really
uh have it
and that implies certain kind of
conceptual shifts logic shifts the way
that when rachel carson introduced the
word ecology or popularized the word
ecology with silent spring in the late
uh or early 60s
you know she was people would say huh
what's ecology but she was making an
assertion that pesticides had something
to do with birth defects which was a new
type of logic and conceptualization of
the problem
so people have said to me well why don't
you just talk about the common good or
the public interest well because the
commons is trying to articulate this
analysis and framework
in ways that those words simply don't do
so
you know i understand there's risks in
introducing new terms that people might
find too crazy or unfamiliar at the same
time staying with a lot of the
received language locks you into a point
of view and perception and therefore
prevents change
yeah
that we really need to reframe in order
to think differently we need that's
that's part and parcel of the process
i'm thinking of
how commoning therefore is
a direct threat
to extractive capitalism and you know
the
systems and hierarchies that we have
and i wouldn't say direct threat well
yes it poses a cultural threat and i
think that markets can play nicely with
commons capitalist markets probably
can't play nicely with commons because
capitalist markets like to appropriate
for free or at discounts with collu and
collude with the state to take our
shared wealth
so yes to that extent i wouldn't say
direct but
over the long term yeah it proposes a
different way of doing things which is
why
you know open source software in its
infancy was denounced as communistic by
microsoft because they understood the
threat to their business model and the
idea of sharing code that was
collaboratively produced in high quality
was a profound challenge to their
business model so yeah there are there
are threats i don't want to deny that at
the same time it's not a frontal attack
uh because that's destined to fail
so
do you see have you seen this be my last
question then we'll go to groups um
government uh having been
directly attacking commons or supporting
commons
well attacking yes that's the
tradition that's the history of
capitalism is government acting as an
agent for capital to
uh decons to to enclose the con the
english enclosure movement was a
collaboration between parliament and the
land of gentry and aristocrats to
enclose the commons uh and the
destruction of the indians the genocide
of the indians and the taking of their
land and converting them into individual
citizens and property owners was
precisely about dismantling their shared
wealth and commons
what's more interesting to me is there
are what's more interesting now
is that there are certain city
governments especially in europe that
are entertaining the idea of the commons
having a productive role especially as
their own budgets
and legitimacy and effectiveness
declines
and they sort of see oh maybe we could
work something out maybe we can have
partnerships the city of barcelona is
really a vanguard of in the vanguard of
this
with because they have a kind of radical
collectivist tradition
despite being a major world city the
catalonia uh but places like amsterdam
and certain italian cities and then
other smaller mid-sized cities
there's experimentation and a serious
look-see about how the city might city
governments might enter into
collaborative
partnerships with commoners
and i say why not the state at least at
the national level
charters corporations as a collective
for shared purposes of making money why
can't it charter commons to meet shared
purposes for the public good
the biggest difference of course is they
don't generate tax money for the state
and so of course the state prefers
market activity
so there's political issues to be
worked out there but at the at the in
the national or international level
there's i don't see that as a viable
proposition right now because the
capital and the state are too
deeply allied
around the progress and economic growth
uh
vision for the world
so go ahead and start writing as you
wish and i'll see if i can
the first one that i saw here is from
isabel sawyer
and to be honest i'm reading the
question and not quite fully
understanding what it what you're trying
to express here so if you're here
why don't you
well but i can sort of
maybe read between the lines in which i
think that
value in a commons is not
the way capitalist economics would
regard value meaning pr if it has a
price it's valuable uh and part of the
purpose of a commons is to protect that
value despite it not being a market or
a
corporation
so
i guess what you may be pointing to is
how we talk about value and how we
protect it
and i think that's what is at the core
of a commons
and isabel if you're here does that
answer does that respond to what you're
raising
yes thank you very much but i saw in
your diaper
the world beyond human in the the
commons something like that so it also
refers to that how do we
respect
the value of other things of our beings
without just
appropriating them as a resource not
called the resource
well that's a you're absolutely right
and i think that we we see with a lot of
so-called traditional or indigenous
commons
that
the more than human world is respected
as a living system having value which of
course capitalist economics doesn't it
regards it as a dead resource to be
appropriated as we wish
so there's a major
ontological shift of value uh that we
that we need to do which uh
you know we in the modern world
at least in the modern west
have to learn i think and so you're
pointing to a very important
point
andre
why don't you speak out loud your
question
yes i'm wondering in historical examples
how much was the membership clearly
defined was it like
did the the group have to consent yes
you're a part of us or no and how does
relationality
builds
in there well that's a great question
there has to be a certain degree of
definition
i suppose a lot depends upon how much
value is eliminated or
reduced if you let others participate in
online context
the more people who participate the more
value is created and so
in an open source or a wiki world or
something the more the merrier
because it's not depleted
obviously for land or water or more
so-called subtractable or finance of
finite resources
who's in and who's out who's
contributing who's taking care of it
who's showing care and stewardship all
those matter and so there tends to be
maybe uh clearer
boundaries but
let's just say it's not a club
and commons tend to be have what what
i call semi-permeable membranes meaning
you have to have enough openness to life
that you're just not
uh strict absolute control and property
the way
a business might be
and
you know you because you have to for
your if you are a social organism as a
commons you need to interact selectively
with the rest of the world the living
world
you just need to prevent
being destroyed by that or others who
wish you harm who might want to
appropriate the shared wealth of the
commons
so i guess what i'm saying is it depends
certain commons are more able to

allow
non-members or casual members to belong
others need to be a little more
protective if their shared wealth is
going to be preserved
yeah and i imagine if we're trying to
have commons side by side you know i
think of i don't know i don't know
enough about the main lobster fisheries
but you know you've got one commons here
and then another you know a few
kilometers or miles over here there's
the next set of commons and they all
need to be in relationship to each other
in order to mutually support the success
of all the adjacent commons yeah and i
guess it's not necessarily a strict
geographic boundary i know native
americans before settlement
often
shared territories where
certain nomadic people allow certain
people to to take this resource during
this season but not during other seasons
so they can be more fluid and flexible
so long as
you're not depleting the resource
okay there's another question from
janine
how can sociocracy in the commons
support each other more
your question is to both of you actually
well i mean this this uh webinar is
itself uh a kind of a mutual support of
learning and so forth i've i've learned
a lot from sociocracy and how it
its methodologies and social processes
are an inspiration
and uh i mean i think that to the extent
that people can situate themselves in a
larger conceptual universe of commons
and see that there's a kinship among
them even if you're not personally
involved
and not only a kinship but maybe a grand
narrative and set of values to which you
might resonate
albeit within
this
specific context or another so i think
sociocracy is is part of the larger
commons verse in that sense where you
feel a kinship with a lot of these other
projects
out there
and david's work has kind of broadened
my perception of like who might be
available to consider sociocracy as
their governance because like oh this is
a much bigger world and you know because
i can just start with co-housing and
co-ops you know and well there's just a
multiverse out there
and we will continue this part of the
reason we did this particular webinar is
we wanted to educate
members of sociocracy for all about what
the commons was to help exactly what
david just said see the bigger picture
and and the uh the
connections between them all
question from roger
roger matlood you want to ask roger
yeah um i'm
thanks for this i'm really interested in
your take with any um
the pro social and the pro-social world
work of david sloan wilson and his
people um based on of course on the on
the core design principles of astrum um
and just wanted to get any of your
thoughts on how that might fit in with
all this
the the short answer is it fits in very
well i've been in touch with david song
wilson actually in the past and i was i
think i provided a blurb to the book um
and i think they from a different
perspective but in a very rigorous
uh way based on uh sloan wilson's and
his colleagues his
familiarity with group processes and
cooperation especially in evolutionary
science
name a lot of dynamics that i think are
entirely relevant to this whole
conversation and it's you know as i say
coming from a different angle and
perspective but
in some ways enriches the dialogue for
that very reason
thanks
and keala
you want to let you ask your question
probably have a lot more of them by now
since i
always been happening but i can scroll
back and um yeah i can read it for you
yeah
how can we recreate pathways for commons
pattern experience
that are easier
for people to choose
rather than the current situation when
there is a double bind of capitalist
economics
well that's a deep complex
important question
i i think
part of it is simply making the commons
a culturally available idea
and
that you know that's a public education
and cultural process
that will take time does take time
i mean a lot of my work has been about
public education or engagement and
outreach
because there's a lot of people
who i regard as commoners who don't use
the terminologies or appreciate it and
it's not as if i
am imperialistic about the discourse but
i am
interested in people seeing their their
connections culturally and i think
language is an important part of that
so

i think to make it easier to common p
people need to understand that it is a
feasible
attractive proposition
and that needs to be culturally
validated
that's hard to come by in our at least
in the american capitalist
culture individualistic
market-oriented culture
so i build on a lot of the existing
reputable models that are already doing
commenting you know community land trust
and csa farms and open source
this and that and lots of online
communities
to and i think that the language of the
commons helps show that they are a
cultural phenomena with a lot
in common themselves
and this
begins to open up new conversations
and uh give people the idea that oh we
could do it this way or it starts to
show that
that
coh as jerry was saying that
housing and collectives
start to have
affinities with a lot of other types of
collective endeavors and so this is a
long process but i have to say the past
two or three years especially since the
pandemic have
really
fortified interest in
collaborative solutions you know mutual
aid networks for example
so
i that's not a satisfactory answer in a
way but um
it's a developmental process
i think i see what you know your work
david is
you're making visible what's already
there oftentimes
absolutely and
somebody from the global from africa
once said
to my colleague
oh this is the first time anybody from
the global north has said what we are
already doing
and they didn't have the discourse to
start to defend themselves against for
example the international trade treaties
which would require all sorts of
violations of their cultural traditions
and ways of managing their their land
and water and so forth so discourse does
matter at least at a political and
uh
legal level legal level
so you're right i think trying to name
and make this visible through language
and different types of
sub discourses law finance and the rest
matters for moving it forward
yeah that's why it's important to bring
commons into sociocracy and sociocracy
into comments
all right kim uh
kim scott
you want to bring your question in

hi there david um
so um i've just
i'm in scotland and we have
some commons work which is called the
common good
are you aware of this
is it the economics for the common good
movement or project
um
kind of it inc
and i apologize my my up to date
language unless you're probably much
more
um abreast of this but
to do with them you know so we have like
property
land we have our like resources like art
i mean like we have them a lot of so a
lot of things in scotland and due to the
amount of money because glasgow was the
second
city of the empire and so a huge amount
and from the traders they kind of ended
up having huge guilt sways and so they
gifted a lot of their they actually they
accumulated wealth um and accumulated
resources and things like that to the
people of glasgow as well as israeli and
we have it in numerous cities and
numerous places throughout scotland
and so um and what's been happening is
that the local authorities are supposed
to be the government supposed to be um
looking after it but what they're doing
is they're stealing it yep well and
they're using it to develop pieces of
land and then they're not paying back
the money back to the common like so the
common money or the common you know so
is that is that right but you am i kind
of saying the same as you well i i
the dynamic of the state government
betraying its trustee responsibilities
is a common one and it's because you
know
the state and capital are joined at the
hip they have different responsibilities
and focuses but they have the same
vision and government
prefers economic growth because of the
tax revenue and the wealth that it
generates and
therefore uh
cash cashing in the common good the
common wealth
is seen as a way to further the ends of
both i can't this happens all over all
the time it's the the tragedy of
enclosure which is a barely mentioned
aspect of capitalism because they call
it progress
um
so
i think i see the commons as more of a
bottom-up
uh effort
to protect shared wealth that the state
is not managing properly or indeed
giving away
uh to its cronies
yeah i think it's always the envoys
isn't it but um so kind of like the
point i was trying to get to apologies i
just had to make sure that i was talking
because i didn't want to be bringing in
a totally abstract thing as well
um was just
i would like to utilize some of this and
part of what i'm finding difficult is
trying to understand the legal
stuff is there anything you would
recommend to help with trying to get
some of that legal understanding or
anybody i could get in touch with or
well it varies from country to country
so i don't want to speak too broadly i
here in the us and certain western
countries there's the public trust
doctrine which affirmatively prohibits
the government from giving away
shared wealth however the way courts
interpret that is highly variable so
it's not necessarily a strong bulwark
but it is at least has been around for
centuries uh so it is a legal doctrine
but beyond that you know there's all
sorts of things that the state can
justify
its
taking of commonwealth because it it
often uses
uh the standard economic analysis that
says oh we're going to promote growth
we're going to promote market activity
and this is beneficial for the common
good so of course we should do that
but i think we're seeing the end result
of that writ large in climate change
where the externalization of all these
costs and market activity
are destroying the environment or
dispossessing people of things they need
to survive
uh i mean that's what the english
enclosure movement was about and
the clearing of the scottish highlands
was all about
so um
the challenge is
how we
prevent enclosure
from happening in the first place in how
the commons becomes
hardy enough through law technology
social norms to prevent enclosure from
happening
but i'm not sure if that's speaking to
your concern but it's that's part of the
creative challenge we have
cool well i look forward to looking a
bit more and seeing come back for this
hopefully we'll have a second session
thank you for your time
i'm gonna ask one last question and then
and i think it maybe builds on what you
were just saying and kind of two
questions here
um
one from peter's how can commons build
in stabilizing norms to resist the
forces of the attraction of the external
markets you know like kubutzim becoming
less common
on the other hand how can we build a
global federation of commons uh so that
it does not reproduce the power dynamics
you know of nation states etc well both
of those questions contain the seeds of
their own answers
a commons if they're successful
become a
shared mutual support system and culture
for preventing enclosure and developing
a different type of culture
you know i consider them islands of
possibility the question is how do we
connect those islands a possibility into
kind of an archipelago or to use to
continue the metaphor and i think there
the federations i think are the chief
vehicle for making this horizontally
expand it's not going to have some
centralized headquarters or
ngo that's driving it i think it's going
to be a very loosely jointed horizontal
connectivity the way we see the digital
spaces have expanded that way
internationally
as kind of networks of mutual support
but
that begs the question a little bit of
how do we support this how where's the
money come from
you know
what vehicles
um
that's again a creative challenge but i
think of something like the i just
encountered recently or i did a podcast
episode on the group called open
collective
which um
is this
infrastructure
website that does the back end financial
tax compliance and other administrative
stuff for small collectives and mutual
aid groups you could be a very small
group
and the fact that there's somebody that
can take care of stuff that you
otherwise have to take care of legally
in
terms of taxes and the rest is a way to
make it easier and for
that horizontal connection to work
better so i think we need those kinds of
enabling infrastructures
uh to allow federations to work more
philanthropy should step up and support
that kind of connective tissue and
infrastructure so that people can
federate more easily
and see that it's in their interest i
think the whole relocalization movement
needs trans net trans local
uh connections so they can see that
they're not so unique and that they
could maybe help each other
develop
stronger local
visions for themselves
so you know that's i don't have a clean
answer because this is really at the
frontier of where the commons world is
going right now
yes
step by step many little steps you know
just as the example that you just gave
about open collective europe actually
that sociocracy for all hopes to use
that mechanism
to have more of a footprint in europe
without having to create our own entity
precisely precisely
complex so
there's there's the synergies
we are we have come to the end of our
time uh here
and thank you very much uh david it's
obvious from the interest that we have
here we have no idea how many people
would sign up for this webinar more than
we more than we expected which is a good
sign that means this is a rich
topic
many more questions than we have been
able to get to
so i will certainly save the chat i
don't know how much attention david will
have to look at it but we'll certainly
uh ted and i from sociocracy for all
side will take a look and see if there's
ways that we can respond to that or
invite david to respond to some of those

so with that uh thank you and for those
of you who are members of sociocracy for
all um
and i don't ted how you want to handle
this whether we're going to go to a
breakout room or stay here
but we're going to have a a bit more
conversation this is one of the perks of
being a member of sociocracy for all so
you get to hang out with david and have
a
more in-depth conversation
well thank you all i've enjoyed the
conversation
thank you
thank you all you can all wait goodbye
thanks
thank you thanks
you
