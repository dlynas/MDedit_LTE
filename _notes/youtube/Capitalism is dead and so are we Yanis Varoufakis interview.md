Transcript:
(00:00) Mr sunk I understand that generally it is true that you have less power than Winston Churchill had but mate you have power to do incredible things but you are not using it the reason you there is because you are representing the interest of capitalists who have put you there so as not to do anything people say to me come on Yannis but labor will be better than the Tories no the labor party has never had this degree of authoritarianism in its midst there was this mayor in North England who attended a screening of Ken Lo's fantastic movie
(00:32) and he was thrown out that's fascism K sta has been complicit in the genocide in Gaza from day one Rachel Reeves has adopted This Magnificent toxic lie of austerity before moving to T 10 11 Downing Street so what is she going to do when she moves in there I prefer to have bastards in power who claim to be bastards representing the aristocracy than bastards in power who claim to be representing the working class Janis far pakis hello it's good to be back I'm very glad glad you are back on Valentine's Day no less Happy
(01:02) Valentine's Day well as long as it's every day for you for all of us love day absolutely love every day5 days what a message that's what we'll take away from this um yanis for those who didn't see the last interview you did on politics Joe how would you like to describe yourself who are you I am um an academic Economist who completely accidentally just because uh capitalism went pair shaped in 2008 I opened my mouth a few times more than I should and I ended up in politics so I became the Finance Minister of the most
(01:37) bankrupt European country and that gave me some you know some it elevated me from being a second rate Economist to being a First Rate Greek Economist and actually being quite important um your new documentary Series in the eye of the storm the political Odyssey of jannis far fakis follows the interent journeys of your own life the Greek econom economy the international economy and I think a lot of viewers will sort of be asking themselves how did we get here a small correction it's not my documentary go ahead it's a
(02:12) documentary devised imagined executed implemented completed by a remarkable young British Artist rul Martinez who for some strange reason you have to ask him about that uh decided to Center the six-part 4 Hour 4 and a half hour documentary on me so I'm just a talking head in there um responding to His Brilliant questions but he has created a story out of my answers by editing them in a beautiful way not so much about me a story about the repercussions of the 2008 financial collapse which brought about untold misery to people here in
(02:55) Britain in the European Union in my native Greece but also shaped the world in a manner which um has made it unrecognizable to the pre 2008 era it has paved the way towards uh an acceleration of the climate catastrophe of the new cold war between the United States and China uh what's happening now in you know in Europe effectively Europe has been subsumed into NATO uh so that's what this documentary is about we will come to all of the substantive issues which you have just described but it's striking to me and
(03:32) it's for this reason that I want to focus on it for a moment because I think it makes you a little bit uncomfortable to describe it as focusing on yourself you're very quick to deflect and point rightly so to the people that are involved but I wonder you you know you're clearly someone that people want to listen to right whether it's in the form of this documentary whether it's in the form of the interviews you do whether it's in the form of the books that you WR and I'm struck that in our
(03:57) conversations it's happen just now your modesty and I wonder how it feels to be in the position you are in where people are looking to you for answers people are looking to you to inform not just what they might think about something but the very nature of their world view and that's quite it's an incredibly unique place to be as a human being and you're clearly a modest person as well and I just I wonder how that is for you on a personal level well if you were to ask any of my detractors and there are many they would call me a
(04:30) narcissist M arrogant up myself and so on and so forth so it's very nice to be to be here you know listening to you exactly um look um ever since I can remember um I had a penchant for um uncovering for myself how power Works how you know exorbitant Social Power works not so much electricity power but you know political power the power to make other people do things that are against their interests on your behalf right that always fascinated me it was like who done it it was the greatest crime that Humanity has ever
(05:16) managed to accomplish and therefore I wanted to unpack it yeah to analyze it to to to understand it myself and because I hated capitalism and I didn't want to be involved in the labor market m I decided when I was studying here in Britain that I was going to become an academic not because I liked Academia but because it was a way out of the labor market get essentially back then not anymore back then you got paid to read write research and teach right yeah that's effectively an escape from capitalism and as a result of that
(05:54) whatever I uncovered in this process of um declo looking and unring power I was trying to explain to my students and the one thing I didn't want to do was to bore them the way that my professors bored me or most of them so you know I got a lot of pleasure out of um putting forward an analysis of power to students and I did this for decades M and I did it in many countries I did it here in the UK I did in Australia I did in the United States I did and then I did it in in uh my native Greece and then at some
(06:33) point I think it was around 2003 2004 I started realizing that or feeling sensing that a tsunami was coming a new gigantic capitalist crisis not one of those regular ups and downs because you know when I moved here to Britain in 1978 that was a winter of discontent that had just started that was a crisis of capitalism but it wasn't the big one like bigest Quake that demolishes everything that happened in 1929 and it happened again in 2008 around 2003 I started sensing that a big one is coming so I started speaking out beyond the
(07:12) amphitheater the lecture hall of the University uh so that's the beginning of the answer to your question yes it is the beginning to answer question I and it's striking that I tried to get you on the personal and you've already talking macro events about the Great Depression and the Great Recession but I I tried nonetheless um so let's stick with power actually for a second and I know we covered this uh in our last interview on techn feudalism and I would encourage viewers to go and watch that as well um
(07:40) because it's a it's a fascinating conversation but just for the sake of those who are here now in modern Britain you ask the Prime Minister you know who has power and he'll say that he thought it was him until he got into office and then he pulls a lever and nothing happens and he he can't quite understand why and that maybe it's the officials and the civil servants and they'll tell you actually no it's the it's the politicians because because they're the ones with Democratic legitimacy and a
(08:01) mandate to rule and to govern you ask an MP and they'll say no I have no power I get whipped by the by the whips um I'm Lobby fodder I vote how I'm told I have no power it's the media the media have the power you see where I'm going it's a cycle and nobody's responsible nobody's yeah crucially nobody's responsible and the sort of the textbook answer is well Parliament is Sovereign you know the institution itself is Sovereign and it derives its sovereignty from its you know cyclical elections every four years
(08:27) and as a result it's actually the British people that are sovereign go to a market Town go to a Coastal Village ask those people if they think they have power they'll tell you I have no power I feel out of control in my life so where is power in modern Britain where can we look to to find it Well primarily of course it rests in the hands of those who own everything so you know if you own huge tracks of land or um you know the majority of shares in uh one of those hedge funds that on everything else then you have the power
(09:03) if you're a banker you have a lot of power especially if you're bankrupt because the more bankrupt you are as a banker the more of a threat you are to society and the more likely it is that the chancellor of the ex will bail you out um sight and seen I'll answer your question however in two doses the first again on the macrohistorical context in a macro historical context if I may the first okay so if you think about it before the 18th century before capitalism emerged to replace feudalism under feudalism power was uh homogeneous it
(09:47) was one thing there was a Unity so if you were the king you were rich and you had military power and you had political power you had all the power you wanted right you could take people's heads uh and you were only feared the usurpers who would behead you and take your place but Power was unified it changed hands but it was one sphere one realm with the beginnings of the great transformation from feudalism to capitalism suddenly you have a Schism that you have a split of that unitary power into two Realms the political
(10:29) Realm and the economic realm so you had merchants in Southampton who had become stinking Rich because of the expanding trade of wool that was being carried in their ships from Southampton to India uh for spices for silk and so on suddenly these people who were not allowed anywhere near Bingham bace or the House of Lords they were you know just filthy Merchants as far as the aristocracy was concerned but NE never they had more money than the aristocracy so you have this split between economic and political power MH then after 1971 and
(11:05) the breakdown of what was the first post-war uh Financial system called the Breton Woods if you recall you have the emancipation of the bankers from politics so Finance Financial power splits from economic power so now you have three Realms you have the political realm you have the economic realm industry manufacturing and then you have the Bankers the financial realm and power goes from the political sphere to the economic sphere finally to the financial sphere every time it migrates the political sphere becomes less powerful
(11:43) and essentially the prime minister or the president of the United States is right to say that he has usually he not always he um less power today than their predecessors had 20 30 years ago so that is correct however remember the lockdown remember the pandemic suddenly we realize that states governments parliaments have enormous power they can actually lock us down and into our homes so Mr sunk I understand that generally yeah it is true that you have less power than Winston Churchill had who had less power than Lloyd George had but mate you
(12:24) have power to do incredible things but you are not using it because the reason you are there is because you are representing the interest of capitalists who have put you there so as not to do anything except what they instruct you to do in terms of tax cuts in terms of all the the props that they need uh from parliament in order to enhance their capacity to extract value from others it's actually the exact purpose the purpose is to be powerless it is to do nothing yes you see I remember I was having a conversation with a British
(12:59) politician whose name is not going to be mentioned here you sure sure because you know I keep confidences but naturally Tori minister at the time and he was he was saying how can you possibly claim that I don't truly believe that which I'm saying that you know it austerity works and that free markets are always better than the state I said mate I have no doubt that you believe in what you're saying but if you didn't believe what you were saying they wouldn't actually let you be ministered can we uh have a definition
(13:35) of terms before we progress the next part of the interview um I want us to talk about financialization so for someone who doesn't know what that term is what does financialization mean it's just gambling let me give you a very simple example of financialization right please because it's not just buying shares that has been happening now for 500 years this is nothing new you know buying and selling shares it's a kind of Gumble to buy and sell shares but that's not financialization I'll
(14:04) tell you what financialization is sometime decades ago finances developed um contracts that actually made some sense so if you're a farmer and you face uncertainty you may have a very bad crop um it's good to have an insurance company that provides you with a insurance contract that essentially uh allows you to cut your losses if things are not good so this is a Futures Contract essentially you buy the right to sell your produce at a certain minimum price so that if next year the price Falls below at least you
(14:43) get that and it's like an insurance companies like you know you get you have an insurance for your car if there's an accident you get some money back you don't get everything there's an exis right but you get something MH so you hedge against bad things happening so these these insurance contracts became then transform themselves into options to sell shares so moving away from agriculture uh imagine you are a financer and you purchase a million pounds worth of you know uh British Aerospace shares right uh you
(15:20) can hedge you can reduce your risk by saying okay I just spend a million quid on these shares but I will buy a contract that essentially allows me next year if I want to get rid of them say the share price crashes that I can sell them for at least 800,000 so far so good but then they thought okay well if we are selling people finances an option to sell why don't we sell them an option to buy ahuh that becomes more interesting and more lethal because suddenly you you can pay money that allows you not to sell but to buy in the future shares
(15:58) that you have not not purchased today right at a given price so effectively you are betting that the price will go up and as long as stock exchanges go up because governments privatize everything and they allow you know and and they allow the bankers to lend money to people to buy more shares and so on yeah that's a guarant that's what happened with Hatcher after 1981 1982 the Big Bang in the city of London essentially you are guaranteeing that the stock exchange will go up and then you're giving people the a reason to keep
(16:27) buying options to buy and then you think why am I buying shares at all I'll just buy options to buy but then because if you buy on you know if you have a million instead of buying a million shares worth of British Aerospace shares you buy 10 chunks of these options to buy no shares you buy you place 10 bets that the price will go up if the price goes up then you have turbocharged your winnings compared to what you would have gotten had you bought the shares M but yeah so that's fin financialization now
(16:58) now people ask me now how come Barkley's bank went bankrupt in 2008 or Lloyd's bank or um the Royal Bank of Scotland which which became more bankrupt than the whole of the planet Earth could possibly be the answer is because if you keep borrowing money from American Banks to buy these options to buy and you effectively you have turbocharge both your prospective winnings and your prospective losses MH so as long as the going was good RBS was doing it was the biggest company in the world and then one day the stock exchang
(17:37) started going down because of lemman Brothers uh all the loans were called in the options to buy blew up and then you are still paying for the bailout of the Royal Bank of Scotland that's financialization it's a massive gambling Extravaganza where all the profits go to the financiers and all the losses go to you and to your generation and to your children's generation and so on the rewards are privatized the risk is socialized yeah to focus on the city of London and those banks for a moment then you've previously described the city of
(18:14) London as you know a drag on the UK economy a lot of people and for the reasons also that you've just outlined right it can be a ginormous risk a millstone around the neck and Albatross whatever you want to call it I don't necessarily think this but I will argue the count of you right which is that the city of London essentially drives the ex cheer you know it's something like 10% of the tax take in Britain and that yes whilst it might be risky this financialization can pose risks to our economy and it can
(18:40) jeopardize all sorts of things potentially even topple governments nonetheless all of that money some of that money that gets made there taxes are collected on it and as a result it might not be a part of the economy we necessarily desire but it is unfortunately one which we now now necessarily need in order to fund the uh the ex cheer remember Cuba before Castro I don't but I'm aware of I'm aware of it not do I but I remember the the theory of it or the imagery of it well its economy was based on the mafia you could
(19:18) even say that you know 50% of the Cuban economy forter was the Mafia That's all the good reason for keeping the mafia this is exactly the same thing with the city of London now why is the city of London um so such a significant chunk of British GDP because Margaret tcher destroyed British industry so if you destroy the factories if you close them all down and you leave the city of London right and you keep giving the city of London uh public assets to play with and though it gets bigger of course it's going to become a significant
(19:51) percentage of you know portion of the British economy so you know it's like a mafia which is destroy destroying the fiber of the Britain's so social economy uh it is parasitic on it and it grows more and more that is an argument for treating it like cancer that needs chemotherapy to be excised or radiation or surgery or something right it's not an argument for keep to keep feeding it and because I you know I I cut my teeth as an economist as a student just when thater came in in this country I I'm old
(20:28) have to remember how it all worked why did the city become so significant okay before thater it was because the city had created a way of bypassing all the rules and regulations of the Bon wood system essentially it was a little Mafia in the making that allowed Bankers to violate the rules of their own governments uh not just in Britain in the United States in Germany in France through various jurisdictions in the Cayman Islands and so on so forth but then thater comes in and boosts the city of L that's why they loved her so much
(21:01) first thing she did was to sell off Council houses now why was this this significant for the city of London well because to begin with it essentially told you Working Class People here's a house the one you're living in which you do not own it belongs to the local Council um in the market If This Were to be sold off as a private home it would fetch 30,000 quid right we'll sell it to you for 10 essentially we are gifting you 20,000 now of course you don't have 10 so go to the bankers to get it right that's first
(21:40) number one that's financialization commencement in this country you appropriate the working class because suddenly they love you because you give them 20,000 they don't understand that you know your kids will not have anywhere to live because once that house gets sold and all house prices go up the Next Generation working class Britains will have nowhere to live as is the case today uh and the next thing she did was to say okay I'll give you something more to the British working class you know to the blue red
(22:09) wall and so on what I'm going to give you is an opportunity to make some money from privatization of British gas of British Airways and so on and so forth I remember the amazing campaign by Sachi and Sachi to sell sell off British gas tell Sid was the big advertisement Sid of course was working person and what the message to Sid was is this um look we are going to take British cash again to chop up its value in little bits called shares and we will uh because we are Democrats and we want to push for a share owners democracy we're going to
(22:53) limit the amount of shares that anyone can buy so we're not going to give British gas to some conglomerate we're going to give it to you Sid so can you raise 2,000s uh because if you do then we will give you a share of you a portion of British gas they made sure that the shares were under undervalued just like the the council houses were under devalued so it was you know standard and pores and AR and young and price waterhous and they told them that look the real value of this bunch of shares is probably around 4,000 we'll
(23:29) sell them for two so what Sid does is goes go to Lloyd's Bank to Barkley's bank and what they do is they take a loan 2,000 because they know that the next morning they can sell it for 4,000 so the banker gives the money to them essentially without asking for any collateral for anything they know that they will be able to take and they did take their money back but suddenly you had a massive boost of share sales and the co-opting of a large chunk of British Society into the stock exchange of course after that they were jettison
(24:04) because then the Sharks come along and buy all the shares and suddenly British gas belongs to a conglomerate within a week this is financialization so it takes politics and it takes cynicism on behalf of parliaments that allow this to happen and legislate so that while industry is being depleted and shut down the wealth's the wealth of the nation is bestowed upon the city of London and then the city of London says you can't touch me I am the center of this nation's wealth kind of like a mafia it is a mafia it's exactly like the mafia
(24:43) in Cuba before castom what do you think to what extent do you think that the sort of thatches ghost still haunts actually not just the conservative party I think you could say they h of Europe yeah go on well look um last year in April there was um a dreadful train accident in Greece in th 57 young people died on their way to University H why did that happen because of the privatization of our Railways what model did they follow Thatcher model and what was Thatcher model the first thing she did was um to denounce State Corporations as
(25:25) inefficient as monopolistic as awful terrible you know British Rail British gas British electricity by the way they work much better than they do today or the water board my goodness you know much better I mean it was pretty Britain was a pretty miserable place when I lived here but it was you know all these corporations worked better than they do today you you only need to take the train to go to Brighton or to go to Manchester to realize it okay so she presented them as uh ancient and aric and arthritic in need of
(25:58) modernization what was the modernization you break up the network you create one company that owns the tracks and another and then other companies that owned the uh the Rolling Stock and so on I remember what happened immediately after that kicks cross you had the massive uh Railway accident because it's you if you have an one company owning the tracks and another owning the Rolling Stock it's a little bit like you and me driving a car together you steering and me using you know uh having the throttle
(26:28) controls and The Brak controls we are going to crash I think we do quite a good job I understand the analogy you're making together we are not going to do a good job the chances of an accident are significantly boosted yeah uh so you know electricity markets where they we should never have an electricity Market the notion of an electricity Market is a crime against logic because it can never be competitive never why because you know in the studio in your home there's one electric wire that comes out okay and
(27:02) you take that electricity if you had the possibility of having 50 electric wires imagine 50 different networks of wiring through the city of London right uh and you could say oh this is cheaper today I'll take that one then you maybe you would have a market but with electricity you can't so there's one wire coming out and the government has to simulate the market which takes the form of some kind of auction house when different private companies that prod use or carry electricity or sell electricity
(27:31) supposedly compete with they don't compete it's a cartel it's like opic you know they they cooperate fully in order to skin you so how did we get electricity markets across Europe now I mean the reason why we have this massive cost of living crisis part of it is because we have electricity markets if you look at their profit rates in Britain in Germany in Greece in Austria in Italy during this crisis after the war in Ukraine in particular right their profits are going up why should their profits be going up the answer cannot be
(28:07) that natural gas has become more expensive that's a cost I understand price going up in sync with a cost but when they tell me and they celebrate this in the stock exchange that profit rates are going up it means that prices are going up faster than the costs by definition which means they are a cartel that's that's why compet doesn't work where does This Disaster come from Margaret Hatcher but wasn't she brilliant in the way that she managed to wipe the floor clean with the labor party with the liberal party with her
(28:42) own wets and push all this in and not only push this in but cause an infection in the European Union because every cynical and oligarchic policies introduced in this country is now in Greece in Italy in Portugal the extraordinary thing for me in previous Global crisis and I think World War II is probably a pretty good example um I've interviewed MC Lynch about this and he talked about you know the sort of the people that were seen to be profiteering what during rationing right going around pubs selling Black
(29:17) Market Goods to make to make a profit were called spivs they were sort of socially you know par ostracized from society now a corporation skins the public as you've just said right colossal profits billions in profit and there seems to be apathy uh there isn't a a popular Revolt a mass protest movement no one is marching to the gates of centria or you know take your pick name the company demanding that they they get their money back why do you think that is is there a it's almost you know to sort of um to
(29:57) quote Mark to do a bad job of quoting Mark Fischer the sort of the lack of an ability to imagine an alternative political reality right that this is just the capitalist system we happen to live in and we have to we have to suffer the consequences may I be a bit daming about the political party by what means it's the fault of the labor party in this country it's the fault of the of the center left across Europe it's a fault of the Democrats in the United States when you have a Social Democratic party whether it's the esped in Germany
(30:34) or the labor party here which um trades in a vision of a just society and when they come to power they turbocharge every oligarchic policy that they've inherited from the Tories this causes two social phenomena one is people become athetic and stay at home and they don't want to know about politics or they become fascists not fascist in the sense of you know musolini is uniforms and so on but become xenophobic they they become cynical um you know they they start believing that brexit is going to allow them to take back on
(31:25) control when all they allowed was you know for um Mr Johnson to become Prime Minister it is the fault of the left and I include myself in this it is our fault we must blame no one except ourselves think of the United States in 2008 you know Barack Obama was elected with a mandate to get rid of the Wall Street bankers and you bail out the banks because you can't let them fail people's savings are in there but we will get rid of the bankers that was the the the cry call which is what FDR you know Rosevelt
(32:05) had actually done in 1933 Rosevelt had liquidated the bankers not the banks the bankers and that's why the bankers really hated him what does Obama do he takes two gentlemen Tim gner and Larry Summers who were a Clinton's duo in the fin in the finance ministry in the US Treasury Department the two men who had worked for Wall Street to unshackle the bankers and to let them go crazy to the extent that it brought about the 2008 financial collapse he takes these two men and gives them a mandate save the bankers
(32:42) and they print to gaed 12 trillion American dollars to save the bankers do you know what the result of this is this is a rhetorical question Donald Trump that it's it's natural I understand the blue color workers that Hillary Clinton deplorably called the deplorables yeah when they say look we tried you the idea that that Trump was elected on the wave of racism that's rubbish black people who voted for Barack Obama in 2012 2008 and 2012 they voted for Trump MH you know that's why he got elected
(33:17) there aren't enough racists and fascists in in in in the United States to elect the president even with their stupid electoral college system that they have so you know in in my country when we presented when I say we I mean Sera the Coalition of the radical left party um to which I belonged and you know with which I was elected to Parliament in 2015 and became Finance Minister we offered the people after I had tried all different Alternatives we offered as you put it um a meaningful coherent alternative plan of what needed
(33:56) to be done and our party went from 4% to 36% and we formed the government and in the first five months we stuck to our guns we were true to the spirit of the manifesto that had gotten the Mandate from the people and when we crashed with the most powerful forces in the universe like the international Mony F the European Central Bank the you know Wall Street the city of London Frankfurt the whole cabal of powerful people and finances in particular we held the referendum and the question was do you want us to keep fighting or
(34:35) not should we give in yes or no and the answer was no 62% it had gone we had gone from four to 36 to 62 right and what what happened that night my comrade and prime minister at the time decided to surrender effectively to overthrow the people the people had given him a mandate of what was the mathematic Ally inevitable outcome of that the destruction of the left the people don't they don't even want to look at me I didn't betray them because I resigned at night but you know what they don't care they say you lot gave us
(35:11) hope and then you betrayed it and I don't care whether you know whether you signed or you didn't sign so now what what we have we have uh fascists in Parliament we have an ultra rightwing conservative party that is in caho with the fascists in government and we have the left that is um you know we are reeling now and we will be you know sort of languishing in this magma of discontent and failure for another 10 years at least and I I think that's what's most worrying to me about the labor party and the prospect of aarma
(35:46) government right is because aarm government will will be a government of the liberal Center I mean I mean that deliberately aent well it's hard to know what his type of government he's going to have because probably going to Veer towards the alra right very soon because I mean I think the answ looking at the authoritarianism in the labor party the labor party has never had this degree of authoritarianism in its midst you know even under Tony Blair you there there were people like Tony Ben and Jeremy Corbin were they were
(36:17) never thrown thrown out yeah there was of course a dominant cast of uh righted Wingers in the labor party but it was a broad Church now it's not now there was this mayor in North England I remember his name who attended who attended a screening of Ken Lo's fantastic movie Jamie dris he was thrown out yeah that's fascism okay and of course you have Rachel Reeves of uh yeah a product of the financial sector yeah you have Rachel Reeves who comes out I was listening to BBC Radio 4's today program
(36:55) you know last week and she came out to explain the u-turn on the green investment program of 28 billion billion which is by the way a drop in the ocean but nevertheless okay look we can discuss whether it was a good program should be dropped or not I don't care why she dropped it even that she dropped it you know what really irks me the reason she gave she said uh the Tories have maxed out the credit card of the state George Osborne must have been laughing his head off because this is the the stupid toxic lie that he was
(37:31) pedling that the state's budget operates like a credit card and if you in the red you have to cut down that that was the whole of the Australian logic Rachel Reeves has adopted This Magnificent toxic lie of austerity before moving to 10 10 11 Downing Street so what is she going to do when she moves in there I mean my goodness Spar us of the this labor party whoever you are you know nature Society God whoever yeah the rhetoric is strikingly similar actually to that employed by the conservatives in advance of the 2010 election right that
(38:07) essentially you have failed to to fix the roof while the Sun was shining we are going to have to come in and fix the economic mess that you have created they doing exactly the same yeah and that's that's what the lab party's copying right they're They're copying that political rhetoric at the moment but they're not even doing that I prefer the Tory R rhetoric do you first because they are class conscious you know they are loyal to their social class who is labor loyal to they're trying to to what
(38:34) to tell the British Bui and aristocracy don't trust the toist trust us I think so yeah well con you know you know these old men in the clubs of London you know look at them and laugh at them they may consider them useful idiots and quite useful but they will never trust them uh they may you know they may you know like like Tony Blair's government if was excellent Splendid for conglomerates and corporations and so on for rubert for rubert Murdoch who even supported Tony Blair he may even support K tomorrow but
(39:07) trer Muk thinks of them as weasels they don't they can't take them seriously because nobody likes a traitor a traitor of the class that they supposedly represent no one likes a traitor especially the one who benefits from the Traer so K stama wins that election let's say I don't know a land maybe it's like 97 whatever it's like but nonetheless he has a significant majority in Parliament and I'm going to expect and predict that his political answers will not rise to the scale of the challenge
(39:38) not least because they are essentially the neoliberal economic settlement that we've had in this country for the last 30 years so how on Earth can you rise to the challenges that have been delivered by the same system by go turning back to that system nonetheless the electorate says okay we gave you a chance you have failed we placed Our Hope in you you've let us down what's the most likely political vehicle they will be able to turn to instead let's assume it's the conservative party that has gone through
(40:01) its ideologic battle for its ideological Soul has ended up in the grip of Suella bramman cam Bok some kind of populist right-wing politician and we could end up with the extraordinary scenario of going from let's say a 200 seat labor majority in the space of one Parliament to a resurgent populist right I think K starm has to be incredibly conscious of that fact and that risk and I don't know if he is that you're being too kind to kiss I simply don't think there is much happening between his ears except uh a
(40:35) burning ambition to move into T Downing Street power I have seen nothing ever coming from him which um Can Be Imagined as empirical evidence that there is any analytical thinking going on in his brain in his mind and if it is it's very well hidden but you know what I think what you just said which completely correct answers the question you put to me earlier about how is it that we are in a constant crisis of the capitalist economic order and yet it's only the right that succeeds well when the left is represented by somebody like K St
(41:19) what else you do you expect uh especially when you have people like Rachel Brees and Karma that are struggling to present themselves as most more royalists than the king because they need to go the extra mile in order to prove to The Establishment that they're not a threat to them so in a sense they're going to be more right-wing than the torist because the torist don't need to prove to The Establishment that they are Tories so they can yeah give a little bit of money to the NHS and without being taken to task by
(41:55) the Mur press right I very much fear that the G label government you see many people said to me come on yanis but labor will be better than the Tories no not necessarily when it comes to Ukraine The NeverEnding war of Ukraine I mean y more so than suak seems to believe that um we have to as the West we have to keep going until we take Moscow without soldiers fighting gilinski soldiers taking Moscow that means a never ending War that's k starmer k starmer has been complicit in the genocide in Gaza from day one to this
(42:37) very moment when you that we're you know chatting uh so why would the Tor government be worse a fair question I think before we um and you know what I prefer to have bastards in power who claim to be bastards representing the aristocracy than bastards in power who claim to be representing the working class and in denial of their status as bastards um before we uh before we uh draw this to a close I'd like to talk for for a few questions if we may about the crisis um in Gaza that you just mentioned uh the situation in Rafa is
(43:13) worsening more than a million people displaced people there now um the shelling has started the bombardment has started how conscious should we be in the west of the decision that came out of the hag that there is the potential for a genocide being caused in Gaza at this moment in time um and do you think that Israel's current actions specifically what's happening in Rafa right now um constitute well I mean you did just use the phrase but I'd like you to expand on it uh a genocide the genocide started in 1948 it's simply
(43:44) becoming uh more lethal more bloodthirsty uh less barable than it ever was the complicity of the West is um mind numing and indisputable here you have an apar hiide state it is clearly an apide anybody who's been to the West Bank knows it's an apar hiide State they've built walls and they've built roads exclusively for the use of the illegal settlers uh that the local population cannot use that's apide so you have an apide state which um has always tried to merge the Zionist ideology the Zionist
(44:32) narrative with the facts on the ground the Zionist narrative from the 1910s was a land without the people for a people without the land in other words tanus is what the British did in Australia they said you know Captain Cook arrives and declares that Australia to be empty of people so the B are not people so kill them right genocide it's the first step tanus is the first step towards genocide so that's a Zionist project a land without a people for a people without a land now of course there were people there there
(45:07) were millions of people there were so now the IDF is in the process of ensuring that the zist um allegory slogan becomes a fact on the ground they're getting rid of them the whole point is to expel them to kill them to to drive them away they do not want to kill them all I mean they want to kill as many as is necessary to convince the rest to leave uh you can see that in the West Bank because people say to me but Janis how can you possibly support Hamas I'm not supporting Hamas Netanyahu supported Hamas leud and Netanyahu were
(45:40) in the business of diminishing the authority of the poo and they have been for decades supporting Hamas financially uh politically militarily until they completely destroyed the um the capacity of the of the PLO of the Palestinian Authority to appeal to the Palestinian people and only Hamas is left to represent them and in any case let's say that we press a button and hamash disappear they just disappear they you know they're all convinced they're brainwashed by some wonderful piece of artificial intelligence delivered by
(46:24) drones you know to to give up to surrender what happens in West Bank Hamas are not there the ethnic cleansing the genocide is continuing there and of course you can see that they just want the land not to not to mention the natural gas deposits which are of Gaza so this is what's happening the West especially those who claim to care about human rights we must accept that we have now proven Beyond dispute that we never cared as countries as Politics as establishments as media about human rights we only cared about our human
(47:05) rights and the human rights of our friends of our bastards right if you are not one of us you don't have human rights you can be bombed you you're never killed even if we kill you you die um whenever they say hang on what's Happening they are terrorists right so never before has the West image around the world been so terrible what is happening is at once in the west opinion public opinion conventional wisdom is solidifying its support for Israel's genocide but the rest of the world is becoming more and more
(47:51) disillusioned with the so-called principles or ethical um dimension of the western uh polity of the western way of thinking you mentioned drones there and I would like to if we have time to cover the intersection of sort of techn feudalism and this conflict but can we just hone in for a second on the sort of the shifting of Israel's stated War aims because initially we were told it's the destruction of Hamas right which poses its own questions because does that mean the military infrastructure does that
(48:24) mean the nurses that are employed in the Hamas run Health Ministry for example but that was the initial state of a and gradually the rhetoric has changed to Security Control in Gaza the the rhetoric is Shifting and I wonder first of all what you believe the actual War aim is for Israel and secondly whether you think that aim is achievable the original War aim has always been to take over the land from the river to the Sea as part of a greater Israel to expel half of the Palestinians and to keep the other half as bonded slaves that was the
(49:05) original apide idea of the white supremacist the boers in af South Africa that's why we call it an apide state that was always the case up until the 7th of October that plan was working magnificently because you and I were not even discussing Palestine at least not to the extent that we are especially public opinion worldwide had accepted that it was all over over that Israel had won that um you know the Palestinians in Gaza were fading 60% of children before the 7th of October were malnourished so the Embargo was
(49:40) effectively killing them softly slowly and it was just a matter of time before you know the people living there would want to get out and the land would be cleared and it would be settled settlers and so on uh while in the West Bank you had uh something like 100 200,000 settlers 10 15 years ago now you have 800 900,000 so they keep settling they go straight from Boston or Brooklyn or from they go straight to house uh of a Palestinian that has been thrown out of his home illegally in occupied land so that was the
(50:20) aim on the S 7th of October hamas's actions shook the military establishment the intelligence establishment in Israel because they realized that they had not contained them to the extent that they had hope they would and but that was a magnificent opportunity for them essentially to kill lots of Palestinians and to use that setback in their intelligence Community uh as uh an opportunity for speeding up the process of genocide that's what it is and as far as Netanyahu is concerned his War aim is that the war doesn't end an endless war
(50:59) because he knows that the moment it ends he loses the prime ministership and you have Biden Schulz macron Rish sunak supporting this war criminal I'm glad therefore they are war criminals themselves I'm glad you mentioned the international leaders in connection to this because I wanted to get your thoughts on how realistic International pressure is in possibly bring about an end to this conflict whether that's I don't see the international pressure where is it well that's what I'm going to ask you where
(51:30) is it you know Mr borell the ridiculous supposed foreign minister of the European Union the High Commissioner for foreign affairs and gave a speech for the first time which was critical of Israel and he said um that that they've gone too far theyve G too far in Gaza right and how can they kill these people they are sending them the weapon weapons the bombs that are being dropped on Rafa as we speak how dare he how dare you Mr borell ask such a question you are arming the hands that are killing the Palestinians and you have the audacity
(52:11) to question why is it that they are continuing to do it you're giving them every reason to be doing it you know President Biden came the other day out and said something similar that they they overd done if he orders today that the American Army seizes to support through the satellite system through delivery of armaments spare parts for their planes and of course these gigantic bombs that are being delivered daily to Israel by the American Military the war will end tomorrow so if it was applied International pressure could bring about
(52:50) an end to this conflict yesterday could have ended we are in the West responsible for the Ming and the killing of the children of Gaza today we are responsible for it a really sombering place um to finish this conversation Janis far Fus thank you so much for taking the time to speak to me I really appreciate it um we started the conversation talking about the documentary not made by you but certainly it features you in in some parts in all part but it's the artistic when you watch a movie it's the director's artistic
(53:26) it's not the actors I was just talking heading there of course um where can people find the documentary should they wish to see it you can see now the link go for it it's called in the eye of the storm follow it Fus thank you so much for taking the time well thank you
