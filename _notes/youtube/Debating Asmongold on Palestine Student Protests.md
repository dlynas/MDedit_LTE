Transcript:
(00:00) and I think that's it's a bad thing it definitely is a bad thing but at the same time I also think it's a bad thing for a bunch of people to just go camp out at the University for you know multiple days at a time and I I think that's not unreasonable I don't think that I'm being unreasonable with this but I also think I think a bad thing I don't think it's a bad thing because there's no there's no other there's no other options at that point for people to to actually make up fuss kind of you
(00:28) know what I mean in the most peaceful ways possible if you want to talk about it I'm down but if not no big deal I don't want to derail your stream if you're trying to move on oh D yes I would love to talk to you yeah that'd be great you want to turn on your camera oh Fu I'm in bed uh is my mic good if it's not I can get back on my computer yeah your microphone's fine okay okay yeah no I'm chilling man let me see if I can do a Discord bubble or something oh there it is okay cool yeah sorry I can't
(00:55) really quite see cuz I'm like not even at my computer right now it's all good but yeah I didn't I didn't want to deril your stream or anything like not at all my stream is a sequence of endless derailments in general so yeah I mean like so I I I see what you're saying kind of with like the guy entering the encampment but I think that it's kind of problematic if people just get into a university and build like an area and tell people they can't go inside that area and also like in the
(01:25) video it's hard for me to know whether they're really stopping him from the encampment cuz like I mean in and you know you can look at it from my perspective because you look at that video and it doesn't seem like there's an encampment behind those people yeah they framed it in a way specifically so that it would invoke that response from people that are unfamiliar so you think that like basically they uh they filmed it from a direction where there aren't it's not that I think I know I was there
(01:51) no when did you go there I went there three days ago I think and he was there actually even that day as well he's been there every single day so he's one of these roly haired Zoomers that runs around and is like trying to use American foreign policy and active conflict to basically make Tik Tock Cloud for himself he's also worked with groups like Stan with us which is a group that directly gets funding from the Israeli government so like he has worked with the Israeli government to do propaganda already but I'm sure this is
(02:20) a great career opportunity for him that's why he's been on Fox News there's videos of him like trying to debate and agitate teachers uh that are near the encampment even Scott news called him a counter protester and an agitator like he's like a known figure this is not a random guy that's also the reason why he is at least for UCL campus he's the only video of like anyone even claiming that students are blocking people from going to campus because he's deliberately going up to the encampment in an effort
(02:48) to try to get into the encampment to start fights when I was there a bunch of Zionist counter protesters Tred to do that as well and the students were incredibly well organized incredibly well organized and and they just set up a human chain to like they don't even like physically apprehend or remove people they basically just body block them as though they are they you know having a picnic oh yeah no I saw that and I think it was like I think two nights ago not last night whenever all the stuff got removed but the night
(03:16) before I mean it was pretty obvious that like the Israeli or like Zionist or anti- Palestinian ones were the aggressors and I think that that's a bad thing I mean I I don't think that the guy is in the wrong though for being a counter-protester or even for being an agitator really it depends on how you define the word because that's his freedom of speech and I feel like that's what's fair in the same way that it's fair for those other people to go and protest for Palestine yeah but the
(03:42) difference is the difference is first of all bear mace or Mason General is illegal to bring to protest and he's like flashing it there's another video of the students literally he walks up to them when they're gearing up for the cops to show up yeah and they they soon to say we are peaceful we're peacefully protesting against the Israeli genocide here like we see your bare mace like please you're making us feel unsafe and he actually literally does not have a right to have that on him and yet that
(04:09) on that very same night last night he was over there dabbing it up with the cops and the cops obviously don't give a about the prop Palestinian encampment especially because two nights prior at this point when the counter protesters actually entered the or tried to enter the encampment they came with weapons they came with fireworks they came with skunk spray they came with bar that was like the day that um because they were chanting the where were you was this the the where were you moment I don't know what the what do you mean
(04:38) where were you oh oh yeah I guess you were sleeping like last night whenever it happened like a lot of the protesters were like chanting at the cops oh they were saying where were you yeah yeah okay so so like we're talking about the same thing right so that so the night prior the reason why they were chanting where were you last night to the cops is probably because the night prior uh Zionist counter protesters actually stormed the camp and beat the out of some of the Palestinian students like or Pro Palestinian students with like uh
(05:08) wood pallets I watched it happen I watched it happen live it was disgusting like I I was kind of disappointed that the police didn't arrest any of them yeah the police came the police actually came they did yeah and they stood by for an hour and 30 minutes in single file line formation while these guys were beating the out of and these guys aren't even students like you can see it in the video they're like these guys are like adults they're older you know what I mean they're like older also there's
(05:37) also the protesters that are Palestinians that were identified as being older as well so I'm saying yeah no no I'm saying that like a lot of these guys especially the more violent ones have already been like identified as not going to UCLA and they're basically return customers and they they're basically return customers at this point it was a big point of contention with the students too because UCLA was like oh we're going to we are going to take administrative action against the counter protesters for being
(06:04) violent and the students were frustrated with that because they were like how the are you going to do anything as an Administration to someone who's not a student because a lot of the counterposes were not students like there were known right-wing figures and stuff like that amongst the counter proes anyway so the reason why the students were frustrated understandably is because they've demonstrated great messaging discipline so far they are as Limited in their disruption as possible and historically speaking campus-wide
(06:29) Pro protest such as this one is infinitely more disruptive than what the Palestinian uh the pro Palestinian encampment look like I mean we're talking in 1968 they were taking literally uh students would go in during the Civil Rights Movement with guns and take Dean's hostage in 1968 in Columbia they took a Dean Hy for like days yeah yeah I know about that yeah they would like they would literally just like shut off access for any for a Dean from like leaving their room they'd be like no you're not leaving so historically
(07:01) speaking people on the right side of history that we understand were on the right side of history have taken way more radical and way more disruptive approaches to protest so all things considered both in the Columbia University uh where they overtook Hamilton Hall again just like they had done time and time again at Columbia specifically that Hall has a historical significance for student protesters and also especially at UCLA where the encampment was like not even remotely disruptive simply just uh Tak taking on
(07:30) this massive lawn space where there's a lot of demonstrations usually um and and building a uh like putting tents around it and trying to protect the tents from uh people coming in and and it up there are videos of there are videos of counter protesters breaking into the encampment in spite of the the human wall the human shield the human chain that they create and as soon as they get in they start throwing hooks throwing bows stealing people's tan trying to like on like trying
(08:01) to break the tents apart and stuff so that's the reason why they don't want to let in random people to protect the students because they know the university won't do that as demonstrated by the fact that they didn't do that when the counter pror came and the cops literally stood idly by I do think that like whenever I watched it live uh there was like crazy violence and then once the cops showed up even whenever they were in that line the violence went down by like 95% but I think that you're
(08:27) totally right that the counter that protesters were like the agitators they 100% were and they were being violent and to me it was disappointing that I think the police didn't arrest more of them because it was pretty obvious that the pro Palestinian ones were the ones that were the victims in that situation yeah but they ended up arresting only the Palestinian like the pro Palestinian side and the night prior the night prior they didn't actually they didn't actually engage with the counter protest
(08:54) there's uh yeah until you know until they were setting off fireworks in launching them directly in the encampment so the question is you know why are they picking aide because they've arrested hundreds of students both at Columbia University B CC and why what's up you mean why are the police picking aside oh the police are picking a side and it's not the side that is the violent side in the situation it's the side that's peacefully demonstrating in a in in my opinion a direct violation of
(09:26) First Amendment rights um I don't even personally believe that protesters are supposed to like protests are going to be disruptive some of those protest movements uh you might not agree with or the taxes you might not agree with but ultimately the way I look at it is um they they were the perfect victims in this situation even though I don't expect them to be perfect victims and yet even after all of that they were still met with violent suppress violent Free Speech suppression from the state I don't know if it's really free
(09:57) speech suppression right because they're not really getting arrested for protesting they're getting arrested for putting a bunch of tents on the campus whenever the campus tells them to leave yeah I mean the police nobody nobody ever nobody ever gets arrested for protesting that's just um that's not a thing everybody always everybody always when States like in like in Russia or in China or whatever when people are like getting arrested for protesting the state of course makes up like another
(10:24) reason for it uh there as well they'll be like oh trespassing you know what I mean obstructing do you think it's unreasonable um do I think that arresting someone for protesting peacefully is unreasonable yes well do I think that I mean I think a better question is that if you own a property like should you have the autonomy to decide who's on that property well in this circumstance it's literally public property because it's UCLA UCLA is a public school too so that that ultimately uh that ultimately changes
(10:56) Dynamic a lot it depends on what the property is though there's like private property like someone's house right I don't think that people should come to your house and protest it at your house like that's a it's very different like disrupting your life um and and violating your privacy and safety versus protesting in the middle of a public space at the school that you pay tuition to is perfectly valid in my opinion well everybody else pays tuition too I think it's kind of unfair if for
(11:26) example some people that pay tuition are walking other people out that are also paying tuition from the same services that they're both paying for so that's a you bring up a good point right like you're saying this person also pays tuition he should be able to go to any space he wants to any place he wants to on campus which is correct I mean like I'm sure there's a few exceptions but yeah generally yeah so obviously there are many exceptions not just a few like you know UCLA Camp is very famous they
(11:54) uh they shut off certain parts of the campus for filming and stuff like that all the time um um the difference here is that this is a broad open public space that these students were already occupying and um the the reason why they're not letting like they weren't disrupting class they weren't stopping people from going to class the university as a matter of fact is the reason why the other buildings that were in the surrounding area were shut down I talked to the students when I was there and they stated they wanted to go to the
(12:26) library for example it's across the the the uh green area is across the uh the way from the library they shut down the library during midterms so that these guys' lives would be harder so that they would have a harder time studying they shut down the Wi-Fi so that uh students that are on the encampment would not be able to use it trying to make you know make this protest as hard for them as possible which is normal I don't think that that's a good thing to do personally I think it probably goes
(12:52) against the values that UCLA espouses specifically ironic because like a lot of these campuses literally have like super woke terminology in their in their studies like USC literally doesn't have genocide studies they call it resisting uh resistance to genocide studies for me so for me it's like if you're taking that extra initiative to be extra woke on the aesthetic front you should probably not be surprised when your students learn the actual lessons that you're teaching in these classes which is that you should resist the
(13:24) genocide right so um the fact that the university turns around uh after teaching them about uh many different genocides that have happened all around the world and then uh and then tries to do everything in their power to make it as like annoying for these students as possible is a little hypocritical in my opinion it is hypocritical but it's also something that's driven by the protesters actions and the protesters are doing that and the result of them doing that is the University shutting down those places and also the
(13:56) university and and you can correct me if I'm wrong about this because I'm not really sure exactly this is just what I've heard uh I thought that about two days ago the UCLA said that the protest was unlawful but before then they were basically kind of like not addressing it or not calling in the police to to do anything is is that right no they actually did call the police but they called the campus police specifically to protect the encampment I was actually kind of surprised at the University's
(14:25) actions at that time because they knew that there were a lot of counter protesters that in comparison to Colombia for example which had literally called the police against the encampment in Columbia University yeah I saw that the UCLA campus actually had sent police to uh to line up around with their backs uh to the encampment that's not just symbolism that actually means something right when you send cops B cops I mean if the university is allowing it then really that's that's the end result I mean
(14:58) they're the ones that make that decision it just it seems confusing to me that you know based off of the logic that like they're trying to shut down the UN or the library or the Wi-Fi but they're also like having police come in and protect them uh it seems very confusing like what are their goals here what are they trying to do well ultimately their goal is to get the students to shut the up and go away and stop bothering the administration to make these moves about divestment I don't know if you're
(15:27) familiar with the with the goals of the student Pro T were and every campus is different but like specifically the UCLA one I can speak to is the divest yeah yeah it's a divest uh from uh UCLA the UC system across the board is a massive endowment and that endowment basically works like a mutual fund you know and they're investing in a lot of Corporations and the students want to have Financial transparency and what corporations the university endowments are going to like what what corporations they're investig in which is perfectly
(16:01) valid perfectly reasonable demands to make as a matter of fact a lot of companies have have done this a lot of people have done this successfully divesting demanding that people divest from oil and gas companies for like environmental activism you know what I mean oh yeah it's been going on a lot and just for the record like I totally support them protesting against that even if I agree or disagree with it it's their right to protest against that the only concern that I have is whenever it shuts down other students ability to
(16:30) learn or get an education or for people to use the facilities in the way that they're intended to whenever you talk about the actual like intent of the protesters I totally support them absolutely or or even the counter-protesters because that's freedom of speech I think that you know if you don't have that I mean you don't have anything yeah as long as they're not as long as they're not trying to like directly agitate disrupt and like harm the students because there's also a completely separate Dynamic here you
(16:56) hate doxing right like you I assume of course so so uh would it shock you if I were to tell you that there are active organizations that collaborate sometimes with the Israeli government sometimes independently that are tasked with doxing students deliberately and even putting their faces on trucks around the campus and uh and driving those trucks around the campus with their massive uh Billboards basically saying like this student their name and and be like this is an an Semite oh yeah I mean I I would
(17:33) instantly believe that I mean absolutely and I'm sure that there are people on the other side to do the same thing it's just simp there aren't any there aren't any official organizations in the same way that Canary mission in the same way that like the organization I'm referencing is called Canary Mission um there's a couple other official organizations as well uh some of them are American organizations they literally directly will be like oh are you at a pro Palestinian protest say you're a anti-semite and then
(18:01) they plaster their faces they literally try to stop you got that like a week ago right or two week stopantisemitism.org called me an anti-semite of the week but I mean what's up well it's it's ridiculous it it's it's absolutely ridiculous I I and this is kind of the problem that I I have and I think that really to me it's pretty obvious that you know being against Israel doesn't mean that you hate Jews right of course and there are plenty of Jews who are against Israel as well especially at those protest well
(18:33) there's even some that are protesting in Israel as far as I know yeah so yeah no I I understand that and uh I I I I think that's problematic too I don't I don't agree with that either it's in my opinion I think it's intimidation but it's also like a a misrepresentation so yeah I think that's bad in the same way that anybody else I also don't think that people who are pushing back against these people like the actual protesters that are making the encampments and everything
(19:03) like that I I don't think that they're fascists like I have people calling me a fascist for example which I think I think is is really kind of Overboard and I think also I think some of those guys are fascists for the record I I do oh oh oh and and I bet some of the people that are against Israel are anti-semites absolutely yeah but ultimately ultimately uh no no no I I don't disagree with you I think there's like definitely there's definitely anti-Semitism in the in the prop movement as well but the broader the you
(19:32) have to look at the broadest uh defense of the movement right like what is the movement signify what their overarching goals are the reason why I have uh an easier time calling those who defend Israel fascist is because Zionism uh is predicated on the idea that Israel has to be a Jewish supremacist ethn state that literally has a a certain percentage of Jews inside of Israel this is a demographic concern unlike any other here in the United States of America if we were to say America has to be a nation that is
(20:09) 75% you know Irish English and German white everyone would understandably go that's insane that's just white supremacy but yeah Zionism is that exact same principle is that exact same concept but for uh for very valid historical reasons it has been able to shelter itself as a defensive posture as though it is a defensive ethn State the valid reasons is of course the context of like World War II and you know like everything that happened yeah so no I understand that and I mean I'm not really a pro-israel
(20:46) guy all honestly uh I don't really give a about them it's not my fight to fight it's not my problem actually I mean listen that's a good point yeah no I know we do spend a T of tax to defend Israel we gave 26 billion to Israel just this past week I mean yeah I think it's a waste of money it's absolutely a waste of money I wouldn't want to support that especially not whenever they're doing things and uh you know like bombing these people over in Gaza and like
(21:19) of course not yeah why would I want why would I want to support that yeah no absolutely which is why I think uh the the protest that these students are engaging in is like not only perfectly valid but I think their methods are above and beyond like there is there are rarely ever going to be protest where like you have a hard time finding a single person that doesn't say something wrong or a single person that doesn't gete get ahead of themselves you're totally right I mean you can't color an
(21:48) entire like movement based off of like the like the most uh like extreme examples extremist or like yeah the most Bad actors right the same as like you know yeah I'm sure there are anti-i that are Palestinian you know Pro Palestinian but that's not that's not the majority of them that's there also there are also people who are trying to co-op like there's always like a bunch of charlatans on Twitter who are actually neo-nazis like openly but then they'll be like oh yeah how about them Jews like
(22:15) they'll they'll try to like sneak in to be like oh yeah we love Palestine right when in fact you've uh you look you know a couple tweets down and eny is my friend yeah yeah so um that is actually part of the reason why why these student organizers are very careful with who they let into the encampment as well because they don't want to make sure that there they want to make sure that there's no one that is like in support of Palestine or seemingly in support of Palestine that's in there to say like
(22:43) some and they do a very good job with that too someone Nazi yeah that's smart for them to do yeah so that's that's the other reason why they don't let everyone into the encampment yeah I mean I I can kind of understand that but I think that it's also really determined based off of the University like the truth is that the university should have the final say on whether the encampment like that should exist or not and I I think that really if the university is okay with it then
(23:12) of course the encampment should exist because they're the ones that determine what the rules are there but I think the university if the university doesn't want the encampment I don't think that the students have the right to make an encampment there I think that's unfair I mean I think that ultimately ultimately especially like protesters will always be disruptive obviously but if protests are only determined by how lawful they are you can write a law to make any protest illegal which Americans
(23:43) kind of have as a matter of fact I don't know if it would shock you to find out if if I were to tell you that in the state in your state in Texas if you want to work for the Texas uh state if you want to work for the city you have to actually sign a law that says you will never engage in boycotting or uh demanding divestment or demanding sanctions on the state of Israel did you know this that's a direct violation of First Amendment rights a direct violation how did that even happen um APAC APAC wrote
(24:16) the legislation this was legislation that actually two uh Jewish prominent members of Congress were very much against as a matter of fact Bernie Sanders and Diane Feinstein have um openly criticized this for obvious First Amendment violation boundaries yeah I've never heard of that before yeah I heard there like some anti-Semitism bill that was happening today I haven't read about it yet but I didn't know there was something that was going on that was already on the books man that's crazy yeah well would it
(24:46) shock you to find out that there's actually 35 other states many of them red States as a matter of fact that claim that they care about First Amendment uh and and no restriction on Free Speech ironic because Texas governor Greg Abbott actually said that um you know in in Texas college campuses even Outsiders can come to campus and demonstrate to the best of their ability it was 2021 I think uh 2019 he wrote a later or earlier yeah yeah he yeah he signed legislation in the law which he has personally violated himself by using
(25:23) using the government so are you talking about the recent one yeah so no no matter what happens like the idea that like every every single um every single protest has to go through like a permit process is is obviously I think a little bit ridiculous because like it is there that permit process is there to like genuinely make the state restrict certain kinds of speech and only allow other kinds of speech to exist which in my opinion is in direct violation of first of the first amendment in the way that we understand
(26:02) it people people make laws all the time oh yeah of course they do and yeah I I see what you're saying absolutely and and I think that there's probably a middle ground with that where it's like if people are protesting and you know there's a tent there it's okay probably not a really big deal but I still do think that the University or especially other like private businesses should have every right to tell people not to be there because it's also their private property like I think somebody's right
(26:34) to protest is really important but I think it's also important that somebody has a right to have autonomy over their own property especially whenever if something happens to somebody there they could get sued for it too so and and I think that that's really kind of what the problem with like a lot of this is is that I I think that like you and I probably align with a lot of the different like opinions that we have in terms of like Israel or Zionism or anything like that I just don't really think that these methods are effective
(27:05) and I I think that they alienate a lot more people than they bring in I think when I think if the student I think if the student proos were not effective one they would not have actually had uh multiple Universities at this point meet their demands like in Northwestern and in Brown University and now uh as recently as a couple hours ago Ruckers university has uh met the demands of uh students for justice for Palestine um which has led to the dispersal of the peaceful dispersal of the encampments but beyond that I think that another
(27:38) Testament to the success of these uh protests is the violent reaction of the state because in some ways like police behaving in this way also galvanizes a lot of the protesters um as a matter of fact like this entire conversation started originally quietly at Vander blit University where a couple of um fans of mine as a matter of fact got suspended from school for doing an encampment then students at Columbia University saw that and said that that's we should divest as well and then their uh encampment began after
(28:12) that and then they got suppressed by the police and then their encampment grew and now this is in almost every single state with the exception of I think like 10 uh at this point and also uh happening globally as a matter of fact so in a way in a way they were profoundly successful so successful that you know a lot more you know a lot more about this than I do so I'm kind of curious uh so you're talking about like how Brown University and a lot of these other universities successfully the students have had their their demands
(28:45) met and so whenever you say oh okay well the ones that have did they ever like have the police remove the uh the encampments because like I think if the univ is allowing it to happen then I feel like the protest is totally justified it's completely fine no there was police presence in all the campuses as well and the police actually said that they would be uh interested in violently dispersing the encampments even at Ruckers University but the but the administration uh looked at the demands and found them to be reasonable
(29:20) see the thing the thing is there's two ways to always deal with Conflict Management no matter what you either you either the vi arm of theate to violently apprehend students break apart the en use pepper spray tear gas and and uh rubber bullets that you know cops literally shot some of the members of my community in the face with uh last night and I mean Fair whenever I looked at the whenever I want because I I watched the whole thing happen I didn't really see a lot of the police officers shooting people that weren't shooting fire
(29:58) extinguishers at them like I'm I'm sorry but I think if you shoot a FL if you if you are spraying a fire extinguisher at a police officer I think they have every right to shoot you with a rubber bullet you shouldn't be doing that it's disgusting well I don't know if it would shock you to find out but rubber bullets are not supposed to be directed uh directly at protesters supposed to be a less than lethal uh apprehension method or riot control method and when they actually do shoot someone in the face
(30:27) they can kill them the people like you're not supposed they're supposed to yeah against against fire extinguishers what they're supposed to do is shoot it on the ground these guys were directly aiming it at the faces of of students and also it wasn't just it wasn't just students that were holding fire extinguishes it was pretty much anyone and everyone it was a you know it was basically a Kill Zone you can kill people with rubber bullets by the way that's why they call it less than lethal yeah no you you definitely can
(30:55) but I'm not I'm not going to tell the police officers they're wrong for defending themsel against somebody who's blowing a a fire extinguisher at them I think that's ridiculous I think I think that they should have every right to defend themselves against that the students do you think the students have a right to defend themselves they weren't being attacked they weren't being shot no they the cops were at that point the cops were apprehending them they were they were arresting yeah because they were
(31:24) yes because they were breaking the law and the university wanted them off the campus and they have right to ask them to leave the campus they didn't do it and of course the cops would have to remove them ask way do you think it's an do you find it to be a just and proportionate response to unarmed students um and many of them almost all of them were unarmed and the ones that had I guess fire extinguishers is is few um do you think it's a appropriate response to violently in full riot gear uh violently apprehend and you know
(32:02) assault students uh because they because you know they're peacefully demonstrating but the university now has uh demanded that they disperse like um well I think there's two different categories of that so uh for the students that are not being violent because a lot of the students were being violent they were throwing things at the cops they were spraying fire extinguishers at them I'm sorry but that's not a peaceful protest if you're spraying a fire extinguisher with a police officer you're not being peaceful
(32:34) so if the police officers are violent in return no I actually think it's totally fine no well here's the thing that's the reason why this is really important right like the the reason why like I'm glad I went to the encampment I'm glad that like all this was filmed it was peaceful until the police came with weapons and with riot gear and started uh started apprehending with physical Force the students if you look at the if you look at the visuals from before the police officers actually came on the campus it
(33:07) was actually quite peaceful people are dancing people are singing um people are eating food and chilling overall it's it's actually the university that and this is what many students are saying as well both at Columbia University even students who might not have agreed with the overall cause of the protest now now uh now feel uh that the university has left them out and and left their and compromised their safety personally by bringing Outsiders specifically cops uh to come in and violently apprehend
(33:43) students who weren't doing anything who were just who weren't harming anyone who were simply demanding in the most peaceful way they possibly can like literally that uh the university divest from yeah a a violent state that they are uh funding and facilitating I I get that I I also totally disagree with it I think the university should have every right to decide who is and isn't on their property and I think in the instances that you were giving me an example of earlier like brown I think that brown
(34:14) didn't ask the police to come in and brown allowed those protests to happen and I think that's totally fine but if the university doesn't want those people there I think that at a certain point they have every right to have the police come in and remove them and the truth is that I don't think that the police were overly violent to a lot of those people I I really don't I think I mean there there there's a lot of there's a lot of visuals of of uh people like bleeding profusely from the head their due to
(34:43) getting hit in the head but that's but that's violence right like you like that's it's violence because it is like there's no other so here here's an interesting question right so like what would you propose as an alternative to that like How would how would you solve it oh in yeah great question so my uh my solution to this would be exactly what brown and all of these other campuses did which is to allow the protest to continue and also meet the demands to the best of your ability and and take an
(35:18) honest negotiation effort with the students because ultimately if you believe personally that these students are in the right and and it seems like uh you specifically do think that these students are making making just demands yeah they are they have every right to protest and like for example like at UT here like we had a lot of protests and uh it was very disappointing for me to see a lot of people in in my chat and just in the community in general that were celebrating whenever the police were coming in and removing them because
(35:54) these people were not being violent they weren't breaking the law they were just Pro protesting and I completely support that yeah but until until the university decides that they can't is what you're saying for UCL so that's that's yeah that's my perspective so if the so the UT University of Texas Austin uh Administration saying like we don't want these protests on campus uh leading to a police response would be would be just then but because you're I think go ahead no no go you go ahead
(36:30) yeah yeah so I I think that it really kind of depends on the situation in general I think the answer to that is probably yes uh but I'm sure that there are probably some circumstances especially with people that are just there and not taking up space and they're just talking and not really like obstructing anyone not setting up encampments and they're just there yeah I would think that's really kind of up for them to remove them for that reason but in the context of what happened at UCLA I I don't think that it
(36:56) was up because it had been going on for multiple days and you know like it it doesn't like I mean let's be real who really gives a about the you know the pavement and everything but they are graffitiing everything and they're destroying a lot of things like I see Windows getting knocked out uh I don't think there were any Windows knocked out of UCLA you might be confusing that with Colombia and the only windows that were knocked that's what I was saying in multiple places yeah oh yeah so Columbia University they
(37:26) broke into Hamilton Hall to take it over um which is again I I will defend that as well I have defended that I think that's perfectly valid it's trespassing it's trespassing right yeah well it's not just trespassing it's it's like breaking like you're you're breaking the windows to trespass right it's one thing like oh we just walked material material damage facilities yeah material damage to facilities is like is is a an injustice is what you're what you're saying here
(37:57) in this situation you might have that opinion abely is yeah it Absolut okay so so then don't you think that the University's reaction by sending thousands using millions of dollars of taxpayer dollars and sending in thousands of cops to break every door inside of Hamilton Hall and most of the windows outside of Hamilton Hall caused an infinite more uh amount of material damage than just simply meeting the students have way at the bargaining table I completely agree with it and the reason why is because it's their
(38:33) property to damage and they have every right to do that and the law has to be upheld to a degree but doesn't that but doesn't that mean that like the university kind of doesn't give a about the material harm in that circumstance because if if they cared about what happens to the two windows well it's not about it's not about the material harm necessarily it's about having the autonomy of the material harm and being able to decide what you do with your your own material and what you do with your own property
(39:00) and what you don't do with it and I think that's that's extremely important and it it's it's worth more and it's more important than any actual material or piece of property in itself it's the essence that somebody has their their own autonomy to decide what they do with what they own because one of the things that they also did at Colombia was falsely claim that um falsely claimed that like these students were actually harming and being anti-semitic and like scaring Jewish students even
(39:29) though ironically Jewish students were overrepresented and those arrested in the first sweep so once again it's it's the university that is claiming that police action must be met like police action must occur upon these students because they have made up a fake reason a reason really that uh these students are somehow scaring uh uh the the uh student population and threatening them when no such evidence existed for that only to only to cause far greater harm to the student population because then they violently
(40:06) assaulted and arrested hundreds of students so it's a it's a bit of a it's a bit of a I'm cutting my nose despite my face situation don't you think but it's their face to cut and it's their decision because it is students is because it's it's their it's their right it's their business and or not business I guess you could say uh but it's their no universities are business for sure yeah no I I think that in some cases you're probably right uh and I think also like a lot of the people that were
(40:35) being violently arrested I think it takes two to tango in a lot of cases and I think a lot of these people are being violently arrested but they're also not complying with what the police are wanting they're actively breaking the law and I don't think that's something like how do you like well like let me like yeah how do you deal with a person that is active resisting you and won't obey the law because I feel like you have to restrain them somehow don't you so you you actually bring up a really good point
(41:07) that I uh I love this conversation this is not a gotcha at all have you ever been arrested um no I have not okay so I have I've been pulled over I've been like detained but I've never been arrested yeah so I have um and it's not I'm promise you it's not a gotcha at all the reason why I'm bringing this up is because so resisting arrest is a is what is Attack on charge because uh cops often times I'm sure you've seen like body camera footage well there will be like oh stop resisting stop resisting while they
(41:36) literally have like their knee on the neck of a of a suspect already you know what I mean that's on the ground and it's is it's technically uh it's technically a charge and here's why because getting handcuffed physically like physical restriction uh physical apprehension is actually done in such a way that uh your body cannot contort in that way so your body naturally reacts when your arms are behind your back and you're being placed in in handcuffs so it's actually one of
(42:10) those laws that is basically designed uh because it's the physical natural response to you being apprehended so uh many times in many instances like it's basically there so that it gives cops just cause to say well we're using Force because you're forcibly resisting when in fact uh many people who are being arrested in a lot of circumstances are not physically like directly violently trying to resist in the way that you and I would understand it like you know punching a cop or or you know what I mean like or like not
(42:44) complying but in many circumstances there actually are simply trying to comply in many body camera footage we see that too where they're like I'm not I'm not resisting I'm not resisting and they just keep saying stop resisting it's because your body is physically moving in that way naturally um it's built it's it's designed a way to to just add on to the charges to justify after the fact uh once you have decided to to apprehend someone physically and you're saying this is this is what's happening
(43:11) whenever you get handcuffed yeah 100% And and another and another charge and another charge that they're using in UCLA resisting though right because like you know I don't I think that there are a lot of instances where somebody is resisting arrest and it's not because of a body contortion reason they're running away from police you're trying to push them away I mean you can't have that I mean like I I'll I'll Grant you the Handcuff thing sure I I mean I think that there are a lot of cases where like
(43:41) cops are unnecessarily violent and they escalate the situation in a way that they shouldn't and I I think that's bad Absolutely I'll give you I'll give you another perspective that is also even crazier than that are you ready for this it's going to blow your mind in Germany in Germany it is technically not illegal to try to escape prison did you know this no no I didn't know that because under the German understanding of human law they believe that obviously all men want freedom so it is a
(44:17) Perfectly Natural and perfectly valid response to being apprehended and being put in prison so technically when you do try to escape prison in Germany if you do actually Escape prison in Germany the only charges they will add on is if you are escaping with the state's clothes like if you're wearing prisoner Garb they will sayec stealing yeah like in America if you obviously try to escape prison like that's a charge in and of itself in Germany they don't even have that they don't they don't consider that
(44:45) to be U an additional offense to add on to your record because they consider that to be the natural predisposition of humans that they want to be free it's just the reason why I brought it up is because like we a lot of laws are designed around the culture and and whatever our material conditions are whatever we want the criminal justice system to do and that is precisely the reason why the application of like things such as trespassing or things such as um like lawful dispersal are often times simply charges that we've created so the state
(45:23) can suppress Free Speech without you know saying we are doing this because we don't like what you're saying but that doesn't change the reality that it's a charge uh a ton charge or a charge that they're using specifically to actually violently suppress free speech I I I I don't agree with that I I don't because like there are a lot of instances where some they're trying to arrest somebody and the person is actively trying to fight them and stop them from arresting them like how can
(45:55) you have a world where that's acceptable like wouldn't that massively endanger the lives of every single police officer it depends it depends on which country we're talking about I guess but I mean like yeah I mean what whatever Germany does is what they're going to do but it's like I can't see a world where being able to resist arrest is like not going to lead to massive risks of violence against police officers it's the application of the law I think that I think that there should
(46:25) be probably a higher standard for things such as this because obviously like um as long as it's not violent as long as it's not like genuinely causing harm to others um I think that a trespass law in this situation especially because it is public land um trespass in this circumstance is in my opinion not meeting the standard of violent State apprehension if it was something else if these students were like beating the randomly out of like student that are walking around then well you have a specific charge for that right yeah I
(47:01) think that trespass is just a one to use in this circumstance especially after the Vice Chancellor hours prior to the sweep actually went and sat down with the students and talking about in UCLA yeah and uh and the vice Chancellor made it seem as though they were doing this to protect the students they were claiming that um you know they wanted police presence there to protect the students and the students kept asking him uh whether there would be a sweep at all because police presence in this circumstance would not actually mean
(47:34) safety for the students or security for the students but the exact opposite and he basically said oh no there won't be a sweep or maybe there will be a sweep but you'll be able to leave before the sweep uh giving them op uh giving them only one option which is leave or get beaten up I don't think that that is I don't think that that's that's valid to do I I think it kind of is in a lot of circumstances and the reason why is because the alternative to that is that you are effectively holding University
(48:07) hostage and I don't think that's fair but they're not well they kind of are whenever there's well whenever they're saying we won't leave until you do what we want and then you can't make them leave they are effectively holding the space hostage aren't they not I mean the space that they're the space they're occupying is is marginal they could even hold an actual space hostage I guess like if they were to go inside of a building and and set up barricades and whatnot and at which
(48:34) point what I care about is what their goals are right um because all matter of protest is inevitably going to uh inevitably going to be disruptive this one wasn't that's why I think it's like truly unconscionable the reaction from the University and that's why there's a lot of students who are very pissed off right now at UCLA who think like this was unacceptable because um these students did not go above and beyond they didn't do other things like uh you know actually block students from going
(49:03) to class that never actually happened um or even like block students or block faculty as a matter of fact faculty and teachers under uh UAW 4811 the local uh UAW for the grad student uh Union and the teachers union there specifically um specifically were participating in the protest against the police presence thinking that like at least if the if the teachers are there the cops will be less likely to beat the out of the people and that still didn't stop them that's why you see images like that lady yeah yeah you see
(49:39) images everywhere of like there was a there was a a a a lady who is the head of Jewish studies at uh at one of the universities that literally was physically assaulted by the police she's a Jewish woman she's a professor she's the head of the Jewish cultural studies at the school and cops are beating the out of her for saying that like Israel is is doing a genocide I don't think that any of these I guess like the thing that annoys me the most about this stuff and the way that it's covered in
(50:11) mainstream media is the hypocrisy of it all beyond the beyond the obvious issues beyond my own personal perspective on the matter beyond the fact that I think it's truly uncashable that our tax dollars are going to fund and facilitate ruthless B Slaughter overseas instead of you know helping Americans helping people here yeah um beyond that beyond that fact the the the idea that these guys are somehow doing this to combat anti-Semitism is truly truly ridiculous especially when in many instances the people that
(50:48) they're beating up are Jewish students and also Jewish members of faculty in some instances literal Holocaust Survivors that go and participate at these protests so it's all like the the reasoning that the media gives is the justifications that universities give is ultimately they just don't want this kind of protest to occur they just don't want it at all they want everyone to shut the up and say that you love Israel unconditionally and uh that uh you should make no demands from the
(51:18) University whatsoever and I think think that the university isn't you know at Liberty to be held accountable by anybody who wants to get together and hold them accountable even if it's students like I I I agree with you that like all of these things are bad but just because something is bad that doesn't necessarily Greenlight any Behavior you take in order to hold somebody accountable for it so like wow yeah I think that it's absolutely fair for the students to want to you know protest to make the you know the
(51:47) university divest or you know not be involved with those things absolutely that's fair but whenever you do it in a way that the university doesn't want you to I I think that yes they have every right to have you removed because that's the way the law works and I think that's that's what I would say if it was a Walmart doing this or a Starbucks or a person at their house or anything because again a person should have autonomy and the right to decide what they do with their own space and also
(52:15) it's not like the protesters are speaking for every student there are a lot of students that probably are you know like kind of neutral about the topic or might even disagree with it would it shock you to find out and and I know that this is like not something that Ma media covers at all but for example students hold um student hold uh votes like Student Government body will hold votes for divestment in Colombia 90% of the student body voted in favor of divestment 90% in Columbia University so it's actually not about democracy it's the
(52:51) exact opposite it is not meeting the it's not meeting the demands of the students or the interest of the students whatsoever is I'm sure many students uh much like yourself would probably agree that it is kind of ridiculous that we're you know participating our tuition dollars are going to like baby murder machine right um and for the record historically the reason why I brought up like 1968 and many other instances because in 1985 specifically um Columbia University students and students across the board
(53:24) across the United States of America originally did the BDS movement and did the exact same things if not more violent at that time as a matter of fact and successfully were able to get their universities to concede to the reasonable demands that they were making which was to divest from apar South Africa that's the that's the history that these students are are relying on and and they're hoping understandably so that these institutions that are supposed to be there to educate them will be human and will Beason I get well
(53:59) they're trying to get the the the institutions to come to the table and my my point of view is that I don't think the institution should be made to come to the table I think that you should have every right to try to try to get them to do it but the idea that you're going to hold space's hostage or destroy property or do really anything that violates their rights or violates what they their autonomy of their own property and what they have control over that's what I disagree with but I don't
(54:30) I don't have a problem with with people being angry about it and also like anybody can like people don't have to go to that school they're choosing to go to that school and the the student votes are not the like a university is not a Democratic Republic it's not a democracy so the student votes matter and I think I think I think it should be like I If you ask them they would say that they are a place for learning where they do care about their students interests and stuff and they wouldn't like you were to
(55:04) ask them they would disagree with that statement I think well I think that it depends on whether that statement is convenient for them but the truth they're hypocritical for sure oh absolutely but it's still their right to be hypocritical and I I and I'm not and I think this is like kind of two different conversations and you know we could be talking a bit past each other but I think that really they they should should have the final say in whether they do this or not do it but I do agree with you in essence that what they're
(55:32) doing is hypocritical and I also think that it's bad I think that they're wrong I just think that it's important that people have the right to do what they want to do and they can't be intimidated or bullied into doing what a mob of people tells them to do I think that's extremely scary and that's worse than almost anything else wait really you would rather you would prefer rather that like because because the difference between uh the majority the tyranny of majority is the tyranny of minority so
(56:02) you're saying you prefer the tyranny of minority to the tyranny of majority tyranny of majority is democracy right well like let's think about this a little bit more logically so I I see what you're saying and that's an interesting point but I don't think it really applies here because for example if a lot of people are around like some sort of uh I don't know grocery store and there's more people that want to get in get the food out of the grocery store than the people that you know work at the grocery store then
(56:31) you would have a majority of people that you could logically say based off of democracy should be able to do that but the truth is that it's not tyranny of the majority or the minority it's tyranny of the people who have the rights and the ownership of what they have those rights and ownership to and their autonomy to decide what they want to do with that so it's neither I'm I'm a little confused by your example example because in in this circumstance in this circumstance it's like Outsiders like the the example that
(57:03) you're using would actually be best explained with strikes right because what you're what you're uh the analog here is actually grocery store workers who participate and work at the grocery store like clerks and whatnot um who are a part of let's say uh some kind of collective bargaining some kind of Union yeah decide that they are generating a lot of a ton of profits for the Walmart family The Waltons right and they're saying well I think we want know what's up oh I I worked at
(57:40) Sam's Club for a week and an orientation they even had things on the wall saying how bad unions were oh yeah I I know yeah yeah um I love Sam's Club uh Costco's probably better Costco's a little bit better for their workers but you know I I was in awe of Sam's Club when I first came to America I thought this is the greatest thing America's ever invented Club has better pizza man it's really good but yeah um but the thing is in that circumstance right the majority of workers at Sam's Club would
(58:11) potentially stop um or Walmart would potentially stop people from going into Walmart which has historically been done uh for not just Walmart but like you know it's been done time and time again and these examples of protest are disruptive at the time and possibly even very annoying for those who just want to get their food and get the out and they don't want to think about it but ultimately movements like this have uh created a lot of the rules and a lot of the freedoms that we now take for
(58:43) granted including things like the weekend including the abolition of child labor even though it's coming back to America to many different states right now Roo workplace workplace protections things of that nature so the reason why I am on board with these students is not one is not because they're like you know doing unimaginably peaceful pres like much better in a much better way than I would ever be able to do it you're using an argument of basically the ends justify the means right is is yeah you are and I
(59:17) understand but only because but only because like the ultimate goal is one that I agree with and I think is just and I think you think is just as well and that's what I think is though right because once you once you create a foundation where that type of thinking is Justified then who's to stop people who disagree with you and want to do something bad for thinking and applying the same type of logic and that's what I think is scary because I think you're right exist that that that is how most
(59:44) people approach matters bad it's also very bad right and and what I'm saying is that I think there's a situation where in in applications of the law all of it is bad or none of it is bad you you can't have a thing where you kind of means test each individual person and each individual cause as to whether or not it's justifiably okay to break the law for this cause I think that's very unfair and I think also that's not true though what you're what you're saying is actually not correct I
(1:00:14) just want to let you know that's precisely the reason why uh the prosecutor's office in Texas in Austin specifically refused to prosecute all of the individuals that were apprehended by uh the the Texas state troopers at the protest so like leniency is uh exactly how the criminal justice system applies the the means testing I guess um and the reason for why they did that is because these guys were lawfully protesting and exercising their First Amendment right they weren't doing well yeah they weren't doing anything wrong
(1:00:46) number one like the people here at UT were doing nothing wrong they should have never been apprehended yeah there's no but the same but the same uh fate will befall the UCLA students as well well and the reason for why they will uh inevitably not get any serious criminal charges or any charges whatsoever is because ultimately what they are doing is peaceful demonstration the the major purpose here of sending uh the police there is not actually to this this is what is like on principle alone anti-American in my
(1:01:21) opinion if we are to believe the first amendment is is real and true and enshrined and ensr and protected by the Constitution which is probably one of my favorite things about America considering that I came from turkey and a lot of the that I say about the American government or even the Turkish government as a matter of fact would lead me in serious criminal punishment in Turkey my nation of origin yeah no I totally agree with you there so that's why when I see stuff like this when I see the state acting in this way when I
(1:01:51) see the state like designing new bills that say like criticism of Israel is inherently anti-semitic and should be illegal that's the one today yeah when I see stuff like that I am genuinely much more fearful about the future it's awful much more fearful about the future than like students actually protesting against their school in the most peaceful ways possible to be fair I totally agree with you there but I also I think maybe the difference is that I view these like in this circumstance those two examples are both on the
(1:02:21) spectrum of not good or bad things but you're absolutely right that the Israel thing where you can't criticize Israel or say that people are working for Israel it's ridiculous like I I'm it's astonishing to me that it's even considered so so the question I guess is how do we resist against that right and I think the reason why the the founding fathers enshrined the first amendment in the Constitution was specifically because there should be healthy dissent against the government
(1:02:50) in order to stop the government from being uh tyrannical from behaving in a tyrannical way which is precis the reason why I think that the UCLA students are totally in the right and the university instead of taking them seriously and trying to you know trying to mediate the situation in the same way that other colleges have uh seeking the the rabid dogs of the state that take uh that that cost La taxpayers two to8 million2 to8 million a day when let me tell you okay if you get your stolen out here they're going to be
(1:03:28) like LOL okay write a report okay and give it to your Assurance it is sure it's the entitlement and the lack of interest in actually doing your job that really frustrates me about especially Los Angeles Police Department we you and I both know two different people that have had their car stolen that the police did nothing about both lwig both lwig and myth got their car stolen and in the same in that in both cases the LAPD said LOL sorry um but then but then they have the capacity to send thousands of Los Angeles
(1:04:06) Sheriff Department dudes rocking like tactical gear riot gear to beat the out of like otherwise peaceful protesters that are 18 years old these are like queer anthropology students that are sitting in a protest they're bunch of hippies and they're getting brutally taken down by like 45-year-old from uh not even from here from like an you know one of these one of these like Edge cities that they all live in together and coming to brutalize them I think that's unjustifiable I think that that is a
(1:04:39) gross misuse of funds and as a taxpayer who pays uh European level taxes if not more I I wish that you know I demand more from uh I demand more of a return from the taxes that I pay for and I think it's you know my my honest American right to do so just like it's the right for these students to protest well I think yeah you're absolutely right you can demand that as much as you want but it doesn't mean you can go somewhere and just post up there and expect for people to just have to be okay with it like I I agree with you
(1:05:14) that the cops are probably like there are a lot of cases where the cops are incompetent but like the dichotomy that you're creating between like you know the uh police officers arresting the protesters and not getting the people who stole myth or Ludwig's car like in my opinion I think they should do both because if you don't have law and you don't have rule of law and you can't apply the law then everything is chaos and everybody is making up their own rules constantly well I for me I think
(1:05:45) the police I think the police were behaving in an unlawful Way by by going into a otherwise peaceful encampment and and you know beating people and and apprehending them that's what I'm saying I think it's a violation of the First Amendment to do so I think that it's well like don't you you don't view it as like you know for example like if somebody went on to your property and I understand this is a public university so it's different but I do believe that going on to somebody's property and
(1:06:11) refusing to leave is violent it is is fundamentally violent like you're not allowing somebody to access or to use part of their property that they own yeah but this being different is important though because there's personal property like your house or whatever versus public property of a school that you are actually paying tuition to utilize the grounds on like there it's it's entirely different that's why there's public spaces to begin with so that people can protest in places like that in parks and whatnot so
(1:06:43) I guess um the question I had for you yeah at this point is like 1968 Vietnam War and civil rights protests are happening they're much more violent ultimately than these uh this round of protests that are occurring in college campuses like you at the end of the day uh agree with the ultimate solutions that occurred right like ending the Vietnam War uh well that's that's really the thing right is that I I so like I can see where you're going and you know you can you know like kind of like redirect if if if it's not but um like
(1:07:19) basically my perspective is that I do agree with you on doing those things but I think that if you use the argumentation of the ends justify the means I think that can be used in a lot of ways that are extremely harmful and I think that also they can always be used in very hypocritical ways where the ends justify the means in things that I agree with or you agree with or somebody else agrees with but not in cases where other people don't agree with it and that's why I think that the only way to have
(1:07:47) any sort of a stable Society is to have an official set of rules that everybody has to go off of and if you start going off of that are you know like diverging from that everything becomes chaos and everybody starts inventing their own rules and you have situations like what's been happening and I think it's worse for everybody like you said it's millions of dollars that get costs and I think the truth is that if you want to change things there is a democratic process to change things and with the
(1:08:17) university people do have freedom say that the Democratic process cannot is not going to work either in the state in the case of I well well that's because it's not a democracy but people can deal with it in a way that is democratic which is simply choosing not to go there so if people don't like what Colombia is doing they can choose not to go to Colombia so I don't really see the problem here why does Columbia have to you know agree with these people or or bow down to them if these people don't
(1:08:50) even need to be there so that's a great question um and the the best answer perhaps comes from James Baldwin American writer in civil rights activist who once famously said and I I uh don't want to paraphrase this so I'm going to give you the actual quote here said I love America more than any other country in the world and exactly for this reason I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually this is the exact same answer that I gave to people as well whenever they tell me why don't you
(1:09:20) leave America if you're so if you're such a goddamn hater of America now the reason why I I have the financial Freedom this is the same quote as like the you know I don't agree with what you're saying but I'll defend to the death your right to say it so I I I agree with you I I think so but I don't think all types of criticism are the same so yeah go ahead I didn't mean to interrupt well no what what I was what I was trying to point to here with this quote is that I think that you and I
(1:09:50) both agree that dissent is healthy right and I think that absolutely I think that there are uh as I've explained earlier um all throughout history we have had people who believe that their cause is righteous and their cause is just and that their means actually uh their ends uh justify their means right their methods of protest and that is uh I'm thankful I guess for people of the past for demonstrating the courage against the State apparatus that violently chooses to suppress them so that I can live in a country where or I can live in
(1:10:32) a world where people have shown that courage time and time again to to bring to bring us all of the amenities and all the freedoms that we now take for granted whether it be a great place to be yeah whether it be uh the American Revolution early on which was a Bourgeois Revolution Al together and there's still a lot of faults in America but you know um America shows a lot of Promise which it fails meet on a regular basis but ultimately you know I choose to live here right and it is I love America I think America's great yeah I
(1:11:05) totally well you're gonna say probably the same thing right is you're gonna say because you care about it so much that's why you're so critical and that's why you're so hostile about things that you don't believe in yeah I totally agree with you yeah which is why I think it's which is why I think it's wrong that the state acted in the way that it did in this circumstance and not only is it wrong but I also think it's hypocritical that they acted this way this doesn't
(1:11:29) mean that like for example you know in a hypothetical like if a school shooter is barricading himself into a school and holding a bunch of children hostage that like I don't expect the state to be violent you know what I mean I of course I expect this I expect them to not do what they did at youal I expect them to do to be as militant as they are against like a blue-haired uh queer English major at UCLA right um except they don't do that but that's besides the point that's not there's a
(1:12:02) whole different a whole different ly of problems so I'm simply stating that in order for the state to react this way I think um there needs to be a bar there needs to be a bar there needs to be a standard in my opinion um and that standard was certainly not met in this circumstance uh and it's not just because the ends justify the means but does play a role in it because I do think that they're like I'm I'm going to be intellectually honest and and not act like uh I'm taking uh no stances here I
(1:12:34) do agree with this cause I do agree with the cause of the students um but beyond that I think that their methods overall were um their methods overall were of a peaceful nature and I think that the the uh School reacting in this way by sending the cops to brutally arrest these kids was genuinely up like really really bar is where do you think that bar is and scary as well uh what do I think that bar is I think like yeah I think when you do actually engage in direct acts of violence it probably
(1:13:11) it makes your cause definitely a lot less uh palatable to to many others you don't you you don't view like blocking access or trespassing as a direct act of violence no I mean definitionally under the the under the legal code trespass is not considered a violent act oh yeah no it's it's not yeah I and I don't I don't I don't agree that like I don't think it should be considered that I think blocking access in some cases can be however yes if you're if you're like technically kidnapping someone if you're
(1:13:44) like restricting their movement then yes you are doing that but these students weren't doing that the way I see it is like uh everyone dances around the rules right um like to the best of their ability which is precisely the reason why like um I guess it's like what these guys were doing is in some ways even though their cause is just and I agree with their methods and I probably would defend them if they were uh way worse than they are currently for that reason I'm being very honest here um in this
(1:14:12) circumstance especially um the the students uh setting up an encampment and and not allowing like random people who are like very obviously there to agitate uh with the exception of like uh you know students that are genuinely honestly and earnestly trying to uh lend their support was for for good reason so that they don't have like random Nazis showing up at their at their doorstep and saying a whole bunch of like up things that would put a lot of the Jewish students there in direct danger as well to be like oh yeah
(1:14:47) free Palestine also the Jews you know that kind of thing uh not only looks bad optically but it also is um not only looks about optically but is also putting the Jewish students at that encampment In Harm's Way so I think that um I guess the comparison is is kind of like if there was a family on that courtyard having a picnic right just because you're a student you would not that would not give you the right to like step on the picnic while they're having a meal as a family well like well
(1:15:19) like let's use the picnic analogy right and like so if the picnic lasts for six days do you think this the University should have a right to tell the picnic people to leave I don't think the picnic would last for because at that point it would be something different than right I mean at a certain point like I do think that they that they do have the right to get rid of them like I agree with you right I don't think the University's li no no yeah no you're absolutely right the difference is uh
(1:15:48) there have been demonstration such as that in in times past in many other college campuses and more often than not they just kind of waited out and have people leave or they're like all right what the is going on and they could have UCLA could have reacted in the same exact way that other colleges have reacted like I mentioned and tried to find a amicable and peaceful solution instead of actually greatly escalating to Violent means by utilizing the the uh the the police force and greatly putting students in danger of physical
(1:16:26) violence that's that's my main anger here I I get that I think the students put themselves in danger they were told by the cops to leave and they didn't do it it's not their property they weren't allowed to be on there they were told to leave they didn't leave they are putting themselves in that position by their actions like I mean these aren't children right they're these are adults and they're smart people that are going to this college in a lot of the circumstances they know exactly what the
(1:16:53) ramifications of their actions are so that's why this protest that's what they're doing is brave in some in in many different ways because of the potential for State suppression okay so I guess the the question like I said with 1968 and whatnot is that like I don't think you would like as far as all the protests that have happened in the past like the 1985 anti-ar protest yeah similar counters were uh similar uh counter perspectives were brought up in this circumstance in in each of these individual cases I've also
(1:17:32) maintained that or I have also shown I think with enough historical precedents that like the government doesn't simply offer people nice things because of the kindness of their hearts people have to demand those nice things well you have to vote for them really yeah well that too for sure but but sometimes it goes beyond voting because sometimes the state will refuse uh will refuse what you voted for democratically and will say no we're not going to do it so I I guess the question is always like what are what is to be
(1:18:07) done like what are people supposed to do because there is this idea I think it was JFK who said it that um like uh a a violent retaliation to uh what is it is like I think uh violent suppression violent peaceful action makes uh makes violent retaliation a necessity yeah yeah I I think that's about it yeah yeah I think we're saying the same thing like I know what you're talking about and so yeah I I I feel like you're you're definitely right and that nonviolent action I think should be not going to that University don't go
(1:18:45) there vote for things that and vote for people that will represent your interests in a way that's authentic and will enable you to change policy in a way that you think reflects what your views are I I totally age with that and that's that's what I think needs to happen much more because I think that a lot of people in the US and I hear this sentiment a lot and I find it to be very well the thing is it's it's sad but it's also kind of true you know in some cases uh is that people feel like voting
(1:19:14) doesn't work and like voting does work but it should work a lot more than it does and I think that people are just so demoralized and they're so fixated around trying to like protest or like force UCLA to do something that they lose track of what they really the power that people that really have is is voting we can hold people accountable you can push for third parties you can do that if there's enough people that believe in it and I wish that that energy and that I don't think it's that
(1:19:42) easy I think the American the American electoral system is makes that virtually impossible for the most part the other what is the alternative I think the alternative is making through pressure through public pressure by way of like uh causing some level of material harm in the form of strikes and labor militancy as we have done historically in the past is to organize on the boundaries of community organize on the boundaries of Labor and make demands from at least one side of the uh of the political duopoly that
(1:20:16) they cannot ignore and that is at the heart of protest movements like this that's why I am uh fully in support to protest movements like this because the reality of the matter is um active lobbying efforts from uh corporations and the Very powerful very wealthy individuals in this so in society have rendered American democracy useless there are so many instances where there's like tremendous injustices that are occurring all around us that virtually every American would probably agree on that uh that seemingly get no
(1:20:56) uh solutions from our elected representatives the system is designed as it stand currently yeah but that's why I'm saying like it's not just about it it can't be just about democracy because that's the expectation or rather shouldn't say it can't be just about democracy this is about more democracy right to to make your elected representatives represent your interest rather than the interest of the wealthy few and in order to get there you do actually have to take it to the streets
(1:21:24) sometimes you do actually have to show them that like no you can't do this like this is ridiculous and um I think it's also about controlling a message and sending a message out that people believe in like you can look at somebody like Bernie Sanders right you were a big supporter of Bernie Sanders I also like Bernie Sanders like the amount of money that he was getting versus you know a lot of the people that he was going against was like nothing compared to them but I mean he got he got a lot
(1:21:50) of money from Individual donors especially um I mean compared to the the bigger candidates I mean I don't know like with those massive super packs yeah of course I mean it's it's it's always going to be billionaires are much easily billionaires are going to much have a much easier time you know dumping a $100 million of a super pack than like 100 million Americans giving a dollar so yeah of course yeah Grassroots is always much harder the strength of the message is something that that also
(1:22:21) is important and and I think if if there's a strong enough message people will believe in it and people will push it I mean you know we're we're the same age right so like you remember Obama right I mean that was a very strong message and people believed in that and they acted on it and I think that it'll happen again too whenever people was yeah but Obama was ultimately Obama Obama ran on Obama ran on ending closing Guantanamo Bay and like ran against the Iraq War and then was responsible for the troop Surge and
(1:22:53) like the continuation of the Iraq War right so like uh and change his mind I understand so so my my point is like how what do you do when your elected representatives that you voted for have told you a lie right well like this is the thing right because like people use for example like you use the Revolutionary War or like the Boston Tea Party or something like that as an example of like Justified violent uh like basically Pro T and I I agree with you and so I think the question is that I think violent and like uh you know
(1:23:33) material destruction protest like basically illegal protest is completely justifiable if you're not able to like vent your frustrations democratically and so I think the question is really depending on do people have the opportunity to vent those frustrations democratically because like what what you're saying is like do you think they have this in this particular matter in America because you said like well like well there's two circumstances right you're talking about the schools I think that they don't have
(1:24:04) it and I think that they don't have the right to have it because it's not Democratic fundamentally not everything needs to be Democratic and if you own something it's like if five people outside your house democratically vote that you know your house should be you know everybody's house that doesn't necessarily mean that you lose your house well I mean if they paid for it if they paid for my house then I think it's a whole different conversation if they didn't pay for my house conversation but
(1:24:30) it doesn't mean that it's a democracy no I'm saying that if they paid for my house that they would have a righteous say they would have an understandable say in like uh in a circumstance where like they're living in the house and they paid for the house and they're basically renting then yeah no they do have a right in my opinion uh both morally and in some instances legally in what happens in the house that's why if you're landlord refuses to fix your mold for example you do
(1:24:59) have a right many people don't know this but you literally do have a right to um to to deny them payment even um so I mean it's state by state it definitely has to go both ways but what I'm saying is that you can't do everything by tyranny of the majority and I think that also whenever you're talking about private property people should have the right to decide what is and what isn't like private property and I don't think that people who own private property should you know be at
(1:25:30) the at the mercy of of the majority in a lot of cases no that's why I mean that's why this is a public property like University campuses especially state universities are public property that's actually quite literally the reason why for example you know those westbo Baptist Church freaks that go to like all the college campuses and like talk about how like yell at students and call them the F slur and stuff like that oh yeah like those guys are uh those guys often times cannot be kicked out of college campuses for this specific
(1:26:01) reason because technically it is public property that the that uh their tax dollars are paying for which makes the situation all the more complicated and all the more egregious in in terms of a violation of First Amendment rights yeah I I think that it's really about the encampment in that case right because the people that were there were really getting kicked out it wasn't they weren't really getting kicked out for protesting they were were getting kicked out for having an encampment there they
(1:26:27) were getting kicked out for protesting they they were getting kicked out for protesting they just used trespassing even though originally they didn't have an issue with it here's what makes it even worse originally didn't have an issue with it right yeah and then the counter protesters showed up first day second day Third Day the counter Pro protesters showed up in incredibly violent ways right and you you saw that you recognized it as well yeah then this the school cynically yes the school cynically turned around and said well
(1:26:58) this is now a safety issue so what do you think what kind of lesson do you think that teaches everyone around the around the country that if you want these students to shut the up if you're uh you know if you're like a like a 45-year-old Zionist dude who just wants to unconditionally dick ride Israel into Oblivion go and beat the out of some students and inevitably the school will turn around and use your violent actions against them to basically say now the state has to come in and and pack up these students
(1:27:30) themselves so they first got beaten by the Zionist counter protesters many of which there many of which have been identified and are not from the school at all then on top of that the school used that instance to directly pack you up like they're they're because there's a reason you can't just you can't just declare something unlawful like that's not how this works right cuz like Vice chancellors are voted on democratically often times by the student uh by the student body and uh the administration
(1:28:00) at least like has to maintain a semblance of democracy especially because it's a woke Elite learning institution right um oh well I mean like just just to make one thing clear like if these people weren't at you know they there was no encampment there and they were just sitting there protesting I think that's totally fine there's nothing wrong with that so you wouldn't have an issue if they were just sitting there protesting but because they built a like a camp to protest uh continuously that it it demands violent
(1:28:32) retaliation from the force like it justifies violent retaliation from the state I think so yeah I I I do um because like they have no right to do that they have no right to just start building and putting up tents there that's insane I mean they they were engaging in continued protest also like well also keep in mind that when whenever I'm talking about you're you're saying engaging in violent actions like the police told them to leave the university said that they wanted them to leave so like really violence was the only thing
(1:29:07) that was left and so it's like does somebody have the right again and this is what I was saying initially does somebody have the right to defend their property and I think the answer is to that is AB not it's not their property it's property that the students are paying for and it's the state property too so it's like taxpayers but which is why it's the property that all the students are paying for not just the ones that are protesting but yeah but like in the case of Colombia it is private property and yet the students I
(1:29:34) don't know what the UCLA student votes would look like I'm not familiar but I'm I'm fairly certain given that 81% of the 18 to 35y Old demographic in the United States of America uphor Joe Biden's handling of the Israel Palestine situation it's not Beyond The Pale to assume that like a majority of students would probably vote for divestment in UCLA campus as well so I mean I don't know they might have even held a vote I'm uh I'm unfamiliar but um ultimately ultimately they uh if if the
(1:30:08) if we're talking about the majority of students or the minority of students like in this cumstance like it's still the difference between tyranny of majority is is I guess the opposite side of that is tyranny of minority so it would be like capitulating to the wishes of a smaller percentage of the student student base uh to to you know technically beat the out of uh thousands of students that are uh protesting on behalf of the majority opinion yeah but it's also not a democracy just because they have a
(1:30:41) student government or a student body that votes on things it doesn't mean that the Administration has to listen to what the student body votes on that that was never part of it yeah that's so that's the I guess that's the difference in opinion that you and I hold I do think that they should listen to the student body in this circumstance um and I'm glad that they did in previous instances like during the Civil Rights Movement uh when you know when when students took similar actions during the
(1:31:09) Vietnam war and in the Civil Rights protests where uh we've seen the worst of the worst like what actually happens when there is resistance like in Kent State where they literally shot and killed four students yeah yeah they they K they shot and killed four students because they did not want they they didn't want this to continue you know they were like all right shut the up you're done and I find that to be significantly scarier than um a a university especially a state-funded
(1:31:45) university uh listening to the very reasonable demands being made by their students especially students who have followed the law uh uh almost entirely all things considered despite the fact that people were like attacking them relentlessly and setting up defenses against that is also perfectly just too like that's why they had the uh that's why they had surrounded the encampment with like with the plywood and so it makes sense yeah definitely um and I I think those are two separate issues right so like you're talking about like
(1:32:18) I agree with you that the university should do it but I also think that they shouldn't have to and Kent State being shot by those I mean those are police officers that shot them National well National okay well either way right this is the government that's doing it right it's not like there's not some kind of like you know campus police force that's you know hired privately and so I think the problem is that whenever you're talking about something like uh you know Columbia University or
(1:32:47) UCLA people have the choice and the decision the autonomy to decide whether they want to go to that school or not and I think that the fact that they have that right to do that means and I think that the other counterbalance to that is that it means that this the people that are running the university don't always have to listen to the students and I think that in a lot of cases like what you're saying actually does make sense and I think that it probably would have been better if they did divest but so so
(1:33:16) here's the thing though like you're you're saying like they could just choose to go to another school okay yeah most schools are in some way Shar or form using their endowments to to and also using their research to fund and facilitate Israel's aparte right so let's say you transfer UCA to UC Berkeley okay well they do they're doing that too what are you supposed to do well you set up an encampment okay well now the school doesn't want you to set up an encampment what are you supposed
(1:33:41) to do let's say you leave UC Berkeley then you go to Stanford well similar situation exists there it exists in almost every single institution which is precisely there a lot of cases where that that happens but I don't think that they are obligated to to adhere to anybody's demands they're not obligated to do that no no one is obligated which is why like uh concessions never come without leverage which is precisely the reason why I think like especially when students are following the letter of the
(1:34:10) law in their protest um in their in their protest I I'm fully unconditionally in support of it especially because there's no other option in this circumstance no other option Beyond like I guess like I said uh all forms of peaceful resistance being met with violent ends from the state would then radicalize people to probably take up violent action against the state as JFK correctly pointed out there's no way to solve the problem other than that yeah and there is and I think that's something that's unique to
(1:34:43) the state though like whenever you're talking about a private company I don't think that same type of like that same type of like difference occurs well I mean these aren't private companies are like universities especially public institutions are yeah excuse me sorry I didn't mean to say that I'm talking about like anything that's not the government oh okay well I mean in this circumstance I think that it is uh perfectly reasonable for the universities to to listen to the demands but beyond that um I think that this is
(1:35:16) a good it's a good pressure point it's a good pressure point that's like immediately in front of you it's like a local uh it's a local Vector for organizing so I think it's a it's really really good to continue uh increasing public pressure and increasing demonstrations in this regard because ultimately it doesn't seem like the American government is going to respond to the demands being made by the now the broadest majority of the American population in terms of our tax dollars
(1:35:45) going to Israel well I I don't know like I mean do you have any data on that I'm actually kind of curious because I was actually wondering about that myself what do you think that like do you think that people are like more against Israel because I feel like there's like an obvious like really big generational divide because I was talking to my dad about this and like a lot of people that are like his age are like very pro-israel and a lot of people that are our age and younger especially are more
(1:36:10) Pro Palestine yeah no for sure um I think that the older you get the more calcified your position on Israel is because like it's easier to manipulate World War yeah and and also not even that it's more so it depends on it depends on your media diet if your media diet is less diverse and the older you are the more you like remember a time when there was like you know eight newspapers and three TV channels where that message is like super easy to control um the more you heard like Relentless dick writing of Israel from
(1:36:46) mainstream media which you of course trusted why wouldn't you um that's the that's the major uh difference between the generational divide is that like kids can literally see on Tik Tok and on social media like Palestinians directly advocating for their own uh interest they can see uh people on the Israeli side uh directly doing atrocities and and celebrating them like the viral Tik Tok Trends and whatnot that pop off in Israel or IDF guys like stealing people's underwear and stuff right I mean like it's one thing to hear
(1:37:26) about it and it's another thing to literally see it happen yeah I think that's a very good thing that's an amazing thing no I I I agree and um so I think that's where a lot of this generational divide comes from that's why I mean Senators have openly stated that they that is the precise reason why they are Banning Tik Tok inevitably uh is because they don't like that there is no control over it as far as like as far as being able to like influence talk to make certain censorious decisions um and I think that they find
(1:37:59) that to be a big problem um let me see if I can find you like the American uh like the overall American perspective and how it's shifted over the years on Israel Palestine because a lot of these polls are like also very uh they're very biased and it's yeah it's very hard to get any sort of real temperature check on on anything I remember like whenever they got rid of Row versus Wade I looked up a bunch stuff for abortion and it was like oh my God how are you supposed to know what's real it's it's very hard to figure out
(1:38:31) like real information yeah I mean like Harvard Harris is like a really bad Poll for example like there's certain polls that are like really bad where they'll add like a ton of qualifiers only show the Palestinian side as not Palestinians in general but like Hamas and they they have many different ways of like creating the type of outcome that you want to they that you want to get um I'm trying to I'm trying to give you like the one that I remember one of the recent polls that I remember showed that
(1:39:01) under the age of 35 81% of Americans uh are are upset with Joe like disapprove of Joe Biden's uh mishandling of of Israel uh Palestine 81% I would not be surprised I mean I like based off of just like I mean again it's a Vibe check right but like my vibe check of the internet yeah absolutely yeah 100% and I I don't know like I feels I've seen different polls I've seen show like uh overwhelming majority support from both Independence and Democrats and even a majority of support from the Republican party in terms of uh in terms
(1:39:37) of a ceasefire for example which is a position that the Biden Administration has like not budged on and seemingly uh claims that they're they care about and and want to bring about but never really never really done so so I think they're just saying it service absolutely so so there's stuff like that right yeah so my question I guess is what is to be done in that situation because like I think that um democratically speaking part of the reason why we voted for Joe Biden myself and many others in
(1:40:13) my demographic voted for Joe Biden because we saw the uh the horrifying ways in which like the BLM protest uh were were dealt with by the police force and uh that was a promise that was a campaign promise that the Biden administration had made and now these Young Americans are also seeing that very same police resistance in uh in another circumstance where there's like uh peaceful demonstrations happening sometimes it I mean it hasn't gotten to like black lives matter Point yet obviously it's not as widely attended
(1:40:46) yeah and and it uh it hasn't like turned into riots I guess um and this circumstance but but that is a direct contradiction of like what you voted for what we all voted for I don't think that you really voted for Joe Biden for that reason because like you voted for him because he was the option that the Democratic party gave you because like I think that you were Bernie Sanders like you were you were about that and that was that was yeah he got no for sure but but my point is that was a part of it the part of it
(1:41:26) that was that he's not Donald Trump and Donald Trump was the one that was like actively suppressing uh and and saying Law and Order Law and Order over and over again uh when when faced with like the black Liv matter uh protest so that was a that was the assessment from many who voted for Joe Biden thinking that like well he would be able to bring about some positive change and maybe tackle some of the issues within uh policing and discrimination obviously that didn't happen but beyond that didn't beyond that there are many
(1:41:59) other there are many other campaign promises that were violated um including but not limited to you know dealing with protesters like talking about you know journalists getting arrested and whatnot that was another major uh point of consideration there's a video of Biden talking about uh the George Floyd protest saying we will not allow any president to quiet our voice we won't let those who see this as an opportunity to seow chaos throw up a smoke screen to distract us from the very real and legitimate grievances at the heart of
(1:42:28) these protests now that he's president however uh he basically reinforced the Law and Order must happen narrative that Donald Trump was uh advocating for so my question always is like well what is to be done how do you um how do you and many other Americans get our lawfully elected representatives to to actually follow through actually follow through on the demands uh that they originally ran on on the on the promises that they originally made I don't know because I think it's a it's a very complex question because I'm
(1:43:08) sure some promises are made and then somebody gets into office and they realize wait a minute it's not that simple it's not that easy and I think there are probably instances I'm not saying this is one of them I think it's actually in fact not but I think that there are probably instances where campaign promis are made with partial information and then whenever the person gets more information they decide not to do it well I Joe Biden's been pres Jo Joe Biden was was in elected office the
(1:43:35) vi pres years right yeah I mean know I'm not saying this is an example but I think that there are like there are instances of that but I don't really know what the what is the option for that what do you do because like and and like this is the question like what what do you think because I don't know like what do you a riot do you like go and like have a recall I think at a certain point it's like don't I think a lot of people get tricked into voting for you know this person and I I I don't know how to solve
(1:44:07) that because the Democratic and the Republican parties are so big it's like how do you how do you fight against that but I think that like you just kind of have to and I don't know like what alternative you could do that would have any sort of like real meaningful impact right well this is this is one um Vector of pressure like protests campus wide protest protests in General on the streets it's a it's a very good and historically very successful way to get the government to meet your demands even
(1:44:39) if it's halfway so that's why I'm in support of the the Palestinian uh Pro Palestinian encampments uh that are happening all around campuses all around the country yeah I mean I I think for me like my my perspective is that I I support the idea I support the freedom of speech I think that at a certain point you know whenever you are breaking the law the law does have to be upheld to a certain extent but I also think that people's ability to protest should also be upheld I don't I think that you know for
(1:45:11) example like camping out somewhere for six days and not leaving even after they tell you to leave and the police tell you to leave I think that's too much but I also they didn't even they they told them to leave because they said that it it was endangering the students themselves like in the encampment saying that uh and and in that circumstance if they truly cared about that they could have used the police to protect the encampment rather than well that's clearly not the real reason yeah yeah well that's the point that's what I mean
(1:45:41) they they if that's not the reason and that's just simply the seasoning that they're adding onto the conversation then there's one real reason why they're doing it and that is because they just want students to shut the up and go away get out of there yeah exactly yeah and I think that's it's a bad thing it definitely is a bad thing but at the same time I also think it's a bad thing for a bunch of people to just go camp out at the University for you know multiple days at
(1:46:09) a time and I I think that's not unreasonable I don't think that I'm being unreasonable with this but I also think bad thing I don't think it's a bad thing because there's no there's no other there's no other options at that point for people to to actually um make a fuss kind of you know what I mean in the most peaceful ways possible that's precisely what the students are doing because there's no other option there do you see what I'm saying like there's there's legitimately
(1:46:36) no other option just like there was no other option in the school like they don't but then there's another school you go to another school that school also has the same restrictions that school also has the same uh issues right and ultimately you arrive at like there's no school that doesn't have this uh this problem and um beyond that I don't think people should have to leave their schools anyway I think that the right thing to do in this circumstance is to make demands and to see if enough
(1:47:03) people get on board with your cause and if enough people do get on board with your cause even if there is violent resistance from the police force ultimately the school should capitulate to the demands that you're making we have power and numbers and that's ultimately how democracy does work and should work but beyond that laws in this circumstance as I tried to detail earlier are just uh they're they're used as as a as a legal justification for the actual reason which you and I both agree on which is
(1:47:34) not necessarily um it's not necessarily the encampments in in the space that they occupy but rather what the students are saying oh yeah I mean the campus has has the right to do that though and I think that if you don't follow the laws then nobody has any sort of benchmark or frame of reference to how to make any decision uh you just have people that are making decisions for you know the ends justify the means and that is I I think again chaos I I I understand what you're saying and I think that's fair I
(1:48:09) mean I'm sure it's frustrating but I also think that at the same time there should never be a situation where a bunch of people get together and they force a group of people to do something in a way that's non-democratic because it's really like this was at the heart of the Civil Rights Movement though like you like you know rose rose parks's uh refusing to sit at the back of the bus um you know student protests uh and and sittings being uh sittings being enforced in uh or or uh the bus the
(1:48:46) Montgomery Bus Boycott like these are all disruptive acts of Civil Disobedience that were met with violent uh police brutality at the end of it like I I don't think you have this opinion you share this opinion on the Civil Rights Movement I suspect right well it's a it's a much different situation I mean of course it's different yeah I mean like one of them you're protesting against a government and the other one you're protesting against a university a university isn't a government okay well state universities
(1:49:19) well they did they did protest against universities as well during theil Rights Movement so the sure what I'm saying is that I think that if you're talking about the actual uh what do you call it if you're talking about actual laws then yeah people if they want to protest the best way to protest is to vote like that's what needs to happen like I I don't think that you can rely on just getting a bunch of people together and then hopefully the government is going to do what you want because also like
(1:49:49) just because there's a lot of people protesting doesn't always mean that means that that's what the majority of the people want because the maor of the people did not want um you know the any kind of desegregation in general it depends probably on where but I I think that in some cases you're probably right you know where they had to like March the the sou that yeah yeah you're right about that so that was and the that was the minority in that circumstance and allies of uh the black community demonstrating uh unlawfully
(1:50:28) like they were they were breaking the law they were specifically going to segregated institutions whether it be universities or whether it be restaurants private establishments and uh and and demonstrating in the show of force to say that these are unlawful these are J these are unjust laws that are in place and these are unjust practices uh that are in place place that are turned that the government turns a blind eye to and that that needs to change and in that instance just like these students like they were there were plenty of different
(1:51:04) mechanisms of the state that no it wasn't just a government I'm saying like private institutions were the ones who are enforcing segregation um on their own on their own valtion the reason why we have the uh the reason why we have uh specific rights that that actually interfere in the way that private businesses conduct their Affairs on the boundaries of exclusion for certain races and even gender discrimination is specifically because and this was the segregationist argument at the time which was just let
(1:51:39) the businesses do whatever they want I'm sure that people will take their dollars elsewhere but it didn't work that way plenty of people actually genuinely loved the idea that they were white only institutions white people had more Capital than black people especially in the South and therefore for all of these businesses if it wasn't for the federal government inevitably due to a tremendous amount of protests and a tremendous amount of resistance and a lot of State violence uh that that uh try to squash this uh Democratic
(1:52:09) resistance um if it wasn't for all of that then you know we would still not have any uh laws that interfere in the Affairs of private businesses and and and uh and and refuse them uh to refuse to allow them to discriminate yeah no I I I see what you're saying definitely uh I I think if you're talking about the protests that are happening now I do think that is different than the Civil Rights Movement it it it's certainly different and whenever you're talking about the Civil Rights Movement also like I I don't know
(1:52:45) if we can really apply something that happened 60 years ago to something that's happening right now or 50 years ago uh it's very hard for me to say think in some cases you're probably right in some cases maybe not so much what do you mean by it's different uh it's different because the entire culture is different the way that people are making decisions is different the way that people can vote is different uh there are all of these ways that are different I mean so yeah black people were not you know they they couldn't
(1:53:13) really vote I mean I guess it's not that different now because there's many different ways of Legally restricting black people from voting um but but that's that's more complex But ultimately the methods were unlawful the the point I was trying to arrive at here is that the methods were unlawful they were seen as unlawful they were seen as um they were met with a lot of police uh resistance and ultimately that police resistance led to a ton of violence and people were talking about the chaos in the exact same terms
(1:53:46) and in the exact same boundaries as they do right now uh with respect to the Palestinian Pro Palestinian camp um but but ultimately the students are following on the footsteps of those who who fought bravely for civil rights and fought bravely against the Vietnam War in some instances occupying the exact same spaces oh I mean like and I understand that I have I have no problem with them doing that but I do have a problem doing it whenever it's destroying property and taking away other people's education but
(1:54:18) but they said that about the Civil Rights Movement as well is what I mean like the ultimately I think they I'm glad that they had a the ends justify the means uh attitude during the Civil Rights Movement and I'm glad that they had to end justify the mean's attitude during the Vietnam war protests or uh during the boycott divestment and sanctions protest topics are way more complex than that BDS is BDS is identical it's the same exact it's literally like almost definitionally identical it's a boy cost divestment and
(1:54:53) sanctions on apartheid South Africa uh in 1985 this was a also another student L movement as well and the methods were identical too the only difference is uh South Africa did not have uh the the benefit of having another South Africa that they could learn the mistakes from and and uh make sure that they don't repeat it Israel had South Africa to look to so they could like set up a lobbying effort um and and and Ensure that the state uh bends to their will as to the best of their ability and the media apparatus as
(1:55:32) well yeah I mean I definitely Israel is much more influential than that I mean I can see where you're coming from I I I think that the I think that that type of mindset is very scary to me because while you're right that it does create a lot of positive outcomes it also creates a lot of negative outcomes as well do you have examp of the negative outcomes like as far as a democratically organized revolutionary movement what do you mean by that like is like well I'm just saying is there is there an example
(1:56:03) that you can give me throughout history where people organized on certain boundaries that were like democratically organized on certain boundaries and they like enforce the tyranny of majority and like something awful happened as a consequence of that I'm sure I could think of some I mean absolutely and I think it happens all the time on a very basic level like uh for example like during the BLM riots people were obviously burning down buildings and doing things like that that's something I I don't really support and I don't
(1:56:30) think that that's beneficial and I'm I'm never going to support that it's it's not helping anybody it's not doing anything for anyone uh it's purely destructive and I don't think that people have the right to do that uh I I think that yeah you you should have the right to protest but if you use the justification for the ends justify the means then I think that anybody can use that justification and that justification can be used for malicious reasons and there's the the only way to
(1:57:01) have a world that's fair is to have some sort of generally accepted rules and that's what we have for laws and I I see where you're coming from with the Civil Rights Movement but you have to see the perspective that I have too that if you allow people to just you know justify themselves by thinking well our cause is righteous so it's okay for us to do it it would immediately cause huge amounts of chaos yeah because no no no I understand this is this is exactly the same arguments launched against the
(1:57:30) silver movement as well mil case spoke on this um yeah with with great frequency where in the eyes of those who are being wronged or in their experiences not even in their own perspective their regular existence is chaotic right and the this is a from letter from Birmingham Jail where he talks specifically about the the white moderate where he talks about the white moderate who places a timeline on another man's emancipation and another man's Justice that says your methods and your means of protest are actually not
(1:58:04) right or now is not the time where he very specifically talks about people who were naysayers to the Civil Rights Movement who said like oh no now is not the time or things are actually much better than uh they would be if black people were still enslaved and um you know there's too much property damage happening the point point is from their perspective at that time uh for black people especially living in the segregated South or even uh redlined in the North America was uh consistently chaotic and it still is for many uh
(1:58:36) people of color especially living mind like you're talking about Martin Luther King he also explicitly was against blocking transportation and so there were there were lines even that he had wait Martin Luther King also participated in the Montgomery boy uh bus boy let me see if I can I don't know if I can link this he led the Montgomery he led the Montgomery Bus Boycott for 382 days which officially ended on December 20th 1956 that that's like I sent you a link in the chat in the Discord chat yeah yeah yeah what is this
(1:59:10) farmer King and Lewis along with millions of Americans struggle to figure out what would amount to legitimate appropriate forms of nonviolent protest tactics dramatic enough to make their impact but not so disruptive as the alienist supporters okay everyone could agree on the nobility even the genius to the original cens conducted with such dignity that their moral power was overwhelming what is this at an early press conference an organizer with King's Southern Christian leadership conference declared we will tie up
(1:59:31) public transportation by laying our bodies prostrate on the runways of airports across rail or tracks this degree of disorder was too much even for King who walked back the staffer comments over the summer as the Kennedy administration reversed course to support the March Rustin realized that attracting hundreds of thousands of Marchers he desired meant abandoning the controversial tactics that would alienate the mainstream in the end as comedian activist dick Gregor gory said the March went off like a Sunday church
(1:59:54) picnic ultimately these protests at the time were still declared disruptive though you understand that right like every single every single instance including the Montgomery Bus Boycott was declared to be disruptive and at the time and was violently suppressed by the state like these none of these protests not a single one of these protests actually was met with uh you know hugs and kisses and the state being like you know what you guys are making a sound argument and at the time the coverage that whenever you justify like you you
(2:00:25) can't just do anything that you want whenever you've decided that you have the moral authority to do that like it it's very easy to go and look at the civil rights movement and say well they did this to an extent so it's okay for us to do it but if you apply this to real life I don't think that it really works like just because you're morally AG grieved about something it doesn't give you the right to destroy other people's property to stay on their property or to do things that hurt other
(2:00:51) people well property is not their property we establish that like this is you know they did they participated in sens and colleges in the Civil Rights Movement as well they were doing exactly the same stuff that these students are doing if not much more militant there's also another side of the civil rights movement that often doesn't get discussed in mainstream Media or in our schools in general that also played a significant role according to MLK as well uh which was the more militant action engaged uh the more militant
(2:01:19) action where black people would uh demonstrate with weapons or directly get into active confrontation with the police and like shootouts and whatnot now that did play a role in increasing pressure points for the state to uh look at the more reasonable parties the the peaceful demonstrations and concede to the demands being made by all of the parties um so all of this played an active role you can't have one without the other is what I mean but even in this circumstance um we're we're looking at only one aspect the Civil
(2:01:56) Disobedience uh of the Civil Rights Movement you're right whenever you say you can't have one without the other but I don't think that that that being an inevitability justifies the other so but they haven't even reached that point is what I'm saying we're we're currently we're currently in the beginning stages we're currently in the stage where we're getting upset and using ruthless police uh uh Ruth police tactics to stop peaceful demonstrations from occurring like that's the these these
(2:02:30) demonstrations have not even met like the Civil Disobedience metrics of the Civil Rights Movement even yeah um I I I think that really I mean I'll go back to what I said initially I don't think that a group of students should be able to go into the university and just start camping out there there's no there the point is like there's nothing that they can do right like cuz I asked like what can they do then and you said that they should just go to a different University well what happens when that University also has
(2:03:02) endowments well I mean to to a certain extent the world is not obligated to appeal to you the world like be if other people don't want to do what you want then it's not like everybody has to find a way that it's okay for you to do that like if other people don't want to agree with you it's not your right to force them to agree with you that's crazy yeah this isn't about other people forcing other people to agree with you it's more so about getting the state to to follow through on on what uh the the
(2:03:38) majority opinion is in many instances or in some instances is not the majority opinion but it's like the morally righteous thing to do like in the Civil Rights Movement I would say despite the fact that it was not the majority opinion I think you and I both agree that the Civil Rights Movement was objectively a good thing and the methods were infinitely more disruptive at the time than what the pro Palestinian side has done so far in terms of college campuses and everywhere around that that is that is guaranteed you're you're
(2:04:08) totally right about that uh obviously it's not as bad as civil rights it's not even remotely as close um I also don't think it's as extreme like obviously you know Civil Rights was something that was happening in America to Americans at that exact moment what's happening over at Israel is much more disconnected from us I don't really ever see that the disconnection the disconnection does stem you're right one is a domestic issue one is foreign policy the disconnection stems from the fact that
(2:04:35) most people don't really truly understand that like as Eisenhower once famously said um every dollar every no no no every no every dollar being spent on a rocket is a dollar that could be spent on you know building American roads building American no and I agree with you like I I completely agree with you on that but I think that the way that you stop that is by voting for people that also agree with you and that are going to push those policies through I don't think that it's reliable enough and I don't
(2:05:06) think it's effective enough to try to do what they're doing and hope that because like and and I I can only speak for like myself and what I've seen I I I feel like the way that a lot of those people the protesters have conducted themselves and what they're doing I think a lot of people don't like it and I feel like it's alienated a lot of different people and I don't think it's helped at all I think that I think that the mainstream media definitely massages the narrative in a certain direction a lot of people
(2:05:33) probably see them and only hear about how anti-semitic they are even though that's not the case definely plays a role is like I like my community like obviously that's the Viewpoint that I have right but like I'm sure your community probably disagrees with me on this and like you know you got yeah I bet and so like yeah you guys probably have like the opposite like probably like 9010 or like 8020 that I do and so it's it's very hard for me really to say for sure but I do think that by doing that or like by the
(2:06:03) protests like I I don't really know if it's really helped the cause hardly at all and it seems like polling is still pretty consistent and consistently favoring uh the Palestinian side uh on this matter at least for that's what you said yeah yeah so is so the the student Le protests have not as far as I've seen have not actually changed the public opinion and public attitude and I'm willing to bet that the uh violent suppression of the state for these uh otherwise peaceful demonstrations no
(2:06:40) matter how hard the media massages The Narrative will most likely yield will most likely lead to larger and larger demonstrations there's only too many old white ladies that cops can brutalize because they're saying don't do a genocide in my name until the American public goes holy okay this is too far and the greatest example I can give you is that Israel personally had killed 200 humanitarian Aid workers up until a couple weeks prior and obviously that kind of information wasn't really
(2:07:14) breaching the public Consciousness as hard as when Israel killed seven white Aid workers from the world Central Kitchen that that was a big turning point where the majority even of older people said all right they've gone too far this is unconscionable this is you know this is beyond the pale and IIs to me that America pushes Israel so hard I don't really understand the reason why I mean like of course it's probably just money but it it's very surprising for me to see it happen it it it seems like
(2:07:46) it's almost uh there's like a level of dissonance there because uh it comes from strategic interest strategic importance Israel is is our is our forward operating base in a resourcer region that that we are very fond of having their it's destabilizing power against all of these scary enemies that we have that shouldn't really be enemies at all but we've declared them to be so that's the reason that's the major reason as to why um we are so unconditionally offering full throwed support the Israel no matter what the
(2:08:17) they do I I think that you're completely right actually and like and and the reason why I said I don't know is because like I'm I'm happy to hear you say that because I've always felt like kind of a conspiracy theorist that like Israel exists basically to you know create unrest or destabilize the Middle East so uh it's good at it's a settler Colony it started off as a British settler Colonial project and it continued as we took we took over the torch from the British when we became
(2:08:49) the dominant Global superpower and we continued that exact same project and that is the major role that Israel plays for us it's not that like Jews are powerful and and monolithically uh you know uh in a in a scary way controlling the media or some like that it's just that like Jews argue with one another all the time there is a significantly larger group of American Evangelical zionists that are responsible for a lot more donations going into Israel specifically places like Texas as a matter of fact uh
(2:09:24) and uh all around all those mega churches uh in your you know around where you live they are all way bigger dick riders of Israel despite the fact that they hold anti-semitic uh belief sometimes themselves I don't understand it either man I I don't it's a theological justification that they have they believe that Jesus Christ is going to come back to earth and the Rapture is going to happen and that they'll be good ones and they go to heaven yeah they Jews will of course burn in hell in that process unless they convert
(2:09:56) to Evangelical Christianity but um this is a this is a good tactical Ally for the time being in order to create the conditions for the Rapture which means that all that entire land must be uh must be dominated by Jews and Jews only so that's the that's the overarching goal for a lot of Evangelical zionists in this country and they far outnumber Jews this is why I always say if every single American Jew there's six million of them decided tomorrow that like Israel's behavior is uncos and they said
(2:10:30) you know not in our name we don't want this anymore if every single Jew in America was anti-zionist Israel would still be allowed to operate in the exact same way and America would still give Israel all of the money and all of the all of the political power to do whatever the they want to do because it doesn't have anything to do with uh American Jews as much as it has something to do with American interest in the region yeah no I I think that you're right um yeah I think that's
(2:10:57) definitely true I said that in my chat I mean I even said like I don't know if this going to be a a b a bad take but I wouldn't have been surprised if the Israel knew that that October 7th stuff was going to happen I I I wouldn't be surprised if they let it happen I don't I don't know if if I wouldn't go that far I mean I think that it's their arrogance and their hubris that caused October 7 to happen the arrogance that they think that they could uh have an apartheid and violently suppress 5
(2:11:26) million Palestinians 2.5 in Gaza in an open air prison uh and 2.5 in the West Bank in a permanent occupation with like steady rounds of pgms and and forceable expulsion from their own lands uh without any sort of like without incurring any sort of cost uh to their own security many other Regional uh operatives actually informed the Israeli government and they they basically cast it aside saying Palestinians they can't do and it turns out they can actually do and that you can't really keep pressuring people over and
(2:11:59) over again and and trap them in like inhumane conditions and expect them not to lash out and retaliate but it's that very same arrogance but but it is more so arrogance than um some some conspiracy yeah I mean I don't know like uh that's why I was kind of curious like what do you uh what do you think is going to happen like what like in in 20 years like what do you think the resolution of this is going to be I don't know I I genuinely don't know I think that we are in I've been covering Israel Palestine
(2:12:35) publicly for the past 10 years I've been a supporter of Palestinian emancipation and I've never seen this level of Western support in my entire life 10 years ago if you said the things that I'm saying right now immediately everyone would be like oh you're anti-emetic off yeah and that was very powerful that was like that that immediately would stop any kind of conversation cuz nobody wants to be called anti-semitic the especially in Progressive circles like why and that is a true form
(2:13:07) of bigotry obviously and one that is um ever presentent well that's what makes it even worse to accuse without it being true yeah exactly and U and the fact that like while I was very critical of ADL for a very long time the fact that there's like actual journalism being conducted on the the apartheid defense leagues uh uh hate crime statistics is like wild this was something that like this was something that would be considered a non-starter even I would if someone came to me five six years ago and we're like let's look at
(2:13:43) the Jewish hate crime statistics actually I'd be like get the out of here dude what kind of Nazi is this and now you ly do see it though Jonathan greenblat the president of ADL who very famously was caught um on on the uh caught in a in a phone conversation talking about the dangers that Tik Tok presents has changed the designation directly changed the designation of anti-Semitism to criticisms of Israel anytime uh anytime uh someone sees a Jewish student for example sees a placard that says from
(2:14:18) The River To The Sea Palestine will be free or free Palestine or whatever that is now declared an anti-semitic hate crime like it it is uncashable to weaponize Judaism in an effort to defend uh the state of Israel and its awful actions against the Palestinian population and everyone around it's just it's ridiculous especially when anti-Semitism does increase in Times of Israel uh Israel's like sieges and and violent abhorent actions in general like real anti-Semitism I mean I I think that's what happens right and you see a
(2:14:51) lot of it on uh on Twitter right I mean you know somebody I read is getting unbanned now and so uh there's going to be a lot more of it yeah I mean his his little gper fan base is always all around they they've never stop so it's not it's not shocking it's not shocking that Elon MOS would make such a decision um so I I don't you know I I think that that is ridiculous and uh Elon Musk is like the number one free speech for me not for the as dude in general he also claims to be a champion
(2:15:27) of Free Speech but routinely suppresses speech that he doesn't like that bother him talks about Community notes but then literally will take down Community notes from uh from his own uh form of misinformation and he does it in like very thin skinn ways not I I am a huge fan of community notes yeah but Community knows Community knows work work if they're not one brigaded uh and two Community knows work if uh you can also do community notes on Elon Musk or Community notes on like the chain for example a cop after Columbia University
(2:16:05) showed up on Morning Joe and was like this is a chain that we found uh on on all the doors in Hamilton Hall and he very and he claimed that that was the reason why they believed that it was outside agitators that were participating in the C that were participating in the Takeover of Hamilton Hall the community notes immediately swarmed it and we're like what the are you talking about that chain is literally that chain is literally on discount on the Columbia Public Safety website and that Community note perished
(2:16:38) suspiciously so Community notes in that situation if you if you have it for some but not all can still serve a very nefarious propaganda purpose it makes you feel it makes you feel like there's counters what's up if only one side is getting fact checked then you might as well not do it well I mean I I'm I'm in favor of community notes I'm just saying that like to always keep in consideration that you know if Elon Musk is deleting his own Community notes yeah that's stupid as absolutely exactly
(2:17:11) and I think that that is like because then then there's a there's much more nefarious there's a much more nefarious reason for Community know so then then it makes people falsely believe that well there's no Community notes on this so it must be real right yeah oh no I think I think that definitely happens I mean I I like it but I I'm a fan of community notes but I think that there are always going to be drawbacks to things and I think that is one of them you're right just like free speech
(2:17:39) there's always free speech for peaceful demonstration and peaceful protest when you know Nazis or whoever the want to do it but if you don't have it for the other side if you don't have it for you know people who want to criticize Israel even if they aren't being anti-semetic yeah then all of a sudden was it like two days ago yeah with like all those people attacking the encampment like if you don't like the encampment that's fine but it's not your decision to make whether they should be
(2:18:07) there or not yeah but I like I said that's but that's also why I don't believe that the university should have taken the actions that it took and then uh lied under false premacy to the students to act like uh the police presence that they brought about the encampment was actually for their own good for their own benefit for their own safety be honest about it be like yeah we don't like that you have a tent in the middle of the courtyard and we need you to shut the up please I mean I would still I would of course
(2:18:42) still support the students and I would still get very mad but ultimately ultimately at least they be honest in why they're doing it I agree with you and uh yeah I mean I I think that you know it's a matter of degree and you know to me I think that you know some things are over the line if if you don't think that then that's that's kind of like your opinion and that that's fine but uh I I I do hope that I hope that they can keep protesting without doing anything crazy right I mean like I I think it's a good
(2:19:15) cause they will most likely go back and do encampments they will continue protesting very like in in probably larger numbers now that the police have uh have responded in such brutal ways um which will inevitably Force the University's hand to take action in the positive direction this is usually how it goes uh at least throughout history that's usually how it's worked out yeah I mean we'll just have to wait and see I actually uh the River from The River To The Sea a lot of people think that's a genocide
(2:19:48) chant is it no well I mean I mean the thing is man like I'm gonna be honest I I I think it is and that's why I'm asking you why do you why do you think it is well the reason why I think it is is because if if you go from the river from the sea to the Sea you would have to get rid of Israel wouldn't you no it means Palestine will be free as in Palestinians will have dignity and will have humanity and will have civil Liberties it doesn't mean that like you know the Jews that live there have to go
(2:20:27) away so you think that that that saying doesn't have anything to do with like getting rid of Israel or anything like that I think that Israel in the current formation in the in the way that it exists currently as an apartheid regime yes that must that must not exist I do agree that should be abolished and I think that's what that slogan means and for many people who are like no I'm really fond of Israel the way it currently is is they like they basically attribute living alongside Palestinians with um like full rights and civil
(2:21:00) liberties would be akin to the genocide it's ridiculous but unfortunately that is an attitude that is very that is ever present and maybe even normally I would consider it to be borderline hysterical which I still think it is hysterical however it it doesn't take away from the fact that people do legitimately believe that like they do think that if Israel is not like a a a a Jewish supremacist ethn state that like I think a lot of people do as a consequence of social conditioning legitimately believe that if it's no
(2:21:36) longer an ethnostate than like you know Holocaust 2 Electric bugaloo for sure oh for sure yeah that's why like because I mean like everybody that I've I've like heard like talking about it like that's kind of the implication is like they say oh it's a genocide and I I pretty much assume that you wouldn't think that that's why I asked you because it's like really heard like another perspective on it I was curious I I it's a it's another way to to just try and suppress uh any
(2:22:05) kind of protest because ultimately the cause isn't ultimately the goal isn't to to to you know make sure that the Optics of the Palestinian side is actually super intact and and super uh viable the goal is to get get him to shut the up so you're going to do whatever you can and and use whatever organs of the government you can to tell them to shut the up in different ways of it's a multi-prong approach it's ironic because like um from The River To The Sea Israel is all you'll see is um one uh the early lud
(2:22:42) Charter lud is the the party that Benjamin n who is uh um is is the leader of and I think it's like literally Benjamin and Yahoo has said that as well and it's ironic because like they are doing the genocide the Israeli side is doing the genocide so for them to say it it's like well yeah I mean that does become like a very real very active genocide in that situation I think that um overall though like hyperfocusing on these sorts of slogans and and saying that they're genocidal inherently is just another way
(2:23:16) to try and and uh put hurdles uh on the the Palestinian side of the protest it's not not really productive and it doesn't really uh it doesn't really lead to any conversation it's just a way to shut down what somebody else is saying I think you're right I think it's the same thing with like calling things anti-semitic yeah it's like yeah people to stop talking about it that's the goal yeah absolutely and and Congress is now also you know instead of instead of saying hey man this stuff is really po
(2:23:50) un popular uh by the broadest American populations like unlike anything else maybe we should uh I don't know dial it back a little bit maybe we should restrain Israel uh which would not exist as a state without our you know consistent uh Aid yes and uh instead of doing all that Congress has only moved in One Direction and One Direction only uh yeah Tom Cotton senator from AR Arkansas earlier today was talking about how like these guys are all jihadis they're all these are little Gaza they're disgusting
(2:24:25) islamists like talking about American talking about the American protesters that are pro Palestinian um Pro Palestine and like that never gets a censure but Rashida toib the Palestinian congresswoman saying from The River To The Sea Palestine will be free that gets censured so it's always One Direction in the American in the American government and unfortunately it's not a good direction I think what's scary about it is that it seems like it's very much not representative at least from what I see
(2:24:53) on social media well there's a reason why Congress is always barely treading above a 30% approval rating it's because we all inherently no matter what our political positions are we all inherently understand that these politicians don't actually represent our interest at all and only represent the interest of Corporations and the wealthy and uh the military-industrial complex is a very viable perhaps the most viable constituency so they care about that a lot more than they care about I don't
(2:25:21) know healthare or roads or infrastructure czy like I I don't know like I mean again I I think that a lot of times like you know I might disagree with you on like kind of like the methodology of the protest but I I I agree with you about these problems I think that they're very legitimate and I I I hope people finally I wish more people would actually vote and actually be activists you know actually do something or talk about it well um a lot of the people that do participate in activism are often times
(2:25:56) also the very same people that do go out and vote contrary to what popular opinion is those are the guys who are at the Forefront of voting many people always say I'm anti voting I'm not oh yeah no you're not anti voting right I I know that it's just that I think that it's just disappointing because yeah sure like probably a lot of people that are watching this stream people that are watching maybe my stream and especially your stream like they vote but it's all the other um demoralized people that don't and don't
(2:26:26) do anything in that situation I do think that it's uh it's the fault of our politicians because you you got to give people something to vote for people don't people aren't civic-minded especially in the United States of America where we don't even have compulsory voting and on top of not having compulsory voting we have deliberately made attempts to make voting as hard as possible one of the easiest ways to increase voter participation like we did in the 2020 elections is to make voting easier
(2:26:57) Universal ballot access uh a mail and ballot access Universal voter registration those were two reasons why the 2020 elections had the highest voter participation in in decades so there are many initiatives out there specifically to stop people from going out to vote but beyond that I think uh one thing that the the politicians could do especially the Democratic party could do is to give people something to vote for to show people that like when you do vote for us we won't go back on our promises that we
(2:27:27) made and we will follow through and we won't leave your ass in the dark and we will do our very hardest to fight for your rights and your civil liberties with the same intensity that the Republicans regularly fight to take away people's civil liberties and I think they do a really good job at it they do give people the something to fight for right you look at like Trump in 2016 that gave people something to fight for even if it's misguided or you disagree with it and uh Bernie Sanders gave
(2:27:56) people something to fight for and I I think that you're right and um I I don't know why that would definitely like not putting Hillary Clinton up would be a great way to motivate people to go out and vote I don't know why it's man that's crazy because ultimately when it comes down to it I am a firm believer that we do obviously have disagreements like the Democratic party and the Republican Party definitely does have policy disagreements But ultimately on matter matters that pertain to the
(2:28:21) economy broadly or deregulation or more importantly than both of those things War endless war there is always bipartisan support just like there's always money in the banana stand for more war never any money for healthare never any money for you know infrastructure spending but certainly a ton of money for war and more war that's what I think yeah I I don't I don't know how it keeps happening honestly I I think that the problem is that like you know it's like you ask s why are people not out at the capital
(2:28:53) right now you know demanding immediate resignations then somebody says well it's because you're not there and it's like well you're not there because they're not there and then you know it's just two or four more years of the same thing it's very hard to know how like motivate people to feel like they have any sort of real control over things yeah absolutely and I but that is that goes back to that goes back to exactly what I was saying with respect to these protests on the pro pales protest
(2:29:20) because gets people very motivated I do I I see your perspective I mean again like if I if I might disagree on the uh the intensity of it or the amount of it that you're doing that's really kind of a I I I think that's not really a big Point uh overall I I do want to see more people protesting this stuff because I think it's a huge waste of everybody's money and like you're like I'm the same as you right like we're both paying a lot of money and taxes and it's
(2:29:48) getting wasted bro you're about to keep talking you're about to participate in the Austin Texas protest dude what's happening you're are we about to see you next to Melena and Caroline next time at the Palestinian demonstrations uh about 15 years ago you would have I I signed up to work at Greenpeace to promote Planned Parenthood and all this other stuff in like 2009 damn that's crazy have like an Obama poster in my house and everything and you know I was always very political and you know I a big promoter of that
(2:30:21) stuff and you know like uh I I absolutely support it yeah I mean that's why that's why I talk about it right I mean because I know that you know it's the same with you right I mean like you get so much hate like I get people that are mad at me all the time and it's like you still do it and at least I still do it because it's like this is what I believe in I want to do this and you know if people are going to get mad at me for it then that's just the price you pay I mean
(2:30:46) yeah there's definitely more of that there's definitely more of a price than just uh people getting mad at you but it is what it is you know yeah um all right well I got to go pee but thank you for coming on soon so uh yeah I've got a very busy day ahead of me all right thanks I had a good time I hope the chat enjoyed it too yeah all right bye peace all right that was asmin gold on protests and methods everybody calm down okay I think that was a very very productive conversation overall it's a good conversation overall
