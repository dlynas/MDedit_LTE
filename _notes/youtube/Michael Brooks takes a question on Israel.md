Transcript:
(00:00) hi hi so my first question it says on your Twitter that you're Jewish am I getting this right no right Twitter on my Twitter BIOS says I'm Jewish no but like in your tweets I just I don't want to be wrong I have Jewish background okay thank you okay so ask someone with a Jewish background yes how do you feel about Bernie's plan for Israel especially as someone concerned with foreign policy I love it it's an absolutely necessary my Jewish values teach me to oppose apartheid okay could you elaborate
(00:44) please I mean there really isn't that much to elaborate on I mean it has anybody ever been not only to Israel but also to the have you been to but have you been to the West Bank have you been to Gaza yeah you went to Gaza okay but not the Gaza well you know I know people have gone to Gaza you could definitely go to Gaza so for me my politics are built on a base of you know economic justice and actually ain't really like anti racism as in some ways as distinct from some of this sort of woke stuff in a way but
(01:27) when I was I was already look I grew up you know I was pretty connected to left politics I always knew growing up about the travesty that was the human rights situation there and I knew that people would think people I admired like Nelson Mandela said you know South Africa is gonna not be properly free until the Palestinians are free in 2006 I believe I wrote I read a piece by a guy named Tony jut in the New York Review of Books who was a really important Jewish scholar and he just said like the argument was that like literally this is
(02:06) childish like the idea that you have an ethnos state or a religious state if you're committed to any type of broad-based social economic equity and civil society it doesn't work no matter how justified right of course there's justification because of Jewish history for Israel there's justification for Kurdistan because of Kurdish reality there's there's justification for Pakistan it's notable that Israel and Pakistan are both disasters Israel not in the sense of you know look if you're
(02:43) a European Jewish background you have a nice life there you're not you are even inside 67 borders not a fully equal citizen and the situation in the West Bank is I mean it is literally Jim Crow like and Gaza is I mean it's it's just an atrocity so that's not something that anybody can reasonably ask me to support and I understand you know yeah there are some actions from some Palestinian groups that you know we can condemn in fact those have not even really been in any way seriously in place it's like
(03:22) 2003 and when we talk about no look and the apartheid word specifically is both used by people who were crucial in ending apartheid in South Africa like Desmond Tutu or Ronnie Kasrils who served as intelligence minister under I'm Becky you have interview and the other main people who use the apartheid word or a Dahmer and a hood Barack so it is what it is and I don't support second-class citizenship and occupation and sieges for anybody no matter who they are are you not concerned about the binary between either condemning Israel
(04:02) entirely being like also a stance that a lot of like very strong and notorious anti-semitic people agree with versus like you know seeing this as more of a complex issue where it is wrong what's going on and if there's also a way to do this that Israel still exists and is supported so so it's not a complex issue that's the big thing it's super there's one group that has enormous power it's the most powerful country in the Middle East it's backed by the United States it acts on another
(04:33) population of people with total impunity is never held accountable for anything so there's no symmetry in the relationship period and just as like a thought experiment IDW people if we know that if somehow a population of Jewish refugees ended up in West Bank in Gaza and in Arabic government in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv had an open-air prison and in what you know Jewish Gaza which they bombed the white phosphorus they killed civilians indiscriminately and they had no provisions for medicine they had an embargo that blocked food that the
(05:07) electricity wasn't running that there was an over forty eight percent unemployment rate life expectancy and malnutrition statistics were horrifying the one of the major policy makers in this hypothetical Arabic Palestinian state said we need to put those Jews on a diet in the West Bank there was another Jewish area where there was a little bit more autonomy but there was regular Arabic settlements where they pulled up the Jewish farmers foods they terrorized them with rocks the security forces broke children's bones and they
(05:38) couldn't drive their own roads we'd all have no problem understanding what that was so there's nothing complex about the second part of your question it's it's a pure asymmetry relationship and the question is rights or not so that's it it's not complicated the second part of your question at this point there's always been there's always going to be crackpots who are anti-semitic who condemn Israel that's not what drives the movement it's particularly the United States we work
(06:06) around most people who are concerned with this issue it's actually populated with a lot of Jewish people the real question we have to ask is why is it that AIPAC is hosting a information minister if you're slobodan milosevic why is it that there's relationships between the Israeli government and far-right parties in Europe why is it that Benjamin Netanyahu's son is posting borderline all right memes why is it that Israel is an all right state even though it is from the descendants of the one of the greatest crimes in history
(06:40) that's a serious question and that's inseparable from the racism of the project which goes back to the first part that we have to solve but thank you Shalom and I am serious about it coming from Jewish values like Toni jut my reading to the extent I do which I actually do have some connection to that in a religious sense it's unacceptable for me but yeah I know I know but it's not complicated
