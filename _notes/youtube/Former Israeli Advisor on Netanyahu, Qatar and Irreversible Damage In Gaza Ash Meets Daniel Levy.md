Former Israeli Advisor on Netanyahu, Qatar and Irreversible Damage In Gaza | Ash Meets Daniel Levy - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) part of what's going on is people have been so preoccupied with not using nasty words to describe the reality over there that they failed to actually acknowledge actually factor into policymaking the realities of what's happening there we have treated as normal a government which wears eradication ethnos Supremacy and ethnic cleansing as a badge of Pride since Israel launched its campaign of bombardment and ground invasion in Gaza the main thing I've wanted to do with this interview series is give you
(00:50) the context that you just won't find in mainstream media because one of the things that really struck me about Western media is how little we actually hear about what's going on in Israeli Pol politics so what kinds of domestic pressures is Benjamin Netanyahu under what has changed since the 1990s and the oso Accords about the Diplomatic role played by the United States and how did it come to be that Israel basically abandoned any pretense of a commitment to a two-state solution luckily we're not going to be in a state of ignorance
(01:22) for much longer because joining me on this week's Downstream is Daniel Levy a former Israeli Peace negotiator Creator whose Insider knowledge of the peace processes and why they failed is pretty much unparalleled if you're watching this on YouTube you might be wondering why we're about to shift locations and change outfits the truth is that after my interview with Daniel Levy I got really excited about eating lunch and just forgot to shoot an introduction so please forgive me Daniel ly thank you so
(01:54) much for joining us today um I suppose my first question is a really broad one quite famously the position taken by Ood barack's government was that Israel can't be a democratic State a Jewish majority State and also maintain the occupation right there was at least an acknowledgement of that fact do you think that's still a prevalent view in Israeli politics today good to be with you Ash and it's it's interesting you're starting with that because it takes my mind back to a place my goodness yes there was a time
(02:31) when an Israeli leadership would talk in those terms and and I worked as a political appointee uh in that government I think yes that narrative still exists however what it translates into in terms of what the non-occupation vector on that triangle looks like I think looks very different today now now that gets us into slightly tricky terrain of oh no does this guy think there was this Golden Era and they were really going to entirely end the occupation and I think that's not the case but I do think there was a fault line in Israeli politics
(03:22) around something that looked like a significant withdrawal of the occupation from the Palestinian territories we would have had to have Push harder and I think that was a huge missed opportunity for Israel to actually do a full withdrawal allow Palestinian sovereignty there was a fault line between that and entrenching the occupation today that fault line Looks much more like if you want to call it a Palestinian State you can but what we're really talking about is a glorified banto stand this is the for line is do
(03:53) we maintain control or do we go the whole way and complete the project of ethnic cleansing and I say that at a time where that terminology is is so much more prevalent for many of our viewers they may have heard of the Oslo Accords but don't know what the content of the Oslo Accords were so I guess this is two questions which is what was in the Oslo Accords and why weren't they implemented why don't they form the basis of the reality that we're living in today awesome cuz I'm glad we're doing a
(04:33) 24hour interview um so this was an attempt to do something where at the beginning of a an engagement with a peace process you didn't Define the end game okay so it was an attempt to say first let's put in place some pieces of Palestinian self-governance some elements of um Israel Israeli pulling back from day-to-day Security in Parts in kind of small islands of the West Bank and Gaza um pulling back from some of its management of the day-to-day life and control of Palestinians but not all of that and setting out
(05:30) that these are the issues we have to conclude which would get a permanent peace deal this is the '90s we're in a certain place in where Palestinian and Israeli domestic politics are at respectively maybe we'll come back to that were at a certain moment geopolitically this is the height of the unipolar post collapse of the Soviet Union moment the notion that America could help see this through doesn't sound f Fantastical we've had the Breakthrough in apartate South Africa we've had the
(06:03) Breakthrough in Northern Ireland and on the island of Ireland so what Oslo does is it sets out the terms for the gradual embedding of a Palestinian self-government and the terms for completing negotiations however it also sets a dead because what has to coexist during that period is Israeli occupation with elements of Palestinian self-governance the deadline is May of 1999 that's almost quarter of a century ago right and what happens during that time is those things can't really coexist you can't have occupation and in
(06:56) fact the occupation is entrenched in many ways the Israeli side say says wo we're taking this risk we better double down on some of the security what security looks like is greater oppression for Palestinians therefore you're poking even more so those things can't exist and and there was a choice either rush to the end game and actually try and get this resolved or let the thing Fester it's quite evident what the choice was and quarter of a century almost later you're still trying to manage this interim arrangement which
(07:30) now simply looks like occupation by a different name so the Oslo process for Palestinians has become another modality for dispossession stealing of land denying of Rights far worse today than it was when Oslo was launched a 450% increase in what we call settlers what's a settler this is an Israeli civilian living in the occupied territory that's illegal under international law you can't transfer your civilian population settlers don't exist as a free floating entity they only exist with the funding the
(08:11) construction the security military presence of Israel so things got get worse for Palestinians and on the Israeli side I'm sure we can come back to that Israeli say hey we were going along with this peace process but it didn't deliver peace and they see their security also get worse as a consequence of of these circumstances that are created and much harder the second time around I mean thinking about how domestic politics played into that interim period and between the Oslo Accords and the Camp David Summit for
(08:49) which he basically had a front row seat um how important was the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister who had negotiated the Oslo Accords to um I guess undermining dedication to that process of pulling back from the occupation scaling back the occupation allowing for more flourishing of Palestinian sovereignty so first of all I think it's probably important to acknowledge that that scaling back of the occupation doesn't really happen it it exists almost in theory only because what the Israeli withdrawal is out of City
(09:36) centers however if you're a Palestinian and you want to leave the confines of your city you then bump up against a greater level of Israeli checkpoints military presence closures plus the Israeli military are still going in and out of those City centers so that there's there's not the feeling uh of of this withdrawal the Israeli Prime Minister at the time yakin we have a negotiation and the negotiation remains within the confines of handing over certain authorities over over issuing of agricultural land use
(10:22) Arrangements things like this um that's called the Oslo B that's the second big deal Robin completes that it's not a particularly far-reaching I was in those negotiations I sometimes found myself sitting there scratching my head thinking are we really nickel and diming them to death over over this granularity of detail on something which if this process is going to succeed within 3 to four years this isn't going to exist at all because if this is what these tiny interim arrangements are going to be
(10:58) like what on Earth are we going going to do when it comes to the big questions settling Arrangements on Jerusalem settling permanent borders the fate of Palestinian refugees Etc Rabin completes those negotiations the the street has largely been owned by the opposition during this period there are weekly demonstrations um the chap who people may now be familiar with his name itamar benil who is a minister in the coverent Israeli government he's the minister for National Security he first hits the Limelight during these demonstrations as
(11:37) a as a Young Thug um who at one stage produces the I can't remember what car it was but the maybe it was a Mercedes Insignia or something from the front of Robin's car and say we've got to the car we can get to Robin they're sending they're putting out posters of rbin with uh swastic Insignia he pictures of Rin wearing a cafia with a swasti so the right of owned the street and there was this effort to reclaim the street on the part of the camp supporting this this peace process on the part of the robing camp they have
(12:16) a big rally in the Central Square in Tel Aviv Robin is assassinated by a a Jewish extremist and it does feel like an important rupture now many of my Palestinian friends would say listen to Robin's speeches even when he presented the Oslo B deal to the knesset he wasn't going to go there that may well be true I also think it's a little too determinist and Robin had gone on a journey not far enough fast enough for my like but it was an important Journey that assassination I think is is crucial um in in
(13:01) defining that there was probably no leader to carry us through the person who takes over is Shimon Perez from the pantheon of kind of Israeli great leaders but but Perez was super reluctant to to move precipitously to say okay now's the moment to get this done he slows everything down and he loses an election the people who've led the incitement against Robin are in power just seven eight months after his assassination uh when Benjamin Netanyahu is for the first time in 1996 by a hairs breth margin elected
(13:39) prime minister of Israel and natany has been prime minister for most of the intervening period so do you think that the assassination of rabine that was a moment which almost kicked off a sort of mechanism of increasing radicalization of Israeli governments it became more and more diff difficult to hold a position of negotiation which had Palestinian sovereignty on the table and the momentum and perhaps even the swing of public opinion was moving rightwards towards a more Hardline direction would that be a fair
(14:15) assessment I'm not sure because I think it's worth challenging that from two places first of all had enough happened already were there enough signs that Israel and the political philosophy guiding Israel Zionism could make this ultimate compromise with Palestinian national existence because that's quite counterintuitive to the Zionist movement as a lived reality in the state of Israel since its founding there were lots of stre strains within Zionism non-state Centric strains B nationalist strains cultural Zionism once the state
(15:08) is established the modality that it puts in place has consistently demonstrated that any realization of Palestinian national rights is antithetical to that modus operandi and so people may say but they withdrew from the Sinai to have peace with Egypt they've had peace with Jordan now with the Gulf States those are different the the Palestinian question has always been seen as existential from 1948 when Israel is established after the mass expulsion of Palestinians where you have just a remnant of the Palestinian Arab
(15:46) Community they live under a military governorate for the first 18 years of the existence of the state so there's this and this was the Watershed of Oslo the question the fundamental question around Oslo was can Israel transition into a place where it can live with it can live alongside it can accept Palestinian national Collective existence perhaps the assassination of Robin helps leave that question open because we never saw where it could have gone unfortunately the prep of evidence is it we haven't gone there the other
(16:34) reason I'd question just how much of a of a of a go noo moment uh that was is one has this other window in in in 199 to 2001 Ood Barack wins the support of 96% of the Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel so in addition to Palestinians who have been expelled Palestinians who live in occupied territories Palestinians who are refugees Palestinians in the diaspora you have 20% of the Israeli population are Palestinian Arab they voted overwhelmingly for Barack they thought this was a return to Robin now it didn't
(17:13) play out that way how much that's due to the question I just raised I think considerably but it felt like a moment where maybe we could go back to that and so I think the the the Israeli journey to not seeing through a two-state option does have some twists and turns undoubtedly the rubbin assassination being a being a major one it's it's arrived at a place where it would take a really radical shift to imagine that again Israel just experienced a huge shock and that can do unexpected things to a system so I'll state that thought
(18:05) and maybe park it for now I want I want to talk about um barack's government and specifically the Camp David Summit but for our viewers when I talk about here's this big Summit massive diplomatic Enterprise they don't know how to picture it and I don't know how to picture it if you tell me you're fisherman I can kind of imagine what it means to be a fisherman if you tell me you're a diplomat or an international NE neor I don't really know what your job looks like um so this might be a silly
(18:33) question but for a massively high stake Summit like that what is it like when you enter the space like how managed is it has an awful lot of thought gone into what stationary is supplied and the amount of fizzy water that's on hand is it is it that well planned um and and how important are back channels is there a sort of official negotiation going on and an unofficial conversation going on at these things how does it all work so Camp David is of course the traditional Retreat of the American president that's
(19:07) where the the Israel Egypt Accords were negotiated and July of 2000 that's where you have this this attempted big peacemaking Israeli Palestinian Summit hosted by President Clinton and his team I was in a back room back in in Israel then several months later the Americans actually put a plan on the table and we reconvene in t which is on the Egyptian side of the Israeli Egyptian Border in the Sinai and there I'm in I'm I'm in the negotiation and I can and I can speak to that a little those things matter the the the
(19:42) Dynamics you you know the host will so there are different ways of Hosting these things right where I was in taba the the hosting was just that it was very passive in fact in the original Oslo secret channel uh and I work with the the people who did that Oslo secret Channel just after Oslo when we did another secret Channel which didn't lead to an agreement um at tabran in Oslo the the hosts were like you're all comfortable good you got what you need okay good you we've given you a nice setting you can you know have
(20:16) downtime where where you kind of have an informal walk and Camp David was much more managed by the American uh host and sponsor of the meaning but probably not managed in the most important sense of the term which is look sometimes parties are stuck and bringing to the bringing together for this clinch it Summit was premature when that's the case you have two choices and if you have a powerful external convenor which has leverage which can crack heads remember we thought this is the a unipolar geopolitical moment
(21:01) America huge leverage you either have to say we're going to try and push this through anyway but then your role and your ability to carry both parties and your ability to see where are the potential meeting points and not be the lawyer of one side is absolutely crucial America dramatically failed to play that role uh in Camp David why why did they fail to play that role well one of the one of the members of the American team actually uses the the phrase I just used and later on writes America was Israel's
(21:33) lawyer in in these Aaron David Miller who's a ski on of the American establishment when Ben rhods used the term The Blob to describe the Washington DC establishment no disrespect to Aaron David Miller that's um the why takes us into American politics I think um before we go there the other thing you can do um is say okay this isn't this isn't going where we hoped it might go how do we prevent dangerous collapse and that's really relevant for for Camp David and at the risk of of getting too
(22:16) much into the minui they didn't have a fallback they didn't say okay we can't clinch a breakthrough deal what are the steps that can be taken to ease the pressure to make sure that in in the absence of success failure doesn't look like an explosion which is precisely what failure looked like because Camp David ends in July within 10 weeks we're in the second intifada when the then Israeli opposition leader Ariel shaon makes a provocative visit to the uh alaa MOX compound to the Temple Mount and uh
(22:50) all hell breaks loose so they didn't do that Tubba funnily enough was um in way the Israeli government had collapsed already uh it was a negotiating team much more conducive to exploring concessions on the Israeli side uh we didn't get there but it felt it felt like uh there there was seriousness I was shocked um at how little preparation apparently had gone into uh the negotiating positions adopted by Israel at Camp David in the following way it almost felt like the Israeli side was still negotiating with itself and it had
(23:34) worked out a fabulous compromise between different wings of the Israeli government just one small problem you were actually facing a Palestinian negotiator with Palestinian positions and they somehow thought well if if if we've got the acceptance of the moderate wing of our government surely that's okay for the Palestinians right and that wasn't the case so I suppose that was going to be my next question which is how do you go into negotiations balancing what might be an acceptable Landing zone between you and the
(24:01) Palestinians was managing domestic politics at the same time was there ever a version of either Oslo or Camp David or taba where the Israeli government is really bringing the Israeli public along with them I think that in this respect the initial breakthrough is the closest we've come and crucial missing ingredient ever since then has been that the external envelope has failed to create the correct incentive structure so let me unpack what yeah what are you talking about what are you talking about uh what's the Royal Male
(24:49) got to do um so the the the initial Oslo breakthrough comes at a moment when the first intifada popular Mass uprising of Palestinians from inside the territories then occupied by Israel for two decades um underground political factions unions women's movements they challenge Israel this is a largely nonviolent popular mobilization and Uprising Israel cracks down as it knows how to militarily disproportionately International attention is drawn to this and and it feels like and and people may be drawing some analogies here it feels like Israel
(25:43) is losing support feels like the world is mobilizing it feels like there could be costs for Israel to carry on like this it feels like they won't be able to return the territories to the easy management model that had largely prevailed for the first two decades of occupation and as time goes by you have an American Administration it's actually the Bush senior Administration James Baker is then the uh National Security adviser who are not okay with this and they actually put on the table loan guarantees a financial disincentive to
(26:25) Israel which they had been providing to is because Israel at the time is absorbing uh hundreds of thousands of Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union so you have this combination of of pressure from the Palestinian Street pressure from the outside and Israelis feel we need to change I remember this is this is soon after I moved to live in Israel and the the slogan in the 1992 election campaign which rubbin wins and then starts the the the talks with the Palestinians actually he removes the ban on NE negotiating with the PLO interestingly
(27:00) enough the slogan was which means we should be spending our budget on workingclass areas it's a rough translation uh rather than settlements and wow a time when that slogan worked um so that was that was then fast forward what I think has happened subsequently and this is that external envelope I was referring to what I think has happened subsequently is you have had the March towards total impunity for Israel and and so for me when you say how do you carry your public along yes you have to offer them a vision of
(27:42) something that's better than the present but I think something else needs to be in the mix which is there's a price for not doing this this is exactly the thing which I wanted to um go on to next in some remarkably unguarded comments in 2001 Benjamin Netanyahu says I know what America is it is a thing that moves and you know then he sort of swelled his super villain cape and you know disappeared in a puff of smoke um how true is it that Netanyahu has been an Adept player of the Washington violin or is that just something that he
(28:24) says because that strengthens his domestic political position but actually he's more vulnerable to American pressures than he lets on so I think there's a very interesting question here how much is Netanyahu just a fabulous violin player and how much if you kind of pull back the cloak on The Wizard of Oz my God he's not actually playing the violin that violin plays itself and I think it's it's important to think about how American politics addresses questions around Israel and has in a way there's been
(29:03) this strange Journey where today you see public opinion is in one place but the automatic violin playing is almost gone in a totally different direction so when Netanyahu and that fabulous quote that you dug up you and he says in Hebrew it even more comes out that as as America is an easy thing to move the the translation is it probably best I can wrap America around my little finger we're talking now in December of 2023 and that feels perhaps more true than ever tragically perhaps tragically for the Biden electoral prospects next year as
(29:45) well but um I think to understand that American political weakness even when it look looks so much like this does not serve American National Security interests nor uh narrow immediate political interests of an incumbent Administration I think to understand that because it is so consequential it is so much part of the story of how how do we get here how do you have these ethnic cleansing hyper nationalists at the heart of government in Israel how do you have the devastation being Ro on Gaza without the kind of push back that would
(30:30) appear obvious and necessary so crucial to understand and and I think the way one understands that is by not just looking at how effective Netanyahu is so yes nanyu lived in the United States he first kind of makes his bones politically uh when he's a deputy Ambassador at the UN and gives these great speeches in English what were considered then great speeches I think um he does some things which were strategically important he he is crucial to establishing the relationship with the uh dispensationalist Evangelical
(31:09) Christian Community which is now the largest pro-israel Lobby uh in America it's 10 million strong or something like that I think it's even more than that by the way interestingly polling amongst younger evangelicals looks a bit different but this machine which is of course now so much at the heart of the Republican Party means any ability to do I mentioned the Bush senior Administration right any ability to do bipartisan push back in the American national interest is is totally neutralized so Natan is important but I
(31:40) think there are factors indigenous to American politics when it comes to Israel and American politics in general which have to be put into the mix here and I I would say those are three first of all let's just acknowledge the short comings of what we call American democracy uh the role of lobbying so yeah there's an Israel Lobby it hugely distorts the debate there's also something called the National Rifle Association so when we're in this country and we think what what another school shooting what's with that why
(32:14) don't they you can't understand that without the role of um money in American politics Lobby groups in American politics now we have independent expenditure campaigns um which allow endless amounts of money can be just from one donor Undeclared not transparent to be put in any race including a primary race so one of the things that's gone on around this this this um this Gaza crisis this this this Israeli assault on Gaza is Apac uh and and and and the Israel Lobby and that's the traditional main stay of the Israel Lobby in America
(32:53) has come out and said we are going to financially Crush all members of the squad in Democratic primaries so that not a single Squad member makes it into the next Congress I mean I shudder when people talk like that politically in general but anyway so you've got the nature of American politics before Israel comes into the mix included in the nature of American politics is of course the role of the military-industrial complex and as far as they're concerned what's not to like whether it's Ukraine
(33:26) or Palestine what's not to like when when lots of American Weaponry is being used when we're ramping up our production when more money is Flowing uh to that then you also have to understand how this gets refracted through the particular lens of the of Israel in American politics um that yes has to do with the lobby it has to do with a judeo-christian tradition it has to do also though with the stories Americans tell themselves about themselves so you Israel as a frontier settler a colonial society displacing an
(34:15) indigenous population you that's a narrative that sits comfortably with a certain American understanding of itself Clint Eastward playing benan it's a whole being exactly and of course what we see is that the demographic that is pushing back against this way of seeing Israel Palestine that is out protesting is a demographic that is fighting for racial Justice in America that is standing against America being that country still and and I've had racial Justice Advocates you know make the analogy that this feels like a
(35:00) global George Floyd moment George Floyd of course I cannot breathe uh um which really launches that black lives matter movement but thirdly you also need to understand the geopolitics I won't go deeply into that but Israel played a role during the Cold War when the Middle East was an era of contestation between uh uh America and the Soviet Union and it plays a role today now many Americans would look at that and say actually this is not in our in our national security interest that has been a theme since 911 that's a
(35:28) theme now you even have the American Secretary of Defense talking about how Israel is conducting its war in Gaza but the geopolitics also plays into this I mean talking a bit about the domestic racial politics and how it plays out in this country I feel like the story in the media sometimes is good ethnicity bad ethnicity so when you've got people of Muslim Heritage out on the streets that's bad ethnicity when you've got Jewish people who are pro-israeli because the only good ones are the pro Israeli ones that's that's good
(35:59) ethnicity um and I feel when I read about how the pro Palestinian movement is understood predominantly in British politics it's not even about geopolitics it's about racial relations here how important is that for I guess Israel's diplomatic status the fact that it's able to sort of tap into to narratives Around Clash of civilizations which diasporas are desirable and which ones aren't desirable um how important is it or is that just an unfortunate byproduct uh it is far more than an unfortunate byproduct and there's an
(36:40) awful lot to unpack there so one of the places that we might want to start is how come we've had this redefinition really of anti an semitism how come at a time of resurgent intolerance Prejudice white nationalism in America in in in different ways in Europe how come the focus when it comes to the well-being of Jewish communities is the well-being of a country thousand miles away um and it is very important important to recognize and be cognizant of the fact that this was there was a premeditated conscious effort on the
(37:35) part of Israel to Prime the the field seed the terrain with an idea about what really constitutes anti-Semitism and this came from a place which from an Israeli statecraft perspective actually makes sense if you know you're in the business of permanently denying another people their rights of running a regime of of really quite horrendous structural violence where you're already picking up the the background music of this is going apartheid right we we're this is where okay um that's a really bad space
(38:26) for us to be in how can we preemptively nip that in the bud for you if you can make the argument about how dare you what kind of animus do you have against us as a people that you would even make that accusation if you can make that the debate rather than your own human rights organizations inside Israel have now reached the same determination as Palestinian organizations I'm y International and Human Rights Watch have now made the legal designation that this is a regime of apartheid how do you answer that
(39:03) accusation sir you're an anti-site so that's Shifting the terrain of the debate and there's an awful lot invested in that and and Jewish communities have changed in terms of their mainstream establishment leadership over time and you when when my parents grew up very much in the Jewish community in Jewish youth movements Israel was tangential to that when I grew up Israel was already Central to that today it's not just Israel that's Central to that it is a it is a whole narrative around Israel my own identity
(39:41) anti-Semitism and I think what you've seen really accelerated since October 7th is a cohort of of Jewish people who have said wait a minute this how can we allow what is going on there to be said that it's being done in our name this is antithetical to everything we were told was a Jewish ethic was a Jewish Humanity was a Universalist never again and so I think the degree of outrage that one's seen in in in the UK from a group like naod in the US from groups like Jewish voice of Peace if not now speaks to
(40:23) that sense of of having been marginalized for standing up to everything that we believed was was was was part of our heritage now the two other things I'd say here amongst the Myriad of things that that that we've we've touched is um in this country and not just in this country it feeds into a certain moment of of cultural Wars uh fed by governments and it feeds into a broader phenomenon of of how Jewish communities are instrumentalized in debates around the Muslim Community in debates around immigration in debates around how we
(41:08) look at our own history of Empire at critical race theory if you're in uh the US especially um and I think many of us shudder that that the community is is happy almost is volunteering to be deployed in these cultural Wars because we look at this and we say how does this end well for Jew for Jewish interests how how is a more intolerant Society where we are cut cutting ourselves off from a broad to anti-racism struggle just how does this do we have any sense of our own history how does this play out well for us when Israel is
(41:43) aligning with those same forces of intolerance of xenophobia of prejudice who's Israel's best friend in Europe Victor Orban in Hungary who's going to be the next best friend in Europe Europe Hilt Builders if he forms a government in Holland who are their best friends here why does Tommy Robinson march with the ETC so that's I think that's a that's a really important piece of this do you foresee a time where the vast sums of military aid handed over by the US to Israel one could say the
(42:21) Arsenal of assistance the I would not use that word in this studio um it's actually a band word according to our editorial code of conduct written by me um uh that the vast quantities of military aid handed over uh by the US to Israel can you ever foresee a possibility where that's used as a form of Leverage to uh curtail some of the more egregious human rights abuses carried out by Israel against the Palestinians because looking at the recent history of of democrat presidents it seems to me that whatever they do they get called
(42:57) horrendously anti-israel or Pro Palestine that happened to Clinton uh you know in the I think in 1999 nanyu says you know Clinton is a is a dreadfully Pro Palestinian president um Obama is castigated for being anti-israel because he makes some quite you know milk toast comments about settlement expansion and yet in the last days of his presidency he hurries to hand over tens of billions of military aid over to Israel um before you get into the moral dimensions of ongoing occupation to me that just seems like a mugs game this
(43:34) person is calling you an idiot to your face and you're handing over you know all of this Aid um will the incentives there ever change will there be a time where America goes okay we're actually more in trouble domestically for facilitating this ethnic cleansing so we're going to start using this as leverage or or other sort of you know Powers aligned to do the opposite simply too strong so first of all we don't even have transparency and some in Congress are now pushing for that we don't even have
(44:10) transparency of what exactly the US is sending how it's being used is that in violation of America's own laws there's something called the Lehi law named after recently retired Vermont Senator Patrick Lehi is America in violation of its own regulations in some of the support it's giving and the absence of transparency is not coincidental on this of course some people say that look even if Biden wanted to he couldn't stop what Israel is doing therefore don't show weakness by trying to go
(44:45) there I don't buy that I think what you have outlined the extent of the Israeli Reliance yes on the military assistance that is provided and the stockpiles that are now making being made available so when one looks at this this the immediacy of what's going on in Gaza the horrors of that um this isn't just shocks isn't it a shame that America isn't able to bring these these parties together to stop this America is part of this war America is arming one of the parties so I don't believe for a moment
(45:22) that American leverage could not change that equation but what it would require is the willingness on the part of an Administration to maintain a sustained standoff with an Israeli leadership and that would have to be public and I think that is beyond the political willingness of where the administration is at and I say that because I don't want to say what the political traffic can bear because I don't believe that is the case I think that's where the Democrat voting public is at I actually think this is going to
(45:57) be a a vote loser for for Biden I think that is where um enough of the American public is at that you could carry that line it would be difficult in Congress because of the things that we've talked about already um but there are things that you can do by executive order if you're the American president so you don't necessarily need the Congress and if one zooms out just a bit further and gets Beyond this immediate moment and the fact that that that leverage could um be crucial and by the way I do think that if this is going to
(46:35) come to a ceasefire it will have to involve a greater degree of American push than we have now I mean you you have the the families actually in Israel of those who who've been taken hostage who are being held in Gaza um of the soldiers as well who are prisoners of war in Gaza you have the families who who carried a lot of that on their back and have forced this issue to the front of the agenda because either you can prosecute your your unattainable military objective in Gaza or you can get the hostages out you can't do both
(47:07) so but but you're going to need other things to come into play including a greater American push but it's not just in the immediacy it's also this question of if Israel pays no cost or consequence for continuing these violations of international law of international humanitarian law these policies of dispossession structural violence P be the Palestinians if the incentive structure is skewed towards why not continue with that if there's no accountability then that has a suffocating impact on the Israeli
(47:48) internal political debate it goes back to that question of how do you carry your public you carry your public also not exclusively but also because there's a cost to your current set of policy so I don't believe Israel can be sanctioned bludgeoned into a a a 180 degree shift in its policy but I do believe that without that a more open debate which which finally addresses choices that Israel should have to make I don't think that conversation is is going to happen enough if America continues now just to finish I would also step
(48:27) back and say maybe that's just not possible that's America understand it move on the best we can hope for is that the pressure in America will stop the most egregious elements of America's role like what we're seeing right now but if you want pressure to be successful if you want to introduce accountability look elsewhere we're in a rapidly shifting geopolitical climate it's not the uni uh geopolitical moment of the 1990s the the midlevel powers of the so-called Global South look elsewhere for your
(49:04) allies the the PLO was never allied with America when the PLO began to accumulate some weight it was as a challenge to the West allied with others so maybe we we also uh have to think in those terms the Abraham Accords which were negotiated under the Trump presidency were widely perceived as a moment where the gulf monarchies were abandoning Palestine one how true is that and two has that now changed since the bombardment of Gaza which began after October the 7th so there was this equation that said and it was put
(49:48) forward in something called the Arab peace initiative which is a a short document uh endorsed by the Arab League in 2002 which basically says you can have comprehensive peace Israel with the Arab world recognition in exchange for a comprehensive withdrawal to the 1967 lines and peace deals with all with all the neighbors there's also this historical position whereby um Arab states that have not had a social contract with their own public would kind of deploy rhetorical support for the Palestinians as part of their
(50:28) political modus operandi without actually kind of rolling up one's sleeves and doing things that are meaningful to the Palestinians Trump Administration a Middle East where America is pivoting away that begins during Obama less America uh ideally a good thing and a set of Middle East actors who for many years but especially after the so-called Arab Spring Arab Awakening Arab uprisings of 2011 you have some Arab states that are looking at that and saying oh this is not good we don't do popular politics that is responsive to
(51:18) its public and what you see in Egypt I think is a especially Israeli emirati relations taken for a test drive because it's not just the Muslim Brotherhood coming to power in Egypt which is what happens when there's a democratic election by very close vote um but it's also this idea of of of a of a a politics embedded in um in in a greater social contract in a greater public say and that threatens some some of the autocratic so-called moderate in the west right we call them the moderate Arab uh States
(52:04) and Israel has already set out its stall as a place that can offer you some great high-tech but it then it then Works closely to make sure that coup happens in Egypt and then things develop further spy we if you want to be spying on your own citizens Etc Israel's very good at EXP sporting that kind of stuff do you have any dissident journalists we've got an up for that exactly um the Trump Administration erupt all kinds of shenanigans uh in the Gulf um Jared Krishner has benefited rather well from that subsequent to being in uh
(52:45) government life they even tee up what becomes this blockade of certain certain Gulf countries of qat but for our purposes they they managed to take this nent Israeli emirati relationship because that's the center point of the Abraham Accords the bahrainis are thrown into the mix and they turn this into something that um turns this Arab peace initiative that I mentioned on its head and crucially this allows nanyu to say you see the Arab world don't care about the Palestinians the world doesn't care
(53:24) about the Palestinians you Israelis were told for years that we can't control the Palestinians indefinitely we can't do all these things we're doing against the Palestinians because the world won't let us well wake up and smell the coffee the world is with us and the Arab world is with us so it's it was a huge Boon to Israeli extremism these Accords now other states are brought in so in in typical trumpian fashion they bribe the Moroccans with recognition of Western Sahara which they would never have otherwise got they
(53:59) bribe Sudan which that thing is still murky and and rather than care about the transition in Sudan after everything that country has gone through the only way Sudan can get off the terror list and and and get back into the Global Financial system is by normalizing with Israel I mean what kind of a world do we live in where that's a thing um so that's what the Trump Administration uh offers however the Biden Administration continues so rather than say well that's a that's that's not great that's not
(54:30) helping is it because Israel now thinks it can get all this without uh without doing anything constructive on the Palestinian front the Biden Administration basically goes straight on tries to bring Saudi into the mix creat something called the Nega Forum which brings the normalized countries together a particularly awfully named Forum uh just before uh what we saw in October less than a month before that at the margins of the G20 meeting in Delhi in India they announced an Israel Middle East sorry an India middle east Europe
(55:04) transportational Corridor called imch and Netanyahu literally two weeks before October 7th stands on the podium of the UN and shows this map of this new Co connectivity where of course Israel covers the entirety of the Palestinian territory as well however you look at all of this and then you look at realities in Arab society and those realities have of course come to the four since October 7th we already saw it in the World Cup in catar which was after this normalization you know you had Israeli journalist Morocco did rather well in
(55:37) the World Cup um you had Israeli journalists going up to the Moroccan fan saying but we have peace with you and they're like no not with me and they wave the Palestinian flag because the Palestinian cause still resonates and that is what's happening today and I think it's going to make some of those normalization efforts even if they're done at the level of uh of of leaderships not particularly uh feeling they need to be answerable to their own public opinion they they still feel that Vibe and you have the role that Qatar
(56:08) has played a non-n normalizing country a pragmatic role in which they maintain the channels to Hamas the Mossad head goes over to Qatar for the negotiation so thank Havens you have a country that hasn't gone down that path because they can actually be useful but in the bigger picture um normalization hasn't changed things and if anything the Palestinian cause I would say is more iconic not just in the Arab street but in much of the world today than it ever has been is there a big difference between the public conversation that happens in
(56:45) Western media about Israel and Palestine and the kinds of conversations that happening in diplomatic intelligence and foreign policy circles is there a sort of Gap in real reality so one can look at that from two angles one can look at the rather stayed um conversation that is happening in in in much of the public domain or the quite interesting conversation that's increasingly catching up with realities on the ground um and one can also uh do the same when it comes to what's going on in in the Diplomatic
(57:24) domain because many of let's start with West many of the western people who are really familiar with this question who I speak to get it get it a lot more than the public statements by their most senior officials would tend to imply but you do have now the this Mantra this narrative and God help us we're back to it now since October 7th we have to go back to negotiations for a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians and the Palestinian Authority needs to be strengthened and they can take over
(58:08) Gaza um what are you talking about this is is out of sync with with with with what's going on and it kind of at one level goes back to the conversation we had earlier around um around anti-semitism actually because part of what's going on is people have been so preoccupied with not using nasty words to describe the reality over there that they failed to actually acknowledge actually factor into policymaking the realities of what's happening there we have treated as normal a government which wears eradication
(58:55) ethnos Supremacy and ethnic cleansing as a badge of Pride and it's almost like well we can we not can we not talk about that um that that makes for really bad policy because then you don't know what you're actually contending with so that that is a an important part of of of of what is going on I would also say that we we should be listening to how some of the rest of the world is talking about this I say that for instance in the context of the United Nations General Assembly passing a resolution in December of
(59:43) 2022 which called on the international court of justice to provide an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of Israel's prolonged occupation why have I gone on this detour countries are allowed to submit their own positions to the international court of justice 24 countries including some of the most significant countries in the world in the global South have submitted opinions which refer to aparte as being what as as being the definition of what is going on the two countries that lived under regimes of apartate South Africa and
(1:00:22) Namibia centered their submissions around this we saw at the Apex Summit uh in San Francisco at the end of November the Malaysian prime Min the Malaysian prime minister dressing down the American leadership over its position so if we if we tune in to a different state messenger we actually are hearing something different you've had a a a grouping created by the Arab League and the organization of the Islamic conference four Arab states and in addition Indonesia Nigeria and turquia who have been going round to the P5
(1:00:59) countries listen to the Indonesian foreign minister rno speak about this stuff she she makes a powerful articulation she listen to the South African foreign minister um so we are hearing a different narrative here but it's one that that a Western Wall of I don't want to know about this is quite hard to permeate and so my final question we're speaking on Tuesday the 5th of December and I'm just making that clear because news moves so quickly uh the temporary ceasefire has ended bombing has resumed in Gaza uh with some
(1:01:42) ferocity centered on the south around kanun it's nearly two months since this outbreak of War began in your opinion from where you're standing now what's the most likely outcome for Gaza I just swallowed hard because the outcome for Gaza I think has already been defined um the wholesale destruction of infrastructure and housing stock in Gaza is not something that can be reversed the killing of over 15,000 civilians and over 5,000 children is something that can never be reversed and and the the magnitude of that
(1:02:23) toll um I mean people will probably be familiar weeks ago now already when save the children came out with that data point that already weeks ago that was more children that are killed across the entire globe in all conflicts in any given year and of course the 1200 Israelis who were killed on October 7th cannot be brought back but I fear that unless we bring a quite Swift a very Swift end to what Israel is doing in Gaza and it's just entrenching itself deeper that that direct killing as a consequence of Israel's actions will now
(1:03:12) be matched with horrendous losses as a consequence of disease as a consequence of people going into winter just not having those living conditions water sanitary conditions by the way when that flows out into the Mediterranean it doesn't say oh I just come to the edge of Gaza and now this becomes Israel and the Israeli beaches what the Israelis are doing to themselves beyond all the all the immediately obvious things of the hate being generated for Generations into the future uh also has the Mind Boggle so I
(1:03:48) fear that even if we bring this to a to to a ceasefire now so much damage has already been done and if we don't I don't think we've heard the last of uh Israeli efforts to try and force open the border with Egypt people might think well why shouldn't they anyway this this would be a fabulous way out for the people Palestinians have historic memory whereby displacement tends not to be reversed of course most of the residents of Gaza why why are we hearing the names of all these refugee camps what's with that most of the
(1:04:24) residents of Gaza were forcibly expelled from what is Israel proper today uh in the the nakba the Palestinian catastrophe during the founding of Israel between 1947 and 1949 I also I think many of those people will say do I when I talk about return is that to that refugee camp was which was my temporary place of residence or is it returned to where my family or myself uh originally come from so I think the the Palestinian Israeli expanse has been burst open actually um I think for Gaza this is going to be an awfully long period of real
(1:05:03) difficulty in the broader question I think is right now we are on this cycle of very Zero Sum how can Israel live alongside Hamas how can Palestinians live alongside a country that doesn't bad nid when it kills 5,000 children either you or us how does that come back to a place where we can address the Injustice that has been the reality for Palestinians under Israeli domination for decades and at the same time acknowledge that the Israeli Jewish presence is a permanent one and what kind of a dispensation what
(1:05:53) kind of of of of living under equality whether in two states or one and partition I think has has has also encouraged this Mutual dehumanization much as nonp partition seems a hard thing to wrap one's head around it maybe what's necessary how does one one come back to that that amongst other things will require stepping back from the abyss having a pales leadership which we haven't talked about and we won't but which can articulate a a strategy that breaks out of the Trap of Oslo challenges the status quo and
(1:06:41) speaks for the Palestinians in a more unified voice it will require an Israel which understands that this kind of behavior is not costree even even if our expectations from America and the West when it comes to pushing that are limited and I just hope that the disruptive nature of the moments we're living through at the moment can create new Dynamics because this is hell and and Palestinians will not live in security with this kind of an Israel but Israelis won't live in security also if Palestinians continue to have their most
(1:07:36) basic rights denied and that's just a fact that we're going to have to wrap our heads around Daniel Ley thank you so much for joining us thanks so much ash good to speak to you
