## Transcript:
okay i would like to do a series on
thinking in systems
and this book is by donna meadows and
it's really really useful so i'm
actually going to at least start by
going chapter by chapter just sort of
explaining the details in the chapter
and of course i'm an economist so i'm
going to comment on her way of thinking
from an economist's point of view
but these are just great tools and great
vocabulary and great ways of running
thought experiments and structuring your
thought for any field really now of
course the first question is what is a
system
and she defines the system as having
three three things
elements connectors and purposes
but we might want to have some different
examples in our head as we think this
through so as an economist i'm thinking
about the health care system and the
legal system
but systems can include
physical things like the digestive
system
systems include the school system the
economic system
obviously the economic versions are the
ones that bubble up to the top of my
mind but there's lots of different types
of systems and systems have parts where
which are the elements the different
pieces that if you sort of took a
snapshot of the system and tried to
diagram the snapshot what are the things
that are in that system at that moment
and then systems have connectors which
sort of connect between the parts and
create relationships between the parts
that can be dynamic
and then of course systems have a
purpose
now this one is actually interesting in
her book because she says sometimes the
stated purpose is not the real purpose
of the system
the the purpose of the system is what it
does or what it accomplishes
so let me just fill out this table with
some examples of each
so here are some examples we've got
elements of the school system includes
teachers
the salary structure might sort of
create a relationship between say
teachers and administrators and their
contracts so this is actually one point
i wanted to make as an economist which
is when i first saw her structure and
the way she was breaking this down
my first question was
where are the incentives in this in this
framework and the incentives are really
the connectors they're sort of what
creates relationships between the parts
the incentives are basically what
creates dynamic movement within the
system
and the purpose of an education system
or of a school system might be education
for the legal system we might have laws
are one element of that system of course
there's many many elements of the system
that complex
legal review for example the process
that lawyers go through when they try to
enact the laws where they might compare
and pull from different laws and review
precedent all of that might be a
connector within the system that could
create a dynamic effect and then
purposes might be one purpose of the
legal system might be to contain crime
um the digestive system we might have
the stomach is one element the large
intestine small intestine um body
signals might be a connector between the
different systems is your stomach upset
and of course body signals can be driven
by chemicals and by the nervous system
and chemicals actually could be an
element as well as a connector in some
ways
and then
the purpose of that system might be
nourishing your body in some way keeping
you alive
and then of course the health care
system which i study um one element of a
health care system is insurance
companies
and of course contracts between
insurance companies and doctors and
contracts between
patients and insurance companies those
contracts connect the different parts
the doctors the patients
the
the drug companies all of that are
connected through contracts
and what is the purpose of the health
care system
well when i teach this of course i i
sort of teach the triple aim
which is what should be the purpose of a
health care system and this is where i
get it
some deviation between the stated
purpose and the actual
purpose that it's accomplishing which is
that
in healthcare econ class the the triple
aim is
basically says healthcare systems should
aim to
have high population health
uh uh
contain cost per capita so that the
system is sustainable
i would actually prefer if this one were
sustainability as opposed to cost per
capita but this is the official triple
aim and then patient satisfaction or
something like patient experience
so the healthcare system says these are
the goals or at least healthcare
administrators learn that these are the
goals
but you might look at any given one of
them and say actually
the health care system is perhaps not
accomplishing
one or two of these goals maybe even
maybe even three and instead it's
accomplishing something else such as
making itself larger
that's actually one of the problems in a
lot of systems is that they have a
stated purpose which is
uh pro-social in some way and their
purpose instead becomes
to become bigger and bigger as a system
which serves the people at the top who
sort of want to increase their power so
that's one uh that's when uh
just point that that connects with
something in her first chapter now i'd
like to read a couple of quotes from
this chapter because
i thought these were just really
insightful so one thing she says is a
system is more than the sum of its parts
it's this dynamic interaction between
the parts to accomplish something she
says systems can be self-organizing
and are often self-repairing over at
least some range of disruptions
and of course the immune system in our
bodies is very self-repairing we know
that when we get cut it may take a
couple of weeks but that's going to heal
through the systems in the body that
sort of sun signals that you need white
blood cells or what not to go to that
that site
and the same is true of some economic
systems that there are some natural
forces that lead to stability that lead
to self-maintenance of the system
another great quote from that first
chapter
is many of the interconnections operate
through the flow of information
so oftentimes the connectors are
information based and one of the reasons
this is important for economists is that
we're in an information-based economy
information is where so much of the
resources of society are being channeled
and that includes information about how
to improve your business it includes
information about health care
information about how to live your lives
there's so much information out there
that's sort of the focus of the economy
at the moment
and so um
it's kind of acknowledging that the
connectors are often the most powerful
parts of a system
and this is another point she makes is
that oftentimes when we think of a
system
our minds will gravitate toward the
elements
because the elements are easy to
visualize they're sort of like
if we're visualizing a system we're
thinking about a snapshot of it
but she says actually what matters more
in terms of what the purpose ends up
being is oftentimes the connectors
between the different parts
more so than the parts itself and she
makes the point that if you change out
all of the parts like if you
replace every member of a basketball
team with a different person
that actually doesn't change the system
as much as changing say the rules of the
game
changing the rules of the basketball
game would completely change the system
changing the players changes it a little
bit but not as much okay she uses these
diagrams to help us sort of think about
the dynamics of a system
and the simplest is going to be the
bathtub example that she brings up where
stock is the snapshot and time of what
the system looks like with no dynamics
and then these arrows represent the
dynamics that are changing and that are
working within the system to sort of
do whatever
and so
if the stock of a bathtub is how full
the bathtub is with water
then the inflow might be the faucet and
the outflow might be the drain and
the the stock at any given moment in
time is going to be a function of the
previous inflow and previous outflow
and she makes the point that a lot of
times you can't change the stock of a
system immediately
you can't just like snap your fingers
and get rid of all the water in the
bathtub you need to sort of let this fl
outflow process happen if you wanted to
get rid of that
and a lot of times when people think
about systems they may be thinking about
okay we need to change the system now
but there may be elements that take time
to actually work through
uh work through different types of
change
and of course stock and flow are used in
the field of economics as well another
cool thing she talks about in the
chapter is the feedback loop
where um she'll represent the feedback
loop with these arrows where there's
sort of the circular motion this leads
to this lead to this leads to this and
she talks about these two types of
feedback loops where balancing feedback
loops sort of bring the system back into
equilibrium and reinforcing feedback
loops
set the system sort of out of
equilibrium in a spiraling kind of mode
now i love her example of a balancing
feedback loop which was uh basically
your budget and the amount of money you
have in your bank account where the
stock here of course is money in your
bank account the inflow is your income
every month the outflow is your spending
every month
and if you have a situation where the
stock
of money in your bank account is less
than you would like it to be
that's a discrepancy between your goals
and
uh what's actually happening in your
bank account then that's going to lead
you to change your outflow to spend less
money and that is in turn going to
influence the stock so the budgeting
every month or checking your your bank
account every month is a little mini
balancing feedback loop that people have
and my favorite example of the
reinforcing feedback loop was her and
her brother getting into fights when
they were kids
where um that the stock might be
amount of goodwill between the brother
and sister and if the brother
started poking at the sister and trying
to annoy her she would react by trying
to poke at him even more by trying to
beat him at the poking back and then he
would react to that by poking back even
more and it led to this uh escalating
feedback loop spiral where they just got
into more and more of a fight until
something dissipated that so that that's
a fun example of a
reinforcing feedback loop from her from
her chapter i think that's all i will
say on this for now basically
systems thinking is super useful for
complex systems i think economists
should all read this book because it
adds this extra layer to our thinking
which i think is very helpful
