Transcript:
(00:00) in 1930s Germany the Nazis were trying to establish the rules of inheritance so that you could determine who was pure German Aryan and who was Jewish and they looked at the one drop rule they looked at the American framework for it and decided that it was too strict it's not going to come as a surprise to any of you that I spent more time than a psychologically healthy trying to argue with racists but what even are we talking about when we talk about race how did certain clusters of physical features skin color
(00:41) hair color and texture become the basis of how we categorize the human species race science is making a screaming comeback the idea that race Purity is under threat and must be violently defended is gaining momentum so how are we to fight back against the return of race science I'm delighted to be joined by Dr Adam Rutherford geneticist author broadcaster and all-round science popularizer he's an academic at UCL co-presenter of the Curious cases of Rutherford and Fry on BBC Radio 4 and the author of how to argue with a racist
(01:17) his new book control the dark history and troubling present of eugenics is out next week and we discussed Churchill and his enthusiasm for breeding a more Superior race Brazil's disappearing donkey and the racism of Richard Dawkins okay so have you ever done a 23andMe ancestry testing I have I in fact I've done several um why what was the left to learn well for professional reasons more than anything so I I really want to be Viking descended yeah well I am because everyone is um I mean it wasn't a surprise to the
(01:54) results because they came back with 51 from Southeast Asia um and 50 or 49 from North uh East England and this wasn't a surprise because my my dad is from Newcastle and my my birth mother is from India via Guyana so that wasn't a surprise but there were interesting things within it and it was mostly from a sort of professional point of view I was trying to understand what the process was and why people are so attracted to these why this is the single biggest way that people in the west engage with genetics
(02:30) today I mean did you feel any kind of emotional pull when you're doing it or was it purely dispassionate and professional curiosity I'll be lying if I didn't if I didn't enjoy getting those results and I still get updates from them because once you're in the system they keep updating it as the databases change and when they send an email saying you've got a new match they click on it look at it and go yes a fourth cousin yep you know that's ten thousand of them or already it's not that interesting
(03:00) um but then there are little details which are of just more than trivial interest for me so for example my my biological mother was born in Guyana and we know not that much about her ancestry because she's she's descended from she's two generations from indentured slaves from India and we don't really know anything about them because the intention do you know which part of India or no but we can now we now have some identification of of what it's not very precise because the resolution of those Maps is determined
(03:33) by the people in the paying database and you know what a surprise that the density of that resolution for America and England and and Wealthy Europe is very very high resolution and for India it's it's a big amorphous block but but it wasn't it was the Mumbai region I mean so one of the things which I found so interesting about your book and I approached it as a total non-scientist right I dropped all of the stem subjects immediately after Jesus I'm so sorry to upset you no not at all not at all I
(04:05) didn't do biology a level and I wasn't very good at and they let you train to be a doctor yeah chemistry and physics more important and I sort of winged it as well because I was good at Latin and you can get away with a lot in medicine and science if you're good at Latin so you were studying to be a doctor and you were like I don't know if this patient is animal vegetable or mineral but we're going in anyway well fortunately I switched to straight science before I met a patient I uh did English literature arts and
(04:40) humanities all the way because I was like I can spend thousands of pounds getting myself into debt thinking about the thoughts and motivations of imaginary people that's a great financial choice but I've read this book and one is that it uh opened up a world of complexity to me when I'd maybe thought about genetics and DNA as um a uh I guess like a ruthless simplifier of of The Human Condition I was like well we're all laid bare in genetics um and you're one of the things you're saying is that well no the practice of
(05:12) genetics and study of genetics and what the data is showing you is human history at every level um so to hear you say that well what we can learn about ourselves is shaped by economics geoeconomics where wealth is concentrated in the world is another kind of peeling away of I guess the very romantic idea that I had of what genetics can tell us well it's really great that you say that it's really interesting you say that as well because I think the biggest challenge in being a both a professional scientist and a
(05:41) science Communicator is that it's persuading people that that the way we teach it or what you think you know about a subject is not actually what what we think is true and we do it in various ways because you know in physics things are very non-experiential so Brian Cox can point at the planets and and say that there's a black hole 13 billion light years away over there and I have to take his word for it you do because we don't know right we don't know that is based on on real observations and and it probably is true
(06:17) but it's non-experiential or you can say you know quantum physics this table is made of subatomic particles which exist in multiple States at the same time depending on which way they are spinning and we don't we we can touch it and it feels real but I can tell you that it that what just happened only happened in your head right so it's non-experiential but genetics is the study of families and sex and history and everyone without question is part of that story and so the preconceptions that come with
(06:52) genetics are not 100 years old they're 10 000 years old because we've been preoccupied with what people look like and how people behave and where your parents are from for the entirety of human history and it's only in the last 50 years but really 20 or even 10 years that the academic study of genetics has begun to overturn the things that we thought were true so I mean it's a special pleading all scientists think that their subject is the least well represented in the media it's like a persecution complex yeah but
(07:25) I think mine is definitely the least well represented you know even though the the simplification idea is absolutely crucial to this that we simplify to teach genetics and actually therefore miss most of what's interesting about humans which is complexity well describe genetics study of sex family in history that seems but more than a little bit influenced by the fact that your father was a psychologist I mean that was just pure Freud I mean do you think that that had an impact on your interest in the study
(07:56) of genetics as the point where science and social construct interact is I keep charging 300 pounds an hour for this yes the interesting thing about about so my dad definitely inculcated a love of science but um he was definitely not a Freudian and when he retired say to me before we started recording we were talking about The Simpsons he said a line in his retirement speech which is actually from The Simpsons which is when you write 51 of the time you're wrong 49 of the time and I think that's a nice assessment of the successes and failures
(08:35) of psychologists and academic discipline so the love of science comes from him I think in answer to the question I I don't think most people go into genetics as undergraduates wanting to engage with the social history of humankind or human evolution or or Human Social history you know we just dogs you know I'm really interested in DNA and how that stuff works but there comes a point I think if you keep going we can't ignore it in my trajectory it's partly because the history of my field is incredibly pernicious in two
(09:14) Dimensions Evolution and biology are rooted in colonial expansion and and racism I I argue and I'm not the only person saying this that biology emerges in service of European expansion of political ideologies of of Empire and more specifically genetics emerges out of the political ideology of eugenics in the in the 19th century so most I think you know most Genesis most working geneticists people in Labs all around the world either don't know that or aren't that interested in it because there's a lot
(09:52) of work to be done well you uh teacher UCL did you study there as well I did weirdly and slightly depressingly I teach the course that I was an undergraduate on oh man you're like first is tragedy and then as fast yeah Hotel California I mean I also went to UCL I was in The English Department and many of my lectures particularly for Chaucer and for Romantics were in the Francis Galton lecture theater and when you go to um a Russell group University or you know Oxford or Cambridge you're surrounded by the names of people who
(10:29) you never really think about right I don't think about okay so who was Sir John Sloan I don't think about um who was Francis Galton it was only after I left that I was you know reading about Eugenics and then up Pops this guy's name and I go what the um so so what was it like for you to be surrounded by the history of eugenics both as a student and as an academic and was that something which kicked off your interest in the relationship between the study of genetics and the history of eugenics honestly no eventually yes but
(11:06) as an undergraduate also in the golden lecture theater it was very normalized this conversation was very normal it's very early on so I was an undergraduate in I was a first year in 1994 five something like that um and in the introduction to Evolution the introduction to genetics courses they're sort of week two is the history of eugenics and the introduction to Francis golton and those type of people um and so it was right there at the base of my academic and intellectual progress in genetics only recently have
(11:42) I discovered how abnormal that is and it's abnormal because it happened at UCL and gold I was in the golden laboratory being taught in the golden lecture theater golden founded what eventually became the genetics department of which I am now um a a member a lecturer and it will never not amuse me that my salary is paid by Francis Galton because he left a large Financial Legacy which which funded various things and was basically a sort of slush fund for almost a second century um there was Eugenics inquiry in 2018
(12:20) which finished in 2020 just before lockdown and one of the outcomes of that was the redistribution of this money which meant to creating new fellowships and supporting various anti-racism um projects actually not buying new skull measuring calipers well I do have I have budget for that if you if I go in that direction no um but they also redistributed to create a new lecture ship which is my position which is uh genetics in society so for the initiated viewer what what Eugenics and how did it come about so the way I frame Eugenics is that it's a
(13:01) way of thinking that it predates the existence of the word and Francis Galton by several thousand years so it's the idea that you can shape or mold Society for the better by selective breeding by pairing people who you think have desirable qualities or culling babies that you have that you think have uh have undesirable qualities and it's an ancient idea it's first described in the western canon in um Republic in Books five and six we talks about marriage festivals for the maintenance of good quality people in
(13:39) society gold standard women to be matched with gold standard men no poets as well he wanted to exclude all poets from his ideal Republic to Plato he thought they were Liars they're Liars I didn't know that right to exclude them from societies yep so um if you are making ideal Partnerships uh poets wouldn't be a part of it I don't know if being a part is a hereditary trait but well I mean I I can this is probably not the time to discuss this but I can see that argument we can talk about that at
(14:10) some other time no so an old idea um and as far as we can tell this this idea exists lists either theoretically or in practice in pretty much every culture all around the world for as long as there have been humans I mean aristocracy is a form of eugenics when you think about it it kind of is it absolutely is and and that I'm I'm kind of I've ended up being someone who's quite opposed to sort of taxonomic definitions and classifications for various reasons which we might get into later um but I often find that slapping labels on
(14:43) things is a substitute for actually thinking about what the thing is or what the thing does so the we we don't mate randomly and we never have mated randomly we do select personally you didn't know me in my second year at Uni no um there was a study a few years ago in it based in Australia which was tracking sexually transmitted diseases amongst undergraduates and when they published the paper they didn't realize that they'd inadvertently created a a league table of sexual proclivities by subject
(15:22) and I wrote about this at the time so this is a bit of a cul-de-sac here but you've just reminded me I haven't thought about this for years the first thing that we noticed as scientists was that there wasn't a science subject in the top half what's history about top no history was top history was tough English was second of course Psychology was top of Science and it's barely a science evolution was next I was quite pleased about that okay biochemistry bottom that doesn't surprise me anyway
(15:50) um we don't rate we don't mate randomly is the thought that I was having um so we do select our partners and we to a certain extent and historically obviously there's all sorts of valences within that that there's not a complete free choice but societies move in different directions all of the time as a result of these the interaction between biology and culture what eugenics was formalized as a science in the 19th century but what the idea behind it the way of thinking of eugenics is that we should steer the powerful should steer
(16:25) Society in particular directions using that framework in in a in a top-down way it's not this is me or individuals wanting to have families with this person or this person it is that the government or the powerful decide who gets to reproduce and who doesn't and so what happens in the 19th century in the sort of post-malphus years where this is beginning to be a really serious conversation Malthus is the population guy yeah yeah so um priest polemicist um early mathematician in in sort of uh sort of trying to understand social
(17:02) demographics and he he identifies what has never been demonstrated to be true but an important idea which is that populations grow at exponential rates when they're happy but resources grow at linear rates so we always do if he's right we're always doomed to have sort of boom and bust Cycles and it almost doesn't matter whether he's right or not but but at in the 19th century in in the sort of in the wake of the Industrial Revolution and with Colonial expansion and mass immigration and urbanization
(17:39) and which means a much more visible poor the transfer of responsibility of poor people and people at the bottom of the socioeconomic scale from the church with the Tudor Paul laws to the state was something that was happening with various acts with names like the madhouse Act and the lunatic act and then by the 19 by the apollium periods the mental deficiencies Act and so you've got asylums emerging as a way of treating um or dealing with hiding um people deemed unworthy and then golton just drops into this parachutes
(18:18) into this world he's Charles Darwin's half cousin and Darwin in 1859 describes evolution by natural selection doesn't talk about humans at all Darwin is a extraordinarily liberal man for the night for for extremely wealthy privileged man in 19th century Britain but his cousin is Francis Galton who is awful extraordinarily bright cannot see past his own prejudices travels around the world rights of best-selling travel book based on his travels around Africa um comes back as a extreme white supremacist and he applies the ideas
(18:57) that are sort of set up about evolution by his cousin who he adores and venerates and believes that genius is a biological category that flows through his family and it seems whenever someone goes genius is an inherited trait no one ever goes and it's not in my family they go and it is in my family yeah yeah no that's exactly right and this is an example of him not being able to see past his own biases his first book in this sort of area is called hereditary genius and it is a very methodological statistical analysis of
(19:34) the Great Men of British history Prime Ministers MPS poets does include poets okay okay yeah lawyers and various people he's absolutely uninterested in women at all and the difference with his with with this book and the significance of this book is that it is a scientific a statistical numerical application to great man theory of History this very wiggish View um now the stats are terrible but it's sort of foundational in a scientific understanding of hereditary behaviors and what role does race play
(20:17) in this because um one of the things I've been writing about recently is trying to sort of put together like a little potted history of race going um how does this emerge as a technology of governance and how does it change through the 19th century and one of the things which I found extraordinary is that you couldn't separate racist discourses and ideas from ableist discourses and ideas and classes discourses and ideas they were all sort of seen as part of the same thing which is there are certain kinds of human who
(20:49) are deficient or inadequate or inherently stupid um and these are inherited characteristics they're passed down through generation and that's got nothing to do with the fact that from generation to generation you've enslaved people or kept them poor or deny them education or treat them horribly yes exactly these characteristics are immutable and race race science is almost uncontested at this time in in Britain and in Europe and America as a result the racial categories are fixed and they are immutable
(21:28) um and they are inherently hierarchical so the classification system that we have rejected in science in the 20th century um because the evidence Stacks up against it is is the foundation of biology it's designed by Linnaeus in the in the late 18th century in which he describes he's the first person not not absolutely but the first significant person to describe the different types of humans from around the world four of them he starts off with and moves up to five with an extra category in a later edition of his big book
(22:05) sister by nature and the categorizations are initially a biological a physical characteristic skin color secondly another one hair color and texture and then the next ones after that are unequivocal value judgments I mean extraordinarily racist they're racist to us now they're racist in their day as well because they're hierarchical so um uh sub-Saharan African people have silky black skin um tight curly hair are lazy capricious physically strong um and and sexually loose right um uh Homo sapiens asiaticus so broadly
(22:49) what we would refer to as he's East Asian today are yellow skinned these are the words that he uses um straight black hair haughty unimaginative governed by tradition Homo sapiens americanus that's so indigenous Americans not George W bush which is where my brain went immediately no not definitely not him so Native Americans indigenous Americans um straight black hair red skin um governed by Customs you know blah blah blah and you've got he comes up with these four categories and then the uh Homo sapiens Europeans are
(23:29) white-skinned with blue eyes and they are creative imaginative graceful and industrious and and he this is the this is the setup for biology this is the origin of biology everyone that comes after him has another crack at it that introduces new metrics like you know you alluded to skull measurements or all those sorts of things um but there isn't a single example of categorizations of of humans between the 17th and the 20th century which isn't hierarchical and doesn't put white Europeans as Superior so what what does
(24:04) the study of genetics then tell us about these categories because of course some of these are inherited traits skin tones and inherited traits I share mine with my mom um eye color hair color hair texture um how do these uh like it's the word phenotype phenotypes yeah yes um how do these phenotypes overlap with geography because that's the thing that's being described is that these clusters of characteristics overlap with places in the world yeah that's right and it's really important to recognize
(24:40) that people are different from around the world because I think one of the mistakes that um well intentions anti-racist people have made in in history is to adopt a sort of blank slate view that everyone is the same and I think the reason that becomes such a problematic argument and inflames people who who maybe aren't uh overt Nazis or actual racists is that we are very visual organisms and we look and see people are different from around the world and have different physical characteristics the what what genetics did in the 20th
(25:16) century is genetics is is the real metric of human similarities and difference because it is what is different in our at a molecular level rather than what is physical um and it influences what is physical of course but what we began to see is that the categorizations that had been used initially using these very crude phenotype types like skin color and then as they became more um detailed things like skull measurements and various things like that is that they didn't correspond to the underlying genetic variation that we see
(25:56) around the world in Broad scale they sort of do we see Continental um uh clustering of of I mean it's difficult to talk about this without getting into some chewy maths and I won't do that but clustering is a you know real uh mathematical way of trying to identify things that are similar and things that are different but what we find is that there are some broad similarities around the world in terms of genetic clustering and largely very broadly they correspond to Continental land masses but beyond that the way we
(26:28) talk about race does not correspond with genetic variability I mean this is going to sound really thick but I went to I went to Mexico on holiday last year and it was amazing but I went to Mexican holiday and um I was traveling around in the South and I kept walking into people who looked just like me so same skin tone same hair texture the thing that was different is that they tended to have more Aqua line noses rather than like you know squidgy Bengali ones but I was walking down the road in uh San Cristobal and I literally collided with
(27:00) a man who was the dead spit of my uncle dead spit and I gorped at this poor guy and he was like is this girl okay and one of the things that that taught me in a just a really concrete way is that yes you've got these clusterings but as far as I know I have no indigenous Mexican heritage whatsoever it's you know Bengali as far back as we cared to record it um so this racial distinction of dark skin dark straight hair brown eyes short it was spanning continents yeah well you can I mean they're undoubtedly physical similarities
(27:37) between people around the world in different in different phenotypes and different physical physical traits that doesn't necessarily mean they have the same share genetic origin so there's this is an idea which is broadly sort of we could call it convergent evolution right the the straightness and darkness of your hair um you know bearing in mind the overall similarity between all so you're assuming it's natural but uh um might be completely different from the straightness and Blackness of hair
(28:09) from someone from East Asia or from someone from who is of Native American or um indigenous American descent I don't know that but I I'm quite happy to to say that and um because that sort of variation Furious hairdressers in the comments being like actually they get they get furious about anything though they get they get so angry about things that are intuitively what they don't think is is true or they do think it's true that I'm I'm countering this is the point that we were talking about earlier it's that
(28:42) experiential thing that like you know the example I sometimes give is that I know you said you dropped biology as soon as you could but do you remember eye color I yes I remember eye color okay because that's how we teach genetics okay yeah there's a there's a gene which if you have the Brown version of the gene it's dominant over the Blue version that's what I hear right and if you've got one copy of the brown then you'll have brownies yeah and if you've got you have to have two copies of the
(29:09) blue-eyed version to have blue eyes right you've just passed GCSE biology why do so many Iranians have green eyes well it because what I just said is not true right because it's incorrect okay and it is the foundation of how we teach genetics incidentally that model was invented by the American Chief eugenicist in 1907 a guy called Charles Davenport who was the American version of Francis golton and he was obsessed with the notion that everything whether it's eye color or hair color or skin color but also crazy
(29:45) behavioral traits like seafaringness or sexual proclivities or prostitution all of these things that for him were they worked in exactly the same way as eye color genetics does and you just pointed out by saying that Iranian thing about green eyes what the problem with it is there aren't two eye colors there isn't one gene which dominates the the control of of eye colors uh there are at least 15 there's a third Gene so there's the blue and brown version of the same gene there's also a green Gene which it
(30:18) heavily influences green eyes um and the truth of the matter is that the model I just described the mendelian view of genetics is is more like a guideline so say um I mean I hate to break it to you I mean we're all going to die and it's going to happen to you one day too but um you know the archaeologists of the future they they dig you up and they test your DNA were they able to accurately put together how you would have looked because one of the things that the internet racists love to say to me is while you say you're English but
(30:53) when you die and they dig you up they'll be able to say that you weren't because they tested you genetically well if you die with a passport on you then that's the end of that question in fact I would like the lyrics to England till I die in my back pocket this is the thing that the internet racist don't get which is that these these things nationality is a social construct right boundary borders are social constructs you're English because you have an English you were born in were you born in England I was
(31:27) within your English and what's the point I'm English because I'm emotionally repressed I can't comment on that although I'm sure there's a genetic component to it but they it's this is the sort of central pillar of all of my work about Eugenics and race it's really the question of how scientific ideas get marshaled into pre-existing political ideologies um and there's there's a lot of work in this domain within the history of Science and within history and within sociology but I'm trying to approach it
(31:56) from the point of view of a of a geneticists of other scientists um because that's what you know we've talked about we've talked about the history of the birth of scientific racism we've talked about the birth of of eugenics but in both examples this is scientists or proto-scientists making new discoveries or making new pronouncements because I think in both cases they're not really very good science um and and then they then the political classes of which most of these guys are members anyway use that those new discoveries of
(32:32) those new pronouncements in order to justify their own pre-existing um beliefs so it's the phrase I use in talking about Eugenics is that it's bigotry dressed up as biology and so your internet race is saying you know you're not English no matter how how many you Spurs fan right oh yeah yeah so so no matter how much you claim to be a football fan no matter how much you what you sound like or what however English you feel you are you're not English but I mean I mean can you reliably reconstruct who
(33:06) someone was through genetics or can you only get likelihoods like oh you know this person was you know 40 likely to taste coriander like it's soap yeah um yeah I mean part if there's one thing that I want people to recognize in all of my work is that genetics is not deterministic it is probabilistic so you started by asking me about 23 and me um my the the gene the brown blue eye Gene the version that I've got if you look at a population 69 of people with the version that I've I've got have
(33:43) brown eyes right so that's two-thirds of people with that genotype have this phenotype now of course I know I have brown eyes because mirrors right I didn't need to pay for that service but you the way you just framed that question was was was perfect right because if you dug me up in 10 000 years when my eyes color is not available but you did manage to get the DNA sequence for that particular Gene you've got a two out of three chance that you're going to get my eye color roughly right without counting the other genes the
(34:15) green eye Gene the other 14 or however many genes are involved in pigmentation and in the in the in the iris so yeah probabilistically you could make a decent fist at saying it's it's more than 50 likely that this guy had brown eyes but were you in bed the farm on that though would you then how did you feel about like the cheddar man reconstruction because obviously it was a massive news story the Reconstruction of the chairman was like he's got dark skin and he looks like the South Asian girls who have the blue contacts it's
(34:49) startling um did you look at that and you go oh I'm not sure I mean was it nailed on do you think it's it's a really interesting case study and it was done by colleagues and friends so I'm very I wasn't involved in the study itself but I was very closely involved in how it was disseminated the the scientific paper which describes cheddar man and the the genome sequence of cheddaman is is pretty circumspect and I think is it gets it pretty pretty accurately so with these particular genotypes we predict
(35:25) that this person this man will have a darker skin in this sort of range will have eye color in this sort of range because you know science is it's it's boringly circumstant but we always have to say you're always hedging you're always hedging you know there's the classic line is one of the presents I can't remember which one it was when it was a Scientific Advisor to put Roosevelt or something says can you get me a one-armed scientist so they can't say yeah but on the other right it's
(35:53) probably a Pocketful um but that's what we have to do right because we don't pronounce truths in science we're always circumspect because every result is only conditionally and um conditionally correct so that's what the paper says but what people want understandably is not to read about the probability of whether this guy had this range of skin color or hair texture or whatever you want to see what this guy was like and that's the most exciting thing about this field is that we can not just reconstruct historical events
(36:25) or actions but we can see what people well like this is a guy a man who died 10 000 years ago in England Somerset cheddar in summer listen I've never left London in my life I think it's so much that anyway people will be more angry about that how can you mix pronouncements where you don't even know whether the somerset is in the west country yeah right that's exciting so what we often do and what often happens is you create a maquette or a bust and a reconstruction and I that you have to make decisions in doing
(37:03) that where you can't be circumspect you can't be conditional and so there was a choice what what pigment this is the range what color are we going to make this guy's skin what color are we going to make this guy's eyes now I don't think it's wrong and it's quite possible that that reconstruction was literally a mirror image of what that guy looked like but it's also quite possible that he didn't look like that very much at all I mean I I want to talk about the p feel of um DNA and understanding your genetic
(37:30) self um you know who Michael K Williams is what was he played Omar little the greatest uh anti-hero in All American culture um I mean one of my favorite bits of the wires when he's in the turquoise pajamas and he's on his way to the shops to get the Honey Nut Cheerios yeah oh my strolling um he uh was approached by a kind of you know DNA testing lab that markets itself specifically to African Americans and they made a little short documentary of his experience of doing this ancestry test and it was so emotional for him and
(38:14) he calls up a friend of his who also did the test called Isaiah Washington and it just so happens that they both could trace some Heritage back to a particular tribe in Senegal and it is undoubtedly just this powerful moment and they're both crying they're both saying I knew we were brothers and I found myself feeling quite uncomfortable about it because on the one hand this is so clearly important to them and who am I to say this is load of horseshit but on the other I found something and you when you look at how it's sort
(38:53) of measured it's like you know one out of 32 ancestors I was like but this is as much of a story as the one African-Americans had to create for themselves after the displacement and the trauma and the huge cultural psychological political break that was the experience for slavery yeah yeah I write about this in in um one of my books how to argue with a racist because I think it is it it is incredibly hard to process this I think it's exploitation um the fact that those some of those companies are are owned by African
(39:30) Americans doesn't make this an easier conversation um the desire for narrative satisfaction I think is the main fuel for all of these ancestry companies not not just the ones targeting uh the African-American descendants of the enslaved experience um but they're they're there's a sense of the enslaved is a special case because there is no history their history was erased and the the history of the transatlantic slave Roots is that some you know up up to 12 million people taken from four possibly
(40:09) five just maybe six countries um and mixed on Route and then redistributed well half of them died in transit but um traded all of their ancestry completely lost never recorded um and then the American story is is also such that once African people are in um the Americas well they're mostly talking about the USA they are redistributed um and sold and um uh the the the the the sexual history and the family history of the African-American experiences is unique because of that process which means that the average African-American genome is
(40:56) very distinct from the African genomes from which they they were taken now you couple that with the fact that there is more genetic diversity within the African continent than in the rest of the world put together which means that on average someone from Senegal is more different genetically to someone from Angola than either of those people are to anyone else on the rest of the planet and that's just the what the genetic says so I know this is quite a brain scrambling concept no no I'm with you I'm with you but but that's this is one
(41:32) of the problems with the earlier conversation about about how we categorize people we say black people right because Linnaeus said black people Homo sapiens alpha or Africanus but actually it's a completely incoherent biological category because of the amount of genetic diversity that exists in in people from the who are in Africa or from the African diasporas so how this relates to the transatlantic slave trade means that you've got two people taken from maybe neighboring tribes or counties or whatever the
(42:05) equivalent is or or countries who are taken from their their birthplace put onto ships mixed around maybe live or die they then trade around forcibly mated potentially um we know from the genetics now that they that there is a lot of European DNA in the African-American genome and mostly it is from male Europeans into female African-Americans so you know figure that out um interestingly the converse is also true many uh white Americans some have up to 20 of African ancestry that we can measure in their DNA so again it's
(42:50) another example of how there's a mixed race Medici I believe I I can't remember if it was a customer or an Alessandro de Medici um whose father was obviously an Italian Aristocrat part of one one of the most um powerful families in Italian History and whose mother was an African servant um but this mixed race Medici uh his children then married into the rest of the Italian aristocracy and it was never spoken of again because after that race as categories of human who must never be mixed became more and more historically
(43:29) important and nobody wanted to talk about the African blood that was in their families well that in America it becomes formalized as the one drop rule so there's a there's a moment in the in the 17th century where the the the the difference between hypo descent and Hyper descent flips legally so that is where you um you take on what what status wait what's hyper descent the legal status of a child is inherited from the more or less powerful uh cultural parent so hypo descent is inheriting it from typically
(44:04) from the mother hyper descent is I think I've got that the right round from the father but anyway the point is that in in the 17th century there was a there was a legal challenge to this because a boy was born of a mixed partnership an English lawyer and an enslaved woman and the child inherited the states of the father now the Virginia assembly weren't happy with this and so they flipped the law so which meant that the pairing of a white person with a black person the child will always inherit status the legal
(44:36) status of the black person from that point onwards and then over the course of the next you know a couple of centuries as racism becomes enshrined and legalized um sort of formally legalized ever more into the what becomes known as the the one drop rule which is that if you if you have any ancestor who is African or African-American then you legally are a a black person and this is the absurdity of this is is perhaps best showcased in Thomas Jefferson having six children uh with we think well as a sitting president all of whom looked white but
(45:17) were legally black and therefore legally Born Into Slavery so you've got a situation where the sitting president one of the founding fathers has children Sally Heming who herself is mixed race um and they are born enslaved which is a an absurdity even though and they'll they're you know they're ostensibly white people as the social definition goes now the one drop rule continued in in America what this this now trips over into the other book The Eugenics book because a big part of the story of eugenics is is
(45:53) the ultimate realization of this type of thinking during the Holocaust in 1930s Germany um the Nazis were trying to establish the rules of inheritance so that you could determine who was pure German Aryan and who was Jewish and they looked at the one drop rule they looked at the American framework for it and decided that it was too strict I mean one of the things which I've read is that the Nazis looked at American anti-miscegenation laws which prohibited um you know the marriage and really the having of children between consenting
(46:34) mixed race parties one of the things that I wanted to ask you about is we tend to think about Eugenics as this Nazi phenomenon and therefore it's other and it's over there and it's swastikas and Goose stepping but it's inscribed in the University of London on you know very buildings um you had immigration criteria for moving to America which was based on eugenesis principles do you think that as a society we've ever properly reckoned with that that hidden history within our own history no absolutely not
(47:11) um we're having a tool and there's an interesting parallel well not non-parallel between uh attempts to understand the history of race and attempts to understand the history of eugenics I think it's partly because Eugenics is a sort of technical sounding word people just don't know what it is mostly whereas you say you know race racism everyone knows what we're talking about here I I think Eugenics is one of the defining ideas of the 20th century because it is an idea that frames the second world war it's it
(47:44) is the lifeblood of the Third Reich racial Purity through selection it is the lifeblood of the um enforce sterilization of somewhere between 70 and 500 000 people in America it is the lifeblood of the emergence of great replacement Theory and profound anti-Semitism that comes that becomes formalized in the 1910s and 20s with people like Henry Ford that we I think we sometimes think that because of the atrocities of the Nazis and the Holocaust that was the end of the story and that this was unique to the deranged ideology
(48:24) of Hitler and and the Third Reich but the truth of the story is that it's an idea which starts in the UK starts in London or is formalized in in London but is never enacted in Britain we never had why was that well it's mostly due to the campaigning of GK Chesterton the the detective novelist GK Chesterton yeah it's a weird Quirk of this history that we come up with the idea scientifically with people like Francis Galton um it becomes exported and influences German Eugenics it's never called eugenics in German it's called Classen
(49:05) hygiene race hygiene it gets exported incredibly efficiently to America where they have Eugenics policies on the books from 1907 for most of the 20th century but the legislation in the UK was proposed several times mostly by Churchill um who is very interested perhaps obsessed is a little bit strong but incredibly interested in the American models particularly in places like Indiana which has the first enforced sterilization rules we know this because he writes about it very openly this is a this is a cultural conversation that's
(49:41) happening all the time in Edwardian Britain but Churchill's the main uh sort of political driver of this and did he want that for the colonies or did you want that for home yeah for England it's home right the the problem is in Hebrew it's women with menstrual problems the question of race which you asked earlier but I didn't really answer is a bit fuzzy because the definitions of race are quite flexible through time so a lot of the Eugenics policies or suggested policies in the UK were aimed at the Irish
(50:18) right deemed then a degenerate race of Alcoholics um and and that ties in very closely with first ways feminism as well so a lot of the first wave feminists really interested in the Reproductive Rights of women in order that the sterilization of certain groups of people such as the Irish UMES is a monster I mean most of my work seems to center around awful men so it's quite well it's nice to have an awful woman more women you Genesis um so what was the deal with with Mary Stokes because I only um know her as the reason why if I get
(50:56) pregnant My Life won't be totally wrecked by it yeah yeah absolutely so a name most closely associated with reproductive health and abortions for women I can't remember the exact numbers I do quote it in the book but it's it's something like 40 000. um uh abortions around the world per year so in my view an extremely positive necessary um medical um provision of Medical Care for Women double thumbs up right her reasons for being interested in the Reproductive Rights of of women were because she was
(51:32) a Nazi and I don't mean that in a everyone's a Nazi who disagrees with me she was an actual Nazi she was a complete white supremacist total fascist obsessed with social structure and and Exterminating certain races including she sent poetry love poetry to Hitler in 1938 so you're right up against the wall this is not like naive it's not like all I'm interested in this young adult guy yeah he seems quite charming and no no this is where uh but we're about to declare war as she sends a book of love poetry
(52:06) to Hitler in which I forget the exact verse but she's that she Ryan's um she says something like the Russians are a curse the prussians are much worse the Jews are anyways a few bits of poetry declaring how how awful these these races are and that um enforce sterilization is is basically the way forward for the purification of white English people so I I you know I bang on about Stokes because of the Poetry but she's not she's extreme But Not Unusual in in this sort of domain and influenced by Francis golton she was
(52:43) also at UCL oh my God I know did her PhD well I think the first PhD in geology by a woman I I want to ask you uh something which might be quite a technical question but it's something which I've always been interested in so you've got the study of social epidemiology which is looking at the way in which different policies have different outcomes on the health of a population so for instance the impact of unemployment or deprivation or inequality on health outcomes you also start looking at things like the impact
(53:14) of housing on birth rates or the provision of affordable child care mostly Eugenics is about producing certain kinds of population by either facilitating or curtailing people's ability to reproduce right so you affect what's in the population is there a neat dividing line between social epidemiology which is relatively uncontroversial lots of people who um you know would say Eugenics very bad but perfectly comfortable with social epidemiology is there a neat dividing line between the two or can these things
(53:47) bleed into one another not only do can they bleed into into one another but the the Assumption which I don't think you're making but I think many people do but the assumption that eugenics in its foundation and certainly in the Edwardian period is a right-wing ideology is not accurate it is embraced by the emerging socialist movement in in Britain with exactly the same fervor the fabians were they into a bit of eugenics so both Beatrice and Sydney Webb were active proponents of of eugenics William Beveridge uh was expressed positive
(54:22) support for enforced sterilization for men specifically throughout his life um uh George Bernard Shaw Well he kind of vacillates somewhere you know how socialist he actually actually is H.G Wells a lot of cultural figures are all super into the idea of of purifying or improving the quality of the stock of the British people it's a reflection of power again in that almost all of these people are come from wealth and privilege and also a really important thing is that almost everyone who's a key eugenicist of this period goes to all of
(54:59) the men go to one of five public schools and they all go to Oxbridge and so there is a I think past the foundation of this way of thinking is that there are natural hierarchies of people they all venerate the classics you know a society which had no social mobility and where there were strata of society where social Mobility is non-existent I think that there is a there is a discussion to be had about in this darwinian era where the rise of a softer form of Christianity which isn't which is you know ostensibly a bottom-up
(55:35) religion that empowers the poor in principle um that's the the powerful members of society as the power of the church is beginning to wane they say well you know Holland said this is a challenge to our absolute god-given Authority and now Darwin is saying there is mutability in in culture as well so how do we maintain power I know we have a secular hierarchy which is also immutable yeah I mean that that definitely makes sense as a cultural study of um Eugenics moving towards the present and indeed the future you've got the
(56:12) emergence of Technologies like crispr um which I thought was a kind of salad spinner for ages and now realize that it's a form of Gene editing I believe that presents all sorts of ethical questions because you might be able to do something like identify and edit the gene which leads to something like Huntington's disease but there are also many other conditions many of which people have and need happy and fulfilled and healthy lives which reintroduce this question of should there be a limit on our ability to change what kind of
(56:52) people are in the human population I mean what what are your thoughts on it well I run a 20-hour course I'm trying to address that question we don't have a time limit on the recording okay great all right I have slides all right I'm going to frame this answer by talking about something I mentioned earlier which is that the semantics of this argument are I think not irrelevant because um I got a hashtag search permanent hashtag search in my on my Twitter for hashtag Eugenics and 95 of them are anti-vaccination people or anti-covids
(57:32) lockdown people just going it's Eugenics right now I I think that you know I'm not an anti-vaxxer obviously and and I think they're completely wrong about that but I also think they've misunderstood what Eugenics was and is um and this idea that it's a way of thinking more than anything else giving it that name um and then most closely associating the word Eugenics with the atrocities of the second world war has effectively done a disservice to the mindset which is behind Eugenics which is that
(58:04) populations can be controlled through biological means now what what you I think the the sort of evolution of eugenics is an idea is the move away from the top-down approach so this is a government imposed strategy for the people which comes from both both the left and and the right um and what happens in in the years after the after the war after the second world war is a sort of cultural shift within the world of science away from the hereditarian position which is that nature genetics is more dominant over nurture which is the environment nature
(58:49) versus nurture by the way a phrase coined by Francis Galton sake his intellectual Legacy cannot be um underestimated he invented the weather map um so the first Weather Map was published in the times and it was his work it was actually the day after the weather so of limited use he invented um he was foundational for the study of fingerprints for forensics because the similar questions that he was interested in is this is are my fingerprints inherited for my father or mother or are they unique to me so he's made it harder
(59:27) for me to commit crimes Francis Gautama was still alive it's on site yeah I mean many people consider that fingerprinting thing to be positive for anyway forget that um he debunked phrenology which was big at the time and that's interesting because you would have thought that's exactly the type of uh sort of biological essentialists pseudoscience that someone like him would be super into but more than being a white supremacist and a um and a sort of Proto fascist he was a dated nerd I think we see
(59:58) similar characteristics in the data bro behavior of contemporary date Bros as we do in Francis Galton um I mean there's a kind of um you know take someone like Elon Musk who genuinely believes that people like him need to reproduce and impregnate absolutely anything that moves I mean do you think that there is a neo-eugenesis movement within Silicon Valley uh yes I I do I think that we have a cultural issue which is that people powerful people discovering things for the first time I mean if only there was a phrase about
(1:00:37) history and repeating that you know do I don't know whether there is a phrase that describes that but it's it's you know when you when you study history and realize especially when you study the classics you realize that all this has already happened just gets dressed up with with new tech and and I think we do see that with Eugenics I do that mindset is the same great replacement theory has never gone away the and it's more popular now than ever before especially in America it really is founded in those years because
(1:01:11) of enormous amounts of immigration into America in the Years 1900 to 1915 which is shut down in 1924 um with the Johnson act uh and the key advisor on that is one of the main eugenicists a guy called Harry Lachlan who was also the main Eugenics advisor to the Nazis in Berlin during those same era which was funded by the way by the Rockefeller foundation so this is this is a it's so culturally normalized at this point in America that it's just it's just part of society that they're a biological strata that
(1:01:51) are immutable and essential and that if you want to improve Society then we have to take a biological view not the social not not that that poverty is inherited because it is poverty is inherited but that doesn't mean that it's biological um and so there's all these these sort of classic case studies that emerge out of out of this era which give them definitive answers Harry Lachlan produces an enormous document um which describes the biological characteristics of people of different countries and presents it to the
(1:02:29) immigration Committee in 1924 and says these people are better than these people this is here's the ranking here and this is why immigration didn't end in 1924 it just became incredibly streamlined because you know North European German Germanic people are just better than Slavs or Italians or Irish right so you know the the the the the cultural racisms uh fluctuate depending on the on the era back to this question of the technology we've got now because I appreciate what you're saying about Eugenics being top
(1:03:05) down and that there is a much broader history of eugenics outside of Nazi Germany but let's say um the technologies that you know could be available to me ranging from embryo selection to abortion to something like crispr I would have an unprecedented amount of control over what kind of child I might have and how I make that decision is obviously hugely influenced by ableism the way in which we uh view people who have you know long-term illnesses or who have disabilities to get to this question of of how we
(1:03:44) May internalize or reproduce the Genesis logic I mean there's a conflict between for instance Advocates of um disability rights and Advocates of women's absolute right to choose in terms of aborting a fetus who has Down syndrome for instance does something like crispr it revives these ethical discussions over should there be limits on how much we can choose to eradicate certain conditions certain kinds of body certain kinds of illnesses certain kinds of disabilities from the human population someone just you know say an advocate of
(1:04:23) um the social model of disability will go well that lets Society of the hook we should be changing Society not the kind of bodies that are in it yeah well politically I I pretty much largely agree with with what you've just said that the the new technologies that allow things like embryo selection or in the future Gene editing um I I yeah this is this is a hairy area there's there's a couple of things there's a couple of sort of I'm going to be sciency and and tedious about it which is that the technology is very
(1:04:52) limited in its availability right so I've we estimate that something like six million people have been born from the IVF process since 90 since Louise Brown in 1979. so I mean that's the population of like I don't know a country that has six million people in it so it's not insignificant but in terms of it being the type of strategy that would have been imposed from the states say the Nazi State or the American state in the 20th century it's not really a significant number and it's really only
(1:05:22) available to the wealthy West um there's a second sort of scientific caveat to that which is to do with a hot conversation about brown and blue eyes the the public com the public discourse about genetic essentialism and genetic determinism is so heavily influenced by science fiction that it's not really realistic in any way you can't select for eye color because of the conversation we've just just had right so you can't get your money back either if you get a brown-eyed baby rather than a blue eyed baby and when it comes to
(1:05:52) things like behavioral traits which are never controlled by single genes which we are capable of editing so behavioral things like personality or intelligence which is always the you know that it always comes down to to questions of intelligence and I think that's a slightly separate conversation but we need to have it um the the idea that you could edit Gene edit for intelligence and then select is really a scientific fantasy that doesn't mean that it it won't be possible in the future but we're talking decades away at
(1:06:21) best from a purely functional and scientific point of view you um and then on top of that there's the whole fetishization of metrics associated with behaviors particularly for intelligence and that is inherent to the Eugenics movement so I I think that IQ has validity as a metric I think that it is a deeply problematic historical it's it's history is is profoundly problematic but it has some scientific validity with tons of caveats and tons of cautions not least because we've been measuring it for a
(1:06:58) hundred years with all of those caveats and cautions in place but it is a data set that is that that if you're very careful has some utility most people aren't careful about it right and it's become fetishized as a you know yesterday I I saw a headline that the the youngest member of Mensa has been identified as the four-year-old kid with really cute glasses oh I didn't see that one was it yeah that that's the kid four yeah yeah it's four years old I mean sure it measures something but why is that
(1:07:36) why why is that something valued by the media and by Society over finding I don't know the kindest four-year-old in Britain which I think would would propagate a much healthier Society if we if we valued behaviors and characteristics which which didn't have this specific intelligence metric uh associated with them and so that ties into the ableist conversation as well because initially the subjects of eugenic selection in the Victorian and Edwardian period include people with obvious physical disabilities right but then it becomes
(1:08:11) extended to less obvious physical disabilities and then it becomes extended to mental health or behavioral traits or or or pretty much anything that they deemed undesirable and that is that's the sort of fundamental ableist view that people with achondroplasia so classic classical dwarfism um are part of the eugenics anti-selection um sort of criteria of of that era um I I don't have answers to these because it's as a conversation by the way you know I think this is one of the hardest questions that we we face and down
(1:08:53) syndrome is a particular case study which due to its biological underpinnings it is unique and is deeply difficult to to talk about the reasons being that so it is chromosomal abnormality um and it's identifiable very early on in pregnancy because because of its of the phenotype that's that abnormality creates now the second thing we're saying is that because it's a whole chromosome rather than just a single gene or a handful of genes the range the phenotype um that that comes as a result of trisomy 21 is huge
(1:09:33) um and then it's also hugely socially mediated as well so the availability of resources so a a I don't know a single parent having a kid with Down Syndrome who is at the bottom end of the of the Spectrum in terms of cognitive abilities is an entirely different category to a a wealthy person or a wealthy family having a kid with Down Syndrome who's at the top end of that of of those abilities but we kind of lump them all together and we can't identify those differences in neutero so the technology available
(1:10:09) says at nine weeks you can identify with a high probability with a high success prediction that this is a baby carrying Trisomy 21. and now that comes with the ready and for in the in the in the west and then more liberal countries it comes with the free access to abortions and what we found is that in Denmark and in Iceland where early identification and um a early identification exists and free availability of of abortions is universal what we found is that down syndrome has effectively been eradicated uh in America weirdly for the wrong
(1:10:49) reasons it's actually slightly On The Rise but that's because abortions have been Limited with the cancellation of Roe versus Roe v Wade of course but also the steps before that included so in in this sort of incremental process towards the overturning of Roe Wade in many states it was no abortions once tries to me 21 has been identified so that came before that um so given the choice in at least two countries Denmark and Iceland women choose not to have babies with with Down Syndrome and I don't know
(1:11:25) how to I I don't there isn't a resolution to this as a question but part of the underlying framework of the discussion that we have in society and that we need to have is about the visibility and value of individuals that historically have been demonized or deemed Unworthy of existence or reproductive Reproductive Rights uh in order that we as a society decide whether or not that is the right way the right thing to do I mean is there maybe something here about technology evolves at a pace which gives us new ways to
(1:12:02) dehumanize people and that changes faster than society and culture changes so that we can find new ways to humanize include and facilitate the happy and dignified lives of people that we once dehumanized yes that's you said it perfectly eloquently I didn't qualify that um I mean I I want to move on to I guess you know if we think about race the social construction as being the interaction of cultural political economic priorities with what you can see these inherited characteristics which are relatively arbitrary in terms
(1:12:39) of how we chose them hair eye skin um in 200 years time um accounting for the kinds of Democrats demographic changes here in the global North but also historic uh movements of people across borders how how might you think that the language of race could change it's a question it's a great question it's one that I ask my students so I frame it in a slightly different way which is to say that um is there an alternative version of History where instead of discovering and measuring physical characteristics like
(1:13:16) skin color or you know skull size or shape imagine that in the 16th century we discovered genetics before Colonial expansion we had a really robust understanding of biological diversity by the true metric of human similarity indifference which is in our DNA how would Society look today three thousand words on my desk on one day please have you heard about the disappearing donkey no have you never heard of The Disappearing donkey no okay um so this was a 1976 household survey conducted by the Brazilian Institute of
(1:13:50) geography and statistics and what they did was they invited every householder sent the survey to to describe their own skin color so rather than ticking a box which said white or mixed or black they invited people to self-identify so you they ended up with hundreds of words phrases ways of identifying yourself which included my Portuguese pronunciation is horrible by the way tostada which means toasted um cardale which is a flower and it's like a blue violet color that you find on thistles so somebody is going well my
(1:14:28) Skin's kind of this blue violet color and uh burro cuando fog I believe which means the disappearing donkey which is a humorous way of going I'm this kind of tan color which melts into nothing I'm a disappearing donkey and I just thought that this was such a wonderful example of when you invite people to describe themselves and of course many people did just describe themselves as black or mestizo or white Galician um lots of people did opt for that but when you had this expansion of going tell me what you think about your own
(1:15:02) skin color there was almost infinite variety yeah that's great I need to adopt that it says the self-identification and weirdly let many of the studies show that the self-identification of race race or ethnicity tally quite well with the clustering with the genetic clustering and racists often use our scientific pseudoscientific races often say yes but you say race is a social construct but look everyone from Africa describes themselves as black um and it it's a superficial it's a sort of meaningless superficial analysis
(1:15:36) because what it doesn't extract the social history of these terms which are culturally normalized when talking about race I think it's a really interesting conversation about the language itself so and and the recognition that it changes over time of course I grew up being called half cast I didn't really think much about it it's a it's not a great phrase really is it and it's because the economy is half formed it's like yeah right done yeah yeah I'm not half of anything thanks mate
(1:16:07) um and and that's that's turned into biracial or mixed Heritage and I I don't I sort of you know we talked about taxonomy and classification I kind of don't care um but um the the the way those classifications change over time when how tall you with a racist came out and I was doing a lot of talks remember a particular occasion two talks on consecutive nights where a young black woman on the first night said I want to reclaim the word black and I want to be a powerful black woman because of the cultural history of being
(1:16:42) identified as black I recognize the things you're saying as being this is the social history of this word um but that's what I that that's what I want the next night a young black woman said why do people call us black I'm not black my skin color isn't black it's universally associated with negative characteristics I mean and they sort of come out of that going okay right now I don't know what to say but that's okay because you change with time and you contextualize those things
(1:17:12) we laugh at our parents or parents in society who can't haven't quite managed to adapt to the way to the way young people talk today um I'm including you in that category but not me um and you know sometimes we pillory them and with social media we we can be extremely mean about those those those in fractions sometimes it's fair sometimes it's not fair um but the recognition that culture changes and words change and they're never fixed in time and they're very personal is part of the social
(1:17:47) construction of race and understanding the social economic historical ancestral familial all of those those words for the social construction of race another error that I think anti-racists make sometimes is to say that race doesn't exist because it clearly does exist right the money doesn't exist either exactly and time is a social construct wait what time his time is you know I was 15 minutes late for this interview but that's only because we decided what time it was going to be why are scientists studying
(1:18:19) it all the time time ah be the year isn't even a fixed thing I mean we have leap years because the orbit of the Earth the history of time is Super fascinating because that you know we base it on the orbit of the Earth around the sun with the assumption that that is fixed back when they were renting clocks they tried water clocks exhibition about the water clock so it was like a drip drip yeah yeah they're not reliable enough candles was another attempt sundials absolutely hopeless because the orbit is not it's not
(1:18:50) circular it's elliptical and it changes through time so a 24-hour day is the same throughout the course of a year because that's what we decide is the length of a day but it but a day in February is about 15 minutes shorter than a day in September see this is why they used to hang scientists as witches no more for bringing it back it's an even better story than that I'll do quickly because it's not the basis of our conversation today but um we used to use the the Julian calendar um so before the Julian calendar was
(1:19:25) formalized and I think this really the year seven um it was the the year was basically 200 and 270 odd days and they just add a few in or take a few away so that the solstice aligns with so that the season's aligned with when someone's in the eyes in the sky and that didn't really work because they were just making it up so Julian comes along and recognizes that the the orbit around the Earth is 365 and a quarter days yes which means that you have to have a leap year to account for it but it's not it's
(1:19:57) 365.24 for something something something so it's slightly less than a quarter this was recognized in the 16th century by Pope Gregory I I don't know whether it was him who recognized it but we call it the Gregorian super Nerdy with his tables so by the just like you know um you know your Holiness there are Heretics at the door he's like wait a minute yeah I don't know I don't know whether it was him precisely but anyway the point was that the in the Years between the Juliet foundation of the Julian calendar and
(1:20:32) the October I think it's 1589 someone will writing and correct um there was 10 days there were 10 days out so with a Papal decree that only popes can do the day after the 4th of October was the 15th of October they just those days do not exist and that's the calendar that we use so time is just it's a social concept I mean I did always like that um revolutionary France tried to implement their own calendar you know Pi is the ratio between the the circumference of a circle and it's I remember that one okay so it's 3.14 blah
(1:21:08) blah blah um one of the states and I forget which one proposed legislation that just to make things easier they just make it 22 over 7 which is which is not pi so it means that all circles are just different shapes it's just another great example of people going yeah reality is quite complicated and requires I need to concentrate on this it I want to do something else I'm just gonna make it a different number I mean returning to the Michael K Williams thing for a second um because when I came across this video
(1:21:43) of his very emotional um reaction to his ancestry data I was reading at the same time a paper biomedical Anthropologist which talked about the particular way in which DNA has a cultural power within the African-American community and she argues two things is that one you have the trauma of slavery the collective intergenerational trauma of slavery and then the second thing is you know how do I as a layperson encounter DNA it's mostly through watching true crime procedurals in which DNA is almost like a revelation from the
(1:22:24) heavens like the voice from the burning bush like it was him who did it and when you look at the role that DNA has played in the criminal justice system both in convicting and exonerating and you think about how racism pulls African-American people into the criminal justice system DNA has um you know this this obscene power and status and then that is then superimposed on questions of identity and belonging um in your own work have you encountered fetishization of of DNA um and and how did you encounter it if so well all the time is is the simple
(1:23:00) answer because it's the same model again it's a new you know we've only had DNA was first described in the late 19th century but it wasn't really it didn't really become part of the biological framework that we now recognize until the middle of the 20th century and then the work of cricket Watson and Rosalind Franklin in 1953 one of the great discoveries of of in the history of science the only Trio to ever better than was the sugar babes I believe uh yeah I don't know enough about the sugar
(1:23:30) babes to answer that Watson is a monster he's a horrible man a deeply misogynistic racist and he's very near the end of his life um and maintains a deep racism see I don't think that Heidi was a horrible racist but I could be wrong yeah never meet Heroes um so I don't know who was in the sugar babes to be honest you're like I'm gonna laugh um so quick once Watson and uh okay so as soon as we've got them the molecule of inheritance that's why it's such a big deal 53 because all of a
(1:24:09) sudden we've got you know we've got natural selection is is worked out in 1859 we've got um understanding Evolution and the basics of biology emerging in the beginning of the 20th century in in the Years up to 53 and then all of a sudden with the double helix we've got the actual way in which information is passed from generation to generation and not just in us but in every living thing that has ever existed for the last 3.
(1:24:36) 9 billion years pretty cool right but as soon as that happens you see the same thing again you see the same thing you see over and over again which is the adoption of this thing as the answer it's now we now have the biological mechanism which means that you know if the eugenesis has got a hold of this a few years earlier that would have been the thing they focused on in fact what the American eugenesis not so much in the UK or in Germany what the American eugenesis focused on was mendelian inheritance so the pea plants done by
(1:25:08) Gregor Mendel so which set up the rules he was the gardening monk exactly um Moravian Friar August I only learned that in the last book there's a difference between a friar and a monk and for the last 30 years I've been describing as a monk he was a friar Friars have long poles and they fight with Robin Hood talk yeah they're wondering I think is what part of okay they're not associated with a monastery people will write it and correcting um but he came around his rules the eye color rules they come around at exactly
(1:25:42) the right time for the eugenesis as well they're not wrong they are the basis of of genetic inheritance but it was they were immediately leapt upon by the American eugenesis saying well now we've got a mechanism we've got genes we don't know what the Gene's made of that comes in 53 but we've got genes which explains eye color hair color seafaringness sex worker status you know all sorts of disabilities and abilities um and and so you immediately see a 1900 the fetishization of this new part of of
(1:26:18) genetics um the legacy of that is really profound just I know we're talking about DNA we'll come back to that I'm sure with recent studies and these are things only done in the last couple of years have indicated they suggest that if we teach genetics using Mendel first so you start probably like you did I'm guessing certainly what I like I did um then the people who come out of that curriculum end up with a far more um racially essentialist view of humans than if you start with complexity so in
(1:26:56) America they've done a few small studies we've done them here but this is a big part of my work at the moment where you take one cohort of students and you teach them Mendel and genetics you take another cohort students and you teach them complexity and human variation and the rest of genetics including Mendel but you just do it in different direct different order they have the same curriculum but in a different order group one who get taught Mendel end up basically more racist than group two starting with complexity is something
(1:27:23) which I find really interesting I wonder if there's any overlap between that and you'll work as part of the president of humanists UK um one of the things I've been kind of interested in is the way in which humanism and Atheism has changed over the last few decades um going from something which I thought was profoundly intellectually curious and I was really drawn onto to something which had its own rigidity and drive certainty you mean the education community and sort of Skeptics Community oh yeah I mean you know I remember when
(1:27:54) I first read The God Delusion when I was 17 and I was like everyone who's ever had a faith is stupid and now I'm 30 and I think very differently about these things and I think about um the need for Faith I think about the experience of community I think about politics and faith very different do you sometimes encounter even amongst people who have a commitment to reason and to science that there are these kind of uh unshakable rigid you know an iron grip on certainty in what they think they know that you find difficult to deal
(1:28:28) with well yes I do think that and I think that they tend to come from the not necessarily the scientific world but they come with us with a scientific and rational bent in general um but I often find that and this is again something that has really I've sort of really begun to understood as I've got older because I think you know 20 something year old men who are who are not religious it is mostly men um and they read a bit of Dawkins and go you know I can I get on board with this this is a powerful argument and it
(1:29:05) reinforces all of my cultural packages and stereotypes about how ridiculous religions are and I've definitely been part of that in the past because religions are quite silly in in in so many ways um but in saying that you're also denying the importance of cultural and social importance and historical um importance which is centuries deep and we don't J we aren't purely rational beasts at all I also think that when that new atheist movement emerged in the sort of early 2000s it was deeply unscholarly
(1:29:43) I mean there's a whole huge Leviathan body of work trying to understand religion theology Christianity there's probably been more academically written about the history of creating of Christianity than most subjects I guess and people like Dawkins said theology is a stupid subject it's ridiculous I'm not even going to entertain the notion that this is a real academic field which is an absurd thing to say you don't have to be a Christian to be a theologian context of that though almost all theological theologians are Christians
(1:30:21) so that is a problem that's an academic problem they my friend Francesca stavrikapulu is one of the only um biblical Scholars who who is vocally not a Christian not like I'm sure that's I'm sure there are many of them but but I I love her and her work for that reason but you know Dawkins is a figurehead in that movement that book is terrible he's written some of the most important books in biology in history the selfish Gene um the extended phenotype and the blind watchmaker are foundational
(1:30:56) um but his knowledge of Theology and Christianity is sort of year 12. I mean why do you think so many of the new atheist movement seem to go all in on islamophobia I mean Richard Dawkins is someone who will say you know I can recognize the beauty of even song you know the church bell is wonderful but the call to prayer horrible noisy disgusting and somebody who um defines themselves by skepticism and interrogation from the basis of skeptical seems so incurious about how he makes his own cultural value judgments and that's something which is
(1:31:35) you know shared by Sam Harris we're like why are there so many of them um I think it was an interesting time so it's just it was post 911 so there was a lot of um sort of cultural antipathy that was directed towards um Muslims uh I also think it was a time when creationism was a big conversation and in this country it's largely gone away so there's a lot my entry into becoming a media person was via creationism because there was a time when in the early days of the internet when this was the hot button topic and you know the
(1:32:11) the I was one of the first writers on common is free um the that which is the Guardians blog which would have been Seamus Milne who had a studio no it was um Georgina Henry um who who died a few years ago and the pitching process so often students ask me how did you get into into being a writer of being in the media the pitching process was me emailing her and saying can I write something on this and her saying yes and that was it because the competition was it was a completely different world back then so in those
(1:32:43) early days it I haven't read them in years and I if I think if I did read them now I think I'd slightly cringe um I don't think they're wrong never read your old workers ironclad's Lord which I live by but but you know a slightly sneery tone it's easy to mock things that have little value um and mocking creationism biblical creationism was an easy thing to do so I think at that time the the cultural milieu was such that people like me coming from a scientific evolutionary genetics background
(1:33:19) suddenly had this massive easy targets that we could just fling stuff at and and become successful writers now I write for like Aria now age 25. um which which was very exciting and then you know it's formalized in dawkins's book which which I just don't think is very good at all and I reckon I began to recognize that a problem with this conversation is that it all had been written already in the 20th century by people who had had more interest in in the scholarship so um you know people like Birch and
(1:33:55) Russell and and AJ air and and some of the foundational you know philosophers of of humanism I always think about Big Daddy Carl you know so he says religion religion is the opiate of the people that's the bit everyone quotes and they forget which I thought you meant Young no no no oh my God that's the psychologist's son right there I mean I always go back to big teddy Carl right religion is the opiate of the masses everyone quotes that and what they forget is that he followed up with it is the heart and the heartless world
(1:34:26) which is extraordinarily empathetic sure well I I don't know whether it's I come from a Catholic Family um and uh we have actually stopped going to church recently um because the priests that I was raised with died um but it was it was just a simple recognition of things that I think it's a good example of how different the public discourse from public Behavior actually is because the discourse was this is in you know these are insane people why would you do this transubstantiation is uh a mad thing to
(1:35:05) think is possibly real my my granny who is still alive and she used to be a three times a week Catholic and we would go at Christmas and Easter and significance uh events she didn't believe transubstantiation was real and she was perfectly okay with with um with contraception um as I think many Catholics are in the real world got a friend who wanted to be a nun until she discovered sex and drugs. I'm pretty sure she wasn't unique in that revelation she was like okay maybe I can't be a nun
(1:35:44) but I could be an actress who only plays the Virgin Mary and Sandy from Greece before she goes bad conversation about Greece yesterday with my daughter that is not an unproblematic film no it's a change for a man's love Yeah and um did she put up a fight wait you know how many times have adults our age and older I'm much older than you karaoke that I mean he's going hold on a minute that's not a good lot that's not a nice thing Line Is It Baby It's Cold Outside it's all about wearing down
(1:36:17) someone's no say what's in this drink ish yeah I think back to church for both of us I believe and for this conversation um so there's a gap between how people live and their ability to take on complexity and contradiction and where the discourse is at you're saying yeah yeah so just I mean it's interesting because I've never had this conversation about the history of that era and the people who emerged out of it and the toxicity of the culture that subsequently happened and that's that's interesting and I
(1:36:54) think we're only beginning to see that play out um in the last couple of years I mean maybe this could be a sort of a place to wrap up and this might be a weird final question there's an interesting tension here between everything you're telling me which is you don't want signs to be placed on this pedestal because when it is it's used to justify horrific crimes against humanity whether that's at the level of eugenics and racism or whether it's at the level of abuse of power and sexual
(1:37:26) assault and at the same time you're presenting yourself in mainstream media as a science communicator and there is an Associated status and Authority that comes with that I mean how do you balance these two things well I think that people I think that there is an assumption about what science is which is culturally reinforced that it is this truth-seeking um uh unerring device that we make continuous progress towards greater truths and I think there's there is a sort of foundational aspect to to science which
(1:37:59) is which which is it is it's not like history in the same in the sense that it's just one thing after other as the cliche goes things do progress in in science we build on the knowledge of our of our forebears not not always 100 successfully but I think one of the things I I've sort of evolved into being a science historian again you know I'm reluctant to say that because that is an academic field in itself and I'm not trained in that discipline um and I think scientists often make very bad historians for the reason is
(1:38:31) for the reason being that they tend not to treat the evidence of history with the same scrutiny that they treat the evidence that they are researching in their science and the move in academic history over the last I don't know 40 years away from The wiggish View away from the great man theory has not happened in science so we can still draw a perfect line from I don't know Aristotle to Stephen Hawking and it's with on the way with Newtons and faradays and Darwin's and occasionally a woman but mostly it's a
(1:39:05) very direct line and scientists have to be better at understanding the social context of of their work I which which is basically what I do there are there are caveats within that as well so when I say things like all science is political which feels like a very uncontroversial thing for me to say the pushback sometimes is immense and angry it's not the degrees of anger vary between Fields so it's easy for me to say the emergence of biology and emergence of genetics come out of the social uh and political ideologies of
(1:39:40) European expansion and Eugenics right those are factual things I do get pushed back from people from geneticists against that saying that's that's ridiculous the legacies of those the ideologies are still within our work today not because science is a special case but because science is part of society sometimes I get physicists saying if I'm looking at the planets if I'm looking at the transits of some tiny planet in a different galaxy and collecting data on that how is that political and I think they have a point
(1:40:13) which is it's not the same as the scientific framework for the Holocaust but it does deny it does deny that the reason that this guy is looking at looking at that the transit of the planet in a different galaxy has a social historical Financial economic ancestry to it that he doesn't have a right to do that someone made the decision that that guy could do that because that is part of society as well and our society is structurally biased I mean you said earlier that you're not really a genetic determinist are you a bit more of an
(1:40:49) economic determinist I don't know anything about economics it's way too complicated I mean like most economic determinists you know nothing about economics the Dismal science they call it it's a weird thing being a geneticist at this point in history because I spent almost all of my time talking about that that genetics is less important than you think um and it's not that it's not important I'm not a blank's latest that's a ridiculous position to take an anti-scientific position to take
(1:41:16) I'm it's it's complex and I know that's not good enough for people who want answers this evening we're publishing a paper um about the changing public perception of genetics during the covid era because it's a question that's been really important to to to science communicators and geneticists more broadly science was never had never has had bigger exposure than During the covid period there was you know there was a there was a point and you know March or April 2020 where everyone was talking about exponential
(1:41:50) growth and our numbers and then then it became conversations about the spike proteins and and um uh and then the vaccine developments and all those sorts of things and so these are all part of my you know General everyday conversations and all of a sudden that you've got the Prime Minister standing in front of a graph talking about exponential growth and it's all over the press and that you know a lot of people were like a bit sneery about that you know the Press has discovered exponential growth sure I'm I'm not like that it's science
(1:42:21) is difficult and and has expertise in it we it's not something you can dip in and out of but we wanted to ask the question did the public perception of genetics change as a result of this exposure and what we found is I think broadly positive which is that um people seem to think that coverage was good so genetics in a positive light before and that positive light was enhanced as a result of covid was that the same in America this is a British survey um so we don't know the answer to that question yet and then that's an
(1:43:01) important one we also saw though that the polls of support or antipathy towards science were increasingly polarized so the people who were most suspicious of science came out more suspicious positive thing I'm trying to work out how to talk about this because the paper's not actually out until seven o'clock this evening um and hopefully you know we'll be talking about it in the Press but I I think there's a disconnect between um what people generally think which is pretty trusting people generally trust
(1:43:42) science I don't necessarily think that we've we talk enough about the probabilistic nature of science um that's that the conditional nature of the results and that people looking to science for truth I'm not understanding what science is I think a good thing about the pandemic was we saw it live as it was happening we're working this out as we're going along um but what I do think we see as well is that polarization which has a lot to do with social media is that you have The Fringe suspicious
(1:44:15) with a louder voice than at any point in history and I none of us know how to deal with that I think we can enter thirds thank you so much for joining us today
