Transcript:
(00:00)  thank you Mary Rosalyn Pat for um making this possible for inviting me here and sticking up for me uh there was as everybody knows no shortage of pressure to cancel me to um besiege this organization to the point where certain facts could not be discussed in public um and you stuck up for a perspective that often isn't heard in Washington at least within uh Chambers and buildings controlled by the two parties I want to talk about all sorts I want there's so much to talk about and I don't have time I want to talk about
(00:51) what really happened on October 7th why October 7th happened why Gaza is in the situation it's in I want to talk about anti-Semitism I also o want to talk about Ukraine and what's happening there there just isn't time what I really want to talk about is the Democrats I mean I think that's the appropriate thing to discuss here because there is a crisis in the Democratic party and everybody knows it no matter what you think about Israel Palestine um and you're going to hear my perspective on it why it's happening and
(01:23) who the problem is um I I wanted just to tell you a little bit more about myself apart from the that you heard I am the only person in America who was condemned by both major candidates in 2016 Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton's campaign both condemned me for my  yes huge badge of honor David fredman the reciprocal ambassador to Israel and the US under Donald Trump can't really tell which country he represented condemn me as the biggest anti-semite in the world and uh Hillary Clinton also condemned me uh in a statement written
(02:06) by Jake Sullivan who is now National Security Council director so I'm very proud of that distinction um it's and it's for the work that I've been doing for all these years inside Palestine inside occupied Palestine inside Israeli controlled territory producing several books a documentary with Dan Cohen killing Gaza my book Goliath which is really a profile of Israeli Society spending off and on five years there really seeing from within Jewish Israeli Society how it was all building up to this moment how that
(02:48) Society was being primed for a genocide and my book The 51 day war about the assault on Gaza that killed 2200 people just left 100,000 people homeless 35,000 artillery shells piled onto Gaza 40,000 tank shells all supplied by Barack Obama that really set the stage for what we're experiencing now and so I saw this coming and now all of you know 30,000 are officially dead in Gaza since October 7th 177,000 children orphaned over 80,000 injured these are just official conservative statistics the conservative number is that 2% of the population of
(03:31) Gaza has been killed that's conservative they've the health Ministry in Gaza because the entire health system has been put out of service the head of alifa hospital because he refused to allow Israeli soldiers to attack his hospital is now being tortured in an Israeli prison Muhammad aliman they can't keep the numbers so we don't know how many people are trapped under the rubble we know people are now Starving in Northern Gaza Israel dropped flyers on Northern Gaza today saying have a happy Ramadan and don't forget to feed
(04:02) the needy an act of psychological warfare to torture people who are being deliberately starved and 15 children yesterday starved to death at Kamal adwan hospital I can go on and on with the statistics we're in Washington I was talking just an hour ago to a journalist in Northern Gaza named Muhammad Salam he sent me photographs of his I wanted to hear about the humanitarian situation and he sent me photographs of his two daughters who had just been killed his teenage daughters and his son who's lost his
(04:38) foot he was badly burned in an Israeli assault and I've been following the Twitter account of our colleague in Gaza in Northern Gaza a journalist like me Matas dalul who has been going out every day to try to get a bag of flow for his family because his family has been starving like all of his neighbors his elderly neighbor re died last week of dehydration and he's been witnessing the attacks by the Israelis on the aid convoys and on the day I believe it was last week when he finally secured a bag of flour for his
(05:14) hungry kids he came home to see that Israel had attacked his home killed his daughter killed his pregnant wife and wounded his son who survived these are our colleagues my colleague and friend rat who I met in 2013 a poet a professor of English at Islamic University was one of my heroes and I was following his Twitter account avidly throughout this assault on Gaza rat was the first professor at Islamic University a University founded by Hamas to teach Hebrew literature he also taught The Merchant of Venice and
(05:59) encouraged Ed his students to sympathize not with aell the morish general but with the persecuted Jew who had to compromise his dignity in order to survive in an anti-semitic society and his students said that they as Palestinians identified with the Jew rifat brought anti-zionist Jews to his class and told them I used to be an anti-semite until I met these Jews in America who were organizing against our occupation and our oppression now I see things differently the issue is Zionism and he taught his students to resist by
(06:40) not being extremists but by being intellectuals and succeeding inside Gaza inside this open air prison rifat was hunted down by the Israeli authorities his direct messages on Twitter were filling with threats from active duty Israeli soldiers planning pledging to kill him and his family in December he fled from a shelter with his family after being receiving a phone call from the Israeli military telling him that they planned to bomb his location that they had tracked him on his cell phone and went home to his sister's house
(07:18) where they attacked his home with a missile and killed him and his entire family his last tweet rat's last tweet was the Democratic party and Biden are responsible for the Gaza genocide committed by  Israel today in the Democratic party figures Like Jesse Jackson Who expressed sympathy for Palestinians who attempted to open lines of freelance diplomacy with the PLO which the US government eventually did who also helped get American hostages released from Syria through his con ctions with all of these governments
(08:01) that were declared Rogue by the US state department or George ball assistant Secretary of State who would challenge LBJ on his Vietnam War policy day after day who authored the book passionate a passionate attachment about America's de um destructive special relationship with Israel even Jack Kennedy even Jack Kennedy who called for Jerusalem to be an international city under the management of the UN and who in one of his final speeches at the American University warned of the consequences of a cold war and urged his
(08:38) constituents to put themselves in the shoes of the people of Russia the people of the Soviet Union they wouldn't be welcome in today's Democratic party I'm not welcome I might be welcome by you but I'm not welcomed by the party the people who decide who gets elected the party is run by what I would call they're not by anti-war democrats or Progressive Democrats but by genocide Democrats they might play pay lip service to Black lives matter claim to support women's or children's rights
(09:14) Hillary Clinton said she's a major advocate of children's rights they say they oppose Christian Nation nationalism and religious nationalism at home but when APAC comes calling they sacrifice all of those principles and they bow to a parthe let's look at Biden himself this Joe Biden is the largest recipient of Israel Lobby money of any active us politician he's received over $1 million throughout his career he identifies himself as a Christian or Gentile Zionist he said in a floor speech in the Senate that if
(09:49) Israel did not exist it would have to be invented we would have to invented way we kind of did in 1982 Joe Biden shocked the hard line ludik prime minister minim Bean during a closed session of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when Bean had just invaded Lebanon all the Senators on the committee were badgering beg and declaring how could you do this you're destabilizing the Middle East and Biden was the Lone Senator to support him but he actually shocked Bean when he said I would go even further than you I would
(10:22) be willing to kill women and children that's AC according to a new book by Alex B Ward called the internationalists and this incident was described by none other than Bean himself nothing could display the control that Israel's regime and its lobbying apparatus has over Joe Biden then the pathetic and hypocritical scene of the US military dropping a few Parcels of aid over the Gaza Strip where people are starving with barely enough food food for a block of people to survive on while they are funneling
(11:04) thousands and thousands of tank shells and 155 millimeter howitzers directly through the air Bridge established by Biden 2 Israel no they're not allowed they're not allowed to deliver Aid directly to Gaza they're not allowed to bring naval ships there this superpower the most powerful country in the history of the world is not allowed to bring Aid to end Hunger usaid Chief Samantha power the guru of the r2p responsibility to protect anti-genocide industry has become a genocide Democrat as usaid director and her staff is an
(11:46) open revolt against her covering up the killing of a usaid contractor by Israel in Gaza Samantha power attacked slammed Clinton administration officials including the current including suan rice for their failure to speak up and do something about the Rwanda genocide what is she doing as people starve as 570,000 people are on the brink of famine in Gaza according to the United Nations where is she she's posing for photo ops in Jordan with Aid that she admits on her Twitter account will never see its way into the Gaza
(12:23) Strip and she will not quit her position she will not speak up she will not publicly attack her boss she is a hypocrite they could end the they could end it right now they could end this they could end this starvation this famine right now if they wanted all Joe Biden has to do is make a phone call to Netanyahu he's been on the phone with him every day he's so frustrated they're always leaking all these conversations oh Netanyahu won't do what we want by the way we're sending more weapons all
(12:55) you have to do is say no more spare parts for the f-16s that are bombing all those multif family family story uh apartment blocks in Gaza that have destroyed 85% of all residential buildings in the Gaza Strip no more parts no more howitzers time to negotiate and by the way once we have a ceasefire the hostages will all come out and they can all be on the White House lawn in a big ceremony with you and Tony blinkin can get the Accolade he deserves for getting the hostages out why don't they do it they can't do it because
(13:28) Biden wants to run for reelection Biden is Mr APAC Joe Biden instead of listening and responding to the voices of the 100,000 people who voted uncommitted in Michigan went to the home of Heim Saban a Zionist billionaire Hollywood Mogul who said that I'm a one issue guy and my issue is Israel himim Saban hosted a $250,000 ahead fundraiser for Biden helping Biden raise a record total of $42 million in January Alone co-hosted by pro-israel Hollywood Mogul Casey waserman and that's why the aid isn't getting in that's why Biden will not
(14:17) counter Netanyahu and the most right-wing fanatically religious nationalist anti-palestinian coalition government in Israeli history this isn't just limited to buy Bill and Hillary Clinton remember them they earned 3.5 million by 2016 in paid speeches by Israel Lobby groups that's along with $53 million in lecture fees from companies and organizations affiliated with the financial industry after leaving office CL Clinton promptly blamed yaser Arafat for the failure of negotiations explicitly violating a
(14:59) promise he made to Arafat in order to get Arafat to the negotiating table at Camp David the former President Clinton thus reinforced then Israeli Prime Minister ahud Barack who Moved more settlements into the West Bank more settlers than any other prime minister his Infamous talking point that there was no partner for peace then in the summer of 20 2002 the Vietnam draft Dodger Bill Clinton declared at at the Toronto chapter of the pro-israel group hadasa World Zionist organization this is what Bill Clinton said if Iraq came across the
(15:37) Jordan River I would grab a rifle and get in the trench and fight and die for Israel and he earned wild Applause with this line at the $1,000 a plate dinner Bill Clinton earned $125,000 for that speech Hillary Clinton one of the largest recipients as a senator of donations from APAC has slammed proposals for a ceasefire in Gaza repeatedly supported Israel's Camp military campaign in Gaza consistent with her passion for regime change Wars it was Hillary Clinton under the watch of Barack Obama who helped destroy Libya
(16:20) assassinating its leader sending weapons to Al-Qaeda Allied proxies like the Libyan Islamic fighting group flooding Libya with weapons leading to the rise of Isis Isis control over several cities in Syria the destabilization of the entire saho region and the return of Slavery to the African continent as the late Libyan leader mamar Gaddafi warned today Libya is a despotic hellhole in crisis thanks to that military intervention and the destabilization continues Hillary Clinton called to bomb Syria in 2016 she also called for conf directly
(17:01) confronting Russian aircraft going to war with Russia over Syria in 2016 becoming the Air Force for Al-Qaeda the forces that the US was arming on the ground there to overthrow the Syrian government and of course she spread the lies about wmd in Iraq and her notorious senate floor speech supporting the war on Iraq where are the women and children's rights that she stood for for her life when it comes to women in Gaza who now have nowhere to even have their periods have their children whose children are being exterminated Before Their Eyes
(17:37) where are the children's rights children have nowhere to hide in Gaza the hypocrisy is stunning as it was with Barack Obama who was himself a recipient of hundreds of thousands of dollars of money from APAC by the time he was elected president after spending just a short time in the Senate I remember when Barack Obama was an elect did before he was inaugurated that's when Israel chose to launch the beginning of its succession of devastating assaults on Gaza operation castled which left over 1,400 dead 40,000 homes destroyed
(18:14) and 100,000 homeless and Obama said nothing about operation castled and when he was inaugurated he sent the GBU bunker Buster bombs the 2,000lb bombs the howitzers the tank shells Barack Obama presided over the Grizzlies assaults on Gaza up until this point operation pillar defense pillar of Defense over 150 killed 300 homes destroyed 1,700 left homeless operation protective Edge which I covered from the inside of Gaza I saw it I witnessed the destruction I sat with those whose families were slaughtered I sat in their
(18:50) destroyed homes 2200 killed 177,000 families left homeless families not people 35,000 artillery shells of different types fired on Gaza after being delivered by the Obama Administration and 14,500 tank shells what's Obama doing now has he said anything about this is he speaking out like Jimmy Carter so bravely did is he even like building homes for the homeless like Jimmy Carter did no his life is one giant luxury vacation he's one one week he's at a spring team concert Michelle's playing tambourine
(19:26) the next week he's having Splash fights with billionaire Richard Branson at his private Mansion he's raking in the multi-million dollar speaking fees from the big Banks as the clintons did and he like the clintons and like Joe Biden's largest single donor was Heim Saban the one issue guy whose issue is Israel who controls Biden's foreign policy is it Biden do you feel like he's in charge do you feel like he's I don't know the independent solicitor from the justice department said he wasn't really
(20:00) in charge enough to know about his own son's dealings with barisma so I wonder if he actually is capable of standing up to a cunning figure like Netanyahu Tony blinken's The Man In Charge Tony blinkin is not just the Secretary of State he's a veteran Democratic operative who forfeited all diplomatic leverage that the United States might have had over Israel in this conflict when he announced on his first trip to is that he was there quote as a Jew can you imagine a Muslim secret Diplomat from the US going to a country
(20:37) like Pakistan and declaring he's there as a Muslim what would happen to him or her would be a disaster but Tony blinkin has been using this language throughout his career in order to get himself to where he is Tony blinkin comes from Israel Lobby royalty his grandfather Nathan authored an influential study in the 1930s on the feasibility of Zionist colonization of Palestine those were the words the language he used in his study uh he he sponsored the study Tony blinken's father-in-law the man who raised him was Samuel pisar who
(21:18) was himself a kind of pro-israel fixer for franois Mand in France and he was the conary for Robert Maxwell a mosad agent who you all probably know well Robert Maxwell's last call before he infam notoriously fell or mysteriously fell off his yacht in the Mediterranean was to Tony blinken's father-in-law Samuel pisar Robert Maxwell was given a defacto state burial in Israel and his daughter gillain Maxwell earned infamy as Jeffrey Epstein's wingwoman Jeffrey Epstein another person with uh unsavory ties likely unsavory ties to
(22:03) Israeli intelligence at a 207 APAC meeting Tony blinkin declared that he inherited his quote commitment to Israel's strength through his family and this has been the language and politics that he's used to climb the ladder in the Beltway right now there's a major there is a protest encampment outside Tony blinken's home it's a 247 protest encampment they're there rain or shine I visited them two days ago it muddy they were there in the mud one of the women is a Palestinian refugee uh who actually
(22:39) experienced the nakba in 1948 and they protest every anytime blink's motorcade goes in or out demanding a ceasefire all they want is a ceasefire and then they will leave and they're outside a big mansion I mean it's a he lives across the street from a home that was purchased by an LLC for $40 million just to give you an idea of the wealth in Tony blinken's bank account where did it come from came from in many ways a a company called West exec advisors where the Obama foreign policy team cooled their heels during
(23:18) the Trump Administration West exec advisor markets itself as a boutique consulting firm and what they do is they help shepher deals hump in deals for the arms industry for spy Tech firms Jen saki who's now an MSNBC host former press secretary she was she got a deal through West exec to consult for an Israeli spy tech company and they would use their connections to make money for the arms industry the spying industry the same industries that are cashing in on the assault on Gaza and the Ukraine proxy war which Tony blink Lincoln and his
(23:59) team are supporting then you have Victoria nuland well before I get to Victoria nuland there's someone I've had Direct encounters with Matthew Miller at the state department he's the guy who's basically up there defending the Gaza policy of the Biden Administration which is to drop a few packages of Aid in with one hand and drop thousands of bombs with the other to put it crudely Matthew Miller is the former spokesman for Robert Menendez who along with is right behind Joe Biden as a historically top
(24:29) recipient of APAC money because he was the chair and ranking chair on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in fact Bob menendez's legal defense during his first corruption trial when he got off was funded by pro-israel donors now Bob Menendez is going to jail for taking literal gold bars in his pockets from Egyptian lobbyists um the pro-israel lobbyists were more elegant about it um Victoria nuland has just resigned she was Tony blinken's underling assistant Secretary of State she's the former Chief of Staff
(25:05) to the great Democratic party hero Dick Cheney what yeah she served in Republican Democratic Administration she is a arch neoconservative whose husband Robert Kagan wrote the benevolent hegemony Essay with Bill Crystal who is now supporting the genocide Democrats through his various front organizations which called for the United States to act as a benevolent dictator and take out Rogue governments across the world Paving the path for the invasion of Iraq with its eyes on Iran Victoria newand just resigned leaving behind a legacy of the
(25:45) architect of the 2014 coup which removed an elected president in Kiev and installed a us and nato-backed government Paving the Primrose path as John Mir shimer put it to war with Russia Victoria nand was infamously or famously recorded in a leaked recording deciding who would come into power after the Ukrainian government was removed in a color Revolution give yats the attaboy she said about billionaire arsenia yatsenuk and we'll keep klitsch on the outside referring to Vitali Klitschko who's now mayor of Kiev she essentially
(26:24) controlled what happened in Ukraine after she handed out cookies in the maidon square with the US ambassador Jeffrey Pat to protesters who wanted a better Ukraine and riers I'm being told this is time well I'm going to go two minutes over time and just talk about Congressional leadership a little bit because um we have a historic person in Congress Hakeem Jeff the first black Congressional minority leader to Bow before an apartheid state uh Hakeem Jeff is also one of of the top recipients of APAC money he's
(27:00) the son of a black radical named Leonard Jeff in 1992 Hakeem Jeff published an oped for his College Newspaper denouncing Clarence Thomas and Coen Powell as quote house Negroes and token blacks propped up by racist affluent elements hey none of us I don't think any of us would argue with that he even quoted Augusto sandino the Nicaraguan Guerilla leader who resisted the US Marine invasion of his country to paint the US Military as the policemen of Wall Street Bankers fully agree with old Hakeem Jeff but 30 years later Hakeem
(27:37) jeffri in a speech before a pro-israel organization unwittingly but appropriately channeled the segregationist former Alabama Governor George Wallace declaring Israel today Israel tomorrow Israel forever did he know he was quoting Wallace's most infamous statement Clarence Thomas and hakee Jeff are different but who's more dangerous Clarence Thomas Revels in Liberal America's contempt he likes being called a house negro by democrats he hates them but Jeff he mimics the rhetorical techniques of Jesse Jackson
(28:17) and caters aggressively to the social concerns of the democratic part's donor class not the Grassroots and in this way he and many of his colleagues are arguably more effective than Clarence Thomas in serving what Hakeem Jeff once described as an elite business class through the promotion of multinational corporations and the military complex and look at what APAC will do to Black members of Congress and black politicians who don't to tow their line they will destroy them like they destroyed Nina Turner in Ohio look at
(28:51) what they tried to do to Donna Edwards here right out in Prince George's County because she simply called for a Palestinian State look at what they planned to do to Jamal Bowman and ilhan Omar Nancy Pelosi was the predecessor of hakee Jeff she was protested at her home for her support for Israel's military assault on Gaza and refuse an objection to a ceasefire and what did she tell those protesters that they are controlled by Russia and that their headquarters is located in China this is not just tragic it's
(29:29) criminal and if South African lawyers who are prepare who have prepared a filing against many of these elected officials who are presiding over this genocide have their way they could go to trial these are the de genocide Democrats and if APAC has its way in this election cycle they will elect many many more of these kind of figures while crushing any iteration of anti-war politics in the Democratic party they are unveiling a $100 million War chest which will partly be spent through democrats for an pro-israel
(30:08) majority which has uh one of its leaders has condemned this event an Lewis and then what's and and what and what were we what are we left with are we left with a party worth supporting is there anything worth supporting there I see this event as part of a wider rebellion in the party Grassroots I see it in Michigan where 100,000 people voted uncommitted in Minnesota where 20% of all voters voted uncommitted in protest of the Gaza genocide in Los Angeles where Jewish voices for peace interrupted Adam schiff's Victory party took over Adam
(30:44) schiff's Victory party these are people who won't stand for the Democratic party being a party of genocide Democrats and and and and look at how they're being attacked they're being attacked for playing Purity politics for something Boutique no this is the moral issue of our time this is the Holocaust of our time this is the Trail of Tears of our time this is the middle passage of our time and what we are doing now to oppose it will be written in the annals of history and it will say everything about
(31:18) us you know what this has to continue into Chicago it has to continue into November as long as this assault continues and as long as these policies of supporting apartheid continue then they must feel the heat if like me you can't stand this you if if you stand with the starving the homeless the dispossessed in Gaza you must not let the genocide Democrats win thank  you  thank you all right so what we're going to do is we have questions from Members First and then we'll go back and forth if
(32:15) there are questions on the zoom the first question Max thank you is what policies would you advocate for the US to take toward Israel how can we achieve a two-state solution solution everybody can boycott Israeli products and cultural institutions as Palestinian Civil Society has been asking since 2005 or 2007 since the icj decision against the apartheid wall in and around the West Bank they can organize divestment drives on their campuses and their businesses this is something everyone can do to create pressure the
(32:52) same pressure that was put on aparti South Africa to make South Africa into a country that the world would welcome into the actual International Community but sanctions is something that only a government can do and what needs to happen is sanctions need to be imposed at the United Nations not unilaterally and the UN and I would call for the US to support those sanctions on Israel until it ends its system of apartheid and this is why and the it's not just the refusal of the US to do that it's the Diplomatic cover that we
(33:26) see the us providing alone on the UN Security Council the isolation that it has brought to Palestinians the opposition of the Obama Administration to even Palestinian Observer status at the UN this kind of treatment and abuse of Palestinians that denied the government in Gaza any diplomatic channels and led to October 7th which was rooted in political motivations and which led to bloodshed and awful events in order to establish diplomatic leverage the only thing a Palestinian group that is not allowed to be a government like Hamas
(34:08) has is the ability to take captives they showed it when they got gilad Shalit they was the first time they'd ever achieved any diplomatic leverage and they got over 10,000 prisoners out an Israeli soldier named gilad Shalit and he came out alive that's why October 7th happened so when you start pushing Israel you start removing the motivation for more October 7th the US thinks it can be solved the way they destroyed Libya the way they decimated Syria the way they are destroying countries across Latin America through a
(34:42) regime change operation and we know that that will fail and that Hamas will not be eradicated through this assault Thanks Max a member I asked this question this is sort of a combined question do you feel that Trump would be better at the issues in and problems you discussed um well that's the uh feeling of hopelessness and voicelessness that a lot of people in the Pro in the Grassroots who are mostly Progressive feel is that there is not an alternative within the other party Trump is just as much he's a he's a genocide Republican
(35:17) uh Jared Kushner his son-in-law is going to be back in the white house with a security clearance and we know where that will lead and we heard Trump's statement finish them finish them off which is the same thing Nikki Haley said about Gaza finish them there the these are like pole tested focus group tested phrases that work among the Republican Grassroots which is substantially populated by Christian zionists people who are passionate about Israel because it's the future Landing Pad of the Messiah um so I don't see any hope
(35:51) within the Republican party's leadership what I can say is there there things are changing among younger evangelic IAL uh they have actually organized actions in the West Bank called Christ at the checkpoint to protest Israel's occupation uh even younger Mormons are becoming sympathetic to Palestine look at all the polls so these Dynamics are going to ultimately shift politics but people feel like everything I mean Republicans feel like the 2020 election was rigged I think people feel feel that that there's just
(36:26) a general rigging it's not through um you know ballot boxes being stuffed miscounted it's through wealthy powerful pro-war elements dominating politics and everyone being voiceless Thanks Max uh this from another member are you going to vote in the election and how might you vote and how did Obama become such a friend of Israel after his speech in Cairo in his first term I'm gonna vote for Dr Shiva no I'm joking but um oh I figured a few people would get that I I I'm not going to discuss how I vote
(37:01) I don't endorse candidates I did a talk at uh bus boys and Poets in Tacoma Park with Jill Stein of the green party who's going to be on the ballot in more than 40 states she performed very well and you know that's that's some that's someone Biden's gonna have to pay attention to uh if he's gonna uphold this line on Gaza uh how did Obama there were like two questions how did Obama Obama the the die had already been pass with Obama and if you look back at his Cairo speech it was sort of an effort to try to mify
(37:35) and co-opt Arab public opinion in support of a larger agenda that wasn't going to play out with respect to Israel Palestine and which the Arab Spring kind of took off the table but it was to sort of establish I mean you look at what they've did in Egypt it's a big success for us diplomacy a country of 80 million people which was the PowerHouse not just of uh the you know Arab economies but also of Arab politics which was led by someone who supported Arab resistance was turned into a us protectorate run by
(38:13) a military that's totally dependent on us Aid through Camp David and Obama wanted to do the same thing with the Palestinians through the Palestinian Authority um and that's what Cairo is about it's about turning the Arab world into Jordan Egypt and look at what Egypt's look at the look at the crisis this helped create Egypt's building a wall on the southern border of Gaza so that starving desperate people cannot get out when Israel comes to assault them and they'll be stuck between a
(38:41) literal rock and a hard place these are Zoom questions yeah we have a question from somebody on Zoom who's asking of course war is horrible so why did the Palestinians initiate this war with their vicious attack on Israelis on October 7th well well they didn't what do you mean they didn't they didn't this war has been going on for 75 years Israel initiated it in 1948 by ethnically cleansing 750,000 people we must expel Arabs get out of here we must expel Arabs and take their places and are we all demat
(39:21) hereat leav I will never this is not aat okay um is the us we must expel Arabs and take their places and if we have to use force not to dispossess the Arabs of the netive and trans Jordan but to guarantee our own right to settle in those places then we have Force at our disposal David benan the first prime minister of Israel said that in 1937 and that's what they proceeded to do the people in Gaza this is what you need to understand the people in Gaza over 80% of them are refugees many of them are from a place
(40:06) called majdal ascalon in what is now Southern Israel in a city called ashalon and they were dragged from their homes and driven from their homes placed in prison camps barbwire prison camps and then dumped in trucks in 1950 into the Gaza Strip where they would be permanently warehoused and then Israel proceeded to move Arab Jewish refugees and Russians into ashalon to prevent them from ever coming back and pass laws to prevent Arabs Palestinians from being able to return to their homes 750,000 were ethnically cleansed for 18
(40:43) years the remaining Palestinians 100,000 were internally displaced inside Israel the remaining were put under military rule they were under military occupation until 1966 then in 1967 Israel violently in a war it initiated occupies Gaza occupies the West Bank occupies the Sinai Peninsula the Golan Heights in East Jerusalem and then invades Lebanon in 1982 attacking Palestinian refugees there puts Gaza Under Siege in 2005 no no one can get in or out without Israeli military permission we must kill and kill all day every day that's according
(41:23) to arnan sof Sofer an Israeli government consultant to help decide devise the siege of Gaza for years Israel would not allow certain chocolates and A2 paper into Gaza and then they began these brutal military assaults which they call mowing the lawn slaughtering a few people will leave Hamas intact but keep him a Les teach him a lesson and I talked to you about those assaults that took place on Gaza so this didn't come out of a vacuum this you're not going to be able to hold People Under Siege to cut them off from the world and then
(41:57) expect them to just play along that doesn't mean that I celebrate what happened on October 7th it should have never had to happen the reason it happened is because of the Israel Lobby here the genocide Democrats and the genocide Republicans who deny the Palestinians any right to have the right to have rights and it's the right to have rights that defines you as a citizen they're citizens of nothing and now we see what Israel really thinks of them really thinks of their children Gaza has become a graveyard for children according to un
(42:32) Secretary General Antonio gutterz so this didn't start on October 7th and it's not going to end when there's a ceasefire Max about Gaza what would Trump do if he were president and what would the Republicans have done if they were in control well I think it would be ra it would be similar Trump said you know Trump said that he would he would say that he wants to smash Gaza but I don't think he would do any be able to do anything different I don't think there's anything Biden has done that uh put exercised any us
(43:16) leverage Trump wouldn't either but what we do know about Donald Trump is that he went rogue in many ways and went off script there's a scpt that's handed to you when you come into the White House it's the script Biden has been reading from his entire career and Trump refused to follow it he first refused to follow it at the Republican Jewish Coalition of Sheldon Adon who works with Heim Saban he's I mean he's dead but his wife still runs his foundation they control the Republican Party through donations he
(43:46) was Trump's top donor before Adon was donating to Trump trump said at this meeting you guys are real estate you're in real estate you know how to make deals I think we can make a deal between Israel and Palestine and then they called Trump an anti-semite for saying that and then he signs on with the Adon agenda the Jared Kushner agenda the rest is history but Trump tried to broker peace on the Korean Peninsula that was a heroic act 80% of Koreans support peace while the Democratic party establishment
(44:19) attacked him and mocked him for doing that people want to have their families reunited there he sat down to discuss reducing intermediate ballistic missile stocks with Vladimir Putin and CNN published a story claiming that Putin handed him a soccer ball with a hidden mic inside to spy on the president and Rachel matow night after night said Trump was going to be impeached and arrested for his ties to Vladimir Putin this is how it was received this is how peacemaking and diplomacy was received so Trump when he comes back in is going
(44:50) to be under even more pressure than he was before to read from the Beltway script and I don't know why anyone was laughing about peace in Korea because anyone in Korea except for a few Fanatics in the South wants to see the peninsula United and wants to end this war which was itself a US genocide a US genocide in which the North Korean population lost 20% of their population Curtis lame who was in charge of the aerial bombardment operation that leveled pany Yang to the ground said if we had lost the war we
(45:25) would have been all tried as War criminals Max this is our last question it's okay it is 7 o'clock but thank you very much thank you so much thank  you thank  you okay
