Bill Mitchell: The case for full employment and the end of austerity economics
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHSIUtudHTc)

## Transcript:
um okay so i think
um i think we're all uh good to go
that's the uh housekeeping out of the
way
um what i'd like to do is welcome
everyone to this
uh session um this has been organized by
the
fabians and uh co-organized by uh an
economics group that i'm
involved with region one um economics
group
um i'm certainly extremely pleased to
have
uh bill uh join us
i'll give you a little bit of background
about bill very shortly uh this sort of
uh continues a series of zoom meetups
over sound three or four months
and i can't guess uh in particular uh
covering
you know new economic ideas that are out
there we've been looking at things like
the green new deal and a lot of the
things that have come out of that
including uh the job guarantee
um uh also known as real full employment
as opposed to the phony full
employment that we've been hoodwinked
into accepting over the past uh
recent decades um
and uh and obviously how to use this uh
covert 19 response to build a better and
fairer and greener
economy and society and to that effect i
think it would be fair to say that our
speaker
professor bill mitchell has probably
been
at this for um you know decades rather
than years or months
his entire career really i think has
been sort of focused on
exactly the issues that are now front
and center
of the debate um
bill is professor of economics
and director of the center of full
employment and equity
at the university of newcastle
his seminal work on job guarantee
schemes has attracted
international attention and application
and as many of you know
bill is one of the founders of modern
monetary theory
uh which is causing a major rethink
of many of economics core principles so
we're especially pleased to have bill
with us today his recent books include
reclaiming the state a progressive
vision of sovereignty for a
post-neo-liberal world
and macroeconomics a textbook that
finally
is available to i think first-year
economics students that gives a
much better perspective on economics
um bill is going to speak for about 30
or 40 minutes
and we will then
open up to a general discussion
and questions uh and as i mentioned feel
free to use either the chat or to
raise your hand at the end of the
session so without further ado
um i'm going to hand over to bill i
think bill's got a
slideshow so we'll probably want to do a
present as a slideshare
um over to you bill okay well thanks
very much and um
thanks very much for giving up your
sunday afternoon it's a
lovely day on the east coast of
australia at the moment
very sunny i'm just looking at my office
window here and
i'm assured that it's a nice day over
there so thanks very much for
staying indoors and taking the time and
being committed to
advancing sort of education and
knowledge that
will help us hopefully alter the
political
debate somewhat so i'm just going to
share my screen and there's a few slides
i don't have

heaps of slides i'm presuming
i've just got to check this get this
slideshow working
just bear with me for a moment
what's happened there
so i want the slideshow and i want to
play it from the start
okay is it can everybody see that
can you see the slideshow
now
okay fine so what i want to briefly talk
about is some of the
ideas behind this concept of a paradigm
shift going on at the moment
and some specific aspects
so this is this is from a u.s
philosopher he's very famous
no simply no polite way of telling
people that they've dedicated their
lives to an illusion
and uh for most of us uh
we've been part of that illusion or the
fictional world that i talk about in
economics
and for many of us even though we're
well intentioned
we've made political choices based upon
living
that within that fictional world that's
been created
by mainstream economists
and the reason we've got to break out of
that fictional world
is because these things that i'm going
to talk about today are
are constants and very important in our
lives
uh a lot of people sort of turn their
nose up and say oh
economics for god's sake but
it's constantly in our lives and it's
and it's a driving force in our
in the way in which uh political
decisions are made
uh which which directly affect our
well-being
and the problem is that macroeconomic
concepts are quite difficult
even for students who are in economics
the concept of a macroeconomic aggregate
is quite an
abstract concept you uh it's
it's quite difficult to actually get
your head around that
and uh one of the things that um
that i'm aware of these days is that
social media is really
exacerbating that lack of understanding
that difficulty and
there's a lot of so-called experts on
social media
and i'm not talking about critics of my
work but also
those who might have a pre-election to
it but uh
it's not a it's not a great place social
media
for debate um and the other the other
aspect is that uh macroeconomics has
been
housed within all sorts of different
ideological agendas
that abuse the difficulty of the
concepts and
and and create this fictional world and
the the whole neoliberal
agenda over the last three or four
decades depending on where you live
relies on you and i being ignorant
about macroeconomics they exploit the
fact that we're ignorant they
build up our ignorance through very
sophisticated framing and language
and they exploit that to pursue agendas
that and in and co-opt us
into being part of their agenda setting
through the political process and and
the sort of and social media
and uh those agendas
have progressively undermined our
prosperity
and what modern monetary theory is
is a new way of thinking about
macroeconomics that i believe
gives the progressive side of politics
hope
so that's sort of what i'm going to talk
about so
full employment era what did we learn
from that 19
the the great depression taught us one
thing
and that was that
the government could use its fiscal
capacity that's spending and taxation
there's a bit of noise there could
could use its fiscal and
policy capacity to create unemployment
and to create full employment and what
what the great depression taught us was
that
capitalism left without that government
support and government intervention
would create crisis
and large amounts of unemployment it was
it was
endemic to an unregulated
capitalist system without strong fiscal
support
now the the great depression didn't
really end until the end of the 30s
and uh with the prosecution of the war
and the large deficits that accompanied
that prosecution
and and that clearly taught taught
governments that
uh strong fiscal support spending
support
would would create work and production
and income
growth and the great depression
unemployment ended with that military
effort
now the problem in the the early days of
the piece
in the 40s was well how we going to
continue to maintain that
full employment uh and that fiscal
support
without blowing the hell out of each
other having to

build tanks and armaments and things
like that
and most governments in in around the
world
had major policy statements in
in australia it was the 1945 white paper
on full employment
and these were very familiar all around
the world
where governments committed to nation
building
to using its fiscal support consistently
to maintain
sufficient spending so that when the
non-government sector
wanted to save overall and withdraw
some of their income from spending their
economy didn't go into recession
and instead would remain at full
employment with that fiscal support
that's what the full employment era
taught us
and it was quite clearly understood then
that
any unemployment that was realised
was due to a lack of spending and it was
a systematic
failure of the of the economy to produce
enough jobs
it was nothing to do with the
individuals who who were the victims of
the lack of spending and that the
solution was quite
clear that we needed to use uh fiscal
capacity to
to redress that spending gap so they
were the
they were the things that were
understood throughout the
1940s 50s 60s into the 70s
the breakdown in that consensus occurred
in the
early 70s now
it wasn't it wasn't a very
uh a rapid paradigm shift in the sense
that the
the monetarists milton friedman and his
gang
were were at their program for many
years earlier
they were fighting against the social
democratic
uh consensus in the 1950s and the 60s
and what what allowed them to gain
ascendancy in the academy
which then filtered out into the
policy making processes within central
banks and treasuries for example
and then broadly into the population was
the
uh dislocation related to the oil crises
the opec oil hot
price hikes first of all in october 73
then a bit later on which caused
you know dramatic shift it was a huge
supply
shock we call it in jargon the price
have all doubled overnight virtually
and for all dependent nations that
caused a huge
shock that the governments were under
prepared and
and really did hadn't worked out how to
deal with properly
and of course we had uh double-digit
inflation almost everywhere and the way
in which governments responded
was exactly the wrong way and to create
large-scale unemployment which
disciplined the inflation process but
caused massive damage but in the
in that disjuncture
monetarism assumed a credibility that it
didn't deserve
and uh there was a there was a paradigm
shift
so in my lifetime i've seen one paradigm
shift in economics
which tells me that they happen
now the interesting thing uh and we deal
with this in the book reclaiming the
state
was that at that time also the world was
opening up
and uh trade was becoming more
global
more rapid escalation of trade but
particularly financial capital flows
were were much larger in the late 60s
and
into the 70s and part of this monetary
story
which was started the creation of this
fictional world
was that nation states the fiscal
capacity that nation states had used
throughout that full employment era was
now
no longer effective
against the power of global
financial capital and
this was an agenda that was uh
prosecuted very vigorously by their
conservatives
and of course this played into their
political agenda that they wanted to
uh stop social democrat democratic
governments uh
running welfare states and took and they
wanted to confine the fiscal
capacity of nation states to
under underpinning profitability of
capital
and there was a very famous document in
1971
uh commissioned by the u.s chamber of
commerce
they commissioned a lawyer called lewis
powell
and this is the so-called power
manifesto and it's available to read
i've written about it
and this was a strategic agenda where
the
right could fight where capital
could fight back against the social
democratic forces
take over the media create think tanks
infiltrate the education system and in
and get rid of the lefties
and so on so forth and that set the
agenda
for capital which which you know they
used the
concepts of monetarism uh to their
advantage now you know at that time in
australia i was
just a young uh student
but the big big debates and these were
worldwide debates were trade union power
the profit squeeze
and all of these things and and the
agenda was quite clear
they wanted to uh break down the social
democratic
consensus and you know we've now got uh
in the 50-year archive rules of cabinet
documents in australia from 68 for
example
we've now can see that you know the big
bosses of the peak bodies of
industry were writing letters to our the
australian treasurer
implore him imploring him to
create more unemployment deliberately
to uh break the power of trade unions
and discipline the wage process so that
there could be a redistribution of
national income towards profit away from
wages now it's quite blatant what was
going on
but the the problem was that the the
political left
bought the whole fiction and you know
the if if you want to trace the origins
of uh
political support for monetarism uh it
comes from
originally from the left and you know
the famous statement by
jim callahan in the labor
annual conference in blackpool in 1976
in september
where he made the statement that the
idea that governments can use fiscal
spending to create work is dead
we no longer believe that now the
responsibility of the government
is to fight inflation and to
appease these and my words international
capital
and you know you can go through several
other turning points
jim callahan laid the groundwork for
thatcher
it was thatcher wasn't the first
monetarist government
the the second wilson government when
callahan took over was and then you had
the mederon government
in 1983 in france elected on an
anti-austerity
platform to re-nationalize and to
restore
uh growth and prosperity to the working
class
in 1983 they did the famous austerity
term
which was uh you know james jacques de
la was the economy minister in that
so-called socialist government and they
were
monetarists and i mean jacques de la
went on to become the president of the
european commission
and subsequently the chair of the
law committee which outlet which was the
blueprint for the maastricht treaty
which was the whole eurozone creation
and
you know the eurozone is the the the one
of the most advanced
expressions of of neoliberalism that you
can get that's that started in the left
and you know i mean closer to home uh
hawk and keating
they were near liberals and so was longy
and uh
douglas in in your country they they
were neo liberals laying the groundwork
for
hawk uh for howard and costello here
and for um
your national government that followed
them
and the the left board at all they
believed
uh that that the nation state was no
longer
had the capacity to maintain full
employment they no longer believed that
fiscal policy was
uh uh possible in in any coherent form
because
the glo the amorphous global uh
the powers of global capital would uh
sell the country down the drain
uh crash its exchange rate and uh
all of these and the bond markets would
stop funding the governments
now what really was going on and what
the conservatives knew damn well was
going on
was that they couldn't and short of
having private militias and invading
countries and sometimes they did that
but generally they don't do that jen
and what they understood was if they
wanted to uh operationalize their agenda
they had to do it through this the
legislative and regulative capacity of
the state
and so what really happened was not that
the nation state disappeared or anything
which is what the left believed
but that the state was reconfigured in
the neoliberal
pattern and all of the things that we
associate with neoliberalism
they've all been accomplished
through the legislative and regulative
capacity of the states
unless the nation state the the the legs
the the elected officials have gone
along with it the agenda could not have
occurred
and so really what the challenge for the
left is
is to reclaim the state
interestingly at this time all of this
was starting in the early 70s the
the post-war fixed exchange rate system
the bretton wood system which began in
1946 as a means of
providing international stability of
exchange rates and certainty of exchange
rates so
uh to provide some certainty for trading
in this in this so-called glorious full
employment consensus
that that broke down in august 1971 when
president nixon
uh suspended convertibility of the us
dollar into gold
and floated the us dollar and most other
currencies floated after that now
the importance of that and this is a
separate talk but
and i won't seek to explain it the
importance of that was
during the bretton woods period
governments
had to be very careful how much currency
was in the system
because the central banks had to
maintain the under the agreement the
bretton woods agreement
had to maintain the the agreed parities
across
all of the exchange rates and those
parities were influenced by
how much of the currency was floating
around in the economies
in the world economy and
as a consequence if fiscal policy
uh uh injected too much currency into
the system
then there would be pressures on the
exchange rate down
and the central bank would have to uh
react to that pressure by withdrawing
the currency
or pushing up interest rates and so you
had this sort of stop
go dilemma where the central bank
and particularly for countries with
external deficits
who were always facing downward pressure
on the exchange rate
they had they were always being
pressured to have
higher interest rates or austerity type
fiscal policies which then pushed up
unemployment and it became
politically unsustainable really to
maintain that system
uh quite apart from the challenges of
the u.s
economy maintaining the gold
convertibility
and so you know i could go on for a long
time about that but the important point
is that in august 71 when that system
essentially collapsed it took a couple
of years to really collapse
but when that collapsed the central
banks were no longer
responsible for maintaining exchange
rate values
so they didn't have to maintain higher
interest rates and
and try to constrain monetary growth
and fiscal policy was no longer going to
compromise the central bank's
exchange rate management and so
governments no longer
really needed to issue any debt to cover
its deficits
and and we learned very clearly then
that
taxation revenue no didn't wasn't
necessary to fund government spending
now that that realisation was
not uniformly disclosed to the public by
economists
and the mainstream of profession and the
teaching programs and the rest of it
continued on as if the world hadn't
changed but the brit
collapse of the bretton woods system was
a dramatic
change and that's really where the
modern in modern monetary policy comes
from
it comes from that shift in the monetary
system
after 71. so after all of that this is
the neoliberal support card i'm not
going to go through every line you can
look at a couple of those things and
tick them and realize that in different
countries
some of these things are more some of
these
things are more more prevalent than in
other countries but broadly
across the globe
these type of outcomes
have occurred
okay paradigm shift what's what's
happening is that that report card is
now
resonating it's taken uh
30 years but it's the accumulated damage
of those failures of the neoliberal
period are now resonating and there's a
paradigm shift underway
and the drivers are quite diverse you've
got
anti-establishment revolts going on
among citizens who realize that the
promise that was held out to them
of of wealth and prosperity
if they pulled their wage demands in
and they voted for governments are
privatized and outsourced and put in
user pays
and all of the rest of it
that those promises have failed to
deliver
and you know what's the manifestation of
that yellow vests in france
brexit vote trump uh
the rise of the right uh in the
political sense the
the demise of social democratic
political parties mainly around the
world
some of them now are virtually
unelectable uh
because they've they've played the
neoliberal game
thinking that was smart uh another
set of driver drivers is coming from
central bankers now
who uh the the neoliberal consensus
uh uh ensured that
most of the policy action would come
from monetary policy setting interest
rates
and uh would would be biased towards
fiscal austerity
running trying to run surpluses as best
uh
as the strategy and of course monetary
policy
uh the austerity from the fiscal policy
has been driving this sort of stagnation
low productivity growth flat wages
growth
uh bordering now on deflation and
and all of those things in that report
card and central bankers are realizing
that
they're they're the ones that have been
made front and center of the policy
response and they've run out of uh
policies they they've realized that uh
setting
uh swap changing interest rates isn't
very effective it doesn't do very much
to stimulate demand or
whatever and uh they've they've
progressively pushed
uh interest rates to zero and in some
kind some
areas in their negative now
and still stagnation
and they're now calling for they're sick
of being blamed and they're now causing
calling on treasuries to use fiscal
policy
which has been astute under the
neoliberal period
and the third sort of drivers are coming
from the financial community
who realize that their business models
have been undermined by this now liberal
period
why because they can't make a buck on
negative interest rates
they can't make a buck when public
infrastructure has been degraded
and run down by fiscal austerity because
they've been used to
being partners in
those large public infrastructure
projects and as they're being
cut back through the austerity they're
running out of safe investment
areas the the financial markets and
you've got situations where
i gave a talk in to pimco one of the
largest bond
traders and we were talking about uh
the the maturity mismatch in the big
european pension insurance funds what
does that mean it means that
they've got long-term liabilities which
need cash flow
you know pensions and paying out on
insurance contracts etc
and they use their asset structures to
generate returns that are timed in
appropriate ways so they can meet the
cash demands of their liabilities
and with negative interest rates and
drying up infrastructure opportunities
their asset structure is unable to
generate the appropriate
cash returns to meet their liabilities
that's called negative
maturity mismatch now what are they what
are they doing
well to to meet their liabilities and
keep their cash flow going in a
timely way that's the maturity way
they're
increasingly shifting their asset
portfolios into much more risky
positions because they can generate
higher returns than the negative returns
that and
low returns on safe assets and
that's exposing the whole financial
system system to collapse
so there's this paradigm shift being
driven by all sorts of diff
different forces that would not normally
be seen on the same page together
and this has of course led to a strong
interest in in my work and in modern
monetary theory
okay group think still prevails what why
is it taken
so long why have we been working on this
mmt project for 25 years and it's only
now
that we're getting um attraction
well the understanding comes from social
psychologists and this is a whole area
of group think
that even when a paradigm is
degenerating which means that it can no
longer explain very much about anything
that's
of interest the the dominance of the
paradigm hangs on
and i hope you can see this table
this is why we should this is why the
mainstream
should be jettisoned and i'll just uh
talk briefly about this
japan's a very good example japan japan
was really the first
post-neo-liberal government because when
when it had its huge commercial property
collapse in the
early 90s it
took dramatic action in terms of
increasing fiscal deficits and
providing monetary support to
prevent the commercial property collapse
becoming a major recession
so they've had consistently large fiscal
deficits above 10
occasionally since 91. the mainstream
of my profession predicted rising
interest rates and rising bond yields
the reality is that short-term interest
rates since 91 have been around zero
bond yields are consistently low and
they've been negative
for many years now in certain maturity
ranges
and they've had low unemployment
throughout they had one negative quarter
of of gdp
after the commercial property crash now
you think of the
gfc was a small property crash compared
to what japan had in the early 90s
japan has a second row gross public debt
to gdp of
largest in the world it's nearly 250
percent
my profession said that that would mean
that bond markets would uh
start assuming that that that excessive
debt would become
uh unable to be repaid and that they
would demand
increasing the higher bond yields if
they were to continue lending
to japanese government and of course as
i said across the maturity range yields
have been falling towards zero
and the private bids in bond auctions
for japanese government bonds have been
huge
huge demand for japanese government
bonds exactly the opposite to what my
profession predicted
and the other element is that the bank
of japan were the first really to engage
in large-scale purchase of government
bonds
in the secondary market and in effect
they've been funding fiscal debt
these large fiscal deficits they've been
funding them with money creation
uh and my profession calls that printing
money
which is erroneous and they say that
that that would eventually
lead to a loss of credibility of the
central bank
and sell out of the currency and all the
rest of it well
none of that's been happening there
hasn't been accelerating inflation
there's been the opposite
and the bank of japan has maintained
total controls of all
yields and interest rates just as it
always can
and the reality is that this fictional
world that my profession
relies on us believing in
can't explain anything about the real
world
and japan has pushed policy parameters
to their extremes
relative extremes and none of the
predictions of the mainstream have
occurred
and and why because it's a fictional
world they dealing
and here's a really nice quote from it's
a recent quote from martin wolf he's a
financial times journalist in britain
and he's talking about mmt in my view it
is right and wrong it is right because
there's no simple budget constraint
it is wrong because it will prove
impossible to manage an economy sensibly
one once politicians believe there's no
budget constraint
there's your fictional world but that's
not the first time here's another quote
from a very famous mainstream economist
paul samuelson he was interviewed by
mark blaug in 1988
i think there's an element of truth in
the view that superstition
that the superstition at the budget must
be balanced at all times
once it is is debunked takes away
one of the ball walks that every society
must have against expenditure out of
control
there must be discipline otherwise
you'll get
chaos and inefficiency and one of the
functions
very important and one of the functions
of old-fashioned religion was to scare
people by sometimes
by thinking sometimes what might be
regarded as myths into behaving
that way in the way
that long-run civilized life requires
so it's very clear
that they think it was appropriate
and they still think it's appropriate to
leave the public in the dark
by creating you know the old-fashioned
religion was to scare people
the myths were to scare people into into
social conformity
and into conforming in the the
the way in which the dominant paradigm
wants you to behave
to serve their interests not yours
okay what's mmt then and is
um about 10 more minutes
maximum so uh it's important to
understand i mean i hear all the time
and you're seeing it in the press now
even philip lowe the central bank
governor was talking in this way
this week in australia that oh
if we have mmt it'll be a disaster if we
shift to mmt won't it be great depending
on which side of the
fence you sit the the reality is that it
makes no sense to talk about
shifting to mmt or that mmt some regime
you can turn on or off
or that mmt is a set of policies that
you can adopt or not adopt
what mmt is is a lens it's a it's a
means of understanding the world that we
have out there
the modern monetary system that uses
fiat currencies
not currencies that are convertible into
gold that's the point i made earlier
about 1971.
and that what that lens exposes
is the ideology that sits behind policy
go back to those two quotes i just gave
you
what mmt allows you to do with this
superior lens
is to see very clearly what the
capacities of the currency issue in
government are
and what the consequences of using those
capacities in one way or another
austerity or not or whatever
what the consequences of of policy
choices are
and it lets you see through statements
that are
that oh we can't do this because we
don't have enough money where's the
money going to come from
all of these uh things that's a
statements that support the fiction mmt
allows you to see right through those
now to operationalize that understanding
into policy you have to impose a set of
values
so for a person on the left who believes
in collectives and public goods and
egalitarianism and those sort of values
they their mmt understanding will lead
to quite a different
policy set than if you're someone on the
right who believes in individualism and
a lack of collective action
and private endeavor rather than public
goods and what have you
but the two two people would have
exactly the same understanding
of mmt in the monetary system they would
just use that understanding for a
different set of policies
so what does it mean to have your own
currency what it means
and new zealand government has its own
currency it means that there's no
intrinsic financial constraint the new
zealand government can buy anything
that's for sale in its currency
including all idle labor
the government's not like a household so
that one of the mainstream fictions
is that oh the government's just a big
household and that
that plays into our own experience as
householders managing our finances
and we know we can't max out our credit
card otherwise we'll be in trouble down
the road
the the and we we were asked to sort of
extrapolate that experience as household
financial managers
into making assessments about what the
capacities of the and options of the
currency issue in government are it's
just totally
a false analogy we use the currency
we're financially constrained
the government issues the currency it
has no financial constraints
and so once you understand that you
realize that if there's idle labor
that's a political choice it's not a
financial constraint
the government could employ all idle
labor that wants jobs if it chose to
and and what mmt
allows you to understand is what
actually constrains government spending
as opposed to the fiction
or things that i will run out of money
or how do we pay for it
type constraints that that drive the
political process and our
political decision making
and i'll just go
just going to uh
i just got to go back one step sorry
there
and so what we what we uh once you have
an mmt
understanding you realize that taxes
don't fund spending
taxes serve another purpose i'll come to
in a second
public debt doesn't fund spending public
debt is just elaborate form of corporate
welfare
the new zealand government can never run
out of money
and the deficits generate income and
saving in the non-government sector
and surpluses do exactly the opposite
they kill income growth and they destroy
private wealth
so what constrains government spending
the first thing we need to understand is
that all spending
carries an inflation risk not just
government spending
private household consumption business
investment
export revenue it all carries
risk and that that risk
is embodied in the fact that if spending
in the economy
private or public uh outstrips the
capacity of the economy to respond to
that spending growth
by producing real goods and services
then there'll be inflationary pressures
prior to that point there won't be any
inflationary pressures coming from the
spending
now what are the constraints here's a
little example
a choice set to allow us to see very
clearly some important points
here's two two states is the economy
fully employed
that means are all productive resources
being used and
and does the nation enjoy monetary
sovereignty money sovereignty means that
you issue your own currency central bank
sets the interest rates you don't borrow
in a foreign currency
those those things are response
are necessary for monetary sovereignty
plus floating it on freely on exchange
uh
foreign exchange markets so new zealand
government is clearly monetarily
sovereign
germany for example isn't because it
uses the euro which is a foreign
currency to them
so here's very briefly some situations
if we answer yes to those two questions
then what are the constraints on
government spending more
the constraints are real what does that
mean
it means this that all the resources
that are
productive resources are currently being
fully employed
if the government wants a greater
command of those resources let's say it
wants to increase the size of government
to pursue
a green transition or something like
that then if it starts
trying to compete with the existing
users of those resources
at market prices and trying to buy them
hire them to work in the public sector
then there'll be inflation
so the real real resource constraint is
hit at that point
and that's the limits of government
spending so if the government really
wanted to run a gr
a program where it increases its command
of the
productive resources available to in the
economy
it has to work out a way to deprive the
non-government sector who are currently
using them of use
and there's many ways it can do that but
a very important way is through taxation
and taxation effectively reduces the
non-government purchasing power which
creates those
unemployment in those real resources
which can then be brought into the
public
back into productive use by government
spending
and so that gives you an insight into
what the role of taxation is one of the
roles
of taxation it's not to fund government
spending the government doesn't need the
tax revenue
to spend because it types numbers into
bank accounts every day and that's how
our
currency enters the economy but it needs
that taxation
to to constrain private spending
so that it doesn't push the economy
spending in economy beyond the resource
constraint
take this example so now we've got idle
resources as in
most economies now
there are no constraints on increasing
government spending
and so when there's unemployed resources
there's underemployment
uh there's machines are not working in
the private sector
then the responsibility of government
then it has no constraints on its
spending
is to type numbers and run programs
into type numbers into bank accounts and
run programs
up to the point where they get back to
answering yes to that question in other
words full employment
that's the responsibility of a
government uh in a in a
democracy in my view it has no
constraints so all of the arguments that
they might come out with
how are we going to pay for it and all
that they're just fictions they're
nonsense
they pay for it by typing numbers into
bank accounts
for procurement contracts uh cash
transfers and all the rest of it
and until they get back to being at full
employment there are no
constraints on spending now what the
main what
for a country like germany for example
in the eurozone the 19 member states
even when they're at full employment
they have financial constraints as well
as real constraints
because they don't issue their own
currency
and so they're dependent on bond markets
to fund deficits
and uh and that financial constraint
doesn't disappear even when there's idle
resources which is why
surrendering your currency like the
eurozone countries did was
is a disastrous thing for a nation state
to do
because even if they've got idle
resources like mass unemployment as
they've got now
the bond markets can still hold them to
ransom
and they can't do anything about it
okay so the last couple of
minutes i'll just talk about options
with
on what how governments can use that
spending
essentially a currency issuing
government like new zealand has
two choices if it wants to start have a
stable inflation environment
it can either use what i call an
unemployment buffer stock
or it can employ use an employment
buffer stock
now at the moment the new zealand
government and most governments use an
unemployment buffer stock what does that
mean it means
that when there's inflationary pressures
in the economy
the government will tighten fiscal
policy the central bank will push up
interest rates and they will
deliberately create unemployment to
discipline wage demands
to squeeze profit margins in the product
markets
and that disciplines the wage price type
spiral pressures in the economy
and the the problem is that that is
incredibly costly approach
because using unemployment not only
results in massive
daily income losses it also has a whole
series of personal and family and
community pathologies
crime rates mental and physical health
family breakdown social dislocation all
of those things that sociologists and
psychologists tell us about
so and the other problem is
that if you then try to ease the
unemployment
you may well trigger the inflationary
spiral then so it's a really costly way
to discipline inflation the alternative
is to use an employment buffer stock
what does that mean
that means that the government offers an
unconditional job offer
to any worker that doesn't have a job
and that job offer is at a
social inclusive minimum wage it's a
it's a and
and in other words it's at the bottom of
the wage distribution in the economy
which is adjusted upwards if necessary
to ensure that the lowest paid workers
have
have the ability to participate in
society socially include
inclusive wage which means that it's not
a poverty wage
it means that they can a minimum wage
worker can have a holiday
can go out to dinner occasionally can go
to the football or
to the to music or whatever they they
can participate
in society but the important point of
that is
that the the government is buying off
the bottom of the market because the
unemployed workers have what we call
zero bid in the market
nobody wants their services and so by
buying those
workers in the job guarantee
the government is buying a resource that
has no bid for it and therefore
that that spending can't be inflationary
and and ultimately why it's a buffer
stock is because when the private sector
is stronger
it can then bid the workers back out
into the private sector
back out of the job guarantee and the
buffer stock would contract
now normal times at high pressure
economy times
the buffer stock would be relatively
small because if you think back to how
the
uh how western governments achieved full
employment in the
post-war period it wasn't because the
private sector was strong
that strong
career public sector it was because most
governments around the world maintained
a small buffer
of jobs always available in australia it
was in the
local government in railways in the big
utilities the infrastructure utilities
like roads and housing
and these you could always get a job in
those areas on
any time you wanted and those jobs
contracted and expanded depending how
strong the private economy was
sorry about that the the
advantages of a job guarantee over a
unemployment buffer stock approach is
are massive and i've listed some of them
there
you can have choose your hours of work
so you eliminate time-based
underemployment
you can participate in career and
training development
you can
target the jobs because they're
unconditional
that they are spatially targeted so you
don't get this problem of
hollowing out of regional areas in our
in our countries
you can make them green
a massive advantage is a second point
there that
one of the real problems of children
growing up in jobless households
especially long-term jobless households
we know from the research evidence is
that they they
inherit the disadvantage of their
parents
and so by by seeing their parents always
being able to work
that that stigma and that disadv
intergenerational disadvantage is not as
pronounced if
pronounced if if existing at all now
that's in bold here it's not a panacea
to everything
it's the base position that any
government should adopt
and and i and i'm not saying that the
response to this pandemic should be
just a job guarantee job guarantee
should be a permanent
safety net and if you want to have
you don't want to see it as the only
government response to
unemployment there's so much
work to be done in improving the scope
and quality of public services uh
that we need career public servants
being re-employed
uh to redress that the problems of that
now liberal report card
the job guarantee is just a small part
of it
and it's infinitely better than buffer
stock option
and the last point i'd make is that a
lot of people
are really up in arms about the concept
of
a duty to work now i'm of the
ilk that says that in a
a society based upon collective values
where the government has a
responsibility to ensure that everybody
can
have a job then the citizens in that
economy that society
have a duty to contribute to the
well-being of the society through their
endeavors
and a lot of people a lot of
progressives find that offensive they
believe that a person should have the
right to opt out and still get income
support
the way i see it is that at the moment
our societies haven't evolved
to the point where the majority of
people especially the working
the traditional working class are not in
not
yet ready to accept people who can work
not working and still receiving an
income from the state
everybody understands that if you're
sick if you're old if you're young
if you're disabled then you should be
fully supportive
well not everybody but every progressive
thinks should be fully supported by the
state
at a very uh substantial level to ensure
that their lives have
have meaning in
relative to the rest of society but i
don't believe the working class is yet
ready to accept people who can work
receiving a state payment
and not contributing at all and relying
on the work efforts of others for their
consumption goods and their leisure
goods
but what we do need is a massive
revaluation of the concept of
productivity what is meaningful work
and the job guarantee allows us within
the
paid work culture that i just mentioned
to really push the boundaries as to what
we
would allow to be within the uh an
employment buffer stock
and to give you the as a closing
point to think about uh i live just
very close to what some of the best surf
beaches in
australia on the east coast and i would
allow surfers to be in the job guarantee
now what would they do they'd go surfing
of course
now what else would they do by way of
reciprocation to the collective
one of the problems in our summers here
is uh
water safety and people drowning and who
best knows the
dangers of the water than surfers we
jump in the
rips to get out quickly and so i would
have
surfers surfing and enjoying their lives
in being creative in the waves
but i'd also have them required to take
water safety training sessions for
school kids
highly productive totally outside the
box of what we currently consider to be
productive work
but that's a way of pushing the agenda
towards a much more
collective leisure based society
without violating the current paid work
culture
okay so that's all i've got to say i've
got
some
i can talk about new zealand itself i've
got some graphs there but
i think that's enough and i'll take
questions
hey thank you very very much bill that
was um
extremely i'm going to stop sharing
uh have you stopped sharing yeah okay
great yeah thanks
thanks bill that's uh absolutely um
illuminating
um and thank you very very much for that
um
and and maybe if there's interest from
the um floor we'll
look at some of those new zealand stats
as we uh
discuss what's uh um what you've
covered what i'll ask people to do is if
you
have a a question in mind
feel free to raise your hand i can't
necessarily physically see you if you
raise your hand physically
because i can't see what's on all the
screens
but do please use that blue
symbol or the raised hand symbol and far
away either with a question
uh to bill or the audience or as i
mentioned we do uh
allow uh comments as well but please
keep them to a couple of minutes or
i'll i'll certainly help you keep them
to a couple of minutes
jeff um you've got your hand up i'll uh
take your
question first right thanks man
um i've got two questions to ask and
they're on different parts of the
presentation
one of them is about the limits to the
buffer stock
because i understand the point you make
about surfers but
i am aware that a large part of the
labor for a large part of the population
lie outside the labor force
but with a job guarantee scheme
potentially might
come into the labor force i'm thinking
particularly housewives
and other unpaid care workers who for
whom there's a strong case that they're
socially highly productive
but there's enough of them to produce a
real problem if they're allowed access
into your job
buffer scheme the second question that i
have is to do with the
the downstream consequences of
large-scale deficit financing which we
are
confronting here in new zealand as well
as you are in australia
we've got about 60 billion of government
deficit financing going into the economy
over the next couple of years
and coming to rest as 60 billion dollars
of settlement cash balances
which if in the longer run represent
excess balances and potentially
represent
uh unwanted spending if the economy
comes back to full employment and
i'm just wondering looking downstream uh
how the exit strategy from a uh
a reco a deficit lead recovery looks
in terms of mopping up any excess
liquidity that you're left
left with at the end of the day when we
get back to full employment
thanks okay so um thanks for the
question
um i don't see any problem of uh
of people doing currently doing unpaid
housework
uh being employed within a job guarantee
what's the problem
they get an income for doing work where
you know there's a major issue where you
have
people doing child care being paid an
income because that's considered to be
part of the market economy that people
who
who are doing their own child care
aren't considering
doing the same thing effectively aren't
being paid i can't see any problem with
that
and i think that would go a long way to
redress
some of the issues that uh
my feminist colleagues rail against uh
the inequity of of that situation the
lack of recognition of
particularly mothers
work looking after their kids and not
being
recognized as part of the productive
workforce i think they're highly
productive and
i can't see any problem with that and
equally
a lot of people are uh a lot of
particularly mothers but it might also
open up a better choice set for
for fathers are for
forced into the sort of precarious work
the gig economy
to supplement their
their home caring time
and if you allowed them to be in job
guarantee
they would be protected from that sort
of
need to go to work in that sense so i
can't say it's a problem
that's the first point the second point
is that uh
you have and i'll be and i'm being
polite here
because we're all adults you've um
you've brought the fictional world by
saying you're very worried about
the the liquidity so i'm presuming
you're thinking that oh what's gonna
what happens when a government runs
deficits is it adds
reserves to the the banking system uh
all the
all the transactions that occurred
because of the higher
economic there's higher spending and the
activity that generates
ultimately show up in bank reserves
now does that matter
well that let's think about how japan's
handled that
over 30 years not not just one year or
five years 30 years
and what what effect if you've got
excess reserves
so what are reserves reserves are
accounts that the private banks have to
keep with the central bank
and their their function is
purely to ensure
that the daily transactions
across banks will clear it you know
think about it as checks clearing
and so there's all sorts of transactions
between bank i and bank b
and and they resolve themselves every
day of every
working day through transactions
contra entries among these reserve
balances that the banks keep
banks don't lend out reserves that's the
myth one of the myths that
the mainstream in my profession
perpetuate
bank banks can't lend out reserves
reserves are only allowed to be used for
the
clearing function and or banks
on an overnight basis can lend to each
other reserves
if they're short or have too many now
the problem for banks is that
reserves typically don't earn a
competitive rate of return
and so for them it's dead money
and what so if a bank has a lot of
transactions that are in their favor on
any day they'll
come up with excess reserves and
they'll try then to loan find other
banks on the interbank market that's
this is an overnight market
where they they transact between each
other
they will try to find a bank that has a
shortage of reserves on any particular
day to lend them out to try to get a
return but
of course if there's an excess overall
those intra bank
transactions can't eliminate it and so
what happens is the competitive process
of trying to eliminate it
drives the short-term interest rate down
to zero
now for a for a central bank who wants a
say a four percent policy
monetary target then as a short-term
target that's a problem
so what does a central bank have to do
in that case it has two options
it can traditionally do an open market
operation what does that mean
it says to the banks with excess
reserves we'll sell you
a government bond uh in exchange for
those reserves and so the government
debt is sold to the
the banks to generate a competitive
yield stop them trying to lend out their
reserves
and the the excess is drained out of the
system
now in more recent times what central
banks have been doing is just saying
okay we'll just pay you a return on
excess reserves
which is functionally the same thing
that stops that
process occurring what did they do in
japan they just let the
excess reserves sit in the system and
drive that's how they maintain zero
interest rates at the short end of the
yield curve the
short run interest rates that's how they
do it
and they're problems there's no problem
there's no
ex the excess reserves that are sitting
there in the banking system
now the myth is that oh well won't won't
people just
go crazy and use those excess reserves
to spend wildly
well they can't they can't spend the
reserves
that's not the way the reserve system
works
and so the question then is well they've
got financial assets that are
expressed in those reserves yes they
have
what happens if they if they liquidate
those assets
okay they'll sell them for cash and then
they might spend
and if they do that then the growth of
the economy will rise
tax revenue will increase welfare
spending will decrease and the deficit
will go down anyway
so and ultimately
there is no problem in running
continuous fiscal deficits until the
cows come home
the australian government and most
governments around the world have always
run deficits
and the reason they have to run deficits
and some of those graphs i had
for you if we wanted them
one graph shows that new zealand like
australia runs a continuous
current account deficit of about i think
in your case about three percent of gdp
in australia's case a bit
over three and a half we've been doing
that for a long time
now what does that mean a current
account deficit or an external deficit
means that there's more income
flowing out of the economy that's coming
in more spending going out than coming
in
that drains spending from the domestic
economy
now if you want if you want the private
domestic sector the household sector and
the business firms
if you want them to be able to save
overall
which means you don't want them to get
to be accumulating increasing amounts of
debt
then with an external deficit you have
to run a fiscal deficit
it's no other way around it and
in the full employment era we had
non-gov private domestic sector
typically
saving overall despite strong investment
rates because household saving ratios
were high
we had external deficits and we had
consistent
continuous fiscal deficits supporting
the income of growth
to allow the private sector to save
now for new zealand at the moment
you've been pushing fiscal surpluses
and the only way your economy is being
able to grow with your external deficits
is because you've got record levels of
household debt
and it's the household debt that's been
driving consumption growth
in running up against the fiscal drag
from the surpluses
and the drain of spending through your
external account
now that's an unsustainable situation
because eventually the private sector
balance sheets become so precarious
that the smallest changes in environment
in employment or interest rates or
whatever
start triggering insolvencies
and so it's best for a country to not
drive growth on ever increasing levels
of household debt
which effectively means you if you
especially if you need
have an external deficit means you need
continuous fiscal deficits there's no
other way around it
thank you thanks bill um jeff you've got
your hand up again did you have a
just a one final yeah i just wanna very
quickly to come back
um particularly on that on your last
point
um i i agree with you in all the detail
of what you said i still raised the
question that i raised at the
outset about excess balances our banking
system operates perfectly satisfactory
with eight billion dollars of
settlement cash balances that's enough
to clear all the overnight transactions
there's nothing more than that required
we're running up towards 60 billion
dollars of those things
at the end of the day
we will end up paying on those
settlement cash balances
either a rate of return roughly equal to
government bond rates or
we're seeing them converted into
government bonds throughout market
operations
on which then we will have to pay
servicing costs
and uh one way or the other uh if you
put 60 billion
it could be could be 100 billion looking
forward now
into the system that comes through
settlement cash balances you do
at the end of the day um have to carry a
servicing cost on that amount even
though the settlement cash balances
themselves can't be directly used for
spending
and i think the um the concern that i'm
that i'm
putting forward to you um is to do with
the
with the the claim that by running
fiscal deficits now you incur
long-run obligation servicing
obligations for the fiscal
system and it seems to me that if you
tax the
settlement cash balances away and
thereby eliminate them that's fine
you've got rid of the long-run
obligation if you can find a way of
writing them off
again you're okay if you go forward
paying zero
rate of return on the settlement cash
balances and can keep them sterilized
that's okay my concern simply is
that if you if you have that much
accumulated settlement cash
uh it can convert into problems down the
track including an increased
fiscal burden of servicing them so i i'm
i'm not criticizing you for this i it's
something i'm wrestling with myself and
so
if you can help me think my way through
it i'd be grateful
well just think of the way japan's
managed the situation
that's what i'd tell you it's 30 years
now they've understood
that the central bank can control all
yields if it wants to
including making them negative if they
want to
now i'm not saying that's desirable but
that's what the central bank has
the bond markets are not the power force
it's the central bank it's the power
force
and what increasingly is happening
happening is
central banks are buying the debt in the
secondary markets anyway
and uh so you've now got increasing
situations where
governments the right pocket of
government the treasury
is owing money to the left pocket of
government the central bank
because remember the central bank's not
independent of government
uh it's it's part of government and so
in the end you're getting
situation like for japan since 2012
the bank of japan has basically bought
all the debt that's issued
and so it's it you know what what's what
could happen there well
i mean it's left and right pocket stuff
going on here
and and uh the central bank if if the
scenario was that
uh the interest payments were going to
become too onerous
relative to the the fit the size in
which the fiscal deficit would have to
be to maintain full employment
so you know you could imagine some weird
situation where
interest payments were so huge that they
crowded out
the ability to fund education for
example it's not
likely to ever happen the government
could just set interest rates at zero
and as you say no no yield
no debt burden but the other thing to
think about
and and this is the way in which mmt
thinks rather than mainstream is to
invert the logic
what's government debt and what are the
interest payments on it
well we all talk about burden but it's
actually our wealth
and our income and if the government and
and if the government is paying interest
payments on
on on its obligations one way or another
whether it's through
through issued debt or through paying
excess uh
returns on excess reserves that's
private income
and the only issue that progressives
should be having there is
who's getting that income and where's
the wealth being stored
it's wealth in the pro non-government
sector is good the the issue is the
distribution of the wealth not the
existence of it
and so that i'm i can't see any scenario
where uh excess reserves in the banking
system can turn negative
for a gut for a society if the
government manages them properly
okay thanks thanks bill and uh thanks
jeff for that uh question or series of
questions
um robert you've had your hand up for a
bit
thank you very much bill um the
ecological footprint
worldwide is something like uh 1.75
so as a as a whole we are living beyond
the resources of the world to us
sustained life so where does
um coming back within that uh
envelope of the capacity of the earth to
support
human activity where does that figure in
your scheme
yeah i think that's really important
question and uh
and i think it goes to the heart of
understanding
the difference between the current
mainstream and what i would call
a progressive ideology
and the current mainstream and you know
particularly the way economists
mainstream economists think about the
natural environment for example
is to consider it to be a
a resource that can be extracted to
produce income in the economy
and you know i mean in environmental
economics we're taught
things about the trade-off that oh
pollution's bad but
income's good so we'll just get a merry
trade-off
and the way i've always thought about it
is that
you know mainstream economists derive
all of these
technical concepts of optimal degrees of
pollution and optimal degrees of
extraction and the way i always thought
about it was that
i i don't know when a river system is
going to die
i don't know when a biological system
has been pushed beyond its limits
and so the idea that you can just keep
pushing a trade off
seems to me to be an incredibly
dangerous concept
and the way i think about uh economics
is that the economics
the economic system is us it's not
something divorced from us that we have
to
be slaves to or the natural environment
has to be slaves to
a slave to the the economy is only there
to
to advance our material prosperity
we and we are embedded in a natural
environment
that is and our prosperity is
conditional on that national
natural environment so
what's going to be required i think is a
massive transformation in production and
income consumption patterns
that honor the fact that we've been

trashing our natural environment for the
sake of material prosperity
now that doesn't mean
a lot of a lot of green progressives and
so are what you
mean zero growth well no i don't mean
zero growth at all i mean green growth
because unless we're growing popular
unless you're going to stop population
growth altogether which is
not going to happen it'll happen over
time as aging occurs
but unless you're going to
with growing populations particularly
distributed in uh spatial geospatially
uh we're going to have to continue to
grow
it's otherwise we're saying that the
future generation is going to have less
opportunities than us but we we're
sophisticated enough i would have
thought
to be able to manage that employment
growth and those opportunities within a
green
future rather than a carbon future
and and i firmly believe that there's so
many you know
so many things that are going to be
required to be done
uh you know think about aging societies
the
personal care services are going to
become huge in the next
20 30 years and personal care services
can be all green type activities but be
highly productive and
and highly beneficial to society but
leave no footprint
thanks thanks bill and thanks uh robert
for that question
that excellent question actually um uh
warwick
you've got your hand up
thank you i think this whole thing makes
sense because if you
lend the government issues um
money to buy to pay people who
say build state houses that only adds
value
so you're creating more goods and
services
you're also creating more money but that
can't be inflationary from one
from my viewpoint but i think we've got
a bit of a marketing problem
about 10 years ago the people standing
for parliament out here called
positive money and you just sort of
think
oh yeah that sounds like social credit
so what's the difference between
modern monetary theory positive money
and social credit
well in response to your first point um
you know one of the things that i've
been arguing with my government here
over the last few months is australia's
got
a shortage of about 400 000
um social housing shortage
because of the years of uh
of de-investment by governments in
social housing in the attempt to force
low-income workers into private markets
so there's a massive opportunity in this
pandemic
which which has short-term problems
independent of the health issue but the
short-term problems of
income loss and all the rest of it
is to use the fiscal stimulus that's
required to
to look after longer-term problems like
like the environment
public infrastructure for carbon
transition
but also social housing but don't think
for one minute that the production of
social housing is
is doesn't uh engage
a an inflation risk under at the moment
not because there's idle capacity
but at go back to that choice set i
provided at full
if you have a stronger economy and you
want to expand social housing
and and start absorbing construction
resources from the
from their current uses then if you try
to do that and just by
offering contracts to constructors to
build social housing
then you will run into an inflation
barrier
so you've always got to be aware that
depending upon the state of the economy
government programs can be can be more
or less risky in terms of
inflation at the moment that's not a
risk at all
but at some other point it might be
now in terms of positive money and mmt
somewhat different the the major
difference
is that positive money wants to
eliminate the credit creation capacities
of private banks
and my view on that is if they
so they want banks to only be able to
lend
uh deposits that they currently can
attract
and not be able to leverage in a
fractional reserve type of way
bank lending now i happen to quite like
my credit card
it means that i no longer have to have
all these coins in my pocket
and that i can as long as i'm careful
each month i can pay it off without
paying interest
now that comes from the bank's credit
creating capacity
and my view is that if you adopted
a positive money recommendation and
eliminate the private bank's credit
creation
capacity we would have we would have a
huge recession immediately
because uh businesses wouldn't be able
to run overdrafts anymore and get
working capital
and consumers would uh not be able to
uh across time balance their spending
and their income flows in
in a way that they chose and and
quite frankly there's enough regulation
and authoritarian type imposts upon our
choices in society and i wouldn't want
that to be another one
regulation's great if it's uh for
collective good that wouldn't be for
collective good and and you know i mean
the the sentiment of the positive money
group is uh
is is reasonable that they are worried
that the
the bankers have become bank stirs uh
like gangsters and uh that they are uh
responsible for uh speculative bubbles
and and fraud and all the rest of it
that we found out during the global
financial crisis and beyond
and you know the royal commission in
australia into the financial sector
recently has found
incredible abuses of the banks and
and the insurance companies and what
have you
and so you know my view is that if you
want the banks to behave
properly but still retain their credit
creation capacity then you need to
make sure that they behave as banks and
not casinos
because what they're doing at the moment
under the financial deregulation
is uh you know they can
bundle up all these loans into
securitized assets and
flog them off to as derivative assets to
unsuspecting
investors and take them off their
balance sheet and therefore shift
create the risk and then shift the risk
and not be responsible for it whereas my
view is that if you want banks to be
banks
then they've got to hold all their
decisions on their own balance sheets
and their shareholders have to be
responsible for it
and i'd go one step further and say i
would eliminate private banking
if effectively private banks the banking
system is really a public private
partnership as it exists now the so
called too big to fail
idea that that that there's no need in
my view
private bank uh banking as a as a a
resource is
sort of like a public good to me and i
would have uh
as a transition phase i would
reintroduce a public bank
and and that bank would then set the
discipline for the sector and make
all of the private banks conform to a
much more
secure non-speculative type of behaviour
and then if you wanted to go further and
have just no public bank private banks
then i will support that but the
problem's not the credit creation of
banks
the problem is that the banks are no
longer banks they're casinos
and you can have the credit creation
which helps people
consumers have choices over time
i like my credit card it gives me extra
choices
and uh but i don't like banks being
casinos
that's my answer to your question thank
you thanks uh thanks bill and thanks
warrick for that question
um um if you're okay bill i'll take one
more question because james had
a hand up but we'll make that the last
um
it's uh 3 30 1 30 your time and thank
you for that but jane would you like to
give us a quick question or comment yes
indeed thank you very much
um first of all i just quickly like to
say thank you to the fabians for putting
this on and bill
in particular for making himself
available it was
really interesting my question though is
um
bill do you have any advice on how we
can
best spread this information and i'm
particularly thinking that
as depending on what happens with kobit
19
we've got a general election coming up
in new zealand just next month
yeah well i mean this is the perennial
and thanks for your comment this is the
perennial problem
we've been confronting this for 25 years
when when a couple of us started out on
this journey
the mmt thing and you know
that point about the group think i i
skated over it of course
but i've written quite a lot about it
and it's a it's an
incredible constraint uh uh
shifting mindsets it's it takes a long
time and
uh uh you know the way when we started
i started this with an american and a
couple of americans came in very early
on the project and
and um
commensurate with their culture they
were very enthusiastic
that all we need to do is get this stuff
out there and everyone would quickly
jump now i'd studied philosophy of
science of course and i
and and i i think i understood that
paradigms don't shift very quickly at
all and i said to them no
this is a mid 90s that no this is a
long haul this is an education is a slow
burn
and this is a really long haul process
and i think we're still in that process
although
there's quite clearly a lot of disparate
forces now
uh totally dissatisfied with mainstream
economics
but we're up against you know mainstream
economics didn't come out of nowhere
if you go if you've studied economics
you'll know that a lot of this
literature that we still talk about
today
came about in the late 19th century
when when industrialists hired
economists
to come up with uh theories that make
capitalism look
fair and why did they want to do that
because marxism was starting to run rife
in
in europe and and you know
1848 revolutions and the 1871 paris
commune
these were real threats to the
capitalist hegemony and uh
because workers were starting to work
out that the distribution of income was
incredibly unfair that they were working
for hours in sweatshops for
minimal pay and the bosses were pissing
off with the surpluses
for doing nothing other than owning the
capital and that was deeply offensive to
a sense of sort of justice and
egalitarianism and
so mainstream economics isn't just a
random invention
it's it serves the purposes of of
capital
and always has been in the fictional
world they've created
nobody asks how is the government going
to pay for when they
when they put trillions of dollars in
into
into the system to save the banks in
2008 and save the salaries of the ceos
no one asks where's the money coming
from when they buy
feed the military industrial complex and
then go and invade countries like iraq
and afghanistan
they always ask how it's going to pay
for when they want to
increase the unemployment benefit from
two bob detuna
two two shillings and sixpence
and and so that's the that's the problem
we are we're up against the power elite
and i'm increasingly forming the view
and i'm acting on this view in the
australian setting in sort of
some political endeavors we're getting
involved in my view is that
we have a capacity now that we've never
had before because
we don't in the past we haven't
controlled the media
but social me social the internet is is
a much more democratizing force
and and and we can organize look at us
today we're talking
100 people here today apparently across
the tasman we're having
a political discussion now and
i i believe that we can
create a grassroots movements to
to confront the power elites there was a
reason in the late 19th century why
trade unions formed
and there was a really reason why
welfare states became an acceptable idea
that politicians couldn't resist
and that was because capitalism had
pushed workers too far
and uh they were faced with with with
overflow and
revolution and i think we're at the
point now
that now liberal report card tells me
and the revolts that are going on around
the world
brexit look at how could you elect a
president
like trump well that's just an
anti-establishment revolt
that's a breakdown of the power elites
and the and the
command over the the aleds so my view is
that we've just got to
exploit the internet the the capacity to
organize
by the internet and to educate
everybody should and that's why i said
at the beginning we all should learn
macroeconomics and learn it properly
because that's a way we can confront our
polity who tells us we can't afford to
do this well of course
we've new zealand government's got as
many dollars as it wants
what it will struggle to have is real
resources that's your constraint
always thank you for that
thanks and thanks i'll do my best
good that was a great uh closing
question uh thank you jane
very very good and bill um really
appreciate your
time uh opening that uh transtasmin
dialogue um thank you very very much
everybody the um this has been recorded
so if you missed anything or you want to
go back
over it um or you want to share it with
those who
couldn't be online um we'll get the
the link out in the next 24 hours and
um thank you very very much bill we'll
