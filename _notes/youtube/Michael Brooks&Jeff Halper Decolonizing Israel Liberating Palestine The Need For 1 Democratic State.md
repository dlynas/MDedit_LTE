## Transcript:
capitalism and he's trying to get some
of the sjw stuff out of schools i just
saw a tweet by him
a day or two ago so on that front and
again i don't know a ton about him
that all sounds good to me
the sonic betting there of the dumbest
man on the internet dave rubin we're
about to
meet uh basically the just intellectual
moral uh every way opposite of dave
rubin
uh jeff halper he is the head of
israelis against home demolitions the
israeli committee
excuse me these demolitions the israeli
committee against house demolitions i
apologize
uh jeff you've been working on a variety
of issues both for democracy and justice
in israel and palestine but you also
have an analysis
that goes deeper than most of the sort
of conversations that we have about
israel-palestine in my estimation
um but how did you
i mean you live in israel yes uh you're
you know jewish gentleman uh you're mash
bakas
i'm half of and phil is all of
this is a couple of right here so
if we can we can
live in israel your uncle converted and
lived in israel yeah my uncle is he
should be on a watch listening guy who
converted judy is some very rare thing
he should hey what did you say he was a
what guy he's a very waspy looking guy
yeah i know i've heard that there they
are actually really funny stories that's
good post game content
how did you end up in israel what what
how did this israel story begin
and then how did you find yourself
in the peace movement well i grew up in
northern minnesota
right a little town in northern
minnesota and i was very active in the
60s okay you know civil rights movement
anti-war movement
chicago in 68 all of that i was the
class of 68.
wow okay and um when the 60s collapsed
we had nixon and everything else
there was nothing for me in this country
i didn't i felt anything was
maybe this is a midwestern reaction had
i grown up in new york
it might have been different but there's
a little more substance but in the
midwest oh there's no substance here of
trust
all right well even the midwest the
midwest i love it but new york is trash
yeah
well the midwest flatter trash yeah so
if you want
you know i still want to be involved but
i wanted to be
in our language in those days to move to
another front a more meaningful front of
the revolution right
and um so i had to go somewhere if i
wanted to get out where i could be
politically active
and israel i mean for reasons that
aren't good because as a jew i had the
right to go to israel automatically
whereas palestinians are kind of
excluded from
the country automatically right
nevertheless i used that privilege
to move there um and uh
so from the very beginning i was
involved in the israeli peace movement i
met my wife
in in the new israeli new left in those
days
and i've been involved for 45 years now
so you
so that okay so that's very interesting
to me so you didn't
because i think some people and i think
particularly you know generationally i'm
very mindful of this some people
definitely had a perception i think in
the 60s and 70s
who had really good politics that you
know obviously
the jews are incredibly to say the least
historically repressed and
literally genocided people and then and
there's an image of israel of you know
oh
well there's it's socialism and we're
building something new
and some people had that that vision
that was a flawed vision but that
but did you you went in already with a
sense
of some of the problems in the israeli
project
yeah i mean my story isn't one of a
rosy-eyed zionist that goes
in and gets disillusioned and finds his
way to the left i i knew
there was occupation i knew palestinians
i knew right
zionism and so on um i do have to admit
that you know part of the 60s was a kind
of identity politics
right where you know you had alex
haiti's roots and you had the native
american movement and you had um
you know cesar chavez and so on so there
was a going back to roots
and i'm not religious in any way and the
jewish
community didn't offer very much and so
in a way there was a certain attraction
to israel
but also israel was a different country
in those days it had a socialist
government
right and nobody thought that the
occupation was going to last
so in a sense going into a new country
with some promise but with some
fundamental problems
being committed to trying to resolve
those problems find a common denominator
with the palestinians
it made sense in those days i mean it's
not like in israel today
where i i think someone like me would
never even visit let alone
go move there how did i i will just say
parenthetically you know i haven't spent
i spent i was in jerusalem for under a
week
and i also spent some time in the west
bank but i i would just say
and this is even i would say even well
short of a radical critique
for people in the united states who are
part of the kind of
i would just even say modern democratic
party
with their expectation sets their
correct
expectation sets about certain sort of
basic anti-racism
you would be shocked by spending time in
israel
even just by that sort of very limited
metric i mean it really
is a radically different thing
so can you though trace for us
because i think it's actually i like
that though because okay
on one hand there's this rosy-eyed
history and some people even hold this
other narrative that israel was this
great incredible thing
and then it was corrupted by likud and
netanyahu and of course that isn't true
but then conversely the other narrative
that israel was
always just all it ever is was just the
settler right-wing thing
it was a settler thing but there was
complexities to
you know a labor socialist government
then the rise of the sort of
neo-liberals then then you even have
ahood barack and a third way
and then a forerunner of this sort of
resurgent far right that we see across
the western atmosphere
starting when netanyahu came back to
power in 2008. so
can you talk to us just about those kind
of big
periods of broader israeli political
history that you have seen
well yes and no because in fact
i mean if you look at the last 125 years
of zionism
um it was a subtle colonial movement
that's objectively true you can't that's
generally true
right and they were more liberal
settlers colonialists and they're more
conservative more religious and more
secular but
but that was you know in other words the
zionist movement that was
a left socialist nationalist movement in
the
turn of the 20th century came to the
country with the intention of taking it
over
of judaizing the country in other words
transforming an arab country into a
jewish country
transforming palestine into the land of
israel and that was the agenda so in a
sense
whether you're on the right or on the
left
you had that same political logic you
know the
um it was the left you might say the
labor party that
that founded the state of israel it was
them that
did the ethnic cleansing of 1948 that
destroyed all the palestinian villages
drove half the palestinians out
it was the labor party for people i
think a lot of people will know but
well the nakba was is the is the arab
term for what happened in 1948
we call it the war of independence in
israel they call it the nakba which
means the catastrophe
and in 1948
there was a concerted campaign to
ethnically cleanse the country
because the country had been partitioned
into two states
by the u.n a jewish state than an arab
state but the jews were only a third of
the population
were newcomers to the country and yet
the u.n gave them 56
of the land and the palestinian
indigenous population only got 42
percent
so the palestinians didn't agree and no
colonized people would agree no
colonized people agree that 56
of their country would be given to
somebody else and the u.n had no
authority to give it to to the jews
and there was a war um and in the war
israel had a concerted campaign of
driving the palestinians out
so about 750 000 palestinians were
driven out of the country
and then subsequent to that not in the
heat of battle but after
for 20 years after israel systematically
destroyed
more than 600 entire palestinian
villages towns and urban areas
in order to first of all take their land
of course but to prevent the refugees
from coming back
so from the very beginning this was a
unilateral process
right and basically 1967 which was also
the labor party
was simply the completion of the last
stage of the judaization of the country
they took the west bank east jerusalem
and gaza
so the idea of two states the idea that
these are occupied territories that
someday we can negotiate
and will become a palestinian state was
never in the works it was
not part of the logic the whole logic of
the settler colonial movement was
unilateral
to take the entire country and the
indigenous population who are the
palestinians
until today in israel we don't even use
the word palestinian
because that gives too much
distinctiveness and legitimacy to a
collective we don't recognize
we talk about arabs right in a very
general way right
so that the idea is that the arabs the
indigenous
have no rights they have no collective
existence and
and it's our country exclusively and so
in a sense whether it's the right wing
or the left wing
you know mark twain grew up on a farm
and he used to say my mother was a
liberal
she drowned the kittens like everybody
else but she'd warm the water first
so in a sense you know the labor party
right you know
warm the water and talks to states and
talks nice and human rights
but in fact it's actually the labor
party
that uh conquered the country that
displaced the palestinians
that they conquered the occupied
territories it never agreed to a
two-state because labor
was in power during the oslo peace
process it's labor that's demolished
55 000 palestinian homes it's labor that
built the wall
you know likud and sharon who was then
prime minister was against building the
apartheid wall
it was labored so labor is actually much
more
uh responsible for the situation we have
today
than the likud yeah and it's funny i
mean i i think it was probably oversold
in the united states but i think of um
who is it
rivlin the olympia you know i mean the
president of israel yeah i mean some of
the things he says about
just sort of general civility and polity
across is a country like israel that
comes out radical
it sounds radical and it sounds well to
the left of anything
that any labor politician says it even
when he made sure to appear with
palestinian children and say
hey they're your neighbors you treat
them with respect i mean this is the
type of thing that culturally signifying
is
well to the left in israel and he is in
fact the leader of likud but
a different faction of likud that has
some sense of
of a broader civic space but with no
political clout
no political cap whatsoever so what i
want to
i want to go to talk about the one state
which relates to it but first
how did the activism that you had get so
specific
to to home demolition well
and also explain the home demolition
policy right we were um
you know look like the palestinians
you know the israeli peace movement the
left uh
was invested in the oslo peace process
the sides were beginning in the 90s
it began in 1993 lasted for seven years
um and we had hoped that um you know the
sides are meeting and the negotiating
something would come out we were
doubtful but
there was that hope and then rabin was
assassinated prime minister yitzhak
rabbin in 1995.
netanyahu who ran against the oslo peace
process was elected a few months later
in early 1996 and we understood that the
oslo peace process was a sham
it's never going to lead to anything and
in fact the occupation was reasserting
itself
israel was going back i mean israel
never stopped demolishing homes
you know house demolitions that we focus
on uh is really a part of the ethnic
cleansing and it goes on till this
moment
so as we um in the left decided we had
to re-engage with
resisting the occupation that was coming
back in force
we asked we advised with our palestinian
colleagues
what issue should we really focus on
that would kind of get to the meat
of of the oppression or the repression
and uh the issue of house demolitions
came up all the time
this is one of the most painful parts of
the occupation
where israel not for security reasons
these are not houses of terrorists
which would be the knee-jerk reaction
these are normal
people that want to build homes on their
own land
israel has simply froze palace frozen
palestinian building
in 1967 50 years ago
so for 50 years you know you have kids
your kids have kids
and they have kids and you want to live
somewhere and start a family
palestinians have not been allowed to
build homes for the last 50 years
and when they do of course because you
have to live somewhere
your homes are demolished again 55
000 palestinian homes only in the
occupied territories in 67.
that's on the backdrop of another 60 000
they were demolished in the nakba right
in 1947 48 and after
and thousands more inside israel until
today so we're talking about a a
you know really a a policy of
either inducing emigration of
palestinians if you don't have a home
or confining them to little tiny islands
in the country which is a kind of an
apartheid so it really is an apartheid
instrument
right when okay so the
actually before i get to one state i
want to get to this
other piece of your work which i and
correct me if i'm reading it wrong but
one of the things i really like
is a part of me really shies away
from and i'm not drawing look there's no
i'm not drawing a false equivalency here
one needs to oppose the occupation
period and the siege on gaza and
everything else
but there's a way in which the
conversation about israel palestine
becomes very
specialized i think in a way that robs
us of understanding how it fits into a
bigger supply chain and a bigger
basically just sort of western colonial
system and a bigger security
securitization of the world and so
you know on one hand there's you know
obviously
like some people in my family which is
well you know it's
israel and we have an identity and we
can do you know we just need to do what
we do which is actually some of my
i think some of the initial critiques i
have of identity politics and certain
manifestations arise from the
tremendous misuse of identity politics
and defense of israeli apartheid
then you know conversely i think there
are some people who uh
have you know it's inevitable that at
times there's going to be
if not outright anti-semitism shades of
anti-semitism
and a conspiratorial understanding of
this
but you've talked about the israeli
government
and the occupation and israelization
is really of course in and of itself a
horrible
distinct crime but also
a forerunner almost a horrifying
infomercial of a world where western
governments are
securitizing borders where they're
policing refugees where they're detained
all governments pardon me uh
explain that that more sort of
security economic supply chain way of
understanding the israeli occupation and
how it fits into the bigger picture
well i wrote a book called war against
the people
in which i place really the israeli you
know israel over palestine is a
microcosm of the global north over the
global south right
that's why i was saying western and in
in um
you know but we all live in a you know
global
capitalist economy right right we're all
living the same system whether you're
western or not western or chinese or
whatever
because for what it's worth i mean yeah
in the west in that sense i realized
yeah it is sloppy because right
dubai is western i would talk about
capitalists capitalism
and everybody that's better in one way
or another
capital domination whether it's state
capitalism like china
or uh you know corporate capitalism like
here yes
the point is that in this capitalist
system especially
the neoliberal system in the last 50
years it's closing down more and more
more and more people are excluded
80 percent of humanity lives on less
than 10 dollars a day
and even you know the global south uh
is extending into the global north you
have the occupy movement here
because young children you know middle
class kids of
uh of the global north are also being
excluded there's no more job
security they can't get housing you know
they have these
huge loans uh you know they're uh so
they're being excluded so as the system
closes down
all over the world and resources are
being robbed by corporations so wars
today are resource wars they're not wars
of battles and tanks and ideologies and
countries
there are wars against the people
whether people in the global south that
you want to rob
and repress because they resist that's
counterinsurgency
or people at home like middle class kids
or
minority kids or immigrants or poor
people
that also resist being marginalized and
impoverished
um war against the people ferguson
occupied you can go on and on i mean
it's just just everything
right right right so that so that wars
today are wars against the people
they're fought by police forces and
security forces
and the police forces are being
militarized and if you think about it
your militaries
are being policified they're not
fighting a war in afghanistan and iraq
and
africa and so on they're policing right
so that
all these things are coming together and
in a war against the people
the united states doesn't have the
weaponry and tactics because your
weapons that the pentagon
develops are geared for fighting the
soviet union
not for fighting people in kabul or
brooklyn
and europe hasn't fought colonial wars
for decades
so the go-to country that's what i'm
trying to get at
for war against the people is israel
because
israel has been fighting a war against
the palestinian people for 125 years
it has an occupied territory that you
have to look at as a resource
as a laboratory for um
for testing and perfecting weapons
security systems
surveillance systems tactics of
population control
technologies of repression that are
exported
so the point is the point is the
palestinians are the guinea pigs
but you in the united states because
israel is exporting to the united states
and all over the world israel is the
sixth largest
arms exporter so in a sense you're
the end user you're at the receiving end
of the military and policing
technologies
that are simply perfected on the
palestinians so
it's what i call global palestine and we
have to understand
in a sense it's a great window into
understanding how
how capitalism is enforced and israel is
really in many
not i'm not saying it's the only
enforcer obviously
but israel really has the model of
enforcement and the technologies for it
and even the concept of a security state
that it's trying to
peddle that that really finds a ready
market
in this country and all over the world
so israel really delivers for you
it helps you to repress your own
populations
um you know israel is is now being sued
by the
kosoji family of the journalists that
was killed in istanbul because
the israelis sold the eavesdropping
material to the saudi government
so whether you want to repress your own
people or whether you're a corporation
and a corporate government that wants to
repress people in general
for the for the interests of global
capitalism israel becomes the go-to
country
so in a sense there's a there's a global
uh dimension to this conflict so-called
to the occupation that i think we should
all be aware of
yeah this reminds me i keep thinking and
i'll send it to you if uh
if you haven't read it yet but achilla
bimbe who's a cameroonian philosopher
wrote a piece in 2016
called the age of humanism is coming to
an end i believe and he
in a similar way he tracked he said
basically gaza is the microcosm of
everything that's happening right now
that's right
and and the point that's right and the
point that i try to make is that the
gazans
uh again are simply the guinea pigs so
what i try to say to people is you know
you should be concerned about
palestinians
because they're palestinians that are
suffering for human rights and
and so on right but in a sense as your
here in new york or the u.s as your
police forces and security forces are
being israelized
um you know the jewish voice for peace
um organization has a campaign called
deadly exchange that's trying to
document the israeli training of
american police and
arming of american police
as your security forces are being uh
israelized
you are being palestinianized you the
people
right and so in a sense there's a very
real connection between the people on
the receiving end in gaza
and the same people on the receiving end
of the same weapons and tactics
in new york city right so and also
ideologically too
there's an ideological export and
cross-pollination as well
yeah no certainly i mean israel is very
good at hasbro
it's pr and so that's you know that
becomes part of you know
especially hasbro of the global
capitalist system
is around the term security yes you know
because security is kind of a neutral
term of course i want security and of
course i want my government to give it
to me
so it becomes a form of
self-pacification
where you don't see the political
interests
involved in pacifying you and getting
you to conform and repressing you
and so on but you simply see it as
security
and so you willingly accept it so it to
the degree that israel gets people to
accept occupation
is something somehow normal and of
course we're defending against
occupation because
the people of the palestinians are
terrorists and and you make a kind of
common sense
israel is helping i think the the the
the global elites
to package repression as a form of
neutral security that of course we all
well how many people after this note in
revelation
said you know hey if you're doing
nothing wrong there's no problem exactly
versus looking at the systemic problem
of that type of surveillance
um there's two more things i want to
touch on
with you so i want to just say and again
and i like in your work i mean there's
no of course there's
anti-semitism in the world just as
there's racism and every other
poisonous ism and i want to bring in the
palestinian political factions not
because
you know i'm not going to do something
silly but what about hamas question
but i do want to know how concretely so
when i talk about this i say look here's
the reality
the west bank palestinian leadership
which are essentially israeli security
subcontractors
are the only political faction that
exists right now who have any
actual quote unquote power in that
they're nominally in charge of the west
bank but not really
they're the only faction that is totally
on board with the
90s oslo process they're actually the
only ones committed to it
so even if so if you want to believe in
that oslo liberal vision
mahmoud abbas should be your guy that's
right 100
hamas has actually significantly
barricaded on what their position on two
states is
they've absolutely committed atrocities
and frankly they mostly have their hands
filled
trying to manage an open-air prison
where medicine can't get into
is that a decent frame i guess what i'm
saying is i don't want to
look idealized i'm not gonna idealize
anybody and also by the same token look
i uh
in a broad sense i'm not gonna here
here's how i see it look
i'm not gonna pass judgment on how
somebody fights their liberation
struggle
generally conversely if we're going to
have values and norms there's certain
tactics and things that just need to be
categorically opposed and ruled out
whether they're from the israelis or
hamas
but that being said the fundamental
point to me is not that i object to
criticizing hamas
i object to any question that has a
starting point that we're talking about
any type of equivalent power that to me
is the enormous dishonesty of that
question
no there's no symmetry right that's why
i don't like to use the word conflict
right arab israeli conflict right
because that
assumes both sides right we have to
negotiate whereas settler colonialism is
a unilateral process
israel is not negotiating with the
palestinians whether it's
uh whether it's abu mazen or hamas or
anybody right
and so that you know we have to
and and of course israel has managed to
um
to demonize the palestinian resistance
as terrorism
and of course the way terrorism is used
it's only applied to non-state actors
not the states
so israel kills many more civilians and
just
demolishes homes and conquers and
everything then hamas or any
so-called terrorist group but the word
terrorism only
only sticks to a non-state actor that
makes them illegitimate
what we have to do is look at hamas
actions as
as resistance and uh you know in
international law a colonized people has
a right to armed resistance
that being said but we could still like
using the ira as an example
so there's no doubt that the ira needed
to be brought into a negotiations that
led to good friday that
approved the situation in ireland and
they had absolutely the right to resist
and every other
right that we're talking about and again
we can all but we could still say hey
you shouldn't have you know kneecapped
people or planted a bomb or shopping
mall so
that's i'm trying to make it easier
although israel was never held
accountable for doing that well that
goes with israel has a whole campaign of
what's called targeted assassination
rights
that the u.s has adopted right in
different parts of the world it's it's
rudinized
which is illegal international law
extrajudicial killings
the point is that hamas is a political
organization right that's only been
demonized by the united states and
israel
as a terrorist group it's denied the
political aspects
and hamas actually agreed to the
two-state idea right
you know just like in 2006
all the factions of the palestinians
from the left to the right including
hamas and islamic jihad
convened in prison because that's where
the leadership is
and they came up with what's called the
prisoner's document
right that said all the factions agreed
that if israel would generally give up
all
the occupied territories the west bank
east jerusalem and gaza
right which is only 22 of the country
right
um then they would all agree
to uh to a peace agreement for an actual
continuous
two states within 67 lines so but my
only point being is that
i think you know so what i'm saying is
that hamas
has actually pursued a moderate
political line
but in order to avoid all that israel
has demonized it as an extremist
terrorist group and i think well they
have since they
came to power in gaza right since 2006.
i mean they came i think
in an election israel
uh unilaterally declared was not
legitimate even though jimmy carter was
there
and said it was a legitimate election
right and we can condemn
actions and tactics categorically from
anyone is distinct
from political delegitimization because
again like let's face facts here there's
if you if you actually generate a
solution to this crisis
it's gonna involve like every other
diplomatic
process uh people who essentially uh you
know
have uh blood on their hands are gonna
be part of it like table and becky says
you know justice or peace
we opt for peace he made this point with
regards to apartheid he said i
certainly didn't want the icc to come in
and arrest apartheid leaders i needed to
negotiate with them to end
this thing so the same principle applies
go
talk about one state solution in the
final couple of minutes
it appeals to me ideologically i
remember i read tony jutt in the new
york review of books
in college and i said to it was like
look what do i believe in i believe in a
state
where everybody regardless of background
who they are has total
cultural and individual autonomy and all
is
protected under a shared civic law
how could i not support that in the
middle east that's right so what we have
today
in israel is uh the two-state solution
is gone
actually it never existed i mean that
but but it's certainly
you can make the case that with the
collapse of oslo for the last 25 years
it's been gone
so for 25 years we've been floundering
and israel has simply strengthened its
occupation
to a degree that today there already is
one state
right between the mediterranean the
jordan river
there's only one effect of government
right there's only one
army obviously there's only one set of
borders in other words you can't get
into the country from any direction
without going through israeli border
controls
there's only one currency there's only
one infrastructure there's only one
legal system
so by any measure this is already one
country
that israel created but it's an
apartheid state
because you have separate legal regimes
for for for different populations under
the same government so it's like
apartheid
it is apartheid so what we're saying is
okay it's a fairly stark
uh set of options the two-state solution
the weeks
that we accepted in the peace camp and
the palestinians accepted
right is gone or never was so let's stop
talking about it because it's gone
the the uh the option what israel wants
is apartheid one
country with apartheid that i think all
your listeners
uh won't accept i don't think anybody
today would accept apartheid
our viewers too and and your viewers and
the uh
and the so that remains so the the third
option
is to say this okay israel you created
one state
we go along with that we'll go with the
flow fine one state
but it can't be an apartheid regime it
has to be a democratic state
of equal rights for all its citizens now
why there should be such a shocking
idea for americans or people in the west
the democracy
right that is exactly the way out it's
simple
it cuts through things and in fact it
would work
because you know it's funny to say
explain how it would work because i i
know
so many people were right there and they
still have this little voice
and i say to them i said look you know
look at the transition not that south
africa doesn't have perennial problems
but they generated a full democracy
there's no pogroms there's no i mean
people they call them
terrorists and they produce blood stuff
these are all colonial terms
right in fact it sounds funny to say
this with occupation and demolitions and
repression and wars
but in fact our the country that i'm
talking about between the metro and
jordan river
actually functions not badly today you
know
20 percent of israeli citizens are
palestinians right there's never been
intifadas inside israel they're fairly
well they're second-class citizens
but they're you know they're well
integrated in that sense and even in the
occupied territory you know
before israel closed the occupied
territories
almost 30 years ago so palestinians
don't have access to the israeli economy
anymore and impoverish them
120 130 000 palestinians
every day would come into israel to work
they spoke hebrew
the last generation of palestinians was
much more integrated into israel
than their kids are because their kids
have been locked out of israel for the
last
30 years so that in fact we had and we
have
to some degree a functioning country i
mean we're not
i mean this is true there's fighting but
a lot of the fighting
like in gaza is actually initiated
is actually initiated by well
is that netanyahu take off my coat i'm
sorry about that it's okay
i didn't think it was gonna ring right
it's all right i thought the ring was
off
and the point i'm trying to make is that
is that the um
actually the violence if you want to
call it that or the warfare or the
has been all has been initiated by
israel you know the wars
the the occupation um the the
the closure of gaza into like a prison
right
um you know i just want to be really
clear that when you call gaza an
open-air prison you know in the united
states this is
first of all that's an objective fact
and secondly david cameron the former
british prime minister called it that
so outside of the united states there is
no conversation
in mainstream politics about what this
is this is a two plus two equals four
statement
but the bottom line all i want to say is
that this idea that somehow we're
enemies
we'll never live together we'll kill
each other the palestinians will kill
the jews
simply isn't it isn't true i think these
two peoples actually
um there's been a lot of research we
have our economies are very
complementary
palestinians have a very vibrant
high-tech economy
they're into telecommunications it's
repressed but it's there
there are more if you take all the
palestinians in the world and all the
israelis in the world there are more
palestinians and universities today
they're a highly educated population
they have a tremendously wealthy
educated diaspora right behind them
that blacks in south africa didn't have
so they have resources and they have an
interest
what we're trying to do with the one
state idea is to say let's build a
country that's a win-win
we're not excluding anybody we're not
destroying anything we're not
we're transforming an apartheid regime
into a democratic country in which it's
good for everybody
so if you're an israeli you can continue
to speak hebrew
nobody's going to close the hebrew
university you can live in hebron if you
want to you know but the country will be
integrated
and and people will be equal and in that
kind of a situation the economy will
grow refugees will come back
in that kind of a situation there's no
motivation
for bloodshed or one community to attack
the other community it's a win-win for
everybody
right and i remember a professor of mine
one of my ir professors he said
you know if you look at uh
car theft rings in israel-palestine you
could see that even in the worst of
times israelis and palestinians can work
really well together the criminals yeah
very well yeah
criminals know what they're doing um how
can people help and get involved if
they're interested jeff halper
well this is a palestinian-led movement
we call it the one democratic state
campaign
for a single state it's palestinians and
israelis but led
of course by palestinians and
we have a facebook page right now one
democratic state campaign
we're working on on a website we're
gonna launch this movement probably in
april
so we're not all set up yet we've been
spending the last two years
formulating a program a 10-point program
that i think is very is a very good
program
which you can find on the facebook page
uh and then you know
people can contact me or contact us
through the through the face
through the facebook page we have an
email which is contact
at onedemocraticstate.org
and uh you know we're at the at the um
you know at the ground level right now
so you know people want to get involved
the good grounds ground up not the
howard schultz one
