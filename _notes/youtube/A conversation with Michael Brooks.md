in LA April 20th along with the great
Ana Kasparian and the great Nando Vela
it's my pleasure
oh cool really cool that you uh you had
Anika barren and non Nando on the show
but don't ask me to come on live show
it's fine
am I am I this is the first time we're
ever talking but then but this is the
beginning of a great bromance you know
that yes I know we both our hair lines
are both a little scuffed you know and
our opinions are very similar to one
another so you know I love I love
leftist Circle Jerks so that's why I'm
very excited to have you on even though
I disagree with like everyone on the
left for the most part except for a lot
of your takes so you know I'm very
excited you were
probably the most requested person after
the fall out with Kyle kolinsky but we
had him on after after his fans asked me
like a gajillion times to come on the
show I finally got him after begging him
for months he came on the show finally
and then we had like a little like a
brief debate about anti-fascism and and
freedom of speech and he got like kind
of uncomfortable
and ever since then he just hasn't
really been responding to my TMI I'll
get into my Obama mode nob peace between
you guys it's fine I think it's probably
really busy anyway but you know I'm very
excited to have you on we're gonna talk
about a bunch of stuff starting with I I
hope you're comfortable if you're not if
you want to talk about this particular
subject or anything like that if you're
like let's go oh alright so right off
the bat I was originally gonna talk
about how Jesse Smollett is innocent and
we're really excited that the criminal
justice system is working perfectly and
then maybe maybe we could talk about off
of that maybe we could perhaps talk
about the the Russia investigation
because I saw your interview with Matt
tabi and you are one of the few leftists
who along side with myself I have been
looking at it fairly critically and you
you guys that the majority report we're
also criticizing the the liberal
fascination with with Russia gate and
and you know the Muller investigation
and they assume that like a you
know a government a Conservative
government g-man was gonna go out and
actually save our our republic or
something it was just like a very weird
fantasy that I never quite understood
you know it's very a historical
perspective but any in any case I just
wanted to hear what your thoughts are
briefly so that people here know on
Jessie smaller Jon smiling no Jessie
smaller and how he's in
and and how is a good case study in read
a article before you tweet about
it that's all I'll say because I'm dying
obviously there's a there's an increase
in fact in hate crimes in this country
but uh if you read that you're like
wait it was below freezing in Chicago
and these guys were carrying each bag
aha what but anyways my I was triggered
because he claimed that he was craving
Subway sandwiches at 2:00 a.m. which is
this Scott like if you're gonna
lie I mean if you're gonna set up a hate
crime scene at least like I don't at
least have the decency to say something
like Chicago related like deep-dish
pizza or like who the would go and
who would be crazy let me send a special
love slash message of some of my most
important people and say deep-dish
pizza my position reads not change but
yes I agree with you I just know that
it's like a Chicago fan favorite isn't
it while people are you know
when Chicago I had to do something
Chicago last year everyone could try it
and I was very proud to say like yeah I
was there and I did not eat that so
but yeah man I mean I think like my view
on Russia is this okay definitely they
should release the whole report 100%
because it's about transparency and I'm
sure there'll be some in there
that's embarrassing
my main opinion on Russia has always
been that it's like if there is anything
there you know it's it's good fella's
not Manchurian Candidate you know what
I'm saying like it's gonna be about
money laundering it's gonna be about
like that and I do think though and
I and I think like there actually are
some some differences definitely like so
this isn't about trusting bill Barr not
saying the court shouldn't be fully
released but I think the bottom line is
that even if right let me stake this
really radically
even if some of the most wild tom
clancy's scenarios that people like
rachel maddow were talking about were
more true than they appear to be I'm
still gonna say that the way the media
related to this story and the way that a
lot of Democrats related to this story
was a fundamental problem because you
hit on it before they were waiting for
an outside source to save them from the
crisis of Donald Trump and I understand
that psychologically like I get it right
like Trump really is that bad actually
more the point the Republicans really
are that bad but this whole fixation on
you know this is the subversion and this
guy's gonna come in and save us and the
secretive Tories and all the that
took us away from what you know name the
conversation you want to have capitalism
race and equality
you know diminished opportunities
xenophobia whatever that led along its
way to institutional power despite being
in the minority and the most
undemocratic impossible perfect even
that that's a good democratic one you
don't even got to be that radical that's
a hundred percent right yes and so and
so you know it's like I said with Taibbi
you know and I stand by this line like
the Russians didn't make a cop murder
Eric garner and and I mean that is like
a stand-in for the obsession with this
story was a problem in and of itself now
it does appear that this has been you
know as of now it's a flop so that makes
it even worse the only third thing I'd
add though where I am different mother
on the left is I don't have any problem
if you you'd like you know I did
something to come yeah if you want to
use it it's a kneecap Trump and
it's effective that that's cool I no
problem with it but I don't think it was
particularly effective and I think there
was
you know in fact as it stands now we
handed him some juicy to like go on
about for the next 18 months but that's
my basic take on okay so I agree with
almost every single thing that you've
said plenty because like I've tweeted
out similar thing so it's like it's not
like it's not like Vladimir Putin's
interest in the United States was even
if the even if all the conspirators are
true it's not like if Vladimir Putin's
interest in the United States were so
that you know we we continuously
increase our attention on our immigrant
population here by by advancing white
nativist immigration policies by you
know giving gigantic tax cuts to
corporations at a time when they were
already insanely profitable like totally
unnecessary tax cuts to corporations of
the wealthy like none of these are none
of these are Vladimir Putin policies
like you can't even it but these
are actually the the horrific outcomes
of having GOP assert power and dominance
and control over the American body
politic so you know and and more
importantly than that our our system has
already insanely if a couple
million dollars in ad spend could could
you know sway the American population to
vote for a syphilitic narcissistic hack
an outright failure fail son
real estate to defeat the the
best possible centrist candidate that
the Democratic Party was 100% behind so
obviously our institutions are
broken and it's time to enact some
drastic changes rather than serve up the
same style of candidate but just in a
different shade of color like Kamala
Harris or potentially even worse than
that put up like serially abusive and
creepy Joe Biden you you think so you
think you believe the syphilis theory of
Donald Trump I just like to say it I
think he hit I think he is his brain
damages like I don't know if it's
because of old age but he is becoming
increasingly more deranged I'm not gonna
this from Felix like I'll give him this
I I'm on the I'm on the Felix Biederman
camp where I think the only the best way
to track whether Donald Trump's mental
faculties are intact is by looking at
his comebacks and looking at his like
snippy
you know name-calling and and they're
not as good anymore
I mean he had to in the last so like the
best ones he had the last eight months
were yeah that sweet he like eight like
seven months ago cuz John Kerry was like
coming out being like hey what the
like everybody gets to pretend that they
might run for president why am I not
giving any shine so Kerry it was like I
might run and uh and Trump tweeted out
and this was like this was definitely
one of those ones because you're
absolutely right he's on off his game
and it was like watching like a guy who
would had just like Tora I'll use a
Tennyson Alan I feel like he just tore
up the tour for a year and like one like
on all four services all four Grand
Slams and I just fell off and drop that
Oh like the top fifty which is basically
what it's been like with his insults and
then you saw this tweet you're like oh
he's still got some left cuz he's
like he tweeted I was like I heard that
John Kerry might run for president I
should be so lucky
and then he wrote bad but the 2022 the
2020 Democratic candidates are looking
to be are shaping up to be really good
doctor dot for me and when he called by
in a very low IQ individual a couple
weeks ago and thing he said about Howard
Schultz or he's like self-described not
the brightest guy in the room Howard
Schultz doesn't have the guts to take me
on I was like I sort of I don't know I
just I feel like his mental faculties
are yeah I think we're gonna have a like
a Reagan style second term Trump if the
Democratic Party doesn't get it
together which it doesn't seem like it's
going to get its together we can
talk about that in a second but I just
wanted to
add I wanted to ask you a question
because my perspective on the Russia
gate stuff is that I was I I called out
the hysteria quite frequently I talked
about certain facts I think the
investigation was absolutely warranted
given the facts that were presented and
anyone who say that it was not is being
intellectually dishonest
but even beyond that now that the the
report has been released at a bar and
then we have like the four-page memo or
whatever from bar I think the Democrats
do everything in their power to use this
continue to use this and milk this
politically but just move away as
quickly from the election meddling as
possible and I think that that was the
single biggest tactical error that they
made I don't have any issue with
conducting long and very expensive
investigations into the president
because that is precisely a Republican
move and therefore it is a smart move
it's a tactical decision look at what
the they did with Benghazi Benghazi
took more time ok the Benghazi
investigations concluded that there was
no wrongdoing shocker that the
government did not find any wrongdoing
with other parts of the government and
and yet it was a it was a longer
investigation than 9/11 and it was a
longer investigation than Watergate and
the JFK assassination combined and the
only reason for why they did that was
because they wanted to attack Hillary
Clinton who's terrible and and you know
obviously we're not big fans of her or
anything like that but it was obviously
a political move to weaponize that
investigation and it absolutely right
sir what really I don't know because a
lot of people conflate my views which
are very much further to the left and
the rest of TYT so that's why I'm like
used to people always being like no I
know you're not my girl and she's not
I mean Hillary that's no one's really
messing with Hill but uh yeah I know I
agree with you man I think um if they
can use it to their advantage they
should and I think the way you do it now
is definitely saying that like you know
released the report for sure and at the
same time you know look I don't really I
basically tapped out of this like two
years ago and I've had almost nothing to
say about it I mean I've said definitely
you know I've done the like for a long
time I've done the Rachel Maddow like
Russia Russia Russia Russia you know
like all right whatever it's ridiculous
and I'm also I agree with you like the
idea that you know it's complete figment
of our imagination like no there's
something like and again the reason I
see that is something there is because
I'm looking at like the dumb like
the Don junior meeting which isn't like
some great like thriller that's
just like a dumb kid who's part
of a sleazy family who sees some
opportunity but whatever cool
investigated but yeah they should
definitely pivot off of it I think but
there are additional like not to be as
someone who was anti Russia I have now
turned I've almost flipped the script on
this and now unlike the rest of the left
I feel like we should be pushing
for more transparency and then beyond
that we should continue to weaponize it
results of this investigation never
concede to these but
then also use specific things that came
out of that investigation that maybe
were not related to that incredibly
narrow focus of oh did Russia collude
with the Trump campaign and and focus on
campaign finance violations focus on the
Michael Cohen testimony like these are
these are also things that you could
100% hit are obviously criminal
president on and a from the beginning
like if you framed as like the
Emirati connection the Mercer family
connection that everything connection to
Trump I do I do think though a big
reason
why some people wouldn't be inclined to
do that is because of you opens it up to
everything
then you're gonna implicate basically
everybody besides Bernie Sanders I saw
here another I know didn't want to do
that but I think twice but that's the
who got who got like a plea deal or
something but like he was directly
related to Paul Manafort I mean they
work together didn't they like
that like the only difference is
because like Trump is surrounded by and
is like a Sopranos supporting
cast dude but every single part like the
DC culture and politics it's like you
can show up with a bag of cash and there
is a legal way for you to you know even
mana for it's a good example of that
right like tons of consultants work for
foreign dictatorships and corporations
and also and oligarchs all of that the
only difference is that that dude also
insists on major tax fraud and
all these other things which by the way
he would have gotten away with if you
didn't work for Trump but like there's
plenty of people in DC who do the same
it's just they fill out their forms
properly ya know yeah there is it's kind
of like the the college administration
scandal or it's like yeah yeah
seventy-five million dollars or if you
paid two and a half million dollars to
Harvard you're your son is
absolutely gonna get in and that
is a very legal and aboveboard way of
making sure you spear dick your fail son
into into one of the top institutions in
this country but if you try to use a
back-channel and you've spent five
hundred thousand dollars and you don't
have any other way to get you know a
legacy admission going then you're
then they'll conduct like a fake
investigation and obliterate like a
small percentage of the petite
bourgeoisie so that they can make it
seem as though they're doing something
and that this process is totally legal
and it's crazy
yeah so so that's all that's totally
but yeah I'm just I'm just very
much in favor of continuing not the
Russia gate hysteria cuz I was dumb as
because that was more so to absorb
the Democratic Party of any sort of
guilt and to absolve Clinton of any sort
of personal guilt even though
they failed at every level because they
couldn't even defeat the most you know
the most defeatable candidate
that's why they focused on election
meddling rather than ya know of course
I'm with you like yeah go go after this
on everything I mean that
was part of the reason that it started
to annoy me was also because it's like
you're leaving all this on the
table so yeah I'm with of course
definitely yeah all right so now the
word now that we're done now that we've
heard your take do you have anything
else say about the Russia gay stuff or
cuz I'm also kind of pissed off at like
all the all the leftists that I that I
look up to and some that I looked down
at or some some who consider
themselves leftist or definitely not and
and maybe mourn as ball running around
and like you know gloating about how
right they were and and what like
exonerating Trump put the most criminal
president you know what I mean
all right maybe not as bad as like
george w bush but still like very much I
mean look I think you've gotta figure
out how to I don't I mean look people
can do what they want and they can
Duncan spike the football and every
other sports metaphor right now whatever
I yeah
to me that's like and I agree with you
and I'll be like you I'm not gonna name
names there's there's definitely people
that I know and have a huge amount of
respect for but I would never in my life
you know talk to Tucker Carlson in a way
that wasn't a fight right period um so
yeah I mean I agree with you yeah
one thing and reaching out to their
audience is one thing but going on
Tucker Carlson show exclusively to
on the left and therefore legitimize his
perspective is entirely different and go
on his show I think even you go on a
show like you know what I'll you can say
like oh guy like Mark bloody show and
just look talks about macroeconomic
issues and gives a left perspective that
I think that's cool yeah but if you're
gonna go out you know and and to be and
to be fair like sometimes like I like
you know they do debt they do pushback
against Fox but like the bottom line is
is that Tucker Carlson is state
television functionally and definitely a
crypto-fascist and you know that's a
political opponent period on the other
hand and the only other thing I'd say
about this and I want to be really clear
because I don't mean some like nerdy
like you know oh you gotta look the
fetch think you where they take you I
mean everybody knows my work knows that
that is not how I think about things I
am power and value driven and facts are
important but not like you know they're
never gonna tell you how things should
be or how they can be right or how they
should be rather but I will say this
like there are people definitely on both
sides of that Russia story and I think
you know definitely I do think people
like if I have to lay my marker
down I think Matt Taibbi it's a lot more
correct than a Rachel Maddow right no no
no even Michael Tracy is more correct
than than Rachel Maddow absolutely as an
app is without a doubt yeah that's
objectively true yeah I would say at any
time you're in a position whatever your
and and there were a lot of people like
this on on both sides of the equation
now I think people who are skeptical
have more justification they've
definitely been more validated but I
think if you're in a position where like
I was in a position where when that and
you were in a position where that report
dropped and even if the most wild
happens that like we knew
wouldn't happen like Trump got indicted
or whatever we could be like cool
that's great
Trump I mean I didn't actually
expect that to be honest but awesome
glad to be kinda proven wrong whatever
but when you had people who either now
because it's not looking good for that
narrative and now it's like release the
full report which I agree with and I
think the full report won't be good for
Trump there's a reason Republicans are
hiding it at the same time I doubt it's
gonna radically alter the narrative and
frankly if they release the full report
then it's gonna be I need to see all the
source material you know what I mean
it's just gonna be ongoing because they
can't take an L and there is an L to
take and then conversely there were
people who definitely on the other side
of the equation if that report came out
and went the other way they would have
to create a whole other narrative to not
accept that so I just think it's really
good with things like this like be a
little agnostic like have an
analysis look at the politics of it I
can tell you that
MSNBC's relationship to the story was
ridiculous even if Jared Kushner got
indicted right yeah like a position
where you're just staking a lane on
something that's so you know pretty
cut-and-dry you'll end up getting
and it's not a good way to do an ALICE
that's the last thing I have to say
about all right all right so this is the
moment this is my gotcha moment now that
we're done with that part of the foreign
policy why do you hate Jewish people and
the and the totally Democratic State of
Israel that is not a violet ethnos state
led by the the increasingly more
militant Bibi Netanyahu sorry I meant
that as a question like Bibi Netanyahu
has done nothing wrong just like Jesse
smollett and Donald Trump let's see
that's a great question
Hasan thank you why do I hate Jews have
you ever spent time in Israel no no I
have yeah I actually studied in Turkey
but I
no man I mean honestly like Israel was
never that really look complicated be
honest with you like I do have you know
Jewish background on and 1/2 my family
and it actually you know I don't talk
about this when I'm on TV or something
cuz I actually don't like I I don't I
have a critique of identity politics
when it's used to of a talking about it
as an example a nation-state that does
things that aren't acceptable and that's
the point
everybody able should be able to talk
about it clearly and forcefully but you
know it is important to me identity wise
you know personally and familiarly and
culturally even in some ways and maybe
even some ways spiritually but the
bottom line is is like I grew up with a
certain set of political values men I
think everybody I I think the base of my
politics you know people get into all
these rabbit holes and I'm definitely a
socialist but if I was to say were super
simple ever since I was like a kid and
got tapped into these things and through
a combination of my own life experience
of dealing with things like poverty and
also the books I read the people I was
around the you know events I was exposed
to it was I really don't like
racism on a super basic level I'm not
talking like super whoa whatever just
the idea that you would design any
system or some pretty one group of
people because of a trade you know is
fundamentally subjugated is gusting and
that and I don't you know again I don't
think that should be a special
position for anybody the whole that
should be obvious but it isn't and I'm
also you know opposed funding I want
economic justice for everybody you know
justice is fake if it doesn't include
economic just and so when I first
started getting aware of Israel and
Palestine you know it's like I'm
fascinated by the politics of the region
how complicated it is even I like the
power games I like the different
dynamics of it and I've spent some time
there you know including briefly in
Palestine and in Israel but you know the
bottom line is you cannot ask
like me who has the values I have to
support that state as it is now and in
fact anytime somebody who is a fellow
liberal or a leftist not a fellow
liberal whatever a leftist but even
liberals who profess you know they're
they're very opposed to racism in the
United States they're very like you know
hip on various types of like rights
lingo and this and that and then all of
a sudden in Israel it's a big exception
and to me it's not and it never has been
and they have to explain to me that to
tell me why Israel is a special case for
them because it's not a special case for
me same values that guide my politics
everywhere are applied to that stretch
of desert lands in that part of the
world and you know dassit I'm afraid I
had to report you to the ADL for for
spreading anti-semitism I'm sorry I'm
sorry
I'm shocked that I haven't been reported
to the ADL thus far but probably because
the platforms that I routinely criticize
Israel on have actual partnerships with
the with lobbyists and the State of
Israel and literally routinely take down
Palestinian like pro-palestinian
Facebook groups and also censor my
videos that and like this is not a
conspiracy theory like they literally
censor my videos that I've done on
Israel so that's probably why the ADL
hasn't caught wind of my my perspective
even though they are both good and bad
at times but I think they go they
overreact a little bit when it comes to
the the criticism of Israel is the same
as anti-semitism is a totally real thing
and also and and you know and to me like
one of the reasons that I'm very wary of
the misuse and cynical deployment of
woke nests and this and that to advance
bad politics is because
this is the that I grew up arguing
about about Israel you know what I mean
when I would say like hey like of course
I know nobody should be harmed we're not
talking about attacks on Israeli
civilians or anything like that we're
talking about justice and rights and
democracy and freedom of movement for
everybody there a period and people
would hit me back with like yeah but if
you ever been there and been in that
community and did this and this and this
and this identity
nah that no and you know it's a
problem like I will say this I have no
idea why but the booking young Israeli
satellite TV and I don't censor myself
so yeah I've seen the debates you've had
on i-24 right isn't that what it is yeah
stuff on there that I've ever said in
like out era or France French TV or
whatever yeah well I think like in a
very weird way and I don't know enough
about Israeli media to back this up but
in a very weird way it's almost like
it's more difficult to bring about or to
deliver any sort of structural criticism
towards Israel any sort of meaningful
structural criticism towards Israel in
the United States media landscape than
it is anywhere else in the world
including like Israeli media that's
definitely mostly true for sure and even
on now it's changing because the other
dynamic that's happening in Israel right
now is that Netanyahu like it's totally
true that Israel's both like an
occupying force and an apartheid state
objectively and also that within 67
borders it's a pretty developed state in
a lot of ways now there's all sorts of
problems and there is definitely not
full equal rights for Arab Israelis but
I'm talking like on the level of like it
has been a place where like you know
former prime minister goes to jail like
election
or what like there's a ton of corruption
there's a ton of whatever but it's it is
a place where like you're saying there
you could say what you want that has
been increasingly under assault in the
last several years particularly and
Netanyahu's corruption scandal and
indictments it's not this money
it's actually extorting good press
coverage so that's under threat in
Israel but historically yeah man you
could read like Gideon Levy who granted
has to travel with the security team and
faces a ton of death threats but he's a
columnist for Haaretz and he's like more
clear more Shaba sharp and less
equivocating about what Israel does the
Palestinians than anybody in I mean
certainly any mainstream American media
and also you know politicians in Israel
who are you know not the same as like
Gideon Levy's a heroic like truth teller
type of journalist but like Prime
Minister's like a hoot Omer and a hoob
Rock they themselves use the word
apartheid
they said it so definitely the
conversation there at least until
recently I mean now it's getting I mean
if you're even like an Israeli liberal
now let alone if you're part of like the
actual left and geese movement it's a
pretty bad time for you to be there I
think Israel in some ways like it always
was what it was but if you look at this
current wave of Netanyahu going back to
like 2008 he in some ways is the
precursor to all this that we're
seeing with the new far-right and Trump
in or bond and and Britain and all of
these places a lot of this and you know
you could add Putin and both snarl and
Modi and all of that but a lot of it was
a lot of template in some ways was set
in Netanyahu's Israel yeah I I remember
you said something about 70 percent of
us
Jews are against the apartheid state I
believe you used that statistic well
they're against the they're against the
occupation
definitely said 70% of Jews do not have
like you know like my position which is
I think we need to figure out a way of
having the full continuous state that is
democratic and safe for everybody I
don't know how you do that is just
logistical like you literally can't
create a two-state solution because the
settlements right like it's just it's
impossible
so in fact ironically it would actually
be a legitimate humanitarian problem to
take that many Jewish people out of
their homes now right so you need a full
that's my view federal defender
terrorists a huge that's absolutely but
there's also definitely bull who you
know got cheap homes and whatever and
you know the bottom line is is like yes
if they can't live democratically and
cooperative Palestinians then that's too
bad for them but they're not you know
like they're people that you can't just
like bulldoze their houses and think so
like you got to stop all of that and
create a safe democracy for every single
person there but yeah most so what was
happening in that debate was I wasn't
like no I wouldn't say most American
Jewish voters have my view on it but a
lot of them a majority of them
definitely don't have the AIPAC view on
it and so what that woman was doing in
her you know fascist claptrap was
basically trying to say like me first of
all it being both supported Netanyahu
and you're anti-semitic was basically
what she was saying so I was like look
we could run in the field from me
through even like you know total
centrist whatever like J Street and you
and I didn't say this cuz I don't really
play these games but frankly like you as
a Gentile in Colorado are lying
and don't know what the you're
talking about
yeah ring I mean we all know we all know
how how Netanyahu loves the rubbed
shoulders with people who are definitely
not anti-semitic so you know we're
he just I mean it's it's it's quite
apparent at this point that he just
doesn't give a about anything he
just wants to he just wants to take over
as much land as he possibly can and and
use that militancy to to secure as much
political power as he can in a similar
fashion to how he rose the political
power right so he's just continuing on
that trend without any care for for the
wives of the Palestinians and the
Israelis that he's putting in danger so
you know I mean who is definitely an
extremist authoritarian leader and
there's no and so you know like it's
that's actually a good example of like
making some distinctions right like and
the parties that are rising up or are
even worse than he is yeah you know it
was like to the left of him back in like
the 90s but it's now further to the
right than an example like a Omer he did
an incredible amount of damage to
Palestinians and Lebanese people when he
was Prime Minister and that's you know
any conversation about him as to include
that and on the flip side
he definitely and he was a two-state guy
obviously he's a good you know Israeli
Patriot but that dude is like you know
if you can't see the difference between
how he spoke about Palestinians and what
he said needed to happen versus
Netanyahu you're not seeing like there's
like the big picture reality of what it
took to create the State of Israel and
then there's like the smaller shorter
frame of like this has really
expanded in the last ten years in a wild
way yeah but I am I'm I mean if there's
only one a little like positive note on
this is that I feel like and you guys
have done incredible coverage on this
issue as well I think I highly recommend
the majority report coverage on Ilhan
Omar in general the fact that like
progressive media is gaining momentum
outside of like the mainstream media
circles Tim yes cover
Tim Tim yes coach what
forth but on this crazy no I just I I
loved the the perspective that both you
and Sam had on no no no no you know in
like I mean it's when I say it it's one
thing because people immediately it in
an almost similar fashion to in Hanna
mark and be like Oh Turkish
Muslim guy of course he's being
anti-semitic being even of like remotely
Muslim descent even if you're like
culturally Muslim means that you're
probably anti-semitic which is an
Islamophobic trope right so when it's
when it's Jewish people that are talking
about it it holds a different different
kind of weight I know that's it Paul but
what are you gonna do okay you
gotta fight fire with fire
so no no I agree I see I I agree with
you look it's a dialectic but I think
you know at some point I want to create
room for like as an example like Alana
Marsh be able to be at the front and
center of this issue even as like a
non-jewish person but no doubt I mean
yeah man I thought it was actually
awesome the way uh you know pretty much
everybody in like the alternative zone
had her back and I mean I you know she's
definitely my favorite member of
Congress oh yeah me too 100%
badass he's amazing
I mean she's got it she's just got so
much courage and like yeah she's
dope man she's the one for sure yeah
yeah it's it is it is rather remarkable
that that the cowardly Democrats grow a
spine when it comes to attacking one of
their own technically one of the most
popular freshmen Congress women in their
in their freshman class they're so quick
the dropper and and go to a pack
and and suck up as best as they possibly
can it was just like it was disgusting
to see those disgusting disgusting it
was it's so stupid politically
it's so stupid in every capacity
it's disingenuous is dishonest it's
disgusting
and the fact that they were using
Islamophobic tropes to just like
deflect any accurate structural
criticism against the state of israel
but more importantly than that moneyed
influence on us legislation from a
foreign power like that's insane
I think they've gotten to a point where
it's so far out there that that
even like the average a political person
is starting to realize like what the
like okay I don't I don't even know
if I like this Elin amar person too much
because she's wearing a hijab she looks
a little different than me I'm a little
afraid of Muslims but it's not like she
said anything that crazy just said like
you know a pack a lobbying group has
like moneyed influence over over
legislation and and legislature right no
definitely not and its objective I mean
it's it's ridiculous it's mean and it
can again like in a in a sane world like
she put out a tweet in 2012 was she
deleted where it's like oh yes that you
shouldn't put it that way
right so disgusting and
dishonest that you can you know it's
another problem with I mean in this case
just like the attempts of politically
assassinate her by these people so
you've got to just fight that but also
sometimes I think like people are so
reactive and non-strategic that you
can't sometimes just have like you know
what we could just like and everybody
could get better because the intentions
here are good and people could figure
this out
will you give me one second man I will
pick something up in my yeah go ahead
break you're fine with like staying on
right I don't want to like take up more
time to like like take a break and then
like another so okay perfect all right

all right so
oh my god fish is going nuts guys
alright so Michael will be back in a
little bit but I hope you guys are
enjoying that conversation we
haven't even gone to like the IDW stuff
so I'm gonna quickly move forward with
the now that we're done with the Israel
part of the conversation I'm gonna
quickly move forward to the the
intellectual darkweb stuff because he's
done a lot of research in this field and
I think you guys will all appreciate us
you know shooting the on shooting
the on like you know our favorite
intellectual Grif there's like Ben
Shapiro and and Sam's Sam Harris which
I've heard him talk about a lot he also
debated sargon of akkad so we're gonna
talk about that I'm not gonna ask him
about article 13 I'm just trying to keep
it in his ballpark of like things that
he's interested in not asking about the
train wrecks debate peels Batman okay
everybody
suck my entire okay if you
want him to go on the train
wrecks debate you can ask him personally
I asked a destiny before okay I'll ask
him when he comes back but stop
de railing the conversation with your
dumb ass chats okay Jesus Christ come on
there's there's sorry Michael
there's like 3,000 people in here and
all of them are just like being little
babies non-stop asking about dumb
alright yeah anyway okay alright so um
we've talked about the
israeli-palestinian conflict a little
bit we talked about anti-semitism and
like how it's used as a deflection I
want to move over to another thing that
I really wanted to talk to you about to
two other subjects if you have the time
okay yeah fifteen ourselves okay chat he
didn't say 50
he said 15 okay one five oh okay we are
we're very upset but it's it's fine
we'll survive all right all right guys
okay so let's move quickly to the
intellectual dark web and
you and I share a lot of experience with
ya we have even more information than I
do and I would love to talk to you about
that like who your favorite grifters are
and all that stuff because you debated
do more man will do more fun and then
and then briefly talk about Lula as well
in Brazil you got it you have the lovely
brain man yeah I mean I I'm not super
familiar with what has gone on in Brazil
so I definitely want to get to that
because I know that this is like your
foreign policy is like something that
you certainly excel in and I want
to talk to about Turkey too god damn it
alright we'll talk about Turkey later
it anyway but yeah intellectual
darkweb grifters okay yeah wrote a book
I'm writing I'm like finishing it up now
it's gonna be out I think like but yeah
I'm in the middle of it yeah okay
like maybe yeah so here's some
publishing it with zero books and
basically what the book is sort of I
mean what I'm honestly trying to figure
out is on one hand like you know I'm I'm
tee off on people and these guys are
and it's funny and you know
like the book is definitely gonna have
some of that for sure but I'm also
trying to like figure out you know how
to deal with these people because I do
think that they still have a pretty out
size than mostly really negative
influence you know particularly the
spaces were in you know I'm saying like
when I go out with normal people they
ask me like even like hey what are you
writing a book on if I say like the IDW
they don't know what the I'm
talking about which is ben shapiro they
might know ben shapiro they might know
sam harris they might know jordan
Peterson but the way I've been
like basically here's what I think it is
the way the if we broke the right up
into like a couple of different
quadrants right so there's one part of
the rock eight is basically Neil overtly
alright identitarian whatever that group
is very terrifying it's very powerful
right now and it's definitely connected
to the IDW but it's not exactly the same
thing right
although the item W can definitely be a
conduit to that then there's like you're
Oleg arc you know politics where you
know it's always gonna have a lot of
power just because there's money behind
that but there's that many like normal
people that are gonna get super stoked
at the end of the day about like reading
a Koch brothers book about why they
shouldn't pay taxes and then there's
still like a segment of like religious
people who are right-wing but I think
what the IDW is like even if the ivw
disappears like as a marketing gimmick
the way the types of arguments they're
making that's gonna be like the
that you and I are gonna argue our whole
lifetime when we deal with people who
are like on the right but not like
overtly fast not not like saying that
they're Richard Spencer and not just a
lobbyist for an oil company or some of
the things to earth is flat right like
this fourth category is gonna be all the
arguments you hear from these people are
gonna be proclaimed centrist who aren't
like all the way over to crypto fascism
exactly all the way over to fascism but
have a lot of perspectives that align
almost perfectly and the reason why I'm
bringing this up is because this is
somewhat relevant another person who
recently wrote a book ben shapiro was
very upset earlier today because the
economists called him a sage but then
also said that he had many he he
definitely had a lot of admirers in the
alt-right and everyone was really
upset about it a bunch of Colet writers
were like oh my god you guys make
urselves looks so stupid when you call
someone who's an Orthodox Jew an alright
member we all know the way no that's the
you and I both know that because we are
the intellectuals of the intellectual
dark web
we know the distinction between the alt
right and the alt light as I like to
call them and as they like to call
themselves they all believe in the same
foundational principles and
correct me if I'm wrong you're the
expert on the subject but from my
perspective it's like they hate
multiculturalism they hate diversity
some members of the IDW won't broach
that part completely but like a lot of
the alt light members will openly say
like you know the great replacement is
happening and we need to preserve the
white birthrates and like yeah if
you get like into the Dave Rubin and
it's you know Dave Rubin like I'm
dealing with primarily Harris Peterson
and Shapiro
because like supposedly they're like the
smart ones a guy like Dave Rubin like
the biggest conduit for that stuff and
you know he's obviously like a
and I I'm not I'm not trying to
create like any like I'm just being
blunt this is just me being totally open
you're completely correct like like I
like like like I literally personally
like jank like I've done the show and
met him and he's a super nice guy
well you're breaking up a little bit
hold on I would be like the last thing
we heard from you before you broke up
was was I've personally met jank and I
like him he's a really nice guy and then
it's good and then you cut the fee yeah
I was like how dare you slander would be
like what did you see in Dave Rubin when
you hired cuz like that guy is a
idiot and he's not fine yeah I've talked
about this before and
it was a real no no it was a real
eye-opening moment for me and the long
leash I give people whom I perceive as
like ideological allies I absolutely I
absolutely am more skeptical of them and
their intellect now because of Dave
Rubin because at the time we did you
know Jimmy I know him personally I've
been to I've been to his house I know
him as well Anna does I worked alongside
Reuben no dude I think I got my
timelines messed up cuz I for some
reason I thought you started a little
later
never on camera I was doing what so dude
so why like okay I'll get back to my
book that can be like seriously what the
I'm cuz I'm trying to say like I'll
just put it on the table man even if
that guy had like nice politics he'd
obviously be a better person but he's
not funny he's stupid what like what's
up sound it doesn't sound stupid when
you're when you're when you're just
repeating previously thought out talking
points and it's easy to be and just like
it's probably kind of easy to be a
conservative and and be like a centrist
conservative who's like a TV show host
like he was built for that he was built
for that basically he had the only the
only genuine perspective that he had on
any political issue that that wasn't
just like the routine liberal position
was you know Israel which was he had a
really violent and like anti-arab
attitude towards Palestinians and that
was really problematic but beyond that
he he just like kind of repeated like
this is racism and like Republicans are
they hate the gays and all that stuff
and honestly it's it's when when someone
is just saying that and you've heard it
so many times I guess you don't
really consider it to be I guess you
don't really consider that person's
intellect to be like I don't know I
guess you don't consider the person to
be dumb because you agree with them
I watched it I said this before it where
I was like what kind of buck wild
watching just like his brain try to
demon even later look I played a clip on
my show the other day of Dennis Prager
insulting him to his face like
essentially saying like it's good to
irrigate token for us and the room is
loser sitting there like dude it doesn't
sound great well there's worse ones that
you've seen the Ben Shapiro clip right
where he's like oh yeah like genuinely
sad spineless piece of who is
openly and deliberately platformed white
supremacist white-naped that
spineless okay so I'm glad
I hope everyone spits on his face and
talk directly to his face and he
has to just sit there and eat that
pile of for every day for
the rest of his goddamn life dude why
you plagiarizing the last graph and then
I just I don't know what happened I
blacked out and I have like I was
writing my Santa hair in that would be
how the chapter it ends but what I'm
doing in that book though is I'm I'm
saying like the basic difference between
the left and the right is that the left
uses history to try to understand how
the world actually works and make it
better and the right uses mythology
whether it's science or religion to just
try to naturalize and make like well you
can't do anything about inequality
that's just like the rain no you look at
all these people being in a racism some
people are the worst brains than anybody
else right and that's like you know
that's an incidentally that's a brave
thing to say even though that's like
been the dominant attitude of Imperial
history so what I'm doing is each of the
chapters I'm explaining how all of these
projects fit to mythologize instead of
use history and
and then in the concluding duties I'm
saying like particle is definitely like
getting back to material problems and
like work from Marx and dealing with
like people's actual needs in a in
late-stage capitalist crisis which we're
in that's not just like verbage to me
and then I'm also trying to circle the
square on some of the arguments about
things like identity where it's like
instead of just like undoubtedly they're
racist and sexist and all the rest of it
no doubt but I also think that like
Hello kind of like whoa moral
condemnation politics isn't gonna do the
job and what we actually do is build
like a genuinely global and and really
build like like as an example when
somebody says like West his best or some
and the response is like I
don't read dead white men that's not
like the real answer should be no that's
all because first of all like you go to
ancient Greece you just I love this
example I don't know that about
Greece to be honest by know this example
right the like certain like pseudo woke
thing is like oh yeah then right when
there's going down again sorry can you
repeat that you fake go to ancient
Greece the Western chauvinists will tell
you that like the Greeks are the founder
of this unbroken thing called Western
civilization which I will show on my
book literally is not exist and everyone
you could read plenty of people who will
show this to you like Anthony Appiah who
are like actual academics and
philosophers and then on the other hand
though they'd say like oh well like I'm
not gonna read that because that is part
of the West in some ways is playing the
same game and the real actual answer
that's interesting is like a lot of whom
we think of as like Greek philosophers
and intellectuals were like actually
African and Greek civilization
when's all these different geographies
and zones that were not like Western
right and so if we actually get into
like really figuring out like just like
the human project of trying to do better
it's it's literally a global thing and
so we need to build like a socialism
that's rooted in global values not just
because we're like oh we're anti-racist
and multicultural whatever but literally
because we're reading and interacting
with and building a culture that
literally includes everybody at the root
and so that's kind of like the double
answer to the IDW both like you're wrong
because you're ignoring history and like
the actual material problems in people's
lives and you're also actually wrong on
the merits of all of your cultural
because you don't understand how this
actually works we have a better answer
so we can do more than just say that
you're you know racist hucksters
which they mostly are and actually
provide like a better answer that will
appeal you know the people that might
have fallen it's that rabbit hole I mean
even even something from I guess from a
time period that is closer to us and
that the the like Islamic Golden Age
gets whitewashed immediately that's
exactly right I like to talk about it in
probably a little bit more militant
terms than you do or I say stuff like
well while the white people were barely
wiping their asses and and dying
because rats coexisted alongside of them
like these Muslim were
preserving all of the important texts
and and you know advancing arithmetic
and and and medicine and you wouldn't
have any of that if it wasn't for
if it wasn't for globalization you know
by way of war and most importantly by
way of trade and an actual thinkers of
those times preserving those texts and
and you know having having it back and
forth in the true marketplace of ideas
right that's like literally true right
wait you're right you're back
I know what's going on I'm sorry but
yeah that's exactly right and another
dope example of that that I used in the
book is dumb a Martius sin who was an
indian philosopher and economist he just
died I think like a year or two ago but
he was he was actually a pretty big
influence on me I used him for my thesis
undergrad and he had this thing where in
the 1990s there was this thing called
the Asian values debate and basically
these like dictators and heads of state
in place like Malaysia and Singapore
were saying like hey like yeah we
came people and like you know like throw
people in jail for like spitting on the
street and we don't have a free press
but it's like because we have Confucian
values like we have our own value set
don't try to like encode Western
values on us right and then there was a
bunch of people in the 90s you know
definitely basically saying like these
are Western values and we did create
them and the rest of the world should
catch up and take from us right
and so what a Marty Ascend did was like
you people are both full of because
first of all there is no unbroken West
that created these values these values
have showed up like every civilization
on earth has had a push for transparency
for rights for people for open dialogue
including by the way it's you like
dictators if you read the
Confucian tradition more broadly you
could actually see that there's plenty
of stuff there that argues for
accountability of the powerful to the
people things like that right so he like
he basically canceled both of those
arguments and I actually think that's
the kind of move that we need to make
more and more just in Braille if we
don't need to be defensive at all like
there is a global culture we just have
to engage with it that's why I
do so much content on my show about
whether it's you know African
revolutionaries Asian intellectuals or
Latin American movements or what or or
vice versa because it's already there
and we just got to build off of that and
do better and by
when you do that you're a more
interesting person
you're more like you're just
better you're better equipped to
organize or party or whatever the
it is you want to do yeah
have you thought about aside from the
book which unfortunately most of the
people that you're probably trying to
reach because I think you and I have a
similar perspective on this and and and
like Kyle kolinsky like you want to
reach out to people that are sucked into
the to the rabbit hole of the IDW and
then therefore the pipeline towards the
alt-right radicalization pie you know
what I mean on the Internet yeah yeah
that you try to reach out these people
or kind of like counter provide like a
necessary counter-arguments or a
counterweight to like the the really
basic historical revisionism that stefan
molyneux meme for example which stefan
molyneux Mullen Mullen you whatever that
you know he makes he
tries to tie popular culture with with
with like historical revisionism in an
effort to make it seem like what white
culture has always been superior and
right it's just I mean it's it's really
accessible and it corresponds to
personal biases that a lot of like
increasingly alienated young men might
feel in like ugh capitalist society but
beyond that what's really terrible and
this again ties back to ben shapiro and
the IDW grifters who enjoy mainstream
success on top of everything else now
unlike the the other fascists is they
they kind of piggyback off of the
existing white supremacist attitude that
is pervasive in in a lot of Western
culture I think that that sort of yeah
that like white hegemony has always has
always been built into the system which
is precisely why these people can say
more politely that you know blacks
inferior without actually saying that
component of it we're like the whole
game is like hey make like hey I like it
would be like if you went a trainer or a
doctor and they were like I've got
really bad news for you you're not gonna
want to hear this this is tough but I
just got to tell you the truth and the
truth is in order to you know
like achieve your body weight
goal and look the way you want to look
or protect your heart health what you
have to do you're not gonna want to hear
this
is sit on your ass and eat doughnuts all
day like that right you're really
uncomfortable truths they're really and
they confirm basically all of your
previous you know yeah just got very
upset at you for for breaking the news
to them okay just so you know I'm sorry
I'm sorry guys
I'm sorry you're you're on
twitch culture right now hey first of
all I don't even know what twitch
culture is but it's all love but uh but
I guess the answer your question I think
I mean I don't know what your experience
of this is but I think unlike with
politics like an electoral pop spend a
lot of time telling Democrats like don't
worry about some mythical like
person in the middle like that that
barely exists and you got to figure out
your coalition and deliver for them and
get them out I think actually weirdly
enough in like our spaces they're
legitimately are some people that are
like those swing voters almost so when I
think of it to me like a book like this
is actually if it's successful it will
provide like some really good rent and
strategy for the left which is actually
what I care about most and then it might
make somebody who's deep in that rabbit
hole hopefully take their confidence a
little bit but then if there's even like
ten
or 20% who reads the book and is
genuinely like I kind of like those guys
but let me see what's up with this
then those arguments will be compelling
to them and I do have anecdotal evidence
yet you know occasional messages or
whatever I'm not saying a ton but also
like not just one or two or three of
people are like hey man like I really
liked Owen so but I saw you know like
and usually to be honest with you with
some combination and I think especially
because it is a lot of men so just to be
real it's like it's sometimes it's like
I understood that yes like they don't
know what they're talking about
actually are promoting bigotry but
usually the first door in was bathed as
always just like well I like that you
like dumped on them or I like that you
like didn't care all stylistic stuff
basically ya know rhetoric is incredibly
important for a lot of these people if
not all of them with like very few
exceptions because one rhetoric is just
way more accessible than like wonky
that you can talk to them exactly even
though and it's it's certainly more
accessible than than getting to the root
of it and like genuinely having a
conversation about like historical
materialism and the reason why you know
black people still have a harder time
because they were they were
intergenerational like poverty
stranglehold for decades and and how
capitalism has accelerated that and all
this other stuff without it you can't
have that conversation with someone
who's just simply blurting out talking
points about how affirmative action is
racist because you know I'm white and I
just want to go to college like what the
you know yeah I'd totally and so
for some of them there's no doubt that
just like you know I mean it's the
easiest one but like we just would hey
hey guys I'm interested in ideas like
it's so it's like really you want this
is someone
actually want to follow you don't think
that's embarrassing you know like I
think the style does matter and we got a
lot of it should use it yeah all right
anyway I don't wanna keep you any longer
I'm sorry do you do you have to go or do
you want to talk about Brazil really
quickly literally five minutes so that's
cool but this was really dude this was
dopest and I'm really glad that you
came just I want to put that out there
if you have to run out of the door I
just wanted to make sure that it's my
question this is great talk about that
let's talk about Brazil and and what you
were able to accomplish with some some
Congress people recently well let's say
I mean you know they it was generated by
a bunch of other people definitely
played a role in a store to get a letter
that was signed by about 30 Congress
people basically first of all just
expressing concern about like the broad
assault under ball scenario on
indigenous people on labor unions on
LGBTQ people also definitely um

certainly the stuff on labor and
indigenous absolutely at the behest of
US and Canadian corporations no doubt
and also saying which is true
let it all hold and almost definitely
would have beat Molson arm if he wasn't
put in jail with literally no material
evidence
we just lost your camera for a second I
just wanted to inform you but it's back
talk about it more later but I'll just
be like I think basically first of all
Brazil is the biggest country in Latin
America the United States obviously has
supported any number of coos and regime
change in Latin
that is definitely going through his own
economic crisis and there's a huge
return of the extreme right back by the
United States just gonna have major
implications for people across the board
and I think that this definitely starts
actually under Obama in 2009 Obama
administration Hillary Clinton back to
ku and Honduras which I think kind of
actually set off this chain reaction and
you know I talked about Lula a lot
because I DS definitely the world's most
prominent political prisoner and I just
like you know there's big differences
but at the on the other hands like
there's a lot of similarities if we were
doing what we did you know the seventies
the eighties it would be crazy if we
weren't all talking about Nelson Mandela
or the people from the ANC put in prison
and you know what's depressing is that
this dude did go to jail in the 80s to
bring down the Brazilian military
dictatorship and then was president from
2003 to 2010 and he brought 40 million
people out of poverty he's also you know
it's also a really charismatic dude and
I think it's an inspiring story when a
guy who grew up illiterate lost fingers
because he was a mine or a labourer
never went to college
rises up as a union leader and then
becomes one of the like objectively of
our century he's the most successful
president of our century and he's a
bull and the treatment of him is
insanely corrupt and personally
vindictive and I don't think you could
separate all the other things that have
happened in Brazil including like the
assassination of Mario Lee Franco a huge
story it was like a young afro-brazilian
lesbian congresswoman who was
assassinated by a paramilitary gang
connected to the police because she was
investigating police murders and of
afro-brazilians and speaking on that and
the gang that killed her is like
directly connected to the bull cenario
family and all of this is paved by
putting Lula in jail as part of this
huge corruption case that only touches
people on the left right
like there's people with infinitely more
evidence and way more serious
allegations to corruption
Venezuela as well right like to the
right wing or the the more right-wing
leaning opposition in Venezuela is also
let's of balsa narrow to get help and
I'm just and like I tell you you're
going to boy you are asking balsa narrow
for help now you you know and you're
talking about privatizing your oil
industry it is what it is and I have no
problem with critiquing Maduro but if
people don't understand that they're
trying to ferment a coup and regime
change in Venezuela then you're really
naive yeah and I don't mind but
I think we all need to talk about Lula
and I think that you know Bernie has a
little bit another reason why he's the
best candidate by far and I think you
know it matters for him but it's also a
symbol of a huge reversal that's
happening in Latin America with us
backing and you know hopefully you know
if you if things change the United
States we might be in a position to free
the guy which would be great for him but
also for Brazil the bill the whole you
know Latin America and then the world
arguably so I just we should all be on
all right well again thank you so much
for coming dude I'm so sorry to keep you
over as much as you want to come on
because I agree with most of the if not
all the things you say and that's what I
care about here - I'm just kidding we
debate I debate this all the
time in here I'm speaking of debates one
last thing it's not a it's not a subject
but are you in contact with destiny are
you familiar with them at all I believe
that yeah I think he's sent me a message
on Twitter will see I'm open to it he
seemed like a good be honest with you
I'm not I'm a little bit more picky
about who I wanted to bait now to be to
be blunt there's a lot of he's a good
friend of mine and
you know we we share an audience in some
respects so there's a lot of shows in
the chat right now who are literally
losing their absolute minds like
why haven't you asked about destiny
which is why I wanted the July's
turnabout Israel modern politics
Lulla Dusty's a great guy come on come

the time don't worry and I do too when
