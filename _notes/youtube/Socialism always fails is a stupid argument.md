"Socialism always fails" is a stupid argument - YouTube
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFUC0UWgdGY)

Transcript:
(00:01) hello we hear the argument fairly often but insert X social's country failed or socialism has never been successful honestly it's a strange argument to make let's humor this probably real person in your life though firstly how would they Define Socialism or capitalism for that matter Norway isn't socialist for example for ease a capitalist country is one with private ownership of the means of production meaning factories lion capsule Etc Market mechanisms as a major determining force in the economy and
(00:30) wage labor the prototypical example of this is the United States a socialist country is one where private property is heavily restricted if not outright abolished we're not talking about personal property here that means the production are collectively and democratically owned by Society through cooperatives and the state there is some form of a national economic plan and Market mechanisms are either subordinate to the plan or entirely suppressed referring to the likes of Cuba the USSR Etc as socialist in this video and no
(00:57) that doesn't make them perfect or any other nonsense you may have just thought of there's of course a lot more Nuance to this discussion but I'm trying to keep it brief without clear definitions you can't have a conversation so check out these two videos if you're interested in further details now more importantly how would one define success longevity quality of life military strengths economic performance political and diplomatic influence ceasing to exist or not measuring up or not to world powers of the time
(01:26) reductions of total human suffering perhaps the conversation becomes stale because the comparisons are never even filled relatively politically stable countries that suffered no major external restriction and benefited from centuries of colonial extraction for example France are compared to semi-futile former colonies that had just won their independence in the grand scheme of things and were made to suffer for it by those same formerly Colonial powers for example Vietnam by all these criteria this or that socialist country
(01:52) meet all of those previous expectations and in many cases far exceed them on the flip side many capitalist countries simply don't the trick in this game though is to excuse or look over capitalism's failure at developing otherwise resource-rich countries this is done through dedicated mechanisms of keeping them poor while enriching the Imperial core Western Europe North America Etc and even then all those third world profits usually flow only to the already very wealthy top sectors of those countries in the Imperial core this
(02:21) delves into concepts of unequal exchange and value transference a concept I'll touch on in another video Let's actually get to comparing we'll use the classic example the USSR lasted seven decades despite starting off from position as underdeveloped as India in the early 20th century it was immediately besieged sanctioned diplomatically isolated and not given International recognition into the 30s torn apart by a civil war an external Invasion by over a dozen countries overtaken by German invasion
(02:47) World War II in which it suffered far more than any other country in Europe perpetually suffering from U.S and NATO attempts at destabilization afterwards and plenty more already a comparison without taking these factors into account is incredibly disingenuous if we're going by quality of life well I made several videos on that in short socialist countries in general provided a higher quality of life for their population at the same level of Economic Development meaning whatever capabilities a country may have all
(03:12) things equal socialism would provide better housing Health Care education women's rights cultural development and so on than if the country were to be capitalist you get some common objections to this point but they all fall flat skew data old research blah blah etc etc which I deal with in the above videos you just saw on screen moving on the idea of military strength is silly to even mention as the greatest unfounded honestly fear of the US was the ussr's military capability which although powerful was used far less
(03:39) liberally than Americas in fact the USSR had pleaded with the us to stop the arms race frequently stating that whatever you develop with neutron bomb development the Star Wars program Etc being Prime examples it was less an arms race in reality and more of it keeping a parity with a warmonger in the United States which need to remind you has been at War 225 out of 243 years since 1776.
(04:02) regardless even military strength a ridiculous yardstick that falls apart at further scrutiny isn't valid for this analysis economic performance is also one of those things that goes without saying the USSR started as a peasant Backwater where wooden plows were being used and within three decades had conquered the cosmos they Rose to such a high level that to this day people still unfairly compare it to the US a country that had two centuries of development ahead of the USSR and started off in far better circumstances also not forgetting the
(04:28) horror of the enslavement of One race and the genocide of another take a look at the book The Triumph of evil on top of this the USSR had to endure the aforementioned brutal Civil War multiple invasions sanctions destruction brought by the Germans as they destroyed everything they came across etc etc this point cannot be understated because it's always forgotten and many times emitted intentionally from the conversation through all these trials the Soviet Union not only recovered but was competing with history's largest power
(04:52) of the United States and even surpassing it in certain cases undoubtedly had it not been illegally dissolved against the Democratic will of the Soviet people and may have even surpassed the us in our current age the second rapidly Rising superpower this time of the 21st century is the People's Republic of China which could have never achieved its current level of development without Mao era policies and accomplishments in fact China is expected to surpass the United States in just a few years and I'll do this with a
(05:17) population more or less confident in their development and agreeing with the general direction their government is taking at least a lot more than the Us and other contemporary liberal states along with a doubling real income by the decade and more that's not mentioning all the other examples that can be listed from Cuba to Vietnam and Beyond breaking the ties of neocolonial dependence and resource extraction to benefit the actual population of those third world countries over the profits of people unfathomably wealthy and
(05:42) politically connected within the Imperial core is the program of socialism both historically as well as today most clearly of all it showed in all those countries despite the sanctions and other hurdles artificially placed upon them honestly shouldn't go without saying but if socialism will fail on its own inevitably why does the US suspend so many billions to sabotage invade bombs sanction diplomatically isolate and assassinate for just one example take a look at this video here back to the video in just a second let's

(07:23) clicking the link in the video description below massive thanks status VPN for the sponsorship this is what allows me to pay my editor fairly so the support is highly appreciated alright back to the video if we were to go buy a social political or diplomatic influence well this too is fairly clear communism was considered to be the greatest threat to the status quo in the 20th century and continues to be practically every single revolutionary or Independence Movement sought Aid in diplomatic support from the USSR
(07:48) meanwhile every puppet dictator from Latin America to Africa ran to the US for protection every genuine Progressive domestic movement has had some socialist flavor usually of the pro-existing socialism type from the US to Latin America and each one was brutally shut down with American help and fear of the influence of socialist thought furthermore I don't think the recent upswing in anti-commiss medium publication has gone unnoticed either how about ceasing to exist Does that mean a country has failed Iraq my
(08:17) country is a massive mess yet it still exists in some certain political order does that mean it's succeeding if you doubt it's failure then check out my two recent videos in Iraq here these terms are so vague and just pointless they only serve to end the conversation before this even started how many countless capitalist countries have quote-unquote failed because of economic collapse political change or military takeover far more than socialist countries I can assure you regarding human suffering this one is
(08:45) tricky to calculate of course far more has occurred under capitalism than under socialism and if you believe the 100 million lie that's been reproduced time and time again just know that's all well nonsense they count non-births through extrapolation and fertility data they count dead Nazis on the Eastern front in the total the Aether sleight of hand at fifty thousand or a million just for the memes amongst other fantasies if you're interested in a deeper dive check out my death total capitalism video here
(09:10) regardless socialism has been empirically proven through numerous studies to provide better Healthcare outcomes better nutrition more Equitable access to healthcare and cultural facilities as well as a more robust system of care in general in society things regular people actually need use and objectively defined quality of life likewise in the Soviet example with Leisure more free time more Cultural Center spas or treats for regular people regular day-to-day life basically no rent incredibly cheap Staples widespread
(09:36) and accessible public transport Etc and even working life with shorter and less demanding working days as you're not there to maximize profit it's good to keep in mind to not fall into the crap Austria for example might be nice in their living standards but Senegal for example doesn't and perhaps cannot provide these amenities despite both of them being capitalist socialism so far has been the only system that has been both economically capable and politically willing to provide these benefits for their populations as a
(10:02) whole let's discuss failure then how would you define failure collapse in that case did the Roman Empire fail did the numerous Portuguese republics fail terms need to be defined to me it sounds as more of an emotional attacker than an objective characterization if equally poor starting position capitalist countries achieve the same level of development as socialist countries along with all the hurdles artificially placed upon them they'd be considered Miracles likewise when your average capitalist country
(10:28) think Bangladesh Ecuador Kenya Etc collapses from some form of political order it's never seen as a failing of capitalism or shocked up to corruption or some other nebulous explanation it seems that only liberal quote-unquote democracies are spared from being considered a failure in the fullest sense here's some food for thought the United States is the richest country on Earth and arguably in all of history yet stagnant real wages despite skyrocketing productivity most Americans can't afford a 500 emergency people are drowning in
(10:55) student and other debt there is no place in the US where minimum wage workers can afford rent and nearly half of Americans don't earn enough to afford even a one-bedroom rental inflation is destroying savings and making any likelihood of ever owning something in actual fantasy infrastructure is crumbling widening income inequality climate catastrophe American government support for every fascist Tyrant and every dictator I could go on and on rampant poverty unemployment homelessness serious issues with women's
(11:21) rights amongst many other things people prefer to die rather than go into medical debt stable employment and workers rights are regularly trampled in pursuit of profits as we've seen in Ohio recently school shootings crumbling indication is this not failure to remind you this is with no sanctions on the US no foreign Invasion no internal sabotage nothing the American government has every privilege it is the political military and economic hegemon it regularly dictates the policy of other countries thousands of miles away to its
(11:49) own benefit it dictates international trade and dominates it through its currency it can get away with whatever it wants and still manages to not guarantee a respectable and dignified existence for all or even most of its citizens Cuba a sanctioned third world targeted by the largest superpower ever known as a thriving and efficient Healthcare System that is the Envy of all developing countries they have a stronger track record than the United States when it comes to life expectancy infant mortality child malnutrition
(12:15) literacy and far more how is this not success in comparison capitalism is a system built on top of the cancer cell logic of infinite growth despite a finite planet with finite resources A system that breaks down every few years as a result of inherent boom and bust cycles of which young people have experienced several once in a lifetime economic catastrophes a system where People's Health and environment are regularly sacrificed on the altar of profit this is the definition of failure the capitalist system working as it's
(12:44) supposed to but the fallacy in all this is to ignore these facts and to only consider the richest countries as capitalists France U.S Britain Etc while ignoring places like Peru Bhutan the Congo Moldova or other less palatable yet fully capitalist examples to use the Richard wolfline if you had a car or electrical grid system or even a roommate as unstable as capitalism you would have left a long time ago again I reiterate my earlier point the insert X socialist country failed statement is a sad and Petty non-argument used to end the
(13:12) dialogue before it even begins its use shows less of a nuanced understanding of history and more a certain level of ignorance usually mixed with American sexualism or a severe malanite scrutiny placed over socialist Nations that doesn't cross over to capitalist ones unsurprisingly that honestly is the Crux of the matter the most minute negative of a socialist country is not only magnified it's blown out of proportion or outright lied about and the largest most blatant positives are so heavily and unfairly and in many cases
(13:39) incorrectly scrutinized as to diminish their accomplishments and trivialize their struggles meanwhile capitalist country usually wealthy Western ones can get a pass I'll give you an example the East German secret police deshdasi is spoken of in ill terms to this day hilariously by Americans who live in practically bugged houses with numerous public and private agencies spying on their every word move and of course purchase where their every detail is intimately known they will condemn the East Germans while not batting an eye at
(14:05) their own peculiar situation of course that's not to absolve the Stasi but to give you food for thought you were told that East Germany was the height of totalitarianism for this but you living in a hellscape far more grotesque and they tell you not to worry as if you ever worried at all if you're interested in these Germany take a look at the bookishtasi state or socialist Paradise for a deeper dive regardless it's a reproducible pattern some will condemn Soviet utilitarian housing blocks meant for temporary
(14:31) post-war housing while living in incredibly small apartments themselves where two-thirds of their paychecks go towards rent and homelessness is rampant if you instantly recoil when hearing Socialism or communism ask yourself why maybe those that continuously villainize social examples and ideas have a vested interest in keeping the population ignorant of the facts but those who own everything those with all the money they would never lie right and that's about it for today if you enjoy what I do then please consider
