Transcript:
(00:00) professor John Mearsheimer joins us now Professor Mearsheimer uh always a pleasure uh I'm very uh taken aback as I expect you are by the attitude of uh police and Mayors and and governors not hesitating to use very very serious force on student uh demonstrators in order to squelch uh the speech that the government hates and fears and before we get into that I would like to ask you to help us with a couple of basics yesterday the Congress or the House of Representatives passed legislation and sent it over to the Senate which so
(00:38) broadly defined anti-Semitism uh that if I were a professor there and said from the river to the C let everyone be free either I could be disciplined or the school could be disciplined and perhaps lose federal funds so let's start with some Basics what is anti-Semitism well uh the problem in answering that question is that because Israel's supporters in the United States accuse anyone who criticizes Israel or criticizes the US Israeli relationship or criticizes the Israel lobby as an anti-semite what we have is a situation
(01:23) where the term has become to some extent meaningless uh I mean I've been called an anti-semite on numerous occasion since Steve Walt and I wrote uh the Israel Lobby article and then the book uh and I believe there's no justification for calling me an anti-semite but again I criticize the lobby in Israel and the US Israeli relationship so by definition um an anti-semite if you ask me what is real anti-Semitism it is where somebody hates Jews uh because they are Jews and behaves towards them in noxious ways and
(02:02) I'm fully aware that there are instances of anti-Semitism in the United States and around the world more generally there are anti-semites in the land uh but I think when most people call someone an anti-semite these days that's what not what they're talking about they're using the elastic definition uh to uh criticize huge numbers of people who are saying things that Israel's supporters don't like I mean it is basic First Amendment law that the government cannot get involved in evaluating the
(02:39) content of speech whether your speech is motivated by a uh disgust over what the IDF is doing in Gaza or whether your speech is motivated by a hatred for Jews you have the right to say what you want absolutely I agree uh but I mean it's just very important to understand what's going on on here the greatest threat to the first amendment in this country at this point in time uh is Israel supporters it's the Israel Lobby uh and what's going on here to dig uh a layer deeper is that Israel is doing
(03:18) horrendous things in Gaza and all sorts of people are talking about it and criticizing Israel and what the lobby wants to do is shut down that criticism uh before it goes too far and before too many people recognize exactly what's happening and the only way they can shut down that criticism is to basically throw the First Amendment out the window and that's what's Happening Here does it um without getting too semantic or at the risk of getting too semantic does it matter that the Jews are not semites or
(03:52) does this phrase anti-Semitism just means hatred for the Jewish people they're ashkanazi they're Eastern European Jews the Palestinians are the semites well I think that you don't want to go down that road I think that when we talk about anti-semites or anti-Semitism we're talking about hatred uh for the Jewish people yeah and I I think it's best to keep it that way and again I think we want to recognize that there is real anti-Semitism yes in the land and that we should combat it but that's not
(04:22) what's going on here the idea that you know these uh students who are protesting on these various campuses are a bunch of anti-semites is not a serious argument again that's not to say there might not be one or two anti-semites in the crowd but the fact is that a good number of the people in the crowd are Jews themselves and a good number of the people who've been arrested are Jews uh and the idea that Jews are being beaten up in some sort of systematic way because they're Jews is not a serious
(04:55) argument there's no there's no serious evidence for that what is Zionism Professor Mir shimer well Zionism is a commitment to Israel uh and uh it's basically another way of talking about the Jewish State Zionism is a commitment to having or creating and having a state uh that represents the Jewish people if you think about uh the uh famous book by Theodore Herzel who I would call the father of Zionism uh about that concept the book is called the Jewish State the Jewish state is another way of saying nation state the
(05:40) nation here are Jews or the nation is Jews and uh so Zionism uh is all about the Jewish State and somebody who is a Zionist has a commitment to maintaining Israel maintaining a Jewish State my friends who are anti-zionists don't believe that there should be a Jewish State they believe that between the river and the Sea there should be a democratic State and whether it's dominated by Jews or it's dominated by Palestinians is largely irrelevant they are anti-zionists and of course if you're a Zionist you don't buy that for
(06:19) one second is Israel a democracy it all depends if you're talking about greater Israel which is what I would talk about because that is the fact on the ground that matters these days uh it is not a democracy because the Palestinians and the West Bank and the Palestinians uh in Gaza do not get to vote but they are part of Greater Israel a more interesting question is whether or not Israel is a liberal democracy uh like the United States or Britain or most European countries at this point in time and Israel is clearly not a liberal
(06:59) democracy because if it were liberal it would have to have equal rights for all its uh members and it does not have equal rights for the Palestinians even for those Palestinians who have a right to vote uh and this is why of course many people say that Israel is an apartheid state but it's not a liberal democracy and I don't believe it's much of a democracy well democracy not only means majority rule and the right to vote it also means equal right rights uh protected uh by the government if I were
(07:34) to move to Jerusalem as an American Roman Catholic could I buy real estate and could I register to vote uh I don't know uh I uh you know this involves uh technical laws that I'm not familiar with okay okay the idea was to create a Jewish State and it was a Homeland for Jews and most of the Zionist uh at the start and even most of the zionists now would prefer to have uh a state that's populated almost exclusively by Jews I mean this is why there's so much emphasis on ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians in both
(08:15) Gaza and the West Bank why is Israel referred to as the state of Israel rather than the country or the nation of Israel I don't know uh it's an interesting question but uh all right again again I might be delving uh uh too much into uh into semantics how effective is the Israel Lobby in suppressing speech now I'm asking in in the US I'm asking you this after two weeks of college students being arrested because they support the rights of the Palestinian people and the House of Representatives threatening colleges
(08:57) and universities and quite frankly all educational uh institutions um if they say things or permit things to be said that can Loosely be defined as anti-semitic how powerful is that lobby at suppressing Free Speech here in the US well it's actually been wildly successful for decades uh it's very hard to find anyone who would criticize Israel uh in the mainstream media for example and there were surveys that were done before October 7th which showed that many academics self-censored when it came to Israel if you're an academic and you
(09:39) were to criticize Israel or criticize the US Israeli relationship in a serious way you would pay a significant price there's just no question about that uh Steve and I wrote the article in 2006 and the book in 2007 and we have lengthy discussions of all sorts of cases where people were punished one way or another in the academic world uh for criticizing Israel and then if you go into the mainstream media I mean you were grabbing the third rail for sure but what's happened here judge is that as a result of October 7th and what the
(10:15) Israelis have done in response to October 7th all sorts of people are criticizing Israel and given that we have social media especially platforms like Tik Tock Israel and the lobby and the US Israeli relationship are taking a beating so what's happening is that the lobby is desperate to shut this down these protests on campus just mortify people in the lobby and the question is how can they stop them so tremendous pressure is being put on University administrators University presidents in particular and tremendous pressure is
(10:54) being put on the White House and on Congress to act to shut down the protests on campus uh look just to give you two examples that highlight what's going on here was there any discussion of anti-Semitism on college and university campuses before October 7th was there a big uproar about anti-Semitism in Academia before October 7th the answer is no right question I would ask you is the president of Harvard and the president of the University of Pennsylvania um have been pushed overboard largely by Rich donors who are
(11:39) joined at the hip with Israel these are people who have a passionate attachment to uh Israel who have interfered at Harvard and Penn to get these two women presidents fired do you think if October 7th had not happened that these women would be in power now well of course they would of course they would they were thrown overboard right because they didn't crack down on the protesters and this is why the Colombia president is in trouble it's why the Northwestern president is in trouble the lobby desperately wants every president
(12:24) and every politician to crack down on the protesters and or automatically that takes us into freedom of speech territory and what's happening here very clearly is that the lobby is working over time to undermine the First Amendment you are a professor at one of the great academic institutions in the United States the University of Chicago whose academic standards are uh superlative what is the status of free speech a on that campus your campus with students and B amongst academics well I would imagine that there's quite
(13:02) a bit of self-censorship here as there is everywhere but the University of Chicago has a rich tradition when it comes to freedom of speech uh and it has a rich tradition when it comes to tolerating protest uh and you remember surely that uh when this place uh blew up in 1969 the students took over the administration building Ed Levy who was then the president of the university did not call in the police uh at places like Harvard and Columbia Columbia of course blew up in ' 68 and Harvard also blew up in 69 but the presidents of Harvard and
(13:40) Colombia did call in the police and it backfired on them but leaving much to his credit did not he waited out the protesters uh and then he eventually suspended them uh and that was seen at the time is the smart thing to do and I think if you had protest now and there was no Lobby these University presidents would just wait out the protesters they would not call in the police especially since the George Floyd uh Affair took place not that long ago you remember the idea of calling in the police was Unthinkable in the wake of the whole
(14:16) George Floyd Fiasco right here we are not long after that calling in the police why has this happened and the answer is the power of the lobby here's um uh Max Blumenthal uh one of your colleagues on the show happens to be a big fan uh of yours uh describing his fears about all of this yeah and the one thing that that really concerns me because of what we saw in 2020 with BLM with the proud boys this is this that there are elements in the National Security State and the political Elite that actually want to
(14:56) see a strategy of tension that want to see violent chaos political chaos play out in the streets and that's what kind of concerns me going forward in the election is that they actually could try to play this to their benefit might the lobby might Max be on to something might the lobby actually feel that it could benefit from chaos and conflagrations and therefore in the minds of the public uh more justifiably uh the use of police force I think uh that the lobby understands that the more this spins out of control
(15:34) the more you go down the road that Max is describing the bigger the problem for Israel and the reason is that people who are sitting on the fence will come off the fence and side with the protesters uh I had a good friend who was at Harvard in 1969 and he said the radicals actually had very little Port when the protest first started and they took over uh the administration building but once the police were called in uh the end result is that many uh sort of middle of the road students who were not committed one
(16:14) way or the other sided with the protesters so I think you have a situation here where if what Max describes happens and he may be correct about where this one is headed uh and the police continue to crack down on protesters and we have a giant Fiasco here in Chicago at the Democratic National Convention that what this will do is it will drive people away from uh the Israeli side of the story and it will cause great sympathy on the Palestinian side so I think the lobby if anything is wishing that this one will
(16:50) go away but of course it's not going to go away here's a um cut number nine Chris here is a Columbia University Prof Professor uh of whom I have never heard I don't know if you know her Rebecca weiner uh this professor was outed I'll tell you how she was outed after we listened to her but let's listen to what she had to say about peaceful protest on the Columbia campus this is not about students expressing ideas it is about a change in tactics that presents a concern and a normalization and
(17:27) mainstreaming of rhetoric and I'm not just talking about language I'm now talking about tactics and that's what shifted our response yesterday but a normalization and mainstreaming of rhetoric associated with terrorism that has now become pretty common on college campuses right you see um people wearing headbands associated with foreign terrorist organizations this happened in October when you had a viral Tick Tock reissuing of Osama bin Laden's 2002 letter to America um so that's a larger
(18:00) concern it's separate from what happened yesterday but they're related we do not want ideas we do not want campuses which are where people are supposed to be learning and being in a conducive environment for for all of the things that we do in schools um being turned into places where people are committing vandalism property damage and committing crimes she had finished her statement we do not want ideas that we disagree with I doubt that she's going to be back at Colombia because it turns out that she's
(18:33) an undercover police officer who was teaching at Colombia and who hung out with a lot of the demonstrators and reported on them so I would imagine she's no longer welcome there but she's part of the problem of uh equating legitimate political speech we think the Palestinians have uh the right to a government we think that uh the IDF is committing genocide perfectly legitimate political statements she's equating that with violence exactly I mean it what she represents is a fundamental threat to Academia and to the United States at
(19:14) large the broader Society I mean this just a terrible situation that we're in uh you know what she's trying to do is talk about tactics that these protesters are using that are so dangerous what kind of threats do we see that are so dangerous on college campuses yes at one or two places the students have taken over the administration building or a different building uh this happened in the late 1960s it's not that big a deal those students should be punished for taking over a building okay but uh
(19:51) the the talk I mean the idea that these students are terrorists and you noticed how she linked them with terrorists is just nonsense she said they were terrorists because they wore Palestinian headbands and replayed a speech by Osama Bin Laden this is crazy you're allowed to do that people can sympathize with Hamas I understand why many Americans including many American Jews for sure do not like to hear that kind of rhetoric they don't want to hear people sympathizing with Hamas but this is the United States of America and you're
(20:25) allowed to say that you sympathize with Hamas and you're allowed to say that you sympathize with what the IDF is doing in Gaza that's what freedom of speech is all about but again the thing you have to understand judge is that once you open up these debates and allow people to say what they want this does enormous damage to Israel's image in the United States it does enormous damage to the lobby and to the US Israeli relationship and they don't want that going to play you uh a clip from another fan of yours Colonel uh Lawrence
(21:03) Wilkerson uh in which he expressed an opinion as to what is the principal cause this takes us back to where we started our conversation of anti-Semitism in America today I don't know how he lives with himself Colonel I don't either I don't either he is the living manifestation on Earth today of what causes anti-Semitism those are the words of a rabbi who's been my friend for a long time his exact words were the greatest motivator for anti-Semitism in the world today is BB Netanyahu what do you think well I would
(21:48) just say I don't think we have an anti-Semitism problem in the United States and that's the good news that you know that is good news but the Republicans in the house representatives and the Israeli Lobby want us to think that we do and that it's so bad we have to tamper with the first amendment I agree but that's simply because they're interested in shutting down criticism of Israel look Israel is in the process of executing a genocide this is an apartheid state that is executing a genocide is it any surprise that lots of
(22:24) students who have access to platforms like Tick Tock and understand what is going on are out protesting it's hardly surprising at all but this is not anti-Semitism and again many of the protesters are Jews and many people who are sympathetic to the protesters are Jews so the idea that this is sort of like viore Germany or even Nazi Germany is just not a serious argument again before October 7th did you hear people at universities talking about rabbit anti-Semitism on campus across the country of course not was claudian gay
(23:02) the president of Harvard being portrayed as an anti-semite no nobody even mention that possibility this is all happening in the wake of October 7th and it has to do with the fact that Israel is in deep trouble and more and more people recognize that Israel is in deep trouble and it is doing absolutely horrible things to the Palestinians that's what's going on here what do you think will happen uh if uh the the IDF uh invades Rafa and Slaughters another 35,000 uh people the protest will uh be even greater then than they are now I mean
(23:40) the idea that they're gon to shut down these protests by bringing in the police is not a serious argument uh this is what Edward Levy figured out uh in 1968 69 that bringing in the police does not help you you can't shut these problems s down by beating up protesters or trying to uh throw them in jail if they criticize Israel the only way you can solve these problems is by actually uh solving the problem that's driving the train uh and that means putting an end to the Vietnam War and in this case it's
(24:21) fundamentally changing what Israel is doing in Gaza if the Israelis stopped all the killing and to some length uh to give the Palestinians a decent life the protests would die or at least they would be greatly reduced but what's going to happen here in all likelihood if you listen and believe Netanyahu is that they're going to go into Rafa and they're going to end up killing many more civilians uh and maybe even driving some of the Palestinians into Egypt and this is going to cause huge trouble the
(24:54) protests are going to grow but uh uh beating up on the protesters or robbing them of their first right amendments is certainly not the solution here is Israel an ally of the United States no not in any meaningful way I mean people in lobby and Defenders of Israel like to make the argument that it's a strategic asset it's not a strategic asset it's a strategic liability it's an albatross around their neck as I've said on numerous occasions and from an ethical or moral point of view everything that it's doing is
(25:29) abhorent from the perspective of American values I mean we're supposed to be enthusiastic about supporting an apartheid state we're supposed to be uh enthusiastic about supporting genocide in Gaza of course not so the idea that this is uh a close relationship that we have this special relationship with Israel that we give it unconditional Aid because it's a strategic asset and it's the morally correct thing to do is not a serious argument what we are doing is driven in large part by Israel's
(26:03) supporters who work overtime uh who were Relentless in their efforts to get the United States to support Israel no matter what and who have uh caused this Mantra Israel is our closest Ally to be spread and articulated amongst members of uh Congress and in the in the government of both parties and and all ideologies of of course there's a whole slew of mantras that these Congress people and people in the white house uh spew uh so that they get support from the lobby and at least the lobby doesn't go after them
(26:44) and try to defeat them in the next election I mean this is the problem that President Biden faces right he's up for reelection in November and he knows full well that if he's critical of Israel uh or he threatens to cut off Aid to Israel that the end result will be that he'll lose for sure in the fall I mean he might lose anyway especially given where these protests are going but if he crosses Israel or crosses the lobby they will take revenge on him this is just the way it works here's a former president of the
(27:21) United States no longer living uh shortly after he left the White House talking about what he views as the proper relationship between American Jews and Israel and Israel and the United States let me let me explain something about what is called the Jewish Lobby in this country in the first place Jews understandably in the United States because of what happened in World War II because of the Holocaust are going to be put first prior priority on the survival of Israel now as good Americans as they are they believe that
(28:07) America's survival and security is directly related to Israel's and other words their belief is that being for Israel first uh means that that does not mean you're putting America second because they think it goes together an American president however has to approach it in a different way in my opinion he's got always to think first of what is best for America and that's true whether it has to do with the Israelis or whether it has to do with the Irish or the Germans or what have you or the
(28:40) poles Etc uh usually what is best for America is also best for Israel and vice versa but on occasions for example an American president must make a decision that does not in effect give the Israelis a blank check and one example of that is a decision that I made uh I decided early on in our Administration that we were going to seek good relations with Egypt and other others of Israel's neighbors many of my Israeli friends uh didn't like that uh because they wanted a special relationship with Israel and Israel only but I have always
(29:17) said uh that Israel's interests are better served to have the United States a friend of Israel's neighbors and potential enemies than to leave a vacuum which the Soviet Union would fill what do you think I agree with everything he said except I wouldn't call it the Jewish Lobby I would call it the Israel Lobby because not all Jews are in the lobby and there are Christian zionists and others in the lobby who contribute to its influence but otherwise his arguments are on the money he pointed out that what Israel's
(29:52) supporters like to do is conflate America's interests with Israel's interests and say there's no difference between the two and Nixon says quite correctly that you can't do that they may be the same interests a lot of the time but not all the time and when the United States and Israel have different interests he President Nixon is going to favor American interest for all the obvious reasons but again most of Israel's supporters believe there's no difference between the two countries uh
(30:23) interests now what's different from Nixon's situation and the present situation is the lobby was no near nowhere near as powerful uh when Nixon was President as it is today uh the lobby has grown uh really powerful it is remarkably powerful today uh and it has to be remarkably powerful today because uh the task of Defending Israel has become much more complicated much more difficult than it was uh in Nixon's time uh and uh and I think dick Nixon was in a position where he could challenge the lobby uh in ways that no president could
(31:08) today are there uh Christians in the lobby are there such things as Christian zionists say like uh Speaker of the House Mike Johnson absolutely there's no question about it and there have been a number of Jewish American Jewish supporters of Israel uh who are dis disgusted with the fact that many Jews are critical many American Jews are critical of Israel and they say that the Christian zionists are Israel's firmest supporters or best or strongest supporters these are American Jews I've heard say this over the years
(31:47) so the Christian Zionist matter but of course I think the core of the lobby are are American Jews but again I want to emphasize not all American Jews by any means uh before we go let's get back to where we started the freedom of speech it's the first week in May it's either exam time or graduation time at nearly every major university in the country where do you see this going does it die down in a couple of weeks do these young people coales in the tens or hundreds of thousands in Chicago this summer where
(32:25) the ironic as can be the Democratic convention will be just as it was in 19 uh 68 does it does it uh bubble up again in September if the IDF is still slaughtering Innocents what's your feel for this professor Mir shimer well I think that it'll be very interesting to see what happens at graduation uh at the various universities and colleges across the country where this is an issue uh I mean the University of Southern California which is behaved in abhorent ways uh on this whole issue has cancelled uh
(33:05) commencement uh and that may happen at other schools if it's not cancelled my guess is there'll be lots of protests uh at different graduation ceremonies uh around the country but then school breaks uh School summer break occurs and the question is what happens over the summer uh I think uh the big question will be what happens at the Democratic National Convention uh it's hard for me to imagine that there's not going to be significant protest uh are they gonna do that convention virtually uh is that
(33:42) going to be the road they go down if they don't you know I keep thinking of Chicago in 1968 uh and uh you know what will 2024 Chicago look like for the DNC uh and it might not be pretty uh right school will start up again and I think what it looks like when school starts up is all a function of what the Israelis are up to and I believe that there is little chance I hope I'm wrong uh there's little chance that the Israelis will do much of anything to improve the Palestinians lot in Gaza or in the West Bank and therefore uh the
(34:19) protests will start back up again next fall and University administrators will have a whole year in front of them trying to deal with protesters and there'll be enormous pressure on them then as there is now from supporters of Israel especially uh supporters who have big checkbooks and those University presidents would be under tremendous pressure to crack down and uh should they crack down as I said before I don't think that will work uh to their advantage to the advantage of the University presidents or to the
(34:54) advantage of the lobby Professor M sh thank you very much my dear friend
