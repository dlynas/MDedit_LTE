Transcript:
(00:05) Stanford University thank you for your help with the seating we very much appreciate it with a lecturer of the fame and stature of Douglas Hofstadter we get a fantastic turnout and it's a marvelous don't worry if someone who is coming to meet you here hasn't arrived they will at least hear the lecture out in the lobby so there's a chance to get some small part of the action out there and we're just very happy you all came this is a presidential lecture sponsored by the President and administered by the
(01:04) Stanford Humanities Center and we're very happy to have been able to invite Douglas Hofstadter and even more happy that he has accepted do take a look at the presidential lecture website which is accessible through the Stanford Humanities Center web site sh c dot stanford.edu glen worthy who's here tonight has invested a lot of time and attention in presenting Doug's work in the most complete and analytic possible way it's a it's a real publication on Hofstadter and worth your attention should you need to learn more about the
(01:49) Humanities Center that's also the place to go sh c dot stanford.edu that would include learning more if you become deeply curious about the publication's and materials that are out front and would like to see more about us you can do it on that website also the tradition at the presidential lectures is not to have QA this evening but to have a real discussion seminar tomorrow afternoon at 4 o'clock that seminar will be at the Humanities Center and the directions if you don't know how to get there are on that same website sh c dot
(02:32) stanford.edu so I'm happy to turn now to an introducer who truly needs no introduction Donald Kennedy the former president of Stanford University the editor of science a reasonably well known magazine and of course a scholar a great distinction in biology and environmental studies so I will now with no further ado turn to Donald Kennedy this is a fantastic turnout and I hope Doug knows how much of a tribute it is to the influence he's had on the thinking of a large number of people not only on this campus but everywhere it's
(03:33) a great privilege to introduce him his family and mine were neighbors on San Juan Hill Hill for a time Doug left his house before I got into Hoover house but we had met on several occasions and actually became colleagues for a while at a time during which I had persuaded him to do some teaching in the human biology program to the benefit of our students and I saw a great deal of Lori as she moved from bio major at Stanford to science writer and I'm glad that she and and some members of her family could could be here in Doug's human bio period
(04:10) he was working on goodl Asher Bock here after GEB when the book came out I not only thought it was a stirring accomplishment I experienced that voyeuristic feeling of having some Association however transient and tenuous with a great literary triumph nowadays I get the occasional additional dose of that by getting David Kennedy's UNMISS delivered mail but fortunately Doug also keeps me going with more achievements of his own and indeed so much has been said of Doug and the power and luster of his intellect in that
(04:48) splendid piece by Glenn worthy there's not much that can be added to it but there's a question and the question is what kind of linguist mathematician cognitive scientist hybrid does it take to think up ambigrams the Carine 'i'm meta magical and so on answer a charismatic imagination and an extraordinary gift for exploring how we think by substitution and analogy as he explores in fluid concepts and creative analogies a work product that has grown out of a group he has relabeled as the fluid analogy
(05:31) research group farg one Oh short of North Dakota the catalog more formal than playful like Doug lists him as director of Indiana University's Center for Research on concepts and cognition my friend bill Kaufman was one of those whom Doug asked about publishers and other practical matters in the early days of pre GEB Bill's company WH Freeman had merged for a while with Scientific American of the Peale Flanagan era longtime admirers of Martin Gardner's wonderful Lewis carolien mathematical games column in that
(06:15) magazine were devastated about gardeners announced retirement but when Doug was announced as his replacement in 1981 everyone who knew him said simply how perfect his encouraged Abul playfulness with language and anagrams led him to redo the title to meta magical themas he didn't disappoint us in a tenure that lasted two and a half years Doug and I talked earlier today about the shared experience of being edited by Dennis Flanagan at Scientific American one of the truly persistent ego restructuring and capable editors of all time I hope
(06:57) he won't mind my telling up bridging story that has some personal meaning for me Doug is deeply interested in language how we use it and what it tells us about how we think he had an early experience at the University of Oregon while doing a PhD in physics that had followed a good experience with math at a Stanford as a Stanford undergraduate and a disappointing one in a math graduate program at Berkeley and at Oregon he at Oregon he happened to bail to develop a sidelong sideways interest in in the question how gender is used in language
(07:33) in eg how how is it that many of us in that day were saying men when we met everybody met now we say guys when we mean everybody and that's just and that's just as dumb a mistake so anyway his his interest in linguistic sexism for some reason linked him to a talk I had given in the very early 80s at of all things a senior athletes dinner at Stanford I used some data about women's times in events like swimming and the marathon and how rapidly the performance gap between women and men had narrowed as an example
(08:10) I compared the Stanford women's 400 meter freestyle relay time in 1981 with the best men's college time of my undergraduate years and discovered that the women were 10 whole seconds faster than the fastest men 10 10 seconds is a long time if you count it out and that's what I did at the senior athletes dinner it's quite a good talk actually and and Doug Doug put a stiffy of that in in his his column in Scientific American and I was I was totally thrilled it was a far more interesting take on that subject
(08:49) than the snippet in Sports Illustrated at about the same time that suggests a lot about the exceptional range of connections that Doug is prepared to trace and analyze the essence of his work has been to understand cognition how we construct our knowledge of our world the notion of some core as essential to the way in which we link the features and structure of of thinking and language is brought out ng BGE be in this features instructors of three very different creative and intellectual accomplishments and that
(09:32) speaks to the use he makes of computers and artificial intelligence notions or the problem of trans relation which is interested in or perhaps as a way to explore for some underlying formal structure in the preface to the 25th anniversary edition of TeV he chided some critics who had seen it as a book about three men that's a little like saying Moby Dick is a book about whaling GEB is about how anima C arises and in subsequent work Doug has explored a variety of connections or braids with that theme between cognition
(10:12) and language between what is written in one language and then translated into another between what has left life and what remains not only does he navigate those boundaries he does so with a kind of loving respect that is perhaps best captured by the fact that he and his children Dannie and Monica now teenagers maintain an Italian only household conversation rule as a custom of honoring Doug's beloved late wife Carol a fellow Explorer of the translation universe at a time when the University this one is on a crash course to embrace
(10:50) and support interdisciplinary work it is especially wonderful to hear from someone who has been there and who has set out new benchmarks for thinking that loops around cognitive science machine intelligence art literature perhaps eventually neurobiology you get a picture of his agility and playfulness from some of the titles of his presentations the architecture of jumbo that one's about machine learning the slipper Bilal feybelle hinge points of thought speech stuff and thought stuff his biography will break the spell check
(11:30) feature on your computer finally my favorite from his recent passion for for translation you'll need to absorb this slowly mom minion cutie pie pretty dear fairest friend pitting human against computers in poetry translation and guess who wins just think of what we could learn by examining Doug's brain with functional magnetic resonance imaging absolutely non-invasive for those of you who aren't kept to this while he's pursuing a full experiment about the relationship between art and and music phrenology
(12:21) would never be the same afterward I will close by noting that not only has he done some remarkably novel and intellectually challenging work in the world he has also also always been a gracious and kindly and humanistic guide for those who want to explore it I'm happy to introduce Doug Hofstadter Stanford BS in mathematics class of 1965 the College of Arts and Sciences professor of cognitive science at Indiana University as well as the director of the program I just described earlier on under a different name in his own biography he
(12:59) thanks Indiana University in some respects Stanford's institutional parent for quote the fresh winds of freedom generously afforded him by his truly open-minded University his presidential lecture in the humanities and art is entitled analogy as the core of cognition please join me in welcoming Doug back to Stanford I guess I'm a little bit on the spot here after an introduction like that it was I have to say also Don didn't mention that we used to do a little running together he used to go up to the
(13:56) dish from the Hoover house and I remember well I shouldn't say we used to that suggests more than once hi I joined him one time I was a pretty good runner in fact I still run and I just ran this lightning this evening but but it was hard to keep up with Don in fact I don't know if I did and he still run Don well I guess that's what happens to us all anyway we've had a lot of experiences together of various sorts and he certainly did it outdid himself in that wonderful wonderfully kind and broad
(14:35) introduction when I was here as an undergraduate in the early 60s I was very interested in in understanding what the mind was I think I had always been interested in what minds did and what creativity was and I had the experience of learning to program in the early 60s before well Stanford one computer it was a Burroughs 220 located in the basement of encina how many people here remember that about one person well anyway I programmed that burrows 220 and then I went on to other programming but the point is that I got interested in in how
(15:18) language worked and in in certain rules for language and I don't want to go into that very much my model for producing sentences was was amusing and it had a lot of amusing things but it what it really inspired me to do was to think about what cognition is it certainly was not a model of cognition but it was an amusing attempt and and over the years then I devoted a great deal of my life to thinking about what cognition is and I guess tonight I'm going to be telling you or some of the important conclusions
(15:52) that I've come to and I don't know if I can convince anybody but I will do my best I have I will begin with a sort of a complaint and everything is in everything is in focus good that's great by the way I don't use PowerPoint for better or for worse I don't know what that means but so you'll have to put up with my handwriting and with sloppiness and things like that and so uh the in in cognitive science the cognitive science conferences and journals and so forth they always have they divide cognition up into all sorts
(16:31) of different pieces and one of the pieces is always called analogical reasoning and and it's usually put together with problem-solving and it's sort of one little teeny part of of thinking and I sort of decided that I would put it this way that analogical reasoning they sort of this is the Delaware of cognition so I kind of feel that that shunts it off a little bit it doesn't make it very central now you might think that Indiana would be a better name for analogical reasoning but I'm gonna be a little bit more daring
(17:13) than that I'm doesn't mean California either or Texas or Alaska first of all we're gonna get rid of the word reasoning I don't want reasoning and analogy has nothing to do with reasoning or it does a little bit but not much I mean it's just a misnomer and it's a misconception of what analogy is and that's what I really want you to understand and I suppose that's sort of the bottom line of this talk if we are going to make any connection between analogy and a geographical situation we're going to
(17:42) liken it to the interstate freeway system and it links everything together analogy is the interstate freeway system of cognition it is not one little tiny zone somewhere off in the side it's so that's that's a kind of a way of that I think about it I mean I don't really usually think about it that way I made that up yesterday so it gives you the flavor so one of my rules which I'm sure I will disobey tonight is don't cover your transparencies let everybody see everything but I may not do that we'll
(18:19) see if I'm true to my own principles so uh as it says here I think of categorization I mean the story about analogy making of course has to be a little bit more than just analogy making so I want to sort of show you how things fit together categorization is the name of the cognition game but analogy is the mechanism that creates or that allows categorization to happen by categorization I mean deciding what something is what the essence of something is so now one could sort of summarize this in a corny little analogy
(18:56) again analogy is the motor of the car of thought and then we then can even write it down as this little thing analogy is to thinking as a motor is to a car a is to B as C is to D and this sort of reduces it down to the old standard you know a is to B C to D proportional analogy looks like a fraction and that's very nice and it's the kind of thing you know like a shoe is 2 foot as glove is the hand and these kinds of things that maybe they put on IQ tests and SATs and things like that but that's not how I
(19:32) think of analogy either I mean that's that's a that's that's again putting it into a little tiny box and saying all of analogy is a is to be as C is to D and it again it misses the point ah so I don't know I can't define anything and I kind of hate definitions but I will at least sort of give you a sense analogy making is the perception of common essence between two things and then a couple of footnotes to sort of hedge I mean things don't have essences but what I mean I'm not a you know I'm not
(20:06) talking about some kind of abstract glowing philosophical essence I'm talking about the essence that you perceive at the particular time in the frame of mind that you happen to be in and uh and by when say things it's tempting to think that the analogies are between the things in the external world but I really want to say that analogies happen inside your head so that they're there their connections between two mental representations their connections between things inside your head which we project to the outside world and we say
(20:35) these things outside out there are analogous and that's very reasonable to do but I wanted to emphasize how they go on inside the head and they are between mental representations now I want to give you a couple of analogy some of my favorite analogies uh they're there well you know and analogies I could give you forever but I'm gonna give you a few that I think are very interesting and kind of provocative so I'll begin with the when I was a kid I was eight years old as I recall when I found out about
(21:09) exponents and I was in love with math and I was fascinated with any new mathematical concept and I made tables of not integers to various powers I filled notebooks with these kinds of things so one day I was walking through the house and I saw a paper that my dad was reading and he was a physicist and it had math notation galore and I couldn't make head or tail of it but what I did notice was that there was ah there there little things that said you know like X sub 1 X sub 2 and stuff like that I thought ooh look at that these
(21:44) little subscripts so here's my here's my little transparency the red you can get the idea that I saw that my guess was what in a world what operation on numbers does this sub scripting thing do if the super scripting thing you know puts it to a power or what does the sub scripting do I was really interested and my dad told me he said all that doesn't do anything it's just the way of naming variables and I was so so disappointed completely completely flattened ok fast-forward 40 years fast-forward 40
(22:23) years now I'm a father of a one-year-old daughter named Monica and Monica is sitting in our play room pushing the button of the dust Buster having time of her life and then what does she see she sees another button and she pushes it and nothing happens and I'm watching her and I go over there I'm sitting in on the floor and I get up and I go over next to Monica and I pushed the button and I opened it up and I sure this is just where the garbage is you know and Monica is of course completely destroyed and at
(23:02) that moment you have to understand I hadn't thought about this thing with my dad for probably 40 years at that moment the whole thing of the exponents and the subscripts comes rushing to my to my head and uh and I want you to I just want to you know kind of spell out this analogy it's a pretty complicated one I mean somebody said to me I guess it was dawn today he said people make the mistake of reading out loud their transparencies so I don't know I I don't know if I can avoid reading this out loud though
(23:39) because it's kind of fun but I I've already told it to you so maybe I won't I mean I I think it's interesting though that if you if you I mean you know here is me and all my love of mathematics and the subscript and and this is an interesting line here because I make an analogy part of the Ascend algae is an analogy I make an analogy between superscripts and subscripts and I think ah there's something there and then I get flattened ah by my father okay and so here's Monica and she comes along
(24:08) and she makes an analogy between one button and another and she's hoping and then she gets flattened by her father who happens to be me but that's just a just a coincidence but anyway there you go I mean it's it's a pretty a pretty complicated analogy ah now uh the next one that one that one is is a what you might call a reminding event and a lot of analogies are reminding events and I don't want to say something immediately which is that a lot of people think analogies are there to serve purposes they're not there to
(24:46) serve purposes at all they just happen that's all there's no purpose there's no purpose at all they just happen ah sure they they're in a certain sense they're serving evolution but that's about the only purpose that there is you think and I want to give you an analogy that had occurred to me a few months ago uh I was reading a book that my mother had loaned me by Jonathan Rabanne called I don't remember exactly something like voyage to America or discovering America I mean he's he's traveling across he's his
(25:18) first chapter he's traveling across the Atlantic Ocean I was in an airplane I was flying back from California to Indiana and I we were flying on our first leg we're going to Denver and which is perhaps the United hub I don't know anyway we were we were going to Denver and on uh so I was reading this first chapter in which he Jonathan Rubin goes from England from Liverpool to somewhere in Canada and he was in a boat called the Atlantic conveyor and the they he was very impressed by the size of this boat
(25:55) and thought that surely nothing could rock it but the captain told him no it's it's a you know it's it's a boat is very vulnerable and and then what do you know but they discovered a hurricane hey there was you know in their pathway or it was actually coming up the Atlantic and it was and it was going to be right in their way and so well I mean not very complicated thinking but here's what they did there's the Atlantic conveyor and there's hurricane Helene and I've drawn this a little bit off because I don't
(26:26) know if they went quite that far south but I didn't want to put in time and everything you get the basic idea here I mean the hurricane went up and they went to the south they deviated a little bit and missed it and and then went up and then turned back up okay so I've just read this thing well I'm just you know I'm thinking about the Atlantic Ocean and this big hurricane which was curiously enough called a whirly girl by the captain and I'm thinking about this you know but I mean it's just part of the first chapter it's
(26:58) not a major part of the first chapter it's just something that happens the first chapter is all about this trip across the Atlantic and so forth and so on and then I get out of Denver and I'm walking down the corridor and as one does in airports and uh and here's here's a picture of me and this is this is a woman with a suitcase and she's crossing the corridor and and and I was swerved a little bit to the left and all of a sudden bang I thought hey I'm the boat she's the hurricane or if you wish
(27:33) the whirly girl and and this corridor is the Atlantic Ocean and uh and you know two seconds is is is two days or whatever it may be uh and now I have to explain to also this event inside my head happened so quickly and so fleetingly that I would not have even noticed it if I weren't kind of an inveterate observer of my own thinking I mean I caught it you know it would have disappeared in a flash and to have no to leave no effect on the world at all but here it is leaving an effect on all of you now ah ha ha my point is analogies happen
(28:15) all the time for no purpose they're fleeting they just they're they're transient they just appear and go away ok it's just the your mind is filled with them now to get you know the poster that was made used these two photographs which were taken at uh my parents ranch back in the 80s I believe now various people may have thought various things about them and I'm just going to tell you what what is here the upper one is in the summer and there's this lovely oak tree that I know very very well she
(28:49) cast a shadow under the you know noonday Sun more or less the lower one is in the winter and there is no Sun at all it's a cloudy day what is that pattern that dark thing under that is a snow shadow if you wish that is the absence of snow ah the snow has fallen but it didn't go through the tree it got caught by the tree and so no snow is on the ground and that darks patch is the absence of snow and it's a kind of a generalization of a shadow I you know to me it was just a sort of a trivial connection but I it
(29:28) joined in many other kinds of shadows that I've thought about over the course of my life I mean I know that in Eastern Oregon and maybe other places there was what they call a rain shadow which is uh to the east of the Cascade Mountains for some hundred or 200 or some miles there's a desert in other words the Cascade Mountains basically stop the clouds from moving and and and so there's no rain to the east of the Cascades and that's called a rain shadow and uh and there are all sorts of other
(30:02) kinds of shadows that I'm not going to go into shadow is a very common metaphor people being in the shadow of their parents or the in the shadow of World War two and so forth and so on um but I want to just make a curious little analogy that may be a new insight into the world uh which is that well firstly this idea that we're expanding the word shadow or expanding the word shadow that in itself is is part of what I wanted to tell you that by seeing new instances of shadow we're expanding our sense of what
(30:36) the word shadow means this happens to me maybe my personal sense as opposed to a public sense but it means it's no less valid but I wanted to say that um we could look at the picture of snow and maybe deduce something about light we know that snow is made out of flakes and we might just guess that because there's an analogy between light and snow maybe light is made out of flakes it's kind of a crazy idea but we'll call it the light flake hypothesis I suppose it's it is a fairly light and flaky
(31:08) hypothesis but uh Hofstadter 2005 maybe we'll come back to that ah another shadow this is one of my favorites ah and we'll we'll stop shadows at that point I was talking with a friend who's who's Italian and his brother is a professor at some University in northern Norway and I said oh my god it must be awfully cold up there and he said no actually it's pretty warm and I said how can that be and he said well you know the Gulf Stream the Gulf Stream uh is warm and I said yeah but uh you know it's very far
(31:47) north he said yeah but it goes north and and I said but he says that the interesting thing is that it where it's cold is southern Norway and I said how is that he said because the Gulf Stream is blocked by England and so I I had this picture in my mind there's I don't you can see the Gulf Stream which is supposed to be red here and and it gets blocked by England and so the shadow of England is on the coast of southern Norway and and the Gulf Stream hits the upper part of Norway so we have a shadow
(32:16) thrown by England of the of the Gulf Stream so it's again a wonderful abstraction of shadow this is the kind of thing that analogy does to our concepts now so here is a just you know this is a simple idea that repeated analogies expand concepts I've taken as an the concept of number here and I'm not going to go into it in any detail I just simply want to say that anybody who's done any math knows that we begin with the positive integers we learn to count then we learn about things like 1/2 and 1/4 and so forth and eventually
(32:56) we learn about zero and the negative numbers and then after many and all of these are analogies these are all all generalizations that are made through analogy and as we as we progress and go further and further we get more and more abstract and so I've indicated some things here a and PI and e to the I PI and Aleph sub Omega different kinds of infinities and I could include matrices in there and on and on and so we have all sorts of numbers and and and it could keep on going concepts expand over our lifetime and they expand for each
(33:33) one of us and expand for our culture ah one of the key points that I want to make here though is that although concepts expand by seeing new instances sometimes we have a concept that has only got one instance but even there it starts to spread and leak so let's talk about that a little bit the basic idea here is there is no fundamental difference between a single memory trace and a category by which I mean a concept no difference category concept same thing okay that's a very important idea of this talk and and I'm
(34:11) just going to give you a thing I call pluralization so I'll read these out loud because I think that they're amusing so there may be two or three young Einsteins among us tonight okay what is a young Einstein that's a pluralization of Einstein clearly Milton Babbitt is no Mozart if you happen to know who Milton Babbitt is if if another Chopin was born in Lompoc what would happen ah it's the next Catcher in the Rye or the Soviet Union's Vietnam the Paris of the Middle East which was once the name of Beirut uh someplace can be
(34:46) actually I once heard Jerusalem being described as a mecca for tourists uh haha a bunch of treacherous quislings uh notice I've gone to the lowercase here Mecca with lowercase even though it comes from originally one thing it gets pluralized and Quisling was a Norwegian foreign minister or a prime minister or something who who I think collaborated with the Nazis I don't remember the details but it became a lowercase word for basically a traitor and um and then Galileo I I don't know that the details
(35:27) of this but I have to assume that it was Galileo who actually used the word Luna in the plural and with a lowercase M in other words talking about what he saw uh he he equated our Moon with those things those dots that he saw through his telescope and called those moons that was in a magnificent leap that pluralized something that nobody had ever ever considered to be other than one unique thing in the world so pluralization is a way in which a single entity becomes a wide category and there really is no difference between a single entity and a
(36:09) category okay ah so I guess I'm just saying this again there's a no fundamental difference between seeing something as a cadogan category member and seeing something as analogous to something else in one case something evokes a concept which has one instance and another case something that evokes a concept which has many instances and which has blurred together ah now we come to another very special thing about human minds our minds are constructed over this is no not new to anybody that with an unlimited quality for chunking by that
(36:49) what I mean is that primordial concepts in some interrelationship become a larger unit a larger conceptual unit like you know a family or something like that and then a family can get incorporated into something larger and and we build our concepts by taking several concepts putting them together putting a membrane around them and then sort of miraculously the internal components sort of disappear and we're left with just this new concept which is kind of like a black box we don't think it's so much about the the these things
(37:27) become semi visible they're sort of lurking in the background but if it's structured at many levels of hierarchy the concepts inside the concepts inside the concepts are certainly just about invisible and it really takes some unpacking to get there so as we build up concepts they get hierarchically larger and larger and larger and more and more complex and I wanted to just give you one example that I thought was really very interesting and I haven't even scratched the surface of this one but I but take a look at it anyway take a look
(38:00) at this this is the notion of a hub for an airline's I mean it's just an attempt to show you how we begin with concepts that we acquire one we're very very young and I've put here things like ball goes to roll roll to wheel wheel gives you spokes and hub and gives you the notion of centrality I'm not saying these these arrows are not necessarily analogy arrows these arrows sort of represent the idea that this thing is sort of part of that concept it's sort of gotten incorporated glommed
(38:32) into that concept and not precisely I'm not I don't have time to spell it out but I want you to see this as a series of higher concepts that are glomming together lower ones these are the lower ones at the top excuse for that reversal of directions but anyway um so bike is a vehicle a bike has wheels a car is a vehicle a bus as a vehicle vehicle another type of vehicle is a plane then that a plane can lead you to an airliner a bus is kind of like an airliner airliner leads you to the more abstract notion of an airline then we
(39:11) have names which we learn when we're very small names suggest that there are things that come in different types then we learn about brands then we learn about companies and an airline is a particular type of company moving then we have the idea of a trip and then a trip can be broken up into legs and legs can be sort of formalized into routes and that's attached to airline it's also attached to a network time appointment timetable chart the network and then this notions abstract notion of network
(39:44) goes to node and then we have to get gets and that's something pretty primordial get and then when we're very small we also learn about by please by me you know money we learn about and then later we learn about economizing and saving money and then we learn about sort of downsizing and how companies have to downsize by the way notice I didn't even put I forgot the whole notion of city and the whole notion of airport I didn't even put that here I mean just imagine all the concepts here that are that are all required to go
(40:12) into the concept of hub and yet when we say you know Denver is United hub do you think about all this stuff it's you don't think at all I mean it's it's you you know this as a chunked concept and uh so it's a very important part of how we think so another point is that there is no fundamental difference though between thinking with very very basic concepts and thinking with these very large concepts because the very large concepts become as familiar and we don't see inside them we don't deal with all
(40:44) the stuff that's inside them so some of the primordial concepts are these and some of the more sophisticated concepts or soap opera hubs sleezeball wilderness protection legislation or scientific breakeven for laser fusion complicated things but if you're familiar with them they're just very ordinary they're they're as familiar as the back of your hand I thought I'd illustrate some rather complex concepts just for my amusement and yours to show you how amazing our human conceptual system is
(41:20) so indulge me with my reading this slide out loud I'll go down vertically so we have the solar system the concept of a slam dunk a beltway plagiarism Jazzercise les a faire economics F an ethnic cleansing the domino theory of condensate of communism cut the next line Bo's condensation or Bose condensate the Wikipedia now I want you to think to yourself how many levels of structure to explain the Wikipedia would you have to you know if you were to try to explain that to somebody from 2000 years ago what would you have to tell
(41:59) them in order to get across the Eddy of the Wikipedia I mean you have to explain computers and networks and the web and an encyclopedia and publishing and who knows what all okay dot-com bubble spam does it not it's hard enough to understand what a Republican and a Democrat are that's a very complex concept gas war the final for y2k the genetic code quantum cryptography a baby-boomer chick-flick wasp the Fed I have no idea what the Fed is I have no concept a gravity no I also have no concept of that I know it's
(42:44) supposed to be served in some sort of supersymmetric partner to the graviton pork belly futures that's a great one fishing with a cat with a pH radar trap affirmative action grocery store checkout stand presidential lecture and wacky walk these are concepts that we deal with very easily very fluently and they are so far removed from the concept network that an ant might have or that a mouse might have or that a dog might have or that a four-year-old might have or that even a twelve-year-old might have so you have to think how many
(43:22) levels there are now we are talking about concepts at many many levels are primordial words simple words some compound words phrases proverbs I'm going to come to this I'm going to sort of illustrate these and then and then a lot of our concepts are totally unlabeled like for example my concept whatever it was of what happened to me when my dad told me they don't do anything there they're just names of variables that was stored in my brain and it was waiting there to be triggered by some event in the future what was the
(44:02) event Monica on the floor with the Dustbuster I mean and and ah you know that was a concept it didn't have a name there's no name for Doug being disillusioned by his father about subscripts not being analogous to super scripts in mathematics I mean that was a thing in my brain it was an ode it was there in some sense or I don't know tis the right word but it was there it was it was retrievable under the right circumstances it's shared essence I hope you will agree with me there it's shared essence with Monica's
(44:37) disillusionment now then so we have a lot of different kinds of things I'm going to talk about these other things me toos in particular and scientific leaps I want to go through this a little bit talking about how analogy making retrieves one thing out of each of these levels I'm not going to go through them all but I just want to you know name some primordial concepts I won't read these out loud but notice by the way in this list that I am not favoring nouns I want you to understand that when I talk
(45:08) about categories I do not think that categories are always visual things like you know overhead projector or shoe or you know even audience categories can be things like as I said please please what that means is there are certain circumstances where that word is evoked the circumstance evokes that mental concept it's a please circumstance there are certain circumstances if I said please to you now I wouldn't make any sense makes no sense at all but if I you know if I'm a little three-year-old and
(45:46) I want something and I say please it makes sense there's certain certain circumstances where it is appropriate and I'm trying to point out here that words of all sorts whether they're adverbs or prepositional pronouns or verbs or nouns they are all categories and they're all equally good and most of them are not visual most of them a lot of them are not sensory whatsoever and theories of of categorization mostly are involved with visual categories visual objects it's so mistaken that is not
(46:20) where the action is and one of my colleagues who I respect very greatly said that he thought that categorization that this kind of level is very very straightforward it's just a matter feature detectors and I think oh my goodness what we are not on sent from the same planet I don't think categorization at that level is anything to do with feature detectors um I mean maybe they play a little role but it's not it's really that's another thing that's for tomorrow that's not for today okay simple
(46:51) concepts be you know those are primordial here are some you know they're getting a little more sophisticated chair I remember there was an exhibit of chairs at the San Francisco International Airport some years ago wonderful exhibit of crazy chairs and then I got books of chairs you can buy books of thousands of different kinds of chairs and the variety is is mind-boggling the same for the letter A and tell me that tell me the the the features of a mess if we're talking about visual categories what are the features of a
(47:25) mess I would like to know which neurons which feature detectors in my brain fire when I see a mess what what about the feature detectors for the word probably are for probably situations and how about for probably which we say sometimes and other times we don't what are the probably situations as opposed to the probably situations and it's a subtle distinction come on I mean well my point is here with a word like well I don't know what part of speech that is it might be an interjection or I think it's something
(47:58) like an interjection maybe it's an adverb it's a little blurry what it is but that's not my point ah my point is that these words that have nothing to do with visual categories visual objects these are revoked by circumstances there are well situations and you know how to use them and if you saw a well in an essay written by a foreigner and or an email written by far-- news ah they don't know how to use it right or they would put some other word in it and they should have put in well you know you know where
(48:31) the word well goes if your native speaker of English because there are well dot dot dot situations and the same for high kind of but anyway no kidding and so forth and so on um compound words getting a little bit more complicated again I'm not going to read you this list but just giving you sense of compound words that are typical that we use all the time some of them have two components some three four five six it's a little blurry doesn't matter they get bigger and bigger and bigger and they sort of know no limit phrases so let me
(49:09) just give you a few phrases that I happen to think of today at random we all know these and I'm not going to read them out loud there but for the grace of God go I pretty please with sugar on top I think that's a nice one been there done that ah well I can't help but read well excuse me put your money where your mouth is that's for sure and those these are evoked by situations these are categories these are categories and I want you to understand that all these things are mental categories and how do
(49:51) we judge whether the category mate the situation that we're facing is a member of this category guess analogy proverbs okay so I've listed a few proverbs random what sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander I don't say that one very often but I do say speak of the devil all the time damned if I do and damned if I don't I say that all the time go directly to jail do not pass go do not collect $200 I called that a proverb but you know it's maybe it's not exactly a proverb maybe I miss categorized that
(50:26) maybe I made a bad analogy here it's all Greek to me back to square one we'll cross that bridge when we come to it and so forth and so on okay I got some of these ideas in fact I was deeply influenced by an article that I read in around 1975 by Joe Becker who's here tonight called the phrasal lexicon and jaw pointed out that what we have in our head is far far richer than a set of words when we talk about our mental lexicon and I can't possibly do justice to his delightful and a stimulating article I mean there
(50:59) a very inspiring article and one of his principles was that the article should apply to itself and he took a lot of the idioms that he used throughout the article and talked about them and listed them in his lists I've always followed that example but proverbs this is something that Roger shank pointed out proverbs our situation labels we use them to we we in fact sometimes proverbs are boiled down into just a single word like sour grapes I know that sounds like two words but I see it with a hyphen sour grapes you know somebody somebody's
(51:34) didn't get a job that they said they wanted and they said odd probably wasn't wouldn't have been interesting to live in you know in Edmonton Alberta or whatever that is it Alberta yeah I wouldn't want to live in Edmonton sour grapes you know it's sort of one one word now I'm going to go down to the really one-word level and I want to talk about the analogies that I have to make when I went to Italy to the well it's a Research Institute in Trento I spent a year there it was a very austere place a
(52:10) very nice place but rather austere and there were people at many levels bureaucrats scientists students people walking the corridors and I never quite knew who were they would say hello to me and I couldn't quite figure and so the question that I had to face that you know from the very beginning was what do you say to these people when you run into them in the corridor and you don't even know quite who they are you recognize them and you sort of know who they are you have spoken to them and you know definitely who they are you know
(52:41) their name or you know them pretty well they're kind of a friend you've eaten lunch with them once or you've you are a friend and naively being American I would say ciao ah that was wrong you don't say ciao to people that you are not on familiar terms with I mean ciao is something that you can say to somebody that you say to too but you don't say ciao to you know the director of the Institute that just doesn't it just doesn't work you say buongiorno or you say solve a and solve a is sort of
(53:11) dinner me Thierry and I learned this and but but I nonetheless was not a native speaker and every time at every moment as I was walking down the corridors I had to be doing these on-the-spot categorizations is this as a child person a solid lay person or a buongiorno person and you know and I sometimes I would mix them up and I would get them confused I would blend them but it was it was you know gradually it kind of got clearer and I got and I was following the what I saw other people doing I was making analogies and I'm not not only analogous
(53:49) to what other people did but analogies between you know people this person is like that person to me and so I said okay so I said solid weight of that person I'll say solid a to this person so words individual words are the locus of a fight every time you try to figure out what word to use there's a subterranean fight going on mostly hidden and I want to just give you a little example of this um my friends Kelly and Dick were visiting my house and um they kept on referring to my office and I kept on thinking what is my
(54:28) office have to do with my house it's over you know across campus and then I realized of course they were talking about my study um and so uh we talked about this I said why you always call it my office when I call it my study and I said aramis your seems like your office I said it doesn't seem like my office and it seems like my study and my office is across campus and and so then we talked a little more and they said well you know in our house on our top floor where we do our work where we have our books and our computers
(55:01) that's where our office we have a home office where we do our work and you have on your top floor which is not your third floor but your second floor you have computers your books and you do your work there and it Maps perfectly so to them it was totally obvious that this was my office and to me it was totally obvious that it was my study because I took my dad is my prime as my prototype he on upper floor of our house up on Mirada he had a study in which he had his freedom calculator and his books and his things and and it
(55:37) was just like what I did in his office was down on campus and so to me it was a guess you could say a no-brainer and it was very interesting to see that both behind both of our visions there were analogies and it showed that word choice is guided by analogy and I'm going to skip a couple of transparencies here and ah I can see I have so many things here I'm not going to be able to really go through them all but I want you to see this picture which illustrates what goes on in word choice I have not labeled the x axis but the x
(56:15) axis in these bar graphs is sort of it's it's a one-dimensional reduction of what you might call semantic space semantic space is a multi-dimensional space of concepts and I've reduced it down to one dimension I've pretended that there's just concepts along one dimension and so here I'm facing a situation which might evoke you know a word like dog and so dog is that is the big winner it's very activated and and maybe a fox is a little bit activated I don't know I'm just making this up and maybe cat is a
(56:47) little bit activated and so forth and so there we have it and it there it's a big dog is so towers above the others enough that it's a big winner and there's no visible or audible I should say competition but a lot of the time when we speak there is audible competition now I want to talk about the audible competition that we hear when we are making when we are speaking and so I'm going to talk about word blends ah here's just a few maybe these I will read to you because I think they're all nice examples I have
(57:24) collection of literally hundreds and hundreds maybe thousands of word blends I just picked a few at random today and these are these are ones that I just listened to I picked them up this was me at the somebody calls on the phone is Danny there that's my son I don't know I'll go sack the lend of see and check trivial everyday ordinary thing it reveals competition it reveals subterranean competition okay don't leave your car there I say to somebody you might get a ticket may or might now this is the kind
(58:02) of thing nobody would hear I mean I pay attention these things as sort of my profession and so I do hear them but most people just don't hear these things ah Danny my son I love this one I can't keep all these things in my bread at the same time I thought that was wonderful brain and head uh-uh-uh he also said hey wait up I'll come with you that was to his sister she was about to go to the grocery store hey wait up I'll gum with you gum is common go just a nice blend of two different ideas and my
(58:36) administrative assistant Helder said every morning I took a cap see ride it's beautiful beautiful and the mayor of Bloomington was on the radio and he talked me was talking about how how we have to be diligent in in in putting in bike paths and other kinds of things in the town and I thought that was a wonderful blend because it's it's it's vigilant and it's diligent and it also has a little bit of village in it and ah this is a fascinating kind of thing now I don't want you to think that blends
(59:09) are always that obvious I want you to understand that blends can be extremely extremely subtle ah here are some examples uh just two but these were in the course that I was giving last semester called something like analogy and words and concepts and I was talking to the class and at one point I just I mean I must have made 500 errors per class session I mean today who knows how many errors I've made they're not discrete things because they come sort of in different levels of strength but maybe major blend
(59:46) maybe major errors today I've made fifty and made maybe I've made 200 I don't know but anyway every day they I was making 500 and I noticed about three because you can't spend all your time monitoring yourself but I did notice at one point I said as it says here I was having trouble finding finding the F was a little too lengthy and I said did anybody hear that nobody even heard it and I said well okay but I was a little long and you want to know why and they say Tommy I guess they were a captive audience
(1:00:18) hahahaha so anyway I said I know there was competition in my head and I happened to know what it was at least part of it I don't know the whole story but at least I know one of the words was find and the other was figure out and I couldn't quite decide now how much else was going on in smite inside my head I don't know in slide and smart okay uh it was it was paused on the banister it was posed on the banister it was posed and it was poised was just a slight wee wrong vowel slight distortion of the
(1:00:54) vowel now you see these kinds of things these kinds of things every word that I'm saying probably has a slight error in it and that's my point every word has a subterranean fight going on inside it you don't know you don't hear it even I don't hear it I'm not privy to what's going on underneath the surface but sometimes I can feel it and sometimes you can hear little hesitations it may just be a hesitation before the word starts it may be the lengthening of a consonant maybe the distortion of a
(1:01:26) vowel it may be a funny intonation all of those are revelatory of the fight between words the analogies that are struggling to take over and to beat the other ones out phrase blends I hope I'm coming to an end phrase blends I won't read these out loud but I think well maybe oh these are funny these I mean and phrase blends are not always funny I'm not you know one of these people who collect errors because it's funny and you publish it you know that kids say the darndest things or whatever that's not my reasons I think errors are
(1:02:03) wonderful funny at times but I don't collect them for that purpose I collect them because I'm interested in understanding what goes on in the minds of human beings so here's ah in an email this is type this is not spoken this is typed I have it still you know I hope the package got there in one shape okay from a native speaker okay a native speakers talking two of them talking in a restaurant neither of them noticed this comment I mean just went by nobody heard anything he was a real easy go lucky guy
(1:02:35) easygoing and happy-go-lucky this one I said I should count my lucky stars I said it on the phone and then I said what is that right something count my lucky stars count my blessings thank my lucky stars okay I mean just these kinds of things are a dime a dozen and that was a dime-a-dozen situation by the way categorized that put my finger right on the essence there ah this one I I typed in an email when I was very tired and I wanted to hit the sack and I said I'm worried that my editor is going to hit the stack and I thought that was a
(1:03:11) marvelous blend of hit the ceiling blow his stack and my own feeling that I wanted to hit the sack okay and then my Dean at one time at Indiana University was trying to lure a person to be in cognitive science and he made this marvelous marvelous statement that will pull no stops unturned to get him I mean this this is amazing all right so I've already said this but I just say it again because I want you to see it in writing every effortless category assignment is actually a seething sub terrain battle of analogies when the
(1:03:54) battle is a landslide there's no evidence when the battles close there's evidence galore okay so we're coming really to the end here thought is the highest level of abstraction seeking I'm sorry the highest level of abstraction putting one's finger on the essence of a situation and then bouncing back and forth between the actual situation and the essence that when found in one's memories in one's memory now I'm going to give you an example that I think is quite charming and it's actually saying
(1:04:27) I found out about last year I spent a long time in year 2005 working on and a talk called well it wasn't called but it was about Einstein's analogy making I wanted to do something for the honest miyabi's 2005 and 100th anniversary and I had the great pleasure of giving this talk in physics departments a few places about the analogies that Einstein made not only in 1905 but in other years and on what I was really astounded was I had never known how Einstein created the concept of that we now know as the
(1:05:03) photon and it was what he thought of as his most revolutionary ever idea and I want to give you a sense of how he did it and I can't obviously give you much of a sense of it but let me at least just give you a slight sense so we begin with something that was known this is the basically what's called the blackbody spectrum what it basically says is if you have radiation bouncing around inside a cavity at a certain temperature there's different amounts at different energies and there's sort of a
(1:05:35) most amount at a certain peak energy you know that's the sort of the wavelength the the wave that wavelength or that frequency is sort of the most predominant and then there's less and less on either side of it longer wavelengths are last shorter wavelengths or less and now there was another situation that was the situation people didn't understand people did understand the situation of thanks to Maxwell and Boltzmann of an ideal gas and ideal gas inside a cavity where people knew that actually they
(1:06:07) didn't really know for sure but they thought that the behavior of an ideal gas was due to molecules bouncing around inside and if they assumed that it was molecules they could make some mathematical calculations and figure out what the curve should be and they figured out the formula for a bell-shaped curve that looked like that that said that for all the different kinetic energies that you have and you can replace kinetic energy if you don't like that word with velocity so for all the different velocities or speeds that
(1:06:33) the molecules could have you know low speeds there weren't very many high speeds there weren't very many but at some intermediate speed there were a lot and and this was the distribution and and it looked kind of like that now not this was around for anybody to see you have to understand but nobody thought about it nobody connected these two ideas until Einstein and Einstein said this looks similar to me ah and so I think that you know maybe it's possible these think this thing over here the ideal gas we think as being made of of
(1:07:07) corpuscles particles molecules and so maybe it's possible that light is also made of particles and he did a lot of elegant mathematical calculation to check this out and he calculated the entropy of these systems and I won't go into any of the detail basically a bell-shaped curve and a bell-shaped curve the analogy between those two like the analogy between my two shadows the light shadow in the snow shadow I decided that light may be made of flakes Einstein decided hundred years before me that I that light might be made out of
(1:07:40) particles and uh and that was the what nowadays we call the light quantum hypothesis and that was the most revolutionary discovery Einstein ever made it came directly out of a simple connection between two bell-shaped curves essentially all right well I guess I am coming to the end and all I need to say on my last transparency so if strokes of genius are made of analogies and personal insights and political decisions and dinner table conversations and me two comments which I didn't cover unfortunately in random reminding and
(1:08:13) instantaneous categorization and blends of all sorts are all native analogies might not all of cognition also be made of analogies that's the cognition core hypothesis remember you heard it first here thank you for more please visit us at stanford.edu
