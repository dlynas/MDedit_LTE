Technofeudalism and Cloud Capital: A Conversation with Yanis Varoufakis
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMSNpq4K67o)

## Transcript:
hello everyone and welcome to today's
webinar with our esteemed guest giannis
farofakis
my name is ryan c slickowski i'm an
undergraduate here
at stanford and a member of stanford
government which is a student-led
organization here on campus dedicated to
promoting civic engagement
unfortunately the professors we asked to
moderate this event were busy teaching
classes so you all get me instead
but don't worry you can make sure that i
am asking mr barafakas thoughtful
questions by uh posting your own
questions in the q a feature on the
screen uh let's get started uh in in
mark fischer's well-known book
capitalist realism he argues that there
is a quote widespread sense that not
only is capitalism the only viable
political and economic system but also
that it is now impossible to even
imagine a coherent alternative to it
our guest today
doesn't seem to have that problem not
only does he argue that capitalism is
already on its way out the door but he
also has a vision for what he thinks a
better system for organizing the means
of production might look like
giannis verofakis is a professor at the
university of athens a former finance
minister of greece and the leader of his
own political party mera25
his most recent book another now is a
novel that offers a vision for an
alternative society that is more just
and fair it is my pleasure to introduce
yannis fairfax
thank you very much and thank you thank
you everyone thank you to the
stanford um government society i believe
a student led body
it's always good to escape
politics
party politics and find myself even
through a video link
right back in
academia and before i begin let me tell
you whether the greatest shock to me was
when in 2015 i jumped from academia to
the world of party politics
the sudden realization
that you're not allowed to change your
mind
i was
on a television panel and i was
confronted with political opponents
and you know
i'm used to adversarial reasoning
because that's what we do in academia
we sit
opposite one another we present our
hypothesis
and the other side tries to shoot them
down
because this is the darwinian process by
which good ideas are selected by
shooting down the weaker ones but the
beauty of academic life and you should
enjoy it as much as you can before you
get out there into the unreal world of
cut throat competition um the the beauty
of academic life is that you know when
your great idea what you thought was a
great idea has just been shot down in
flames by an opponent an adversary
you can rejoice in this and you say my
goodness you know what you're right
my idea was bonkers um let's move on you
cannot do this in politics you know when
you're sitting there in the television
panel and you have the political
opponent in front of you if you dare say
uh you know what i think you're right
that's it your party is going to
jettison you you're going to do an
enormous amount of damage to your party
so anyway that that was my
non-introduction
um so let's get stuck into the subject
of today
look uh a bit of background is always
necessary
uh i come from a left-wing tradition
so it is as if i was brought on this
world
on this earth
with the conviction that people like me
have a duty to overthrow capitalism
to replace it with something
more palatable
more efficient more rational more fair
of course my political opponents and
ideological opponents and intellectual
opponents the ones who believe that
capitalism is the ultimate form
of uh
socio-economic organization think that
that was mad
it doesn't really matter whether i was
right or whether they were right what
matters is that
in the last few years especially after
2008 the great financial collapse of
2008
i've
been feeling very uneasy about my role
in this world uh
not because the left has failed left has
most certainly failed especially after
1991 you know and the collapse of the
soviet union the demise of social
democracy the retreat of the commons uh
that
triumphant march of uh globalized
capitalism neoliberals and so on we have
the left are in
a state of permanent defeat there's no
doubt about it i'm used to that but
that's not the way i was feeling queasy
i was feeling crazy because
capitalism was overthrowing itself
without help
it's a very sad feeling as a lefty who
believed that you know
our purpose was he was to overthrow
capitalism to be observing that
capitalism was doing it all by itself
and didn't need us at all ignored us we
were not agents of history we were
um irrelevant
so
that's that's my background
in other words the thesis that i will be
presenting to you
that capitalism is already being usurped
and undermined and replaced by something
which i call technofeudalism
this doesn't come easy to me this is not
gloating on my part
this is
a statement of um you know a new defeat
for people like myself uh we you know we
we came here supposedly to
undermine capitalism but we failed and
something worse than capitalism is
coming into being so i'm saying what i'm
going to say to you
is with huge reputation
um regret
and concern
but it is my honest deep conviction so
this is what's going on
so what exactly is going to
allow me to to get started
once upon a time
capitalism was hailed
as a market system
a system which um replaced
the power of clan
of land ownership
of
inherited political power
it replaced it
with a decentralized system
where
one and only one motive
drove the world
profit maximization the
the profit motive which liberals
presented as a much
kinder motive
than that of feudalism
the motive to
use the power of the salt
and the power to subjugate peasants
and bond them to the land and extract
wealth from their harvests
um the capitals was a major advance and
there's no doubt that
it was
and you don't need to be
a free marketeer to believe that karl
marx's communist manifesto and friedrich
henges is commonly much first the first
four pages are opinion
to the liberating power of capitalism
but the idea of that capital of
capitalism that you know
it's greater proponents like adam smith
david ricardo the classics
of um
liberal free-market thinking
as well as karl marx
the opponent of characters the idea that
these people had of capitalism
um was an idea that became obsolete by
the beginning of the 20th century
capitalism was morphed into something
that its
early proponents and
detractors would not recognize
because remember the idea of adam smith
was that capitalism was
a system in which
the baker the brewer and the butcher
competed against other other bakers
brewers and butchers

in the market
for
you know the daily
material goods that we need the bread
the ale
the meat uh each one of them
was trying to satiate our independent
exogenous to the system
and very personal
needs preferences desires
and to the extent that their private
profit depended on undermining one
another so you know if you're a baker
you're trying to steal
the clients of all other bakers and how
do you do that by providing better bread
at a lower price in more plentiful
quantities
so
you know you are
selfish or at least self-interested
but
the market is a mechanism which as if by
invisible hand be where operating behind
our backs
is uh pushing us as if you know through
divine providence even though this is a
secular story
uh pushing us towards
serving the social good the common good
even though or actually because it is
not our objective
to serve the public good it's a
unintended consequence a beautiful
philosophical human kind of smithian
nugget
but for this to work you need two things
uh you need
competition
right you need to have many bakers and
many small brewers and many small
butchers so that none of them
can monopolize the market and you need
something else
you need a splendid independence between
on the one hand
uh the market
and on the other hand
our preferences our preferences must be
not god-given but individually
determined
we must be sovereign
consumers in the sense that we know
what we want
we determine what we want we are the
creators of our desires and nobody
messes with our desires you don't have
somebody brainwashing
well by
the beginning of the 20th century that
was no longer to neither of the two
prerequisites
the
invention
invention the if you want maxwell's
advances in the theory of electro
electromagnetism
the combination of magnetic magnetism
and electricity in uh maxwell's
mathematics
gave rise
to thomas edison
to westinghouse
to henry ford
because once you combine electricity
with magnetism you had networks
when edison
invented the light bulb the electric
oven
and the power station that would provide
the electricity through a grid that he
owned that was running across new york
city
right that company
is nothing yeah it simply does not
feature in adam smith's wealth of
nations you know it cannot be imagined
in terms of the baker the brewer and the
butcher there can be no competition by
definition this is a grid it's a network
that
cannot sustain competition it is exactly
the opposite it's like it's more soviet
than american
this way in the sense that there is a
pyramid
top-down
greed
um central climbed centrally
administered
network it's a networked company a
network conglomerate
if you add to that
the simple fact that
to
fund the construction of that
conglomerate
uh the available money was not enough
so there was no bank that was large
enough to provide the funding to
somebody like thomas edison to do this
and the stock exchange was not not even
large enough
you know there was not
there was insufficient capital for this
so what happened if you look at it
historically and that started with the
railways in the 19th century in the
united states and in britain
smaller banks began to get to merge
and to acquire one another so small
banks merge to create
mega banks
so mega firms like edison
the need for mega firms to come into
being create mega banks so you have mega
finance and mega business
emerging in the 20th century early 20th
century
that was the gilded age
because
let's face it those mega banks
uh didn't have the money what they did
was they created it out of thin air
they effectively you know
provided people like thomas edison and
western thousands ford
huge overdraft facilities so they
created the money out of nowhere
these were not savings that turned into
into investments this was thin air
that um
essentially transferred wealth from the
future into the present in the form of
investments that were provided to mr
edison
in the hope that these investments would
create the wealth that then would repay
the future
and for a while he was doing it
and
as
this financialization and creation of
network firms proceeded
uh the stock of change is virtually
because little people middle class
people
uh could see that the shares of these
companies were going up and up and up
like tesla today or in the last couple
of years three years four years
and they all wanted a piece of the
action so they they took out loans to
buy the shares so you had extreme
financialization the roaring twenties
even the music of the 1920s reveals that
kind of
dynamism
and of course talk
came
to a halting
crash in 1929 because this is what
happens when you build up
bubbles even if those bubbles are
created because those bubbles created
network firms
in the same way that the dot-com bubble
if you're you know old enough to
remember but when the internet first
spawned the first internet
um
you know new economy digital economy
craze in just before 2001 and then
everything crashed in 2001 still we
ended up with you know um
um fiber optics and and various
technologies which were left over so
bubbles are destructive but at the same
time they leave a capital stock behind
um
so you know
so we have 1929 this is uh a moment of
truth for capitalism because uh it was
more or less destroyed
as we knew it and it was rebuilt because
of the second world war and to some
extent a new deal roosevelt's new deal
um and and then you know the moment the
war starts that's when the crisis goes
away because
the united states of america became
another soviet union
the war economy was not based on the
market we had john kenneth galbraith
great galbraith who was a young man back
then was appointed by president
roosevelt to be the price tsar maybe i
shouldn't be using russian terms these
days you know why but that's what he was
being called in 1940s
galbraith's job was to fix every price
in the united states it's mind-boggling
just to say that
and when he was asked
how did you do it
i mean it must have been a very tough
job he said no it was not hard they were
already already fixed by the cartels
by the
the great conglomerates that were
running the show
um
and
so you know you have a war economy which
is a centrally planned economy
in other words yes it was privately
owned the economy but the state told the
private
entrepreneurs
what price and how much and what quality
and the state provided them with
enormous
resources
for r d you know
propulsion all the science that was
created
as part of the manhattan project and so
on and so forth
and then we come out of the war and the
great
the great
fear of the new dealers in washington dc
as we were exiting the war around 1944
before the end of the war but when it
was clear that the allies would win
uh the great fear was a return of the
great depression
um because the gis would come back from
asia and from europe
and then all those factories that were
working under the water economy
producing anything from aircraft
aircraft carriers to bullets even if you
converted them to produce white goods
yeah washing machines refrigerator blah
blah blah
there wasn't enough demand in the united
states for all these washing machines
cars and refrigerators they weren't
enough americans
even if you funded all the americans so
they had to create
the
wood system which was effectively the
new deal
they knew
pretty large in fact
the new deal encompassed
europe and that gave rise to the
european union because don't believe us
europeans would claim that the european
union was our construction this was an
american design and execution but don't
tell europeans that that i said that
they don't like to hear it um and japan
japan was
rebuilt by the united states the
constitution was created by the united
states just like germany let's not
forget that so you have the brethren was
here
at the very same time um while all this
was happening
um you have the beginning of my story
of what i am going to build upon you
know to claim the techno fidelism has
already replaced capitalism without us
noticing
um it begins with freeware commercial
television my story
now
i think the the best
source for this is not some academic
book but it's
madmen the series
if you watch madman you get the whole
story
how
the war economy begot what john kenneth
cultivates the president of the wartime
period
later
in the 1960s
referred to as the techno structure
galbraith was describing a new class of
entrepreneur a new class of expert
engineer
uh management
guru
um
somebody like you know
maybe
ford himself or uh a convert hilton who
had a concept he had uh they you know
and and these people met they were not
that many there were some some like 500
people
um the entrepreneurs who run
the cartels of big business
the
the banks were tamed because of the new
deal and the britain would system the
banks played a very small role then
because they had huge restrictions on
what they could do
that with the those were imposed after
america was burned by 1929 by roosevelt
and his successors and republican
successors as well kept those capital
controls in place thankfully
um and people like don draper the
protagonist of madmen
who is the inspirational figure
who represents in my mind
what don draper
the advertising guru represents is the
manufacture of desire because you have
companies that are manufacturing
products
you know anything from mcdonald's to
codec cameras to
you know to hilton hotels these are the
brands
of the
conglomerate of the techno structure
they have an amazing capacity to
overproduce so scarce is no longer a
problem you have massive production
never before
um has humanity had the capacity to
overproduce to that extent so it was a
question of managing not scarcity but
managing access
and that meant you needed a second
manufacturing production line the
the one was to produce the cars the and
the hamburgers and and you know
and their cameras
but you need to do a second production
line that would manufacture the desire
for these brands and that's advertising
this is where commercial television
comes in there because commercial
television is a very funny beast if you
think about it free-to-air commercial
television before we go on get get on to
the story of
of cable television and you know
subscription services
first game commercial
free to air television this is really
very interesting because it's commercial
free-to-air television is a very strange
beast in the sense that because it's
freeware
the viewers are not the customers
simply because the customers don't have
to pay
so they're not customers really they're
just viewers
so how did what was the business model
the business model was
programs that attract the attention of
an audience so the audience can be sold
to advertisers
so the real customers of freeware
television are the
advertisers
and there is a market for attention
that's advertising
a market for grabbing our attention and
selling our attention to advertisers so
that advertisers can put into our minds
uh desires that we need we didn't have
that's a whole point of advertising
advertising is not about information
it's about propaganda it's about
brainwashing it's putting into your head
it's not such a bad thing you know um
i enjoy having desires implanted in my
brain so that i can then satisfy them
i'm not being moralistic here but it is
a major challenge to the liberal
proposition remember what i said that
first the two pillars of
liberalism or free market liberalism was
one was exogenous preferences while
professors know stopped being exogenous
in the 1950s with commercial federal
television
because you know don draper and his ilk
were magnificent
at commodifying our senses
through the market for attention that
was created by free-to-air television
uh yeah that's hugely important and of
course that the market for goods is
it was not competitive anymore it was
cartel based as
galbraith
noticed during the war um
okay
now let's make a link
i've got this thing here
you know what this
is a google assistant
um in the next room
there is an alexa as well because i like
playing with these things
um so i asked this thing what it thought
of alexa
and it said um i like her blue light
that was the answer
and you know we assistants should stick
together
um okay that's you know yeah it actually
did
you know two hours ago
um and alexa heard that next door and
said thank you
(Laughter)
so you know but
that sounds like
an anecdote but there is a serious point
to be made here what exactly is this
thing
um it is sold to us actually because
this was a gift from google by the way
thank you
for spying on me now while i'm speaking
and you know what i'm telling the people
that stanford
but you know it's it's it's sold to us
it's presented to us alexa is presented
to us
as a mechanical slave
an assistant
um
a robot that we tell to you know we
instruct to do things that are helpful
for us like you know switch on the
lights
um create a shopping list uh you know
order a book for me
uh whatever
and and it doesn't there's no other
that's you know part of what it does but
it's not what it is
because let's face it that machine on
its own is useless it is connected via
the network to the cloud
and um what we have
is
behind the system this is an algorithm
okay initially
these algorithms beginning with google
and amazon and netflix and so on what
they did was they identified clusters of
users
with similar patterns of preferences
patterns search patterns and
choices
shopping
patterns
then they group us together to complete
the to help us complete our searches to
suggest books to us records
recommend films and so on
but then came folks a breakthrough
at some point some time ago
in the 2000s the algorithms cease to be
passive
once algorithms
like alexa like like google and so on
like siri once they could evaluate their
own performance
they began to behave like agents
they monitored
their own performance and they reacted
to the outcomes of their own actions not
that they were clever they were stupid
of course but they were
behaving
as if they were agents monitoring and
reacting to the outcomes of their own
choices
inside them they feature a reward
function that in real time evaluates the
algorithm function
and they not only affect us
but additionally they are affected
themselves alexa is affected herself or
this one is affected itself
by the way i am being affected
so it's a dialectician's delight it's a
never-ending ping-pong
between me and it it and me and not just
me and it but all of you
who have phones that are connected to
some assistant sometimes without you
noticing this is not the case about
surveillance capitalism something much
more profound i believe
because before we know it
the task of instilling desires in our
soul
has been taken away from don draper and
some human
advertising guru
okay and has been handed over
to the alexis and the citizen because
the alexis and the series are not
persons
they are cloud based
algorithms with an infinity almost
you know um billions or millions of
nodes
that are connected to each one of us
um
so you know this is the the this is the
beginning of the realization
that um
capital is not what it used to be
now capital will always exist what's
capital
allow me to give you
the economic definition it's not money
capital used to be something really
simple before capitalism
it used to be produced means of
production so a sword was not a piece of
capital because it could produce
other goods and
unless you think that
you know a severed head
or a piece torso is
a good it's not good
but you know a plow steel plow attractor
a fishing rod these are produced means
of production that's what capital used
to be
now what capitalism did
was because capital predates capitals by
millennia
capitalism was a transfer
of social power from those who had land
to those who owned capital
because up until the end of the feudal
era the late feudal era power emanated
from land ownership
with the enclosures the creation of the
working class the
erection of the first factories that
were machine based
you had a shift of power from the owners
of land to the owners of capital
but now
capital
has changed its scales we have a new
kind of capital which i
for reasons that i think have already
become obvious i called cloud capital
because it is this ineffable capital
it's not like a machine that you can
identify you know this this is a machine
but
if you know just like our russian
friends are recognizing now that they've
been cut off from the updates by android
and google during the war in ukraine um
if if your software is not connecting
you to the internet
um
it's useless
or
it will become useless very very soon so
it is a connection through the cloud
that crea
that gives substance to this new form of
algorithmic infinitely dielectric
capital
um
you know like cloud-based alexa
cloud-based google city and so on you
see
in the end
since you are students of politics
uh what really matters is who has the
power to make other people do things on
their behalf
in the end that's what politics is it's
about the power yeah as vladimir ilyich
lenin put it brilliantly it's a question
of who does what to whom
and who can make you do things on their
behalf
um so you know feed the lords could make
you do things for them you would
um toil the land bring in the harvest
and the sheriff will be sent to collect
six percent of your harvest so you were
effectively working for a whole year
or season for the for the feudal lord
similarly if you're working for amazon
in a warehouse you're working for jeff
bezos at a very large extent he has the
capacity
to make you do things that are in his
interest now you may say that you're
receiving your weight of course you're
receiving wages peasants were also
receiving some tweet which they um
dearly missed after the enclosures once
they were expelled from the land during
the 18th century in britain
um in any case um
so the question is who gets you to do
things who has power to make you do
stuff
now this little machine here has an
enormous amount of power because
you see what what happens is it's
this this dielectrical process is
mind-boggling
think about i am training this machine
here
to learn what i want
what my patterns are
then through the cloud this machine
communicates this and and and creates a
huge you know big data
base
combining my patterns of behavior with
those of millions of other people
therefore it acquires a capacity to
train me back i've trained it and now it
trains me
uh to train it
to train me to train it to train me
to do things
and this is
a first in human history that there is a
machine which is essentially
um
a cloud-based algorithm belonging to
shareholders not to us not to you not to
me but particular shareholders
it's an algorithmic form of capital i
called cla i call it cloud capital that
we are enriching with our
non-waged labor
now this is crucial folks
why because up until recently with
traditional capitalism
the only way a capitalist got acquired
capital
at the
primary level was by having waged labor
by employing labor for a wage you would
employ enough
henry ford would employ a worker the
worker would work at the production line
to produce modality or whatever
the
the difference between the value of the
car and the commercial value the market
value of the wage was surplus value part
of that surplus value was used by tom by
henry ford to repay the banker another
part to repay you know for the
to pay for the rent
of the land rent the ground rent and
what was left over was henry ford's
profit
he kept a small amount of it and the
rest he plowed back into
his capital in the form of investment so
capital and wage labor were joined at
the hip
well now this is no longer the case
this thing is listening to me
talking to you
the other day seriously this is not a
joke
i was telling a bad joke to friend and
he intervened
and said that's a good joke seriously
where the forum
and proceeded to give me a joke
so
why don't i switch it off because i
learned from it while it's learning from
me this is the dialectical process that
was going on about but the point i'm
making here is that
every time we take our phones around we
are adding to the google to the couple
to the to the cloud capital of google
and we do that without being waged
laborers
working for google this has never
happened before this is primarily this
is unique so a whole humanity every time
you post a picture in facebook instagram
video on tiktok whatever
you're adding to the cloud capital of
someone
of very very few people i call those
people cloudy lists
i mean they are capitalists but the
capital that they own are cloud capitals
it's not the same thing as you know
owning a machine
they own this cloud capital and those
who own cloud capital
have three powers over the rest of
society which are unique fundamental
profound
and have never been encountered before
the first already we have um i have
covered
it is the power to get us to tell it to
tell us to tell you to tell it
what we want and to get us you know to
buy things that we neither need not want
like don draper but far more efficiently
because of the algorithmic doing and
throwing the this dialectical ping-pong
between me training it and it training
me without the intervention of a human
being
so don draper has been turned into a
robot and that is an immense power over
my preferences your preferences
our activity what we do that's one thing
the second thing i've already mentioned
again
it is the power to um

the power to extract from us
um
direct labor
like when we post stuff on facebook
which adds to the capital stock of very
very few people
com directly
yeah
and then there's a third power
um which is um
also quite
mind-boggling
the third
power that the people are called
cloudless the owners of cloud capital
have
is
the power
invested in them
by immense
economies of scale in the financial
markets
we know that don't we that um
if you are the owner of an algorithm of
algorithmic capital of cloud capital
you don't need
ever to have a profit in order to be
rich
no
if i had said that to adam smith dave
ricardo karl marx even henry ford they
would look at me and say what how can
you become super rich without ever
having made the profits
nothing of tesla tesla tesla's value has
nothing to do with its profits profits
are minuscule
it didn't have any profits until
recently uber never had the profit
netflix doesn't have a profit spotify
doesn't have a profit airbnb doesn't
have a profit but you know if you own
the airbnb and netflix and uber you
would be amongst the ultra ultra other
super rich
uh and this is
this is the first now that
has to be explained
in two ways
the standard explanation that the wall
street journal will provide you with is
of course that um
it's all about expectations
people expect that these
companies will eventually become
i don't buy that
i think that the reason why they're
profitable is because since 2008
when
algorithmically driven finance
crashed and burned under the weight of
its own hubris
beginning with lehman brothers since
september of 2008
um our governments
in their infinite wisdom go together in
london actually in april in 2009
together with the central banks and they
printed
quadrillions of dollars yen
euros pound sterling swiss francs
and so on
japanese yen
i may have said it already
in order to float finance
since then
big business has become absolutely
hooked
on central bank money you can see today
we have seven percent inflation in the
united states and the fed cannot
unwind
its stock of what's called quantitative
easing you know the central bank money
produced since 2008 because if it does
then the whole thing is going to come
crashing down so
there is
cloud capital
and then there is central bank money now
and this is how i end because i want to
open up the conversation
is this capitalism
no it is
capitalism has moved
into many different varieties there's no
doubt about that it's it's gone through
amazing
obvious forces
i already described one earlier
after the world of adam smith of the
bakers the brewers and the butchers we
shifted to the world of the edisons the
westinghouses and uh you know the henry
fords
the convent hiltons and the technical
structure and all that that was the main
major metamorphosis but it was still
capitalism
because the two pillars of capitalism
have not changed until recently what are
the two pillars of capitalism one is
that it is a system
driven
by private profit
profit is the fuel profit is to
capitalism what um you know
gas is to
the internal combustion engine
and the second pillar of capitalism is
markets
everything was going on through markets
labor markets
money markets
the market for health the market for
education the market for human capital
the market for this market for that
and that's the difference between
capitalism and federalism under
feudalism production mostly production
was happening outside markets
you know in the in the fiefdoms of
europe as well as of other parts of the
world
there was no labor market you know you
could not resign
you never receive the weight you simply
lived on the land you ate what you
produced and the
landlord simply collected a percentage
of your harvest that's not the market
that's extraction pure extraction
non-market extraction so capitalism is
you know
had two legs one was profitability the
other is markets well
they're gone
because profitability has been replaced
if i'm correct in my assessment
uh by central bank money it is what
drives the system
and i gave an example before
and secondly
markets have been
increasingly replaced by algorithm by
cloud money because think about it alexa
belongs to amazon the moment you or i
visit amazon.com we have excellent
capitalism we've entered a digital
system belonging to
jeff bezos and run by the an algorithm
that belongs to jeff bases
one man decides what can be solved what
cannot be solved uh what i see when i'm
in amazon.com yeah what i see is
different to what you see and who
decides that's just basis algorithms
this is not like a marketplace that has
been taken taken over by monopoly this
is like a marketplace where everything
belongs to one man everything the
buildings the pavement you know the park
benches which on which we sit the air we
breathe
uh our head is being turned by this man
to decide what we can see what we can't
see in that marketplace that fictional
digital market it's a digital system
this is why
i was telling from beginning that i'm
feeling uneasy because we live in
something which is post capitalist
now we could have called with hyper
capitalism but then again back in the
18th century we could have called
capitalism hyper feudalism or market
feudalism but it would have been
it would have been a linguistic
loss
not to be
making this distinction between
feudalism and something com completely
distinct capitalism so i think that it
will be a mistake to call our present
system um
capitalism hyper capitalist this is not
capitalism anymore
and that's how i end
anticipating your questions
well thank you for
for that that historical survey about
capitalism's permutations and and new
theories about why it's it's not
capitalism anymore at all
it seems like one of the one of the
features of techno feudalism is that the
the costs to consumers are so veiled it
isn't is it is it isn't always obvious
to consumers why
what um you might call amazon's fiefdom
um is harming them or how these devices
are changing the economic system in
favor of very few people
at the same time the benefits are super
obvious uh you know it's a seemingly
free service
um
that you know can help you get your
inexpensive
you know
trinket or gadget to your door in in in
24 hours and that's pretty convenient in
another now you wrote that no desperate
oligarch or entrepreneur has
enough power to rule over millions
without their tacit consent so i'm
wondering what's it going to take for
consumers to withdraw that consent on a
massive level especially considering
that people you know myself included are
often willing to give up rights in
exchange for convenience
is that withdrawal even what you're
calling for
well look i have a google assistant i
have an alexa i have a laptop i'm
using zoom my goodness i'm the last to
complain about technology i love
technology and i don't want to go back
to a
bucolic
you know hippie-like life in the woods
and it's nice to escape occasionally
into the woods but i would hate to live
there you know it's what uh karl marx
referred to as the idiocy of rural life
um i'm a techie
but the question as always is who owns
it
horns of this whole
system uh
but let me answer or try to answer your
question directly
how can this change okay it's not going
to change because um of lectures like
mine
or nice discussions that you and i have
because
the the the the inertia
of
the the late daily grind
and the convenience of
big tech
is just
devastating let's face it most people
out there
are struggling especially now with
inflation with you know years of
stagnation
of middle class and working class
incomes they're struggling to make ends
meet
you and i can talk about wax lyrical
about you know environmental
um
disaster about techno feudalism they
don't have they're not privileged enough
to be to have this the time that you and
i are having now you know they work all
all day and they come home and they want
to crash out in front of the box and
they want to watch a reality show or you
know lose themselves in tick tock
and that is not a criticism that is a
fact
so
um high theory and great political
discussions are not going to change what
is going to change things however
is a sense
a realization that this is a stupid
system which is destroying their lives
uh and that is going to come whether we
like it or not
it's going to come because
of a major
time bomb in the foundations of this
techno feudalism
and let me explain this um
during the pandemic we had about 15
trillion dollars being printed
on behalf of um
yeah
the the private banks and what the
private banks did was to give it to
their mates
amongst the corporates they didn't give
it to you or to me
or to the people out there they gave it
to the corporations which were already
swimming in money which they were not
investing right and why did he give it
to them because they want to give to
somebody safe
so 15 trillion dollars was was printed
and wasted
because what happened was
um those conglomerates that didn't need
money to invest were given free money by
the banks that took it from the central
banks so what did they do they went to
wall street to the frankfurt frankfurt
stock exchange the city of london and
they bought back their own shares
because that way they drove their share
that that way they they drove their
share price up
their bonuses and salaries dependent are
linked to their surprise so they're
swimming
they're singing all the way to the bank
uh
and you know with all this money what do
they do they buy more houses they put
more money into private equity private
equity comes and buys businesses breaks
them up
pushes wages further down for the money
bankrupts
companies
assets trips
uh it reduces profitability even more
because it transfers wealth even more to
the one that already have had huge
current wealth transfer to them by the
central banks
and this creates a
typical changing
recession
because the many simply do not have this
the money to buy this all the stuff from
amazon
so even though amazon makes huge
quantities of profit the little people
who are selling their stuff on amazon
are suffering
and you know the wages continue to
stagnate inequality continues to get
worse change is preceding a base that
has an effect on people through you know
tornadoes through
droughts through floods through all the
things that we know either the
consequence of uh so you know
discontent
is brewing
now
there is no guarantee that this is a
good thing
because it can
feed donald trump
or bolsonaro in brazil or the various
fascists that we have in europe or more
wars or putin or i don't know whom right
um
it could lead to more barbarism no doubt
about that but at the same time what it
means is it is not going to allow for
stability
this system that we have is unstable
it is up to democrats by democrats i
don't mean the democratic party of the
united states of america with whom i
don't want to have much to do
but you know democrats people who
actually believe in genuine democracy uh
it's up to us international
to collaborate in order to harness this
uh this discontent uh to produce
let's call it techno democracy instead
of technology
i want to bring the conversation briefly
back to back to stanford um
because so many of the audience members
are stanford students uh right here on
campus our main library um just put up a
big conversation board um where there's
some stimulating prompt and students can
walk by and write down responses
uh and join the conversation for
everyone to see the prompt that's up
right now is
what should silicon valley be
students have written a bunch of
different responses ranging from a hub
for free and uh free speech and ideas
more local community initiatives small
business opportunities cultural efforts
for the people more women people of
color and gender marginalized people
someone also wrote broken up
and finally someone wrote demolished uh
i especially relate to that last one
after watching meta's metaverse
promotional video but be honest if you
were to walk by that board in green
library what would you write
there would be two sentences or two
phrases one
one
employee one share
one vote
which sounds like a crazy
idea but i think
it's time has come i can explain that
and the second thing i would uh
do is i would uh put
a bill of digital rights
digital data rights whereby you own your
data
which also means however you you cannot
receive free apps
and free services
you will have to pay for your service
and in exchange for payment
for your data
um
the first part concerns corporate law
uh you see we
once upon a time it was it sounded
preposterous to promote the idea
of uh universal suffrage that one person
should have one vote when it comes to
letting our presidents and members of
congress parliament and so on it sounded
quite preposterous even some of the most
liberal
and progressive people like john stuart
mill were against it
the argument was you can't give
an equal vote to somebody who's educated
and good and virtuous
as you will to an uneducated you know
piece of scum
that's what they said
right
so it was a very radical idea but i
think corton
it's quite popular now that the idea
that everybody should have one vote
independently of their merit
and i think the same thing should apply
in the realm where all the important
decisions are made which is no longer in
congress
or in local senates or local councils
but it is in the board of directors in
the
in in the general assemblies of
shareholders
um the thing about it in
within it sounds like and the assembly
of shareholders sounds like a
shareholders democracy that's a
democracy in which you have as many
posts as you can afford to buy shares
so imagine you know just you know i
wrote this book that you were kind
enough to mention at the beginning
another now
um which is a political science science
fiction novel and
i told you with the idea of what would
happen if you introduced a very simple
corporate law one person one employee
one share one vote and suddenly jeff
bezos
would have to have the support of the
majority of the people working in amazon
he wouldn't have it he would have to use
his powers of persuasion look at the
powers of his wealth
in order to acquire i would be
fascinated
i'm not saying that you know
that they're all equal we're not only
good i mean some people
but
i have no data there's a far better
um strategist than i am very clever man
loathsome man but yeah they're clever
man el mask i mean he's brilliant
there's no doubt about that but it
wouldn't be fantastic if he had to prove
his brilliance by putting his ideas to
vote of his employees
and also you know you you mentioned
breaking up those conglomerates well i
think that those would be broken up
democratically without the state coming
in and saying we are going to break you
up because if you have a company that
has you know 20 000 employees uh and
every one employee
he
you know has a vote and participates in
decision making now those employees at
some point say hang on a second this is
not efficient we can all decide together
about such a large corporation so take
general electric uh why have this huge
conglomerate why not break it up the
unit that um
that makes washing machines another unit
that makes engines another unit that
makes uh
um you know whatever they make
um so i think that it would be a natural
process of reducing the size of firms
without the state coming in and imposing
so it's in a sense a very liberal idea
uh the one person won't share one vote
and also if you have a universal basic
income
and
you know a digital
wallet with the fed
allowing you direct access
to banking
using the fed
suddenly you don't need to be banked
with bank of america or citigroup
these vouchers that take your money for
doing what for monopolizing the payment
system really that's what they do
and if they want to exist fine but they
have to lure you with good services in
terms of investment packages and savings
schemes and so on
and from that digital wallet
you know a stream of micro payments are
made
to internet services that you buy
online almost automatically as you use
them so you know the people who deserve
develop those apps get an income stream
they don't have to go to go through
advertising through capturing your
attention and inputting ideas into your
head as to what you should have
um and your data should be your own they
can't use it so they cannot i let you
know alex and google cannot manipulate
me while i'm manipulating it
or thinking that i'm manipulating it and
when it really is manipulating so this
is what i would have put up on your
library
board
yeah you might have might have needed a
few pages for that one um well no what i
would have done is you know
i would have just written two pictures
and and have a qr code
there you go
uh so i'll just end with two questions
that's getting late in greece um
i'll end with two questions that are
relevant to your student audience um
one is and this one also is pulled from
the q a
the q a section where people were asking
for a
um some kind of material that they can
they can read afterwards um to to to
learn more so
um what what book would you uh recommend
and and you know extra points if you can
grab it from the bookshelf behind you
and the second question is
um well i'm not that good um i've got
everybody else's
(Laughter)
the second question really quickly is is
what what do you want to say to
us students who are about to emerge from
college and and into our careers
okay the book i will have to recommend
another now the number that you
mentioned because in it i talk about
techno fidelism and i also
put forward in the context of this
political science fiction novel my
uh alternative you know what would a
technically advanced
democratic society
look like how would it be organized so
it's in there and now i'm in the process
of writing a book
which is called
techno feudalism
but that won't come up in the united
states for another year
so this is what i would recommend um
okay
guidance to students
look it's very condescending to tell
people when when i was in your shoes i
hated old
folks like myself telling them what to
do in life
um so i'm just going to
to be very
predictable
and say that um
you know you can you can only succeed
seriously succeed in something you're
good at
so don't listen to people
like me tell me what you should do
try to do something that you enjoy
i know it's a standard answer but i
think it remains
a very good piece of advice
don't go for what seems like a lucrative
line of business
uh what is lucrative today is not going
to be looked at even five years
and there's no way of predicting
so you might as well you know if you
want to be an astronomer
how many positions are there in
astronomy that's a good one
well you could be that one
if you're really good at it
so
giannis thank you so much for coming to
speak with us uh this has been an
illuminating talk uh and i'm i'm i'm so
grateful to have been able to share this
last hour with you and and this audience
um
thank you all for coming and
have a lovely rest of your days
thank you very much i enjoyed it
