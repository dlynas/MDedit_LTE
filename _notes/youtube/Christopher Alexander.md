## Transcript:
good evening
and welcome my name is chase rind i'm
the executive director here at the
national building museum and it's my
pleasure to welcome you all here tonight
on
on behalf of our staff at our board of
trustees i welcome you to the museum on
this very special occasion
the presentation of the 11th annual
vincent scully prize to christopher
alexander
architect author educator and a founder
of the center for environmental
structure
the museum is delighted that two former
scully prize laureates have joined
tonight's ceremony
vitold robczynski noted author and
professor of urbanism and real estate at
the university of pennsylvania
received the scully prize in 2007 for
his work as a scholar
author and professor and for his
exploration of american urbanism and
elizabeth platerzeiberk
who together with her partner andrei
stuani received the prize in 2004.
liz is a founding principal of the
miami-based firm duane platter-zyburk
and dean of the university of miami's
school of architecture
she also serves on the sculley prize
jury
i would like to recognize other other
jury members that made the selection to
honor christopher alexander
ned cramer editor-in-chief of architect
magazine
architect and fellow museum board member
deborah burke
and robert peck who was recently
appointed commissioner of public
buildings for the u.s
general services administration and
finally i do need to acknowledge
scott kratz our vice president for
education who has worked so closely with
the jury
and organizing this prize i commend the
jury
for their inspired choice of tonight's
honoree
for nearly 40 years christopher
alexander has challenged the
architectural establishment
to pay more attention to the human
element of design
and his work continues to influence
innovators around the world
the vincent scully prize was established
in 1999
under the leadership of david schwarz
nationally renowned
architect and chair of the scully prize
jury
the prize recognizes exemplary practice
scholarship or criticism in architecture
landscape architecture historic
preservation or
urban design it is with david's vision
and the vision of the entire scully jury
that the prize has become one of the
most significant awards in the
architecture
and design fields please join me in
welcoming
david schwartz to the stage thank you
thank you um i've been doing this as my
11th year of doing this so for those of
you who have been here before i'm sure
that in
some way i'll repeat myself chase has
said a great deal of what i was going to
say
um and talking about when the prize was
first came about and some of mr
alexander's
reasons for being selected but i don't
want to talk briefly about the prize
itself
and why it is important and why it is
important to me and why it should be
important to
all of us one of the interesting things
about architecture is it's an urban
design
and the built environment is it's a
product we all use on a daily basis
it's a product that we don't talk about
very much
i was once designing a a secondary
school
and the director of the selection
committee said
excuse me during my interview why should
we hire you and pay you a lot of money
rather than to give more money for
scholarships
my response was when you drove out here
to conduct this interview what did you
pass
and they all described their drive and i
said you think it was pretty
and they all went and talked about how
ugly the environment was between their
homes and the school
and i asked them then at what age did
they think it was appropriate to start
educating their children about design
we won um they got a nice building
they concluded that the time to ask
their children to start learning about
design was then
and i would say likewise that the time
that we all need to start talking about
design is now
in every moment this is a particularly
interesting period of design because our
design end of the built environment
because i think there's a great deal of
dialogue and discussion
about how we ought to live and how we
ought to build
one of the reasons that we chose mr
alexander professor alexander was
he in many ways really does round out
many of our scully awardees and as we
choose the people we're very concerned
with the diversity of people
that the prize honors and the diversity
of thought and opinion that is expressed
in terms of the build environment
uh past award winners have included
andres and liz as
as chase talked about who really have
brought a very unique view of a
practitioner writer to talking about how
we should build our cities
we have the iago and prince charles who
have been real advocates for good design
in very different ways
we've tried to be very multicultural in
our look at how we approach
the built environment we don't think
it's simply a western question but a
worldwide question
and one of the reasons this is so
important is because the west is a model
for development
and i think it we owe it to the rest of
the world to discuss
how to develop because so many people do
look to us
in a lot of ways professor alexander
also follows in that
some of our awardees have been
practitioners uh for example bob stern
and again
um vince uh jane excuse me andres and
bob venturi
and i think one of the interesting
things is to look at both practitioners
who both practice and think it is very
important to
look at theory and figure out how to
apply that theory to the built
environment
there have been a lot of of of
non-practitioners as well we don't want
this to be an award for practitioners
one of the things that's so interesting
about professor alexander is the fact
that he has been a professor for almost
40 years
he's been extremely instrumental in
developing how a
40 years worth of students think he's
written extensively hundreds of articles
and books
some of his books have been really
seminal in how we think about
architecture today
for example a pattern language and towns
buildings and construction
he really has changed the way a couple
of generations have looked at the built
environment had a very profound impact
on the discussion that people have about
the built environment
the point of this prize is to recognize
people who cause conversation
and who cause people to change the
nature of conversation
because it's only through discussion of
the built environment that will build
the world we want to live in
it is only through involved citizenry
and educated citizenry that we are going
to build a better place to be
it's very interesting to me to note how
public opinion has really changed
the attitude towards environmental
responsibility in the world
at large today i can remember 10 years
ago if you asked a developer whether
they were interested in producing a
green building they would laugh at you
now they come and they tell you they
need to build green buildings
they don't necessarily need to build
green buildings because they think it's
the right thing to do
they think it's something the public
will demand and i think that really
speaks
very largely to how the impact of people
like you and the world at large can
really change how we think about the
built environment
and how we build what we build as well
as what we build
so it is with a great deal of pleasure
that we give the award to mr alexander
today we are
very up until a week ago we thought he
was coming um unhappily
um we gave it to him a year too late in
his life
because his health has suffered a
setback so he won't be joining us this
evening
but he really does deserve this
recognition i'm very happy we're able to
give it to him
and that he can see a video of this
evening's proceedings so he can feel
appropriately warmly about your
reception of him
thank you
thank you david and now you can see why
the museum so values david's leadership
on this prize
he's bringing together for us for all of
us
some great great names and great ideas
the namesake for the prize vincent
scully
was not able to join us this evening but
he did ask me to
read a few words on his behalf
vince writes and i quote christopher
alexander has been a major pioneer
in the revival of a humane architecture
and urbanism
that has been taking place over the past
forty years
during the sixties and seventies when
most architects were preoccupied with
individual buildings
alexander was concerned with the
patterns of the man-made environment as
a whole
and with their relation to the natural
world
in his most influential of many books a
pattern language of 1977
he tells us that he is dealing first
with towns
and only then with individual buildings
and he says that each of them should
help quote
repair the world around it so
taking its place in what he calls the
web of nature
it is a message of healing and as a
gentle herald of the new contextual and
ecological codes of contemporary urban
practice it puts us in alexander's debt
today and with those words vince scully
aptly describes the immense contribution
mr alexander
has made to the world of architecture
and contemporary urban planning
now as david just mentioned sadly
christopher was unable to join us this
evening and could not travel from his
home in london
we are though very fortunate to have
assembled a panel of christopher's
colleagues and leading experts in the
design field who will be sharing their
thoughts about how christopher's work
has impacted the profession and we are
filming tonight's event so that we can
share this special program
with christopher we are joined this
evening by michael mahaffey
former director of education prince's
charitable trust
a research associate at the center for
environmental structure
and noted international lecturer and
author on
architecture planning philosophy
semiotics
and the work of christopher alexander
michael will be providing a brief
overview of christopher's contribution
to the field
and he will be followed by randy schmidt
who will read a personal note from
christopher
randy is an architect and an engineer
who has worked with chris for more than
25 years
he is vice president of the center for
environmental structure
and he is the project manager for ces
design
building and construction projects
following their presentations we will
we will be joined by a distinguished
panel including elizabeth plater zyburk
michael mahaffey and vitold rapchinsky
moderated by pulitzer prize winning
architecture
critic for the boston globe robert
campbell
please welcome michael mahaffey
thanks very much chase and uh chris is
here in spirit with us tonight
um what we're going to do is uh randy's
going to read a statement from chris
and very interestingly is going to
introduce some new work so
i told chris in joking you don't have to
do new work for this award they're going
to give it to you anyway
but be that as it may we're going to
describe it a little bit
a direct message from chris and and
carry on
perhaps at a later venue if chris can
join us perhaps in six months or so
i don't think i'm saying anything
controversial to anyone here tonight
when i observed that in the last century
we humans have begun to make a very uh
worrisome mess of our planet
i think those of us in this room are
aware of that and of course a lot of
this has to do with the way
uh the ways that we've chosen to build
our world
and for many people there's a growing
perception that the manifest
sustainability of this state of affairs
is in some perhaps deep and important
way
uh connected to the growing ugliness of
the world
that we're building so i think one
reason that christopher alexander's work
strikes
such a strong cord emotional cord for so
many people
is that he took up this challenge a long
time ago and he offered a very humane
vision of a more hopeful alternative he
reminded us of the beautiful and
harmonious places
that we are capable of achieving and
have achieved
and he offered some ideas about how to
achieve them again
in a way that's likely to be much more
sustainable
and more beautiful and interestingly the
evolutionary
biologists are beginning to confirm that
the beauty of sustainable ecosystems
is not an accident and does have a
relationship to the kind of structure
that they have
so they're starting to be some broader
scientific evidence
to support this link between what is
sustainable and what is beautiful
many of you may know that chris started
as a mathematician and a physicist
and only then went into architecture
which he does see is very much related
but that fact surprises a number of
people who seem to think of chris as a
kind of
california poet of the built environment
a romantic
and even a quixotic figure but let me
suggest to you that things are much more
interesting than that
there's a great story about how chris as
a precocious 16 year old
uh went to cambridge and won his
scholarship
uh he and the other finalists were in
their last examination replicating a
famous
physics experiment using very sensitive
laboratory equipment
and chris kept getting the wrong result
he
was really frustrated he turned in his
incomplete work dejected and went home
convinced that he had lost this
wonderful opportunity
and so he was astonished when a few
weeks later he actually was awarded the
scholarship
it turns out that there was a very
strong electromagnet that was skewing
the results
and giving a slightly distorted reading
and the other candidates who knew the
theory
uh were adjusting uh their results ever
so slightly
almost imperceptibly to fit the theory
and chris
alone was stubbornly sticking with what
he saw
and he won the scholarship on that basis
and ever since then
chris has said that he's made a
commitment to never
ever let his own or anyone else's
preconceptions
color what he himself found to be true
in his own
raw encounter with the world that had to
be the place where everything had its
firmly anchored roots
now this has made chris a rather
obstinate character at times
as he himself will tell us he's
certainly been frank and speaking out
about the sorts of modern architectural
mistakes
that we all lament and the
self-rationalizing ideologies that have
perpetuated them and he's certainly not
tried very hard to go along with
prevailing
institutional mindsets or
diplomatic politics his laser-like focus
has really been elsewhere
but this has really been the price to be
paid i think
to do the work that he's done and the
evident benefits
that have come out of it and that
willingness to follow the path of what
he's found
to wherever it has led him has taken him
in undeniably
surprising new directions at times
directions that have
surprised him perhaps as much as anyone
else but let me assert that he has
in fact been on a continuous path from
the beginning and we can see that very
clearly if we look at his
career and that's not to say that
everything that chris has come up with
along the way is true
any more than for any other investigator
in fact chris himself will tell us
that some of it isn't true in fact i
don't know of many authors who will
use the 10th anniversary of their own
highly influential book
as chris did with notes on the synthesis
of form uh
to to say you know you really shouldn't
believe all the stuff that's in this
book i'm on to some other stuff now
but what i think has to be conceded is
that
the fellow has come up with some
remarkably useful stuff
uh going far beyond the perennial
popularity of the books
and i'll start just by giving you some
mundane examples
i bet a lot of people have iphones in
this room
and what do you know you have chris
alexander technology in your pockets
the structure of pattern languages is
embodied in its operating system
and in the language of the apps that it
uses along with the macintosh the mac
system and many other computer systems
and uh probably many of us have used
wikis in the last uh
couple of weeks uh that too was uh
inspired by chris's work as
ward cunningham the inventor of wiki uh
confirmed to me in an
interview a few months ago or if you've
used a computer game like simcity or
many other games and much other software
you've used pattern languages i was
involved in a symposium
last week with ward and some others to
see where pattern languages are going
and it was really fascinating to hear
and to see some of what's going on
not just in computers but in a lot of
other fields
today you can find in the published
literature and i'm just going to scroll
through these very briefly
pattern language is for human computer
interface for collaborative work
for conservation economies for
environmental research
for innovative management and research
for strategic project management
for weddings i love that one and a
number of other things
and for those who think there's not
really uh rigorous science involved here
there are in fact pattern languages for
amino and nucleic acid
sequences and what i think must be one
of the most fascinating examples
a new paper a recent paper on pattern
languages
for multicellular organisms the
evolution of multicellular organisms
from
the precambrian explosion to the
organisms like us pretty uh fantastic
mind-blowing stuff
and there are hundreds uh hundreds more
i love this one a pattern language for
provisioning and managing quality
constrained services and distributed
real-time and embedded systems
somebody else will have to explain to
you what that and that one is
and this all came from a bloody
architect
and that mystical bay area guy uh no
less
so clearly there's some useful stuff
coming out of
this guy's work and as i noted this goes
back to chris's early
and very rigorous work documented in the
book notes on the synthesis of form
uh which is upstairs by the way and in
the paper uh
which many of you may know a city is not
a tree his effort to tease apart the
secrets of complexity
along with others of that time like
herbert simon and in planning the
wonderful
jane jacobs and chris never left that
pursuit
of the relationship of parts to wholes
that wonderful word
you may not know but uh it's it's fallen
into disuse mariology
the uniting theme of his work from the
beginning right up through the rather
mind-blowing conclusions in the new work
uh the nature of order
how does nature create patterns of
complexity beauty and sustainability
what can we learn from that process how
what are our own technological systems
doing wrong that we can make them more
robust
in that way and that goes right back to
that lab in in cambridge
and this has always always been grounded
in real confrontations with observable
human phenomena in projects in systems
in social uh context and in real human
lives
and this is one important reason that
chris has never gotten lost in the
abstractions
never let his theories or his artistic
interest leave the real
human realm the real quality of people's
lives and their relation to their
ecology
and for him this was surely the
overriding responsibility of the
architectural profession
and the architectural applications are
continuing to develop and have
recently shown their own form of surging
innovation uh thanks to chris his own
recent work
in this area which uh randy our
colleague randy schmidt will describe
and thanks to some of the folks who are
chris's students and and colleagues and
and their collaborators and there's an
army of them out there
applying pattern languages updating and
evolving and improving them
integrating the insights of his
ambitious new book the nature of order
and doing a lot of other pretty
interesting things our good colleagues
who are leaders of the congress for the
new urbanism have been taking these
insights forward for
quite a long time making very useful
advances in
how we might change the operating system
of
unsustainable sprawl development and
begin to
to transform it into something more
humane and more whole
doug farr who is the co-developer of
lead nd
and by the way lead is another a very
interesting way of changing the
operating system as
as i think was said earlier
doug has based his fine new book
sustainable urbanism on the
pattern language structure as well so
there are a lot of people
taking advantage of this going forward
dealing with sustainability and social
collaboration and the other
great collaborations of our day and
inspired by
our honoree's remarkable lifetime of
work and i know that's very very
gratifying to him so while chris has
clearly accomplished some astonishing
things in his own
half century of work in many ways he's
only opened doors for others to walk
through
and open up whole new topics and i hope
he will
take some satisfaction in this growing
army that's out there
now you notice that a lot of this work
does come down to technology
and when you look at it chris's work is
really very simply
all about technology not in the
limited sense of mechanical
industrialization
of the last century or two but
technology as the more
basic knowledge of how to relate parts
to holes
how to make things how to make places
how to make them beautiful
and how to make them truly humane and
truly sustainable
how to make them more alive in some
important sense
we need to figure this out far better
than we have
and in a sense what chris has been
stressing is that
is that we have some ingredient missing
in our technology today
something that is not as rich or as
sustainable
as what nature does and what life does
on a routine basis
something that in principle certainly
could be incorporated into our
technology
if we could simply understand better
what we're doing
because in a sense what we have been
doing is using a very
formulaic template-based kind of
technology
that is heavily reliant on
standardization and replication
and we've been missing the power of
adaptation
and differentiation which is what life
does so phenomenally
and so powerfully and so sustainably
and we can do it too and in fact have
done it in many
ancient cultures but in our current
unsustainable model
we've lost the language for doing so the
poetic structure of the processes
in our cultures that have made buildings
and places come alive
as we see routinely from the best
historical examples
and we see so rarely uh in new places
today
in particular chris notes that the way
we build today is still based too much
on
the standardized building rules the
abstracted building processes and
especially
the abstracted game theory rules of debt
and profit
and how they affect the various actors a
severe constraint
in what chris's student and colleague
howard davis called
the culture of building
howard has a very fine book by that name
by the way if we're going to get to a
sustainable new model for the built
environment as we must
this is one of the crucial things that
we must reform
so in his indefatigable some would say
even quixotic way
chris has gone back to ask the most
basic questions about all this
doing project-based research asking how
we might go about reforming these kinds
of roles and processes
methods that might allow people to be
able to work together more effectively
to grow something more beautiful more
living more sustainable more whole
and he's developed some ideas about
generative sequences and generative
codes
and also about how pattern languages
might work in a broader and more
communitarian
form of collaborative building now
this might or might not result in a big
breakthrough in architecture
or in some unexpected application in
other fields
and that's the risk that any
investigator has to run
but if history is any guide i'd like to
suggest to you
tonight that at the very least this very
interesting fellow is worth watching
very very closely and if i may say so
cheering on
so on that note i'm pleased to turn it
over to our good colleague
randy schmidt who will read out a
message that chris has prepared
for this occasion thank you
thank you michael and i'm very sorry
that
chris could not be here and i'm glad to
have the chance to read a message
to you from him
the scully prize committee approached me
with the news that they hoped i would
accept the 2009 prize i agreed and
expected to provide them in the audience
at the 2009 ceremony with a brief
lecture that expressed a deep-seated
and probing discussion of the nature of
building form
it was my intention to make this
discussion almost entirely visual
an essay governed by the content and
character of the buildings i had built
during the last 40 years
i have for years been selecting slides
of my work
with the purpose of drawing attention to
the interior morphological character of
those buildings that come closest in my
opinion
to my own aspirations as an architect i
now suspect too
that these are similar to the
aspirations of the scully prize itself
i've been thinking long and hard about
the stated purpose of the scully prize
the goals of this prize and the
intentions that were set forth by
professor scully himself
whether i've hit the target in that
regard the future will perhaps let us
know
but these intentions as they are
reflected in the human character of the
slides have now also come in my mind to
be identified with my own aspirations
during my working life as an architect
unfortunately tonight i'm not able to be
with you in person due to the
devastating case of pneumonia
which i have still not overcome i very
much regret missing the opportunity to
speak with you directly
instead i have prepared a written
summary of my lecture and have asked my
colleague randy schmidt to read this
summary to you
my fundamental proposition in the
lecture is that our environment our
built world
must originate with the ideas and
feelings and relationships that bring
society to life
we need to construct our environment in
such a way that the environment
itself its structure its relationships
its internal configurations
must always derive from the living
structure of society of human action
the geometry of human configurations and
of our relationships to the land
and to our own private and public
persona
that means that the environment viewed
as a microcosm must consist of many
small relationships among things and
these highly personal relationships
exist at a variety of scales
the environment will come to life for us
if and only if it is built from
generating relationships inherent
in the acts of our daily lives the more
we are able to rehearse our social and
psychological relationships and
reinforce them the more we will be
comfortable
at ease and whole within the fabric of
all that we have made for ourselves
that is because it is above all a human
endeavor
in contrast the less well we succeed in
fitting our environment to the small
details of the social and human
relationships of our society and culture
the more misfitted we shall be in our
world and the more unfortunate we shall
continue to become
logically this is a very simple scheme
we need to assess and reckon up the
human and physical relationships on
which we thrive
then we need to construct realistically
the physical relationships which
when built into the fabric of our
environment will nourish our social and
emotional lives
each physical circumstance produces a
different way of feeling and being
each provides a direct and profound
relationship between the physical
configuration and the experience of
feelings that are generated by it
in the most positive environments the
effect is that the physical
configurations cause people to release
their capacity
for life in specific and spontaneous
terms
for example in order to simplify this
idea i shall refer to a number of
configurations which can appear in our
environment
in particular i shall call these
configurations which are most profound
most
trenchant the more archetypal
configurations
they do the most work in making
connections with human beings
or in reverse we may say that people
make the most profound connections with
those configurations where the
connections are the most archetypal
at present and at the time of this
writing i have identified about 20 of
these archetypal configurations
each of these configurations pulls on
the emotions of the people who are
living or taking part in the
configurations
the physical configuration pulls out
from the people who experience the place
some complex of emotions images and
archetypal forms
the words that follow are all similar
but they are not the same
they show how the mind activates itself
in the context of the environment
as these examples will show the
environment activated by these
configurations depends on certain kinds
of words
such as engenders baguettes
spawns provokes brings about
elicits gives rise to
prompts stirs
initiates instigates sets up
stimulates produces
mobilizes sparks arouses
energizes the elements which participate
in any one of the 20 given
configurations
will pull forth from the emotions of the
people who take part
whatever total and holistic response
which arises typically in that kind of
archetypal configuration
these configurations and in a more
complete version of this paper that will
be on the order of 250
discernible and different configurations
create a baseline of possible archetypes
which mobilizes people's reactions
their visible visceral and psychological
responses
i ask you now to look at about 250
pictures
you will see these pictures one after
the another with short time intervals
between them
the pictures will take five or six
minutes to run
all the configurations describe ways in
which the physical environment releases
and activates our feelings
the pictures you will see are not the
high style photographs typically
practiced and presented by architectural
photographers
they are rather pictures caught on the
wing caught in the moment
where the content of the picture and its
feeling are the all-important thing
these pictures demonstrate very simply
the kinds of structure that support life
they show morphology in our surroundings
that supports humanity and allows it to
thrive along with other inhabitants of
this world
life is never fixed it's not perfect but
it is always recognizable
and it always shares a certain essence
i hope these pictures show a taste a
savor an
atmosphere that is the essence of living
structure it is always imperfect
just as it is in part perfect
these forms express life and come from
life and encourage life in what is built
next door to them
in some of the slides you will see
mock-ups and construction work going on
that is because the emphasis in all our
works is on the making of things
we do not believe that a living
environment can be created from drawings
or from machine-like activities rather
the work
and the beauty of the work the inner
feeling of the building
will come from a dedication to using a
making process that engenders life
in every case shown here the center for
environmental structure controlled the
construction process
as a process and could therefore
maintain this emphasis directly
and i'll just let the slides play for a
few minutes
many of these pictures show archetypal
configurations
looking at these pictures does something
to us inside or being in the presence of
the configuration touches us for reasons
that are not entirely clear yet are
nonetheless powerful in the way they
work on us
they touch our core as we walk around
the world we find that certain buildings
have a direct power to touch us to
involve us
such configurations have a direct power
to attach themselves to us
our emotions our thoughts our feelings
are mobilized by these configurations
we find ourselves bewitched affected
moved
these are the spaces to which we
gravitate
we come back to them again and again
this is similar to the experiences we
have in nature
in a grove of trees on a hilltop in a
canyon next to a broad river
or a gentle valley the shore of a quiet
lake
the same feeling can come from a door
which has wide frames or borders
a long table for six to twelve people
a niche where people sleep a window seat
an avenue a gate a small tree which
stands purposefully and collects people
gatherings meetings music
through its configuration for emphasis i
will show two of these pictures again
how many such places exist in the
environments you know
it is rare isn't it to find such places
yet it is the activity of making the
environment with these archetypal
qualities that gives depths to the
places
and what people feel there i hope you
can see the powerful role they play
in our surroundings these elements need
to be brought out
and used more carefully i will attempt
to be more precise about them in a more
detailed follow-up piece to these
remarks
my deepest wish is to support people's
deep core by helping them to build
bridges
public places that supports each
person's strengths and elasticity
with the intention of creating places
that engender well-being
if we try our best to make all the
places in our contemporary world with
such vivid depth of feeling
surely then something will happen that
changes our lives
ladies and gentlemen thank you very much
it's a typical performance of this kind
and that the audience is totally
invisible to us because all the lights
are in our eyes
so if we don't pick out our friends you
can forgive us my name is robert
campbell i was introduced earlier
i'm an architect i write about
architecture and i've been involved with
it for a long time
and it's my pleasure to introduce the
two panelists who have not been
introduced so far at the far end
we talked vetoed ribcinsky i didn't say
that right didn't i read chinsky
the mark martin and margie myerson
professor of urbanism and professor of
real estate
at the university of pennsylvania school
of design and the architecture critic
for the online magazine slade
he is a scholar author professor and
architect
his diverse publications have explored
the evolution of comfort
the history of the weekend did you do a
lot of research for that
american urbanism in a search for the
origins of the screwdriver
among other books his book home a short
history of an idea which i
would recommend very highly has been
translated into 10 languages
his biography of landscape architect
fred frederick law olmsted
a clearing in the distance received the
j anthony lucas
a prize and other awards and one of his
latest books is last harvest
exploring again one that i would
recommend among others the subject of
american real estate development using
case studies as examples
his essays appear regularly in the new
york review of books the atlantic
the op-ed pages of the wall street
journal and the new york times
is also written for the new yorker and
time
vitold was the eighth recipient of the
vincent scully prize
uh i feel like i'm probably introducing
people who don't need to be introduced
to you but i've been asked to do it
elizabeth plato zeibert a founding
principal of duane plato's eyebrook and
company
the leading new urbanist development and
architectural and planning firm
she is dean of the university of miami
school of architecture
where she has taught since 1979 having
initiated the program
graduate program in suburb and town
design in 1988
elizabeth continues to explore current
issues in city growth
and reconstruction with students and
faculty
she is a multi-tasker as i'm constantly
noting
served as director of the center for
urban community and design
organizing and promoting numerous design
exercises for the benefit of communities
throughout south florida
founder and emeritus board member of the
congress for the new urbanism
established in 1993 characterized by the
new york times as quote
the most important phenomenon to emerge
in american architecture
in the post-cold war era end quote she
has co-authored two books
suburban nation the rise of sprawl and
the decline of the american dream
and the new civic arc liz was the third
recipient of the vincent scully
prize along with andres duane her
partner um
what we're going to do in the time
remaining
i'm going to give a kind of little
introduction about the impact of
christopher alexander on my own life
as a kind of personal uh view of what
we've heard more
more objective views maybe and then i'm
going to ask each of the three panelists
to make whatever
preparatory remarks they want to and
then we will have a panel discussion
uh first of all um christopher alexander
whom i know only slightly has had an
enormous
critical influence on my life and work
and i think that's true of a whole
generation of people
i think that for me it began on the
second floor of the library of the
graduate school of design at harvard
when i was looking for something else
and i ran across an essay by this person
christopher alexander
called and it's been mentioned earlier
the city is not a tree
that was a landmark moment in my
development as a thinker and as an
architect
it blew up it really blew away what were
the foundational principles of the
education at harvard in those days
and it established in me an interest in
actually looking at the world
and not looking at a set of preconceived
abstract
mechanical ideas that were supposed to
replace the existing world
um it was uh i i would try to describe
it but the diagrams have described it
better but a city is not a tree
the easiest way to think of it is in
transportation
here's your house little street think of
it as a tree you know your house is the
leaf at the end and then
the little branch comes down and meets
the bigger branch and the bigger branch
and the bigger rain and finally around
the interstate
and there's been no way to move
laterally through that system you can
only
come and collect in the trunk of the
tree or the interstate
that was a planning principle that
you'll see exemplified in the british
new towns after world war ii and many
other examples of modernist planning
this rationalized thing well the rebel
community size enough for an elementary
school and then we'll have five of those
and they'll be big enough for high
school and we'll have five of those
they'll be big enough for downtown blah
blah blah blah blah
chris being a mathematician used the
term semi-lattice
and i've never understood at all what
that means
network network but a much more complex
with diagonal connections and lateral
connections through the system the way
that people in fact
really live my next contact was a book
called the oregon
experiment which again blew me away and
i remember talking to oxford university
press about it and they had no idea what
they had and i said you'll still be
selling this book
at the turn of the century that was nine
years ago the turn of the century now
the book came out sometime in the i
would think the 1970s
uh and it it posits the idea of growth
by gradual accretion that's the
certainly one of the many ideas that i
took out of it you don't master plan the
world
and build it the world grows by
accretions and then each new accretion
that you add to the existing fabric
has something to relate to uh it's uh
i don't know whether they still use it
as the planning guide at the university
of oregon i was out there about
10 12 years ago and i was told they were
still using it they do still that's the
guide
and then came what i think is chris's
masterpiece in the one book if you read
only one book
to read it's a pattern language i regret
to inform you that it's longer than war
and peace
uh at eleven hundred and
i can't get to the end here
eleven hundred and sixty some pages um
so you don't it's but it's luckily not a
narrative so you don't have to begin at
the beginning and read through to the
end you can dip in anywhere
uh this was for me um
i don't i don't know how to describe it
chris is someone that i would
characterize as one of a trio and the
other two have been mentioned here often
chris
and vincent scully and jane jacobs all
share the same quality which is a
distrust
of the intellectual abstract platonic
idea of the world
they are people who go out and look and
draw their conclusions
and write them down and go home they
don't spend any time at all worrying
about where they belong in the firmament
of intellectual ideas and theories and
movements in architecture because
they're not
they out all three of them act as if
they'd never read a book
as if it all came out of their own
observation i assume that they have at
some point read books
uh but they don't quote them they quote
themselves
um i think this this amounts to a
movement and that's why we've heard
these names and three of them now have
won
this prize um a different way of looking
at the world a way that i think is much
more appropriate
um
and then finally my last experience of
chris before i actually met him was a
lecture he gave at harvard on persian
and turkish and turkish carpets
uh not a topic that i have any had
thought i had any interest in at all
and again i came away with an idea that
had never occurred to me before that has
been
rooted in my mind ever since which is
that in a large pattern like the pattern
of a carpet
it's made up of smaller patterns each of
which is complete in itself
simple simple idea but when you see the
examples of yes it's done this way and
no it's not done this way you realize
why to right away the logic of that and
then you can translate that into city
planning
the city as a whole but each part of it
is a whole
it's similar to what cholera said about
poetry but i won't go into that
i visited him in his home uh his country
home
uh in sussex i guess it is south of
london a couple years ago
and uh it's uh it's an interesting house
two jaguars in the driveway
uh a painting of queen elizabeth the
first and of henry viii
each from life and an extraordinary
collection of paintings that chris
himself has done and he never seems to
advertise himself as a painter
but they were all over the place they
were obviously heavily influenced by
bernard that would be the sort of
leading
uh painter in his kind of portfolio
uh the richness of colors the
exaggerated uh kind of quality that of
light that you think of in bernard's
work
and maybe a little uh um
of some others too um
i just it it it was a house that was on
the
in the doomsday book uh the list of
houses in england that were made by
william the conqueror
after 1066 and all that and
obviously it had been added to and
changed over much time but you had the
sense of a person deeply rooted
uh not only in in the in the place and
the time
but in his own work his own his own
underpinnings of his own work
i was going to quote just i was what i
did to prepare for this was leaf through
a pattern line which
i was going to quote something that by
accident struck me but i probably could
have gone into it at 100 points and
found something equally interesting
this is a pattern called open stairs and
he always begins with a picture
he always begins with an observation
something you can see
and then from that he deduces a premise
which in this case is
about internal staircases being bad and
external staircases that run up
the outside of buildings being good and
then he always has a discussion of that
in effect we are saying that a
centralized entrance
centralized entrance into a building
that takes you to a corridor and stair
in a traditional manner
modernist manner which funnels everyone
in the building through it
has in its nature the trappings of
control
this is the real chris alexander
emerging here
while the pattern of many open stairs
leading off the public streets
direct to private doors has in its
nature the fact of independence
free comings and goings we can see this
most easily in the cases where the
centralized door is without question a
source of social control hates social
control
in workplaces with a central entrance
and a time clock
workers punch in and out and they have
to make excuses when they are leaving at
a time that is not normal
in some kinds of student housing people
are asked to sign in and out
blah blah blah blah and then at some
place in here i don't want to read it
all but he
he uses the word anarchism
and he's saying the kind of world that
anybody can enter anywhere and anybody
can see anybody in
anywhere and it's all mixed up like that
is an anarchy and he loves it
and i thought to myself as i was reading
that the other day now wait a minute
didn't he write books about order
pattern what do pattern and order have
to do with anarchy
and that's the last point that i would
try to leave with you he is an
absolutely anarchic person he had a
great deal of difficulty
dealing as many people did in berkeley
with the administration of the
university of california
at berkeley and had many conflicts with
them and a naturally anarchic person who
is looking for a kind of order
that will absorb and encompass anarchy
that an order within which anarchy can
live
uh that's a big bill but i would if i
had to sum up what it seems to me he's
been trying to do
that's what i would that's what i would
do but i do recommend this
absolutely wonderful book you don't have
to agree with it i disagree with a lot
of it
but there won't be a page on it that
won't stimulate your thinking and make
you wonder about something that you
haven't thought about before having said
that i'll move on to michael mahaffey
and we'll have some kind of introductory
remarks from each of these guys and then
we'll have
a panel discussion go ahead i just want
to say very briefly because i've already
spoken and i'd love to hear from these
guys
but uh picking up on that point you know
chris is
talks a lot about self-organization and
about the way things organized
spontaneously and and what you need to
sort of let that happen
i think that's been his passion all
along that um
he's very interested in just
finding the ways to allow for example
people to build by themselves for
themselves
uh things to happen in the way that they
happen spontaneously in this sort of
bottom-up way very very close to jane
jacobs in a lot of ways
i one other point very quickly i was at
a i mentioned a
symposium last week with four of the
original six
pattern language authors it was really
fascinating to hear
their thinking about what in what went
into the book and this was very much the
spirit of it
um what was going on in berkeley at that
time in the
in the 1960s and early 1970s and
what it took to to sort of uh allow
a more spontaneous um sustainable
kind of growth instead of the sort of
rigid top-down
uh mechanical stuff that was causing
obviously so many problems at that time
i'll find an order big enough and
complex enough to absorb all those
individual
initiatives exactly well said liz
you know it's very interesting to
think of remarks to make this evening
because christopher alexander has always
been
part of um our professional and academic
life
in a way that he's just automatically
there
um and so as i did the same as everyone
else most likely
i went back to the favorite books
and i was actually surprised to see that
a pattern language came out in 77
because somehow i thought it was there
before i even started
being an architect in the earlier 70s um
and the reason i think it seemed that
way is that
it's always felt that christopher
alexander's presence has
been in the in the background supporting
us as um
he said himself in his own words
in our work and
his writings really have been his
writings and lectures
a bulkhead for practice for many of us
a kind of safe haven by his very
thorough examination of how people use
buildings and how
one might design incorporating that kind
of analysis
that's the first part that i remember
about his books
and this is of course at a time which
continues when architects are expected
to tell the user how to live in
buildings
of designs that never have heretofore
existed
still being very much promoted in our
profession
so he gave us the cover in a sense when
i say us
i mean of course andres in my practice
and the new urbanists
as a whole the courage
to buck the dominant professional and
academic trends
the in the inclination to focus beyond
the individual building
on place making that might in fact
please its users
a kind of radical idea um
his scholarship um and after all the
the words in the prize mentioned
scholarship and criticism the
description of it and i thought that
chris's scholarship
in fact has been his criticism
um by his proposals uh imp
implicating a quinty and critiquing
contemporary
practice so
i first understood the reach of his work
in the 80s
when a princeton professor of latin
spoke to me about a pattern language and
i was very surprised to
see that someone else in a completely
different field
had such a great admiration for it
and then more recently at
a congress for the new urbanism this one
in austin where he received the athena
medal alexander's keynote speech
brought developers in the audience to
tears
it was quite surprising it was a
wonderful talk developers cry
yes
uh and it was i really didn't understand
it
but they were reacting to his
articulation of their purpose
which included i might add even comments
and advice about writing contracts
but much in the way you've heard
described this evening his ability
to speak to history fact and
the very deep emotions in taking actions
he was calling forth the kinds of
reasons for which
people make themselves developers but in
fact can never
speak about in public apparently so
this span from latin scholar to
developer reflects
of course alexander's own range in his
publications
so i don't want to take a lot of time
you can tell i'm editing as i'm going
through
the notes i made but i might read just a
few
quotes
it has shown that towns and buildings
will not be able to come alive unless
they are made by all the people in
society
and unless these people have a common
pattern language within which to make
these buildings
and unless this common pattern language
is alive
itself these fragments are very
difficult to put out there because of
course you keep reading and there's much
more
in there but i think one of the things
that we might comment on is how
collaborative his work is and so even
though we are honoring him
if i think of the counterpart to those
early publications it was
five architects in which this whole idea
of star architecture was born
and even though he is the individual we
are honoring tonight
and indeed the driver of all that work
and the initiator
he's always been very careful to even
all the photographs showed
lots of people working together on these
things so
um let me stop here okay uh and pass it
on to veto
veto do i need this no it works good
uh well when i was invited to come i was
very pleased because when i thought
about it a little bit i realized
what a long history i'd had with this
gentleman
a vicarious history because i was a
reader like probably most of you
and it started very early in 1964 i was
a
21 year old student and a friend of mine
and i had founded a magazine at mcgill
where i was studying architecture and
i found an old copy and we had an
article by christopher alexander and
bibi doshi who was a indian arc is an
indian architect
and it was about planning villages how
villages should be planned in
india and how they should be laid out
and
there were sketches i i think we
reprinted the article from somewhere and
i have no idea how we got in touch with
him or how we got the article
but he was clearly somebody that for
young architects
students was saying things that we were
interested in hearing and the following
year
we we had to do a thesis in our final
year
and a friend of mine had dug up this
fortran program that alexander had
written
which were you took the lattice or
semi-lattice or whatever it was and you
broke it down into rules and then
you ran stacks of little cards with
holes punched in them through the
computer and it
it forced you to think about what the
project was in
i remember i looked it up this morning
there were 45
statements that i had they were all
interrelated the thing didn't run at all
i later found out and that's i think the
only thing i resent
against christopher alexander was that
it actually never ran anywhere
and we had spent months with these
horrible cards with the holes and
trying to get them to run uh on the
other hand it didn't make us
think it made me think about what really
how can you break a project down into
requirements is what he called them
you know women should face a certain
direction or there should be wind
protection or whatever
the thing was and
like everybody i think of my generation
i bought those books
i think i bought them because i was a
catholic boy and they look like missiles
and i think they're supposed to look
like missiles they have those
they don't have a paper jacket they're
just
and i don't think they had a ribbon but
they should have
and i i went on and did other things and
it all came back to me
when i was building my own house and my
wife and i
built our house we i didn't design it i
built it
and i realized that one point i
i think it was because i had placed a
window somewhere and i realized you
couldn't see anything through that
window and it really should be a little
bit lower and a little bit over here and
then you had a nice view out
and somehow the patterns started falling
into place i never
and i think it's impossible to design a
house using the pattern language it
would be
a horrible sort like doing a crossword
puzzle but
but all the patterns were actually there
they sort of came out naturally and
even the one about sleeping facing a
certain direction
that was the way our bed sort of turned
out and
it was the thing that i think convinced
me totally that experience of the
correctness the sort of fundamental
correctness
of his vision uh and as i as i told bob
i was totally convinced but this was in
the 80s and i very quickly realized that
i couldn't actually talk to people about
it
because by then christopher alexander
had made so many enemies that if you
raised his
name in polite conversation people said
oh no not that person you
have to be serious about that so i had i
had to sort of keep quiet about it and
just have it for myself and as a
final comment i like bob i went back to
the book so the books
will always be there i'm convinced and
the books are what
what what it's about really not for
christopher alexander i think for him
the buildings are important but for me
the books are what it's about
and i was i didn't want to carry that
heavy book so i took
one of the thin books on the train to
read but but i also wanted to mention it
because it's not one of
the famous books it's not as as well
known as pattern language and it's a new
theory of
urban design which is a preposterous
title as alexander himself admits
and it's a wonderful book and it's it's
wonderful i think
like all his good books
you hear the voice of the man when you
read it and it's a kind of sane
voice i love the anarchy
analogy because i think that's true too
but the books are kind of sane
he's looking at things he's definitely a
teacher he's teaching you things
and those books are just a wonderful
kind of connection
that you feel you have with this person
they're not they're not
they are of course theoretical but
they're written in a way which is very
much alive
maybe you shouldn't tell chris that
there ought to be ribbons in the books
and make them work
really just looking i had several
questions
we only have about 15 minutes and we
were told we would not have time to go
to the audience so if you saved up a
question
uh i'm sorry afterwards
come up to us afterwards indeed a couple
of questions
and you it's what vetoed was beginning
to raise and any one of you may want to
answer this
what is the presence of christopher
alexander and his work in american
schools of architecture
and why non-existent
william saunders wrote the review of a
pattern language in
harvard design magazine no the the book
about order
well both actually he wrote nature of
order also but before that he wrote a
review of pattern language a very late
review of pattern language and he said
it may very well be the most read
treatise of architecture
of all time and then the next sentence
was but among
the schools of architecture i know it's
as if it didn't exist
and i spoke earlier about all the other
disciplines and liz mentioned also all
the other disciplines
taking this up and and done really
interesting things with it
and i i think i guess there have always
been a little bit of two cultures within
architecture and uh and chris has sort
of
uh certainly not endeared himself to
the one culture that seems to be holding
the day
and i think that's essentially what's
happened is that he
is is largely ignored within the
architecture community and yet
celebrated within the software and in
other communities
it's very interesting liz you are the
dean of the school of architecture well
yes and uh you would find his books in
our school
but i think it's always an individual
decision about whether students can
dive into it and actually penetrate it
at the age that they are starting to
think about
all of these things and the profession
they're not quite ready to have somebody
telling them
absolutely everything about what they
don't know anything about
sure and so i think it's actually
developed taste but
um i do think that internationally there
is a very broad impact and continuing
influence
through the readings and i dare say that
in every school of architecture you'll
find a few people who are
brave enough and thoughtful enough to
take it on
early um and then i dare say that others
uh in the course of their life
begin to take it on in the course of
their professional life um
as they feel ready i would add two
comments to that one is it's very
interesting i've had students that tried
to take a pattern language and use it as
a
means a book of rules as how to get to a
building and it doesn't work
um and i think uh and if chris would
agree with me he probably wouldn't but i
think
he is a magnificent observer of life and
a drawer of conclusions about life
he is not a system maker it seems to me
and
he would like to be and he would like
that book to teach you how to go step by
step by step by step go from pattern 87
to 42 to 128 and
you'll have a great building at the end
of it oh it doesn't work the other
comment i would make is
american schools of architecture are in
universities and universities have
philosophy departments and the
architecture faculty being begins to get
envious and think they ought to be
intellectual too
and they they they tend to um fall in
love with abstract theories
especially if they are originally
written in french and german
and in fact architecture is not
primarily and i emphasize the word
primarily an intellectual activity
it's a social and physical and spatial
and a lot of other kinds of activity but
not primarily an activity of ideas
uh okay let me try another question
could i just add something because sure
it struck me when i was thinking about
it today that
alexander was one of the first
architects who talked about theory
and he was a pioneer in that sense
because in fact theory has
overcome architecture it's just not his
theory it's it's the german french
latino theory of
obscurationism i think mostly uh so
so it's kind of it's poignant that
this man who brought theory to
architecture uh
you know has lived to see theory in fact
succeed but it's in a very
different way and and it's not his
theory it's really this
this theory is not an abstraction that
is that is distant from the world of
place and space and time that's the
difference i think it's it's
phenomenology
not uh post-structuralism to go to the
philosophy schools here
um he really is about the in the jane
jacobs sense confronting the actual
things
and and he's very wary of building big
systems i mean he tries to but he you
know he always sort of breaks it down
at the end and um you know tries to make
sure that it that
that the system doesn't seize us that we
can use the system and it won't use us
liz did were you going to add some i
want to try one other question again the
i'm asking questions about the aspects
of chris that i know least about and
this is the one i know at least about
he has built 300 buildings he is a
licensed general contractor
uh what about these buildings are they
good are they bad why aren't they better
known
uh why aren't they published more in the
magazines and anyone
be told you want to try that i've always
thought that the the weakest part of
his theory was the absence of culture
culture is very important you know he's
from northern california that's
important
he has a background a european
background that's important and i
i think is you can fit his work into i i
was thinking of carl larsen when i was
looking at many of these slides oh
that's interesting yeah
you could arts and crafts i mean it it's
in a category it isn't
suey generous and i think it needs it
would need to be judged
in that way and i'm not sure people are
that interested in
carl larsen anymore but
i mean he's done his thing and you know
he had a huge influence but
but they have been published um and
they are global i mean they're all over
the place and i think when you look at
them closely you will find that they are
individually of their place you can
you can distinguish the places that
they're in
but i've always thought they were
they were interesting because of the way
they were made which was always
collaboratively
and by hand and that in a sense
whether you could critique them for
formally
and say this proportion is wrong or why
isn't he looking at
the way capitals and bases of columns
are made and
everything all the ways that people
might look at those buildings
um that in fact they're about embodying
the ideas and the numbers um the
observations
that are in his writing and in a sense i
think
the fact that he uses all three tools
words
numbers and images in his work so
integrally with his own being
is one of the things that makes him
unique because
most architects will deal with the
images only
and many of us have trouble speaking and
writing
we can draw um other people have great
strengths in
um describing the ideas verbally or in
in writing and then there are a few who
deal with the numbers and try to set out
the systems
um but he's really doing them all of
that all of the time
and trying to show that it all goes
together and doing his paintings
on which he spends years on a on a
single painting he told me that he
scrapes it off and tries again and
scrapes it off and tries again
um just a quick addition to that
the buildings have always been sort of
the way he has developed
his ideas he's never developed them in
abstraction he's always been
out building stuff and trying to figure
things out so in a way
his buildings are somewhat experimental
for that reason
uh but also very sort of specific to
the group of people that he's
collaborating with and not the kind of
thing that you know somebody publishing
glossy magazines
would necessarily find and very
interesting perhaps
uh unless they're connected to the yeah
you definitely get the feeling that
they're not about
this is a christopher alexander building
and therefore you have to get every last
detail
absolutely correct
what a fair criticism of his buildings
which i haven't seen only pictures of
that they are sometimes too literally
illustrations of his pattern ideas
i wouldn't say so no i don't okay
but i but i did find you know having
look seen that that show one right after
the other
um how many times it it reminded me of
leo creer
the work of leo creer which is um who's
also a writer
and a drawer a painter and
has built and there's something about
those forms
that i started thinking about the inner
relationship between those
two practices too much concrete though
leo doesn't like concrete not so much
concrete
um two other topics came up just showing
how diverse this person is
whether i was going to say he's writing
a book about a school that he designed
in japan that was built
and i was the publisher sent me the
first couple of chapters to be a kind of
early reader and all
and that seemed very interesting to me
so i thought i would ask you before we
leave the build work
if i had all the money and time in the
world what should i go see
certainly the the japan school the asian
school
um any other thoughts
no particular favorites okay um
california there's a number of projects
uh
they you saw in the show the uh um
the the garden um the the farmers market
in fresno and the homeless shelter in
san jose
and and of course in in now in portland
there's a new project coming out of the
ground with
some really interesting ideas about
patterns it's a town center on the light
rail line
in a suburb of portland uh with
with using pattern languages in a kind
of different
way um very interesting so that'll take
a while to go you ought to organize a
tour i think
and so that we can all catch up um i
don't i'm i'm not of the generation that
knows how to turn on a computer
and i'm fascinated by what you just
began to touch on the influence of chris
alexander
on the world of digital uh computers and
all the rest of it
could you say a little bit more about
that and draw that connection a little
tighter
well as i mentioned we were with ward
cunningham who's probably one of the key
people who
saw the value of this in the world of
architecture and saw how it was useful
in the world of
computers which seems completely
counterintuitive
how could that be and yet uh the logic
of it was exactly the same they had the
same kinds of problems of
you know not so much space to arrange
but
but um collaborative problems to solve
and and something about the logic of
that made complete sense to
to ward and to kent beck his colleague
and uh they developed a whole new
uh approach to software design called
design patterns
which is hugely influential and what is
it though
can you say it is essentially a
structure of pattern languages it's
if you go back to notes on the synthesis
of form uh
the kind of logic of problem solving and
the way configurations
uh what's interesting is that
problems keep recurring but not just as
individual problems as sort of
clusters of problems you keep having the
same sort of set of
of clusters of problems and you can
start to identify those as as almost
like sub routines if you know anything
about computing or
ways that you can solve the same problem
over over and over as it keeps recurring
over and over
but each time it's got to be a little
bit varied and that's what the
software people have to do just as our
just as
architects can take a typology and and
use that over and over again but in each
case it can be very different
the term user friendly comes to mind at
the same time that you're solving
problems that you're imagining how
someone else will be dealing with the
construct
yeah yeah i'd love to know more about it
i'd love to see a demonstration
sometimes
somebody using a computer language that
is derived in some way from the pattern
language
yeah well i mean again it's the way um
these systems work similar to our brains
i mean you touched on that earlier that
this is the way we think and this is the
way we solve problems and that's why our
brains
work that way and that's why
i think actually an earlier generation
of software
people who were doing object-oriented
software we're inspired by chris's early
work on
notes on the synthesis of form because
it really is
sort of the essence of problem solving
in the simplest
simplest way oh just one last topic
again it came up and we touched on it
just showing how broad this person is
there seem to be a limitless number of
topics you can bring up sustainability
climate change yeah issues of that kind
someone want to comment on chris's
early influence if there was such on
that
well you know i think um in summary
actually not so much just the early
stuff was always about
being organic responding to daylight
local materials local traditions things
of that um following the culture and so
on but if you think about it
his idea that you make places that
people appreciate that people love
might be the formula for the ultimate
sustainability
um in which you make places that
people in participating in making and in
their beauty
will want to save and never take apart
so that that embodied energy of the
first building act
remains for a long time that's very true
there's this notion that that you know
you save
uh buildings um
again i touched on this topic of of uh
technology
the notion that we we're gonna create
new technologies uh whether it's uh you
know solar
power or whatever that's not necessarily
gonna solve the challenge unless we deal
with these
kinds of you know deeper connections
between i mentioned sustainability and
beauty sustainability and lovability
even as early as the pattern language he
talks about issues of density of
population and things like that that are
being talked about all the time
now and he talks about them as as as
creating the need for social cohesion in
a genuine community sense
but they are also of course issues of uh
sustainability and use of resources
we're at i believe i can't believe it
already at eight o'clock
um let's have a round of sort of
whatever i've left out in the way of
questions any comments you'd like to
make
um while they're thinking i just want to
add um
i do hope that chris will come and speak
again
because um i i just touched on it
earlier that he actually in the last
couple of days has been sort of
feverishly
coming up with yet another idea this
notion that randy talked about of
configurations
uh and archetypes which i i'm very
intrigued and i hope you are too and i
hope he'll come
back to the national building museum
when he's feeling better and
i hope so tell us more about that i hope
so i didn't mean to just throw the
medal at you that way i did have i don't
know if matt glazer is here because he
told me he wasn't going to be here
there he is i'm sorry who uh not glazer
was
jane jacobs editor on death and life in
american cities and i was
doing some research on jane jacobs and
this is to your comment about
anarchy and one of
alexander's colleagues at the university
at berkeley had
i guess accused is the right word jane
jacobs of being
an early neoconservative and i asked nat
about that and he said
he thought neoconservative wasn't the
right word but he said anarchist would
be a better word and i think
i think bob's absolutely right there's a
sense in which both of them
see the world as very very messy
and they see the charm in that and
they're on the one hand
looking for order but also
at the same time very worried that too
much order will lose what
the thing that you actually value and i
think
that is a theme that runs through both
of their works
and it's i think those beautiful
hand-painted decorations that he swaps
on
do that they really make the building
unprecious and
really quite wonderful and but i think
that i think i like your comment about
that because i think that does bring
them together
and it's important to remember that
particularly with jane jacobs because
there's a tendency to see her as another
kind of planner and i don't think she
was another kind of planner she didn't
like planning
she believed in the market she believed
in individuals
she shortly before her death she got
together with ken greenberg the planner
in toronto
and they persuaded the city to establish
a neighborhood that would not have any
use zoning
all uses would be permitted so this is
not the kind of planning that uh is
uh you know there were there were um
dimensional
zoning you know certain heights certain
setbacks whatever but no use zoning
i don't know how that's worked out i
would love to see it well that's uh
andres has proposed that for new orleans
um opt-out zones for um
for rebuilding uh so yeah self
self-building uh in a way that allows
people because this is what was so great
about new orleans there was so much
self-building there well and since we're
speaking about
um coding and codes it might be pointed
out that
um going back to a pattern language
points out how much the new urbanist
work
on design codes including form-based
codes which is a recent word but the
content of those codes
owes a great debt to to christopher
alexander and
you know maybe we could end uh since he
is seeing this film
with um on a note of gratefulness
and thanks for his contribution to
all the work that so many of us are
engaged in
both here present tonight and really all
over the country and indeed all over the
world and the work continues
yes i think we all are terribly terribly
grateful for
the experiences that he's provided
thanks very much
you
