Ask Prof Wolff: Reform vs. Revolution
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXH1XgzEZ8E)

## Transcript:
This is Richard Wolff from Democracy 
at Work responding to another  
Ask Prof Wolff question from our Patreon 
community and this one comes from Jared  
Rogers. Jared asks a very very important question, 
he’s heard, he says, from some of his Socialist  
friends that Social Democracy movements of various 
kinds that push for higher minimum wages, that  
push for taxes on corporations to carry out useful 
social services, the usual collection of policies  
promoted by Social Democracy— that those can 
have the unintended and unfortunate result  
that corporations confronting higher wages they 
might have to pay, higher taxes they might have  
to pay will run away from the countries say in the 
global north where Social Democracy is powerful  
and re-establish production in the global south 
where they can get away without paying comparable  
minimum wages or without paying comparable 
taxes. And he asked does that therefore  
make Social Democracy subject to the criticism of 
the Socialists he heard making those criticisms?  
I think the answer is yes and no and I understand 
that may be frustrating so let me explain.  
Anything that is done anywhere to try to offset 
the harshness of Capitalism, the endless drive  
of Capitalism to pull more profits out of 
production, the endless tendency of Capitalism,  
to create greater inequality of the sort that 
Thomas Piketty’s work has so clearly proven and  
demonstrated over and over again, whatever 
Social Democracy tries to do to create a  
Capitalism with a more human face a Democratically 
Socialist version, if you like, may in fact do  
exactly what Jared Rogers question points to it 
may well lead, it often has, for corporations  
to leave the countries, the areas where Social 
Democracy is strong and move instead to where  
it is weak or absent. That's in the nature of 
profit maximization. That’s what Capitalists do,  
there's no question of that and it means that 
much of the intention of Social Democratic reforms  
is either undone or is accompanied by enhanced 
exploitation in the global south, but is that a  
reason not to pursue those kinds of reforms? 
I don't think so. Let's be a little logical  
here. That argument would then apply to virtually 
anything short of system transformation. I  
happen to think that the only solution here 
will, in the end, be system transformation  
otherwise you will continue to have precisely 
what Jared Rogers question points to, Capitalists  
evading, weakening, undoing Social 
Democratic reforms one way or another.  
And often at the expense of other parts 
of the world that they escape to at least  
for a while. But the question is, how do you build 
a movement strong enough to make the system change  
that these Socialist critics are pointing to? And 
here the irony is, and hence my yes and no answer,  
you need to fight for reforms because fighting 
for those reforms and then explaining to the  
people fighting for the reform how Capitalism gets 
around it, how Capitalism escapes and evades it  
and how Capitalism's harshness simply 
moves to yet another group of workers.  
Who, if they react in the same way, can 
make the movement go the opposite direction  
bringing back to the first group what they tried 
so hard to overcome. In short, it's the struggle  
for reform that can teach the lesson of the 
need for more than reform, for a literally  
global transformation in the sense of going 
from one global economic system, Capitalism,  
to one that doesn't work this way. But it won't do 
much good to talk about it if you are not busily  
fighting for the improvements that will enable 
people to get it to, understand it, to become  
advocates for it. Otherwise, you will have what 
we have had for a long time, the division between  
those fighting for reforms but being looked to 
scant by those who see the need for system change  
and likewise those who preach system 
change being alienated and disunified  
in terms of all those people fighting hard, 
for a better wage, a better school program,  
a better health system and all the other 
reforms that Social Democracy typifies. Let’s  
not get caught in that stale old reform versus 
revolution mentality. Let’s understand that reform  
can be doesn't have to be, but it can be the road 
to revolution and that depends on those who see  
where that road leads being very active in and 
among all of those fighting for reforms don’t get  
caught in the either or. It is a political dead 
end. This is Richard Wolff for Democracy at Work.
