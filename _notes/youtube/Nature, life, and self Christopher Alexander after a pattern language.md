Nature, life, and self: Christopher Alexander after a pattern language
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmlo0Lva5AU)

## Transcript:
After I finished the pattern language I was ...  
I wasn't quite satisfied, really. I felt 
that the geometric substance of things  
hadn't been deeply enough exposed. And I knew 
from my early building works using the pattern  
language, both myself, and also watching other 
people do it, that this geometric substance ...  
was crucial, and it was clear to me that it 
was very very far from understood, in general.
So I started trying to come to terms with it ... 
I noticed gradually over a period of years that in  
order to make things have some kind of life, I had 
to do particular sorts of things geometrically.
And I was really just puzzled by that. I mean 
this is years ago. I just noticed it. Gradually,  
I mean this must be, I'm talking 20 years ago now, 
it must have been in the 70s, I began to be aware  
that the living thing, whether it be a building, 
or a part of a building, window sill, gate,  
neighborhood, painting, carpet, Turkish 
tile, whatever, that any one of these things,  
when it had its life, I began to realize that 
it had a very particular and profound geometry,  
and this was quite different from the 
... what I view as the sort of rather  
silly season geometry, that is beloved 
by geometers. One's always seeing these  
books on architecture and art which have got 
various kinds of grids in which you've got  
the golden section ad infinitum in which 
you've got all this sort of stuff ...
This thing that I was seeing was much more 
rooted, and under the surface, and above all real.
I mean with those grids the impression you always 
have is it's somebody just laying this stuff on  
top of something, it doesn't really mean anything, 
it's certainly not true enough to be able to  
let you generate any wonderful kind of 
work, so it's a waste of time really.
But the stuff that I was
beginning to see ...
There were quite a small number of 
these properties and they're actually  
the geometrical properties.
And they'd been hinted at in the pattern language.
They were sort of buried in 
many of the patterns, I think.
Simple things about the kinds 
of regularities which occur,
the kinds of levels of scale which occur,
the positiveness of all space,
and so forth.
And ...
I found that it was quite difficult to 
do these things. That in general people  
weren't particularly aware of doing them, 
or of needing to do them, and that they  
really were the sort of origin and core of the 
life that occurred in an object or in a thing.
In the course of trying to unravel this,
I mean again I'm still back in the 70s now, 
when I started working on these matters ...
late 70s ...
I realized that ...
in order to see this stuff ...
I was able to see it because I did accept the 
idea that some things have more life than others.
And I could see that, distinguish it, 
make the distinction, and then say well  
and this one which has more life has 
such and such geometric structure.
But when I began trying to communicate 
this to others I noticed that there was  
extraordinary reluctance at first to admit 
that there was such a phenomenon, even.
I mean ...
People were obsessed then, as still today they 
are, with the idea that artistic taste was all  
a matter of opinion, that they were entitled to 
think and feel what they thought and felt. And ...
The idea that there might 
actually be something which ...
That this thing really is more 
living than this thing and so forth.
... was quite shocking and ...
I gave one very lengthy series of seminars, as I 
often did with work that was sort of in progress.
And I began trying to encourage people to 
do this sort of thing, and in order to ...
I knew that everybody could see this.
In other words it wasn't as if it was some  
extraordinary thing that I could 
see, but other people could not see.
I knew that everybody could see it.
But that the conventional terms were so messed up
that people in effect were kidding 
themselves that they couldn't see it.
And we're kidding themselves that this 
business, this opinion thing, you know:
"I want to make my thing like Le Corbusier"
"I want to make my thing like Jackson Pollock" or
"I want to do this." or
"I want to do that."
... was really going on.
And so whatever people actually felt was 
hidden from view, even to themselves.
So I began
asking people rather peculiar 
kinds of questions ...
one of these questions, for 
instance, which became ...
quite central in my thought later,
was that when I was asking 
people to make these distinctions
and they were having trouble
I would say, well, don't 
tell me which one you like,
and don't tell me which one you think is better,
because those questions are 
all plagued with problems.
Tell me which one of them 
you would you would choose
as a Picture of your own True Self
if you had to do that.
And of course people jump up and say ...
"Well that's nonsense!"
"I don't know what it means!"
"I don't want to do it!"
"I can't do it!"
... you know so ..
And I would sort of gently say,
"well yes, yes that's all right, um just humor 
me, it's nonsense, but just do it anyway."
And when people were kind of relaxed enough, and  
given permission to just answer this 
apparently nonsensical question,
then indeed they would
see the real life in the thing.
I mean by that, I mean they would 
always pick the one that had more life.
They would tend to agree with one 
another, to rather extraordinary degrees.
Which was of course never true if you're just 
merely asking people their opinions about things.
And furthermore, by asking a particular 
person this kind of question,
which was a question entirely to do with them,
but then they would pick the object 
or building or gateway or whatever --
you know it could be one brushstroke 
that you could be looking at
-- which I did, in my belief that 
it had more life than the other.
So I was very powerfully able to 
vindicate my impressions by this empirical  
procedure, which relied only on what 
the other person was actually feeling.
Provided I could get that person to concentrate 
on "what is it that is a picture of my true self?"
Rather than on all this welter of opinions, and 
images, and art historical, art critical ...
flim-flam.
So that was very powerful.
In those early years
I began being able to teach 
people to do this kind of thing.  
I gave a lot of workshops on all sorts of things:
on painting,
on furniture-making,
on, of course, building design,
and so forth,
on very simple things like 
just make a small ornament.
And ... I found myself able to teach people 
to do this kind of thing effectively.
And in addition I also found that people were 
nourished by this to an incredible degree.
I remember one woman kept a journal, 
and she described how in the course of  
gradually coming to terms 
with this kind of material,
and then doing things that were of that character
rather than of some other character
how she experienced a sort of tremendous healing.
Almost as if her own daily 
wholeness of her existence
flourished in parallel with the fact that
she was conducting this kind 
of inner artistic process
and designing buildings, making 
objects, and so on, so forth,
in this way that I'm talking about.
Anyway so that was all really in the late 70s,  
I think I've slipped off into the early 
80s by now. It's still 15 years ago.
And I began writing this manuscript,
which now has the title:
"The Nature of Order"
... it had many many different 
titles along the way.
I must have written the book 
an enormous number of times.
It's had many versions, probably about 
one a year for these last 20 years.
At one time it was called "Geometry".
At one time it was called
"The One"
... which is a little bit extreme.
