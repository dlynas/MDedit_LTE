## Transcript:
welcome everyone to system thinking
Ontario for May
um and uh we're here to talk about
sustainable development goals origin
context and perspectives uh we're all
welcoming Ned Raba who is with the um
sdg with the joint sdg fund for today
um what we're going to do is uh first
I'm going to have people type in to the
chat
um the question of the day will be uh so
you know if if you haven't been on these
calls before uh we kind of introduce who
we are uh just briefly and um the
question of the day will be how much do
you know about the sdgs that'll give us
a bit of a feel uh for for the audience
we have
um the the session itself
uh it's kind of a response to uh the
March call we had
um and what happened was that Ned was
actually sending me messages in the
background
um and uh and saying uh in effect
um well he's even immersed in this and
so I said okay let's let's go down to
some Basics here some basic questions
about the sdgs uh we'll have a
conversation about it the way we're
going to approach this is uh we're gonna
have three questions
and
um and so Ned is going to talk for a
little bit and then we'll pause and
we'll have people
um ask questions I'll be moderating
um and we'll have a little conversation
about that and then move on to the
second question have a discussion and
then the third question after the third
question then it's kind of open field
and I'll be moderating people so if we
could use a chat um and uh firstly If
people could uh just type in I'll pause
for a minute if people could type in
um uh who you are and um how much you
know about the sdgs and after that uh
we'll get going
okay we've got some responses coming in
so
um I'm pleased to introduce Ned rava
besides being a PhD in uh in
um political science he also has a
master design degree from the Strategic
foresight Innovation program at ocad U
and so he's not a stranger to many
people
um in this group and I'll just hand it
over to you Ned go ahead
thank you very much
okay
I think thank you very much David for
for you know giving me this opportunity
and organizing this session indeed I I
felt but not only in this this context
but I also felt in many different other
uh cases that there's there's a little
understanding of the of the basics of
the icts I'm not saying that you know
people
I should should really you know it's
thick as I'll do all types of
positions for this I'm the catcher
and the Pitcher I play all roles
uh let's see okay sorry no problem so
um I'm not saying that the people need
to to be kind of proficient in India as
it is but there's a lot of confusion I
think there's a lot of misunderstanding
there's a lot of misinterpretation and
and also
um
just kind of wrong uh perspective on
what the sdgs represent uh so I thought
that maybe it would be good to to you
know lay down some basics
and and then have an open discussion uh
which goes beyond so those people who
are not really um have not had the
experience with the sdgs would hopefully
be able to contribute uh because you'll
be discussing the uh the you know what
do sdgs have in the uh systems approach
what does it mean for Canadians and so
on so forth and um it's great to have
Peter here um Peter and I have been
working with also with Ryan
um on on some of the analysis and
actually Peter I'm going to show some of
some of the uh there's the slide um I'm
not gonna show the results we can you
know share it separately but you know at
least indicating that the kind of stuff
that you contributed with Okay so let's
start I think David did like 10 10ish
minutes uh first part second part third
part and then in between we had the
discussion but let's see let's play play
it by you
so um
okay so the first part would be just
some background and I'm not going to go
into a lot of details but I'm going to
emphasize things that I I found
um uh misleading for most people and
also giving some context uh for better
understanding of the sdg so
before the sdgs there has been some
attempts to
uh deal with the issue of having global
goals and when when I say Goals that I
you know it's it's very broad definition
of what the goal is
um but some sort of idea of what could
be uh identified and then reported on
meaning it's measurable
uh for at the global level so before the
sdgs there were mdgs but I also want to
mention that one of the the the Pioneers
in in this uh was UNICEF in the 90s
and that was I mean UNICEF is uh known
for its marketing and and also some some
good work but um UNICEF uh the the head
of Unicef at some point came in and said
well you know we are doing all this kind
of stuff but we cannot properly report
on it because we don't have proper kpis
so it's very much you know
um taylorism in action
um and and also the way that UNICEF
started
um really
um I shouldn't say simplifying but it is
simplifying things to to the point of
you know can a child of six years old
understand what UNICEF is doing this
kind of stuff but you know it brought
UNICEF to the position today that it's
probably one of the most
um financially sustainable uh un
agencies and and really kind of you know
uh being known uh all over the world so
marketing plus you know being able to
have measurable goals so so that was
that was a push and then everyone's
talking about well you know we need to
have some Global agenda because most of
the discussion Cinema development and of
course we can discuss the whole concept
of sustainable development whether it's
really sustainable development or
sustainable growth or does it have
anything to do with sustainability but
this whole idea was was quite up in the
air so at some point in 2000 uh the the
dun uh agreed on the mdgs Millennium
developing goals and you see the boxes
that graphically then you know were
adopted by the sdgs as well there was an
ICD report but but the whole point of
this is that for the very first time
there were some Global goals however
they were not Universal so they were
referring only to the so-called
developing countries or the cell Global
south or whatever you want to call them
so for instance Canada was not part of
the empty cheese
um and uh it it put together
environmental aspect with kind of social
human development because previously
sustainable development from the 80s was
more so seen through the lenses of
environmental aspects
um so this was the first time to say oh
when you talk about the same development
it's not only environment it's also
Human Social but the economic part was
was missing
um and the progress on the mdges was
quite slow but there was something
interesting that happened the last years
which then became known as acceleration
and that that's a concept that we can
also discuss I know that there's a lot
of pushback and and I tend to agree with
that but there's also some value in the
fact that some countries really made
huge progress in a very short period of
time so all of that then led to a couple
of other initiatives before the sdgs
um that there was something um at the
U.N that was called delivering as one
countries that that was the idea to
break down the silos to hear more
systemic approach to integrated policy
and there was a fund that was I was
managing this fund before the joint
density fund it was called delivering
results together front and there was
idea of catalytic funding so not really
providing only grants and you know
paying for services and goods but you
know can can you find a way to invest
Millions
to mobilize billions and then trillions
I always felt that that was a very
ironic logic because the the
calculations were made
um take into consideration that everyone
should become Sweden or Norway so how
much would that cost times whatever
150 200 countries exist in the world uh
which I don't think it's it's a it's a
it's a it's a proper logic and not least
because the this whole European welfare
system is also showing signs of some
erosion and some some cracking and of
course there was the idea that the
private sector should be coming in more
uh kind of substantively paying for some
of this development goals so beyond dhg
and then of course beyond the CSR which
was mostly about branding and then there
was the idea of bringing in the economic
parts now you have at the at the left
left hand side of this we have three
ways and then I think we you know this
has been discussed so many times in this
uh community and and in other uh fora
but um ideally social environmental
economic would be the three circles that
kind of you know uh are one within the
other I mean this pill is yeah quite
quite meaningless but unfortunately most
of the people who are involved in this
they see it as the this kind of Venn
diagram which is very wrong as We Know
uh so but there was the idea to put
social economic and environmental
together and actually this this was um
not so much about the three pillars it
was about the five PS
which is people meaning social Muslim uh
planning meaning environmental
prosperity and nice words to say
economic growth uh peace and Justice uh
and then Partnerships so this is the
five piece that you know used to be
mentioned a lot now less so but they
were at at the foundation of the sdgs
and then they were really massive uh
consultations around post 2015 agenda
this is how it was called to push for a
multilateralism and and help
participation I don't know the numbers I
forgot those but I think there's you
know a couple of millions of people that
participated either in person in
different local country level Regional
level consultations or through surveys
but it was really massive I'm not saying
this was a proper dialogue it was not it
was mostly just in a kind of harvesting
a data and insight but it was something
that I made a lot of traction
um in in 2014-15
now before I get to the goals just very
briefly um so there are seven people
goals so-called so it's around poverty
hunger health and well-being education
gender clean water and sanitation and
affordable and clean energy and by the
way as we know
um these kind of things are not only
relevant for developing countries
they're called developing countries we
have plenty of issues around these in in
Canada
um even I think around clean water and
sanitation and then there are five
Prosperity goals which is economicals or
Economic Development economic growth but
there's also you know bits and pieces of
things like responsible consumption and
production which I don't I you know this
is there's so-called orphan as it is
which are the as it is that one really
mentions and works on and number 12 is
one of the orphans so no one really
talks a lot about consumption responsive
consumption production even 11 which is
sustainable cities and communities is
not is not in the focus but reducing the
quality uh and of course decent jobs
decent jobs not only jobs are really
kind of in the focus and then you have
three Planet goals around climate action
like below water in Life or land uh one
uh peace and justice
um which is mostly around institutions
rule of law
governance and then we have one
partnership and partnership is really
you know Partnerships but also
everything else that didn't fit anywhere
else so for instance mobilizing funding
and financing is is a Target under the
Partnerships
um I I forgot to say I'll probably I
wanted to say that later on these goals
uh some of those are really not goals
um
that they're supposed to be means of
implementation I mean 17 Partnerships is
definitely a Minster implementation uh
but some of those are really uh
misleading uh I think I have it on
another slide but just to mention it
here so it's nice to have these boxes
and and they actually miss represent the
SGS because they are not supposed to be
boxed
um but um I think it was a lot of
marketing around how to develop these
icons but also how to have something
that is recognizable
and easy to remember so for instance no
poverty has nothing to do with no
poverty
uh so you always need to look into the
targets so no poverty uh there are
targets one which says no extreme
poverty
and another Target is to
um reduce to half poverty
but even then you need to ask yourself
what is power tick how was the division
of power thing you need to go to the
indicators and most of that
unfortunately is the World Bank approach
which is monetary
so poverty is defined as the number of
dollars per day per person per household
whatever
so you know it's fancy to say you know
we are going to achieve no poverty but
at best it's going to be no extreme
poverty
um and and only monetary terms in any
case so um
uh the sdgs were adopted they were part
of the the global document called 2030
agenda for Cinema development which is
about as it is primarily but there's
also something very interesting which I
actually particularly like most is the
living one behind which is or lnop
agenda which is really focusing on those
who are the most vulnerable and most of
my work is actually uh focused on that
um and I find it very interesting
because
um focusing on the most vulnerable uh
actually facilitates
quite a bit of system thinking because
you're not going from the EV you know
for the average you're not going for the
aggregate numbers you're trying really
to to look into what's behind
um all these kind of reports but I'll
come back to it a little bit later
um one thing that
again now getting to the to to the kind
of proper understanding the context
these boxes these 17 boxes
are part of a document which is
political in nature
so this was the result of negotiations
amongst politicians and statisticians
and bureaucrats it was not like you know
strategic thinkers policy makers sitting
together having a proper dialogue or
whatever they would just negotiate as it
happens at the U.N as it happens with
multilateral uh processes
uh and what of course ends up being the
the product is the the minimum common
denominator
so something that everyone or most of
the people could agree on
both in terms of substance
and the formulation
so when people criticize yes it is they
are not really you know what it should
be
they reflect what Global politicians
leaders statisticians bureaucrats
uh managed to agree upon in 2015. that
that was their understanding of the
world which which we would probably
agree that most of that is quite
misleading and wrong and not really what
it should be but it is what it is I mean
it cannot it couldn't get further than
that even that was very ambitious and
then the boxes they combine the latest
thinking in 2015 so it's you know seven
years ago
uh around in these boxes and then put
together so whatever was the mainstream
thinking about education it was put in
into education whatever was thinking
about you know hunger and and Food
Systems and stuff was put into that box
so it was kind of a compilation of
compilations all based on the mainstream
established thank you so there was
nothing really radical about any of that
but still it became Universal
so um all countries are committed to
implementing it even Canada we'll come
back to that later on and there was some
sense of global coherence so there was a
global City framework saying this is
what everyone in the world will be
focusing on for the next 15 years
and there was a narrative around them
for the very first time
um I mentioned the calls some goals are
not through the goals
um and the idea was to have it not
radical fundamental transformative as
such but to create a sense of urgency so
many of these goals
were never meant to be achieved by 2015
but they were formulated to push the
world or you know at least those
involved in the International
Development and National development
to create something inspirational to say
you know by 2015
you know will will exterminate the
extreme poverty so no one is going to be
in extreme power till on first of
January 2016.
but again it has never been
uh something considered feasible so no
one said that all 169 targets will be
accomplished by 1030 by everyone in the
world
so it was it was a you know again very
political and we can discuss that uh um
further on of course
so
this was the basic kind of you know
background
um I didn't want to go too far because I
wanted to leave this for this for the
discussion a bit more
um I didn't get into what's the same
development meal means and you know is
this even you know appropriate concept
uh and do we even need to have the goals
um but this is now for the discussion so
passing back to you David thanks
thanks
um so if people want to ask questions
um please enter them in the chat
um so let let me actually start with a
question of global
this is a big challenge you have
countries that are economically well-off
countries that are less developed and
um yes it's all political
um is this more than politicians just
um trying to make a score
is that the question for me yeah yeah
that's a place to start yeah when
well I think I think it was as I said it
was aspirational it was something daring
at the time I think there was a lot of
excitement
because even in Canada there's still
extreme poverty right so a politician
committing just to focus on this one
particular Target politician committing
to and extreme poverty even if it's in
monetary even if it's like the narrowest
or the Narrows or whatever's meaning of
poverty I think it was quite daring at
the time by politicians to commit to
those so if I would appreciate even that
kind of commitment there's less
commitment today we will get that in the
third section
um but and this is very unfortunate but
I think this is uh you know so if you
compare 2015 where there was excitement
we're gonna do that
even again very narrowly very kind of
you know not in the kind of system
thinking that we would prefer
um today is much worse
so you know it it would be good to go
back to 2015 uh comparing to what's
happening today
thanks uh I'm going to invite people to
actually uh speak their own questions so
Mary um you'd ask a question would you
like to unmute and um and uh ask your
question
all right why were the goals achieved to
be
um so why were the goals set to be
achieved by the year 2030.
I I think it was just because MTG
started in 2001 and they were in 2015.
so of course then you go 2015 2013. so
there was no particular logic or kind of
visibility test that these goals can be
achieved in 15 years it was just a kind
of it's a time frame that it's not too
long and it's not too short so I think
it was again just political uh reasoning
around that
uh but but there is a um sorry there is
a there is a risk with his goals and
this was also this also happened with
the mdges because if you make them
aspirational
then at some point in time you're going
to get disappointed right so you get
excited and then when you as you reach
the the the timeline you know the end of
the the road then you start getting
frustrated and disappointed this is
what's happening now halfway through
there's not one single country that is
on path to achieving these goals it not
even close
and things are getting worse so setting
the the time frame which is like you
know Sweet Spot 15 years not five not
50.
um can also be problematic if you're too
aspirational because at some point in
time you're gonna conclude you failed
even if you did some progress
Elena has a question Elena
hi um what I was asking about was
the fact that some of these goals would
seem to increase population rather than
reduce population growth which is
exploding
in educating women seems to be the only
goal
that would seem to be geared towards
reducing a population explosion is that
implied in the other goals
then thank you Elena
the problem with this as I mentioned is
is it's a compilation
our goals and targets and indicators
so on the surface of it there's some
coherence
but even that you know superficial
coherence is again compilation of
different agendas so there's no one
definitive answer to your question or
any other question
which is why in the second section of
this discussion we'll get into the
systemic approach or like on it on how
different goals and targets relate to
each other because they are trade-offs
and synergies so I would say that
there's probably plenty of stuff in the
sdgs that go one way and plenty of stuff
and yes it just go the other way in
terms of the population growth
and by the way these are Global targets
I probably didn't mention this so
um the idea was to have something Global
and then to bring it to the National
level so-called to nationalize it which
is an awful term but better than
downloading which is another term so
every country was supposed to take these
Global targets uh goals and targets and
then identify we transfer the priority
for the country and then modify them
because of course these goals are not
the same for Canada as it's for Rwanda
or from the Philippines and this was
done sometimes but in Canada it was not
done and that would make things clearer
as you bring them from a very generic
level down to the National and then to
do the same at the local level for
instance in Canada to the provincial
level and even local level cities and
municipalities so things should have
been
clearer as you get down and then you see
how these things relate to each other
more and more in Practical terms
okay Kelly
what like oh you have a question would
you like to ask your question I did
you typed in a question actually go
through to push yes would you like to
ask your question
I think I was just putting down a
thought for myself
um it wasn't really thought out but but
just uh
just seeing them in silos uh
that and talking in a systems uh systems
thinking forum
related back to sustainability I I
certainly my experience
if we take a look at consumer products
and Manufacturing in Canada over my
professional uh time uh certainly we
were able to solve some of our
environmental problems by offshoring the
goods and taking down industry I was a
bit disappointed to take a look at
industry in terms of the narrowness of
the framing
um maybe Kelly we can go back to this in
the next section because I'm gonna
provide a bit critical approach to
systems thinking system practice and the
sdgs
um
but that's good that you asked because
that's that's the essence of the whole
thing I think you asked about the data
reference 2030 2050 or 2060. I left in
2030 so it was the 15 years from 2016
including 2016 to 2030 so first of
January 2031
uh should be a new world everything
transformed and changed and you know we
are all going you know around happy and
and and you know we know poverty and all
the rest of it but yeah 15 years from
until 2013.
okay Peter
yeah um hi now uh Mike the the answer to
this question might actually be the
Secretary General but who would be the
most authoritative spokesperson to
clarify
uh the you know the stgs and the 2030
agenda and the to to speak for it
authoritatively overall and are there
any other U.N designated ngos that are
working with countries or coordinating
the program or is it in but if or is
officially really within the U.N
it's very much within the UN
um so I don't think there is one uh
authoritative spokesperson
I mean of course the secretary would be
the the you know the mouthpiece of it I
mean he would say stuff
um but it's actually
um all the sdgs were divided among the
U.N agencies there are 40 plus you and
agencies funds and programs too and I
think this as we call them and they're
custodian
custodian agencies so for different sdgs
you would have one agency which is
supposed to uh report on this which is
supposed to provide support to
understanding uh of this so for instance
you know on education to the UNESCO for
instance
um but the issue with interpretation is
that there's no one single
interpretation and there was I'll come
back to this in terms of the kind of
more the genetic uh universalistic
approach versus contextual localized
approach uh to the sdgs uh so I think
you know we can get back to this issue
of how you interpret and who speaks for
the sdgs and then the ngos there of
course ngos involved but it's within the
UN agency so you and agency have the
mandates for the custodianship
um to report to support to you know
coordinate processes and involvement of
others and stuff like that
okay Mary has a question maybe a
two-part question and then we'll move on
to the second part Mary
why did the UN think that it was the
best vehicle um to house these goals
um when within the um body there are
sorry countries and actors that don't
adhere to these goals um these goals
seem like they are not of the country's
interests
um to adhere to them
so why did the UN feel like it should be
where these goals
um are are living
are are steered
and my other question is
um when have citizens and countries been
allowed to vote on these sdgs
thank you Maddie so um there's no Global
democracy and and probably there will
not be anytime soon what about there
were so un is the only Global
um structure institution body
that brings together every single
country in the world
um around
wide scope of issues
um so I I I don't understand you know I
like what would be the alternative
there's no alternative to the U.N you
can you can go to different other bodies
but they're much narrow much more
automatic
so
um there's no other body except the UN
um but at the same time
U.N rarely if ever
makes decisions or agrees on documents
that are
um obligatory in terms of the
implementation so all the countries that
support it and everyone supported these
as it is they did not sign in blood that
they are going to implement those so
they just said you know we are committed
like the party's agreement or whatever
they just committed politically that
they would they would Implement those
um so it was not that un was imposing
something I mean there's no U.N without
the member states I mean if you if you
don't have countries and there's no you
and even it's just a platform just a
foreign
but then it was upon these countries
to engage with their own citizens
um align with their own existing
government programs and policies and
funding and everything else to
um as I said nationalize or localize the
sdgs and that was not done much at least
not in the global North or so-called
developed countries it was done a lot
in developing countries you know in many
countries there were you know hundreds
of ngos Grassroots thousands of people
millions of people whatever being
involved in designing National sdg
strategies or plans uh but it was less
prominent in in the in the countries
that are like supposed to be more
democratic
um but again these are not obligatory no
I'm gonna say you know why did you know
no one's going to punish anyone for not
implementing those
it's just a global strategic framework
that provided an opportunity for
everyone to come together and talk in
the same way
if that makes sense Maddie
okay let's move on to the second part
okay so there was another okay Maddie
okay
um
okay so now introducing a bit a link to
the systems change
and this is my own perspective so um
it's not official I mean I have the logo
behind me of the funded when I work
um but it's still my personal
interpretation so so don't don't quote
me even if this is recorded okay so
plenty of stuff and I don't have the
answers to you know I'm gonna post some
of the questions
so I spent I think a couple hours with a
colleague
um a couple of years ago
um
and we were joking about this notion of
indivisible
so when you read the 2030 agenda it says
that sdgs are indivisible and then it
says you have to blend them integrate
them coordinate them they're
interdependent so how can you have
something and I think this is a broader
philosophical discussion I suppose uh
how can you have something indivisible
meaning that there are no separate parts
and then still try to bring Parts
together
Eternal parts so that's a side note but
you know I always start with this
because it's one of the you know kind of
the
I suppose uh underlying issues whenever
you talk about this kind of CG framers
that are supposed to be systemic in
nature
um so
the idea that shs are not separate boxes
although the graphical seem to be so
that they are interdependence in the
interdependent you need to integrate
them and integrating is kind of the U.N
lingo for saying systemic
so you have to work across sectors
across portfolios across silos breakdown
the silos across institutions and you
are supposed to be producing coherence
in policies and financing
and there's plenty of lingo uh on
systems there's a lot even in the
convention 2030 agenda and there are
these words are being used so there are
synergies and trade-offs right I mean
you cannot work on one goal or Target
without considering whether it's
energetic or you know we would say
enabling
um how facilitating
um the progress on the other goals and
targets which is kind of synergies or
trade-offs that it's actually hindering
the progress on the other one so I mean
there are plenty of examples like this
but you know you increase production and
of course it increases the environmental
negative environmental importance after
that Leverage is all over the place so
everyone's talking about fabulous you
know when you ask about the definition
not many people know catalytic impact
you know you invest a relatively small
effort and funding into proper entry
points or systemic change and then there
is the boom effect I mean this is my uh
you know Theory job so we are supposed
to be giving money to where someone
um you know demonstrated that if you
give me two million dollars over two
years I'm gonna transform the country so
so that that that's kind of the idea and
of course catalytic is used as in terms
of development so actual policy goes and
also in terms of financing so you invest
a million dollars and there's like 200
million dollars being leveraged on that
sense Universal approach this is going
back to Peter to your
um previous question
and my point of view this idea that
these goals apply to the whole world
even though there is assumption that you
would need to adjust them to the
National local context
I I find it very pragmatic because
there's a tendency to say you know
there's one approach to rule them all or
you know
um
that they're also you know that there's
an actual app that applies an algorithm
to to help you understand how you're
moving on the sdgs which I find very
problematic because you know I come from
the from the legacy of complex social
systems thinking uh where you know it's
not about extrapolation of past data
into the future it's not really about
forecasting it's not about just kind of
improving a bit
um the current situation it's a you know
transformative really means that you
need to you need to really apply
something that is very contextual and
maybe going back to Matty's question it
has to be done by with proper
involvement of the stakeholders it
cannot cannot be imposed not not from
the from the UN is not imposing but even
from the national government
uh and then it's it's a lot about
reporting so everyone cares about how
the report on this you know it's it's
sometimes it's really you know less
relevant what's behind this uh behind
the data as I mentioned some are
misleading but what is good about having
goals targets indicators is that that
the scope is being narrowed
so you start with no poverty then you
have a Target reducing by 50 poverty and
then eliminating its empowered and then
you have an indicators which again is
mostly monetary about how I do that so
it's fluffy in the in the main
definition and even in the icon is just
sometimes misleading but when you go
down the scope Narrows and sometimes
Narrows very narrowly so it's actually
too narrow but at least it's not really
everything under the sun
um as the 17 goals initially May imply
um indicators are actually chromatic
because the one-third of indicators
uh data doesn't exist
data was supposed to be created and that
was also inspirational so let's put
these indicators out there and then
let's start developing you know Data
Systems to collect them but one third
was not even considered
um measurable
so so that that's a bit funny
um it's just kind of you know like yeah
you shouldn't be measuring everything
under the Sun but at the same time if
you say you're going to measure you
should be able to measure so
um this this um this diagram here is uh
probably the most famous quote-unquote
systemic diagram uh on the sdgs uh it
was reduced actually before the sdgs
were kind of you know started
implementation it's called the network
of targets approach
uh That was supposed to be initial
thinking around how different targets
again not goals targets relate to each
other
um but the problem was that I mean it
was very reductionistic
um and again very genetic so these
linkages are not the same in different
countries or even within different
countries the different localities but
it was supposed to be like the okay so
if you want to work on the sdgs we have
to develop your network of targets for
your particular context this is the
methodology and then you move from there
and then you try to identify entry
points Library
but the problem is that that was the
only Global accepted methodology that
exists no one really moved beyond that
substantively to a bit more complex
spaces
um and then the issue can you work on
all goals I mean everyone says you
cannot work on one goal okay so you have
to work on couple of goals because
they're in the interdependent but at the
same time can you work on all of the
goals uh there is one actually
publication
um 2018 that I I consider the the the
most you know relevant
um is and it came from Norway and they
said
depending on the entry points depending
on your Pathways the relationships
between different uh targets are gonna
change
and you cannot take all of the 169
targets at the same time you have to
select a limited number of targets that
you focus on and then apply these lenses
to see how they relate to others in your
particular context so they were actually
making a strong argument against
universalistic approach
um to understanding the interlinkages
uh now when it comes to methodologies as
I mentioned there's there's only this
kind of network of targets um so as you
can see in my presentation there's a lot
of lingo and there's a lot of good
intention to apply systems thinking and
practice but at the same time the
reality is is uh is not really
reflecting that not least because as we
know as systems literacy is very long
it's slow in Canada let alone in some
other countries so methodologies
um there's something called maps and
actually I was working on this quite a
bit I was doing a midterm review of the
whole Maps project in 2018.
um so Maps was the idea that you take
the global goals and then you mainstream
them which basically means
nationalization or downloading so you
take those calls and targets and
indicators
and then you rethink them in the
National context and then you do that
again when you bring them to provincial
or SubCentral or local level so you are
not just taking the global goals as they
are
and then you try to work on acceleration
which means kind of should should mean
in places systemic approach we identify
entry point to identify so-called
accelerators and master accelerators
identify bottlenecks and leverage you
apply mixed method combo is applied in
Latin America as a mixed method approach
to maps and then you have integrated
policy support which is how you actually
work then on policy Innovation policy
change and most transformative systemic
theories are changing and there was of
course the foresight idea I produced a
global foresight guide for the sdgs
which was not really about sdgs it was
just my own compilation of everything
that has to do with the foresight and
and there was some prominence of
foresight at the beginning
um but I think it was lost now it's
being kind of uh you know recovered to
some extent but forecasting took over
and and I think that that that's a huge
problem for the adjectives because that
was not the point just to kind of
maintain the status quo
again how do you work across goals and
targets nobody knows there's no specific
methodology to that how do you actually
change systems almost nothing and when I
say almost nothing I don't mean that
there are no methodologies there's
nothing that is globally agreed and
applied and I kind of recommended
there's no guidance on how to do that
uh you know how do you identify entry
points and sell it all the rest but I
think
probably at the core of all of this is
this old dilemma that I think is has
been discussed in this you know
Community as well
is between the systems Dynamic approach
or what the limits to growth imply the
versus
the the quote-unquote loser in this kind
of debate at the you know at the
beginning uh it was the uh oswegan's
predicament for the human uh kind which
was around complexes so can you actually
set specific targets can you have a
linear thinking even if it's system
thinking but a bit more linear towards
achieving these targets all you have to
understand complexity in a very
different uh context and of course I
don't believe that you can change
institutions and policies and societies
only with so-called techno economic
thinking or rationality you need social
normative and political if if nothing
else so it's I think it's quite a
reductionist lnob actually uh proposed a
very good opportunity because they and I
always kind of advocated this they give
provide an opportunity to do extreme
case systemic design and we can discuss
it because uh most of the funding in
most of the focus is on the most
vulnerable on on one on this uh this
graph is just one example of you know
people trying to figure out how to do
this kind of stuff but again nothing was
accepted at them at scale these are the
theories to change
from the programs that in my portfolio
on integrated social protection and
living on behind it Peter has been
analyzing
um I'm just giving some examples it's
not supposed to be readable it's just uh
showing you that even when you talk
about the theories of change
there's no agreement on what theory of
change is and let alone what's how we
should apply theories of change for the
sdg so you see I mean four very
different approaches to this from I
think you know from four different
countries and Peter can talk
um uh uh about you know some of his uh
findings uh in the discussion but it was
really interesting to see and and
actually if you look at it into those
very briefly there are no sdgs so most
of them are just not related to the sdgs
properly that doesn't mean that these
programs were not successful all of
these four really produce huge results
uh my portfolio of 35 programs uh
contributed to directly uh to
transformative change of 147 million
people over two years so plenty has been
done but whether that was just kind of
you know done because it was done
they're good people in the ground
governments are interested or because
they're proper methodologists behind us
that that's a whole different question
and then we we had also Ryan work with
us Peter and me I'm trying to figure out
this you know understanding leverage
points bottlenecks and this is how this
might look like at the genetic level for
only goals and selected targets so so
the complexity of this is huge so some
criticism is maybe not fair because if
you want to deal with all this you know
169 targets and then try to figure out
the linkages uh it really becomes uh
um quite quite a challenge so I'll stop
here for you know I just want to
introduce and then we can we can discuss
it further
so um more questions in the chat if you
uh want to uh ask and Peter actually has
made a comment and he'll probably maybe
have you back up some slides with Peter
oh that was just a comment for everybody
picking up on just like you've been
posting comments David on Extreme
systemic design
that there really is sounds intriguing
now we should um extreme case I don't
know if I put it on Extreme case extreme
case
extreme case systemic design yeah I mean
this is Disco logic if you if you design
things
for a very narrow group of people where
there is some intersectionality so I
always give an example of you know
whatever
um a woman who is also part of ethnic
religious minority and maybe she's uh
she has you know disabilities and
whatever so if you design for that
person which is much more difficult and
more expensive than to implement then
the whole idea is that you the system
would then you know provide
um good uh services to to everyone else
I mean
in that cell
so similar to the perspective of the
extreme user and satisfying the the the
range of extreme users so that
um so that every Everybody in the middle
of those Tales is also satisfied I see
it as uh
as a problem of of of the translation of
the various targets to appropriate
National or Regional goals and context
too so it's extreme in the sense of
the reach from these these very um uh
you know these very aspirational or kind
of High
um
you know so they're
the sdgs and the targets are worded in
ways that are that don't lend themselves
to very effective evaluation you know
they have to be translated to as you've
shown theory of change at least you know
that's that's one kind of transformation
of the program to be able to be able to
manage it toward toward uh progress and
toward evaluation
but then to really translate it to
community levels uh so it's an sdg 12 or
like Community Development level that
seems to be you know an extreme reach
from you know the global goal to the
actual support of the community and so
that is that the theory of change at
least is somewhere in the middle
but to reach all the way down into the
community is really a stretch you know
so
yeah I think this is one of the main
challenges because again
the the formulations lower formulations
are not supposed to be actionable I mean
they're just something that is minimum
commonly nominated for everyone
you know um all the countries in the
world
then the whole point was to interpret
those into different contexts so at the
national level governments are supposed
to be doing that and then many did many
did most in Europe but also in Africa
Central Asia Canada didn't
um and then you would bring it down to
the local level original level
um then you know private sector
corporate sector people are complaining
well this is a bureaucratic goals you
know from for National statistics
offices and stuff as well the point was
that you take those goals and say how
this relates to my own business
uh and then of course universities I
mean many universities Embrace this as
well so how does this universe and then
Grassroots and ngos and I've been
working with some ngos trying to figure
that out the problem is that there's no
guidance that will help
enable this process you have to do it on
your own or you just need to have
someone who is very well informed about
the sdgs and knows the local context and
and then there are very few people like
that so I think that the problem was
that there was no guidance on how to do
these maps how to mainstream them or
nationalize them and localize them what
acceleration means there's no agreement
on what accelerator is and then how to
actually organize an integrated approach
and then give this as a kind of a manual
and everyone then does it in their own
context but again saying that these
messages are not applicable to
businesses or Grassroots or universities
or like municipalities is completely
misunderstanding of the original
intention
you know I I just had I think that's a
really uh it it's value it would be
valuable to have
um a proliferation and more case studies
of the in of of uh different and valid a
variety of valid approaches to
implementation that have been used
um not just in National context which I
think could come out of the lnop
um you know your work with the with the
lnop
um program uh across the different
recipient countries
that that we actually analyzed too with
the theories of change
but but for you know I know there are
communities in Canada municipalities
that are attempting to to work sdgs into
their
um strategic planning so that they can
have use those as
um aspirational goals for and then who's
assign different indicators within their
own more local strategies or local
theories to change
those are um you know Griff and I have
been you know part of a team that's been
exploring different municipalities and
we've come across some interest some
applic some interest in in different
municipalities in this the extent to
which they're able to develop anything
we might see as a case study in sdgs is
probably a few years away I mean so that
the thing is that it starts to get
caught up in all the you know all you
know the local action can really take
some time
so you know there's also rate you know
you would think the closer you are to
the ground the faster things could
happen
but it's probably you know not the case
and just even the understanding of what
the sdgs are going to mean to a
municipalities especially one that's
already fairly well off and it's trying
to perhaps push you know even you know
into goals that might be very that might
be very high-minded for you know as like
a middle class economy you know in a
strong economy in a Canadian
municipality or something and so they're
you try to use these I think as
reference points for getting you know a
direction for you know for for
sustainable
you know for for sustainable uh economic
growth as they might think about it in
these municipalities
but um but we're short on good guidance
of case studies and then missing that
guidance you know not as you know
um people will start to believe that
this is perhaps being imposed as a
policy agenda by the U.N or are these or
this is kind of you know like the
communities are indulging in globalism
or something and and I I think without
having a good strategic position or
narrative about you know the about the
application of of of the sdgs within a
localized framework
um people really you know I'm not sure
they're clear about you know what that's
going to mean and it might be different
in each project in each municipality
yeah I think um
many many you ask a couple of questions
so maybe I can I can sponsor those as
well building on what Peter said but I
think I think that
I mean when they talk about the U.N I
mean again there's no U.N without member
states which means that there's no U.N
without National Representatives so
there's not something like you know
people either Secretary of D1 where I
said these people are not making any
decisions so I think that there's a lot
of uh kind of a failure at the national
part to communicate this effectively
because if you I mean as it is per se if
you try to look at them objectively
they're really bad
but if you use them as a reference point
as you said Peter if you use them as
like okay so I don't start from scratch
I start to start with these and then you
start changing them to what you need
I think they can be very effective one
thing that I forgot to mention it was in
one of the first slides is that actually
before the Millennium calls before
UNICEF was I mean osberg can propose
ccps and Peter you presented 50 years
after the CCP is recently I've been ccps
are also kind of global goals I mean
they are not goals meant to be
measurable in the way that these are
but they're also kind of certain
reference points that you take at least
this is my understanding and then you
work on it depending on your context
they're not prescriptive in that sense
so I think there was a lot of
miscommunication at the national level
but that's you know we can discuss it in
case of Canada but I think that's not
the case in most of the other countries
in Germany for instance I wanted to
mention that later on but I mentioned
now Germany took the I mean before the
education adopted Germany conducted
functional review of the whole federal
government
to review how the federal policies and
institutions relate to the sdgs and then
introduce reorganization of the federal
government and change the priorities so
they're not they did not take the sdgs
and they start implementing them they
use them as the kind of a again a
reference point to see how they align
with something that has been emerging
the time but you know
this is Germany and then in other
countries it was a bit uh different but
I think the most problematic was indeed
and going back to to Maddy's questions
is with a private sector or corporate
sector whatever you want to call it
because at the at the very beginning
they just lay down and they said oh is
this here's nothing to do with us it's
you and it's the politics it's a
bureaucracy and then and so on so forth
um but
um actually they are critical
um to to the implementation of the sdgs
because the funding and financing has to
come from the private Court protector
governments cannot pay for the sdgs for
most part
and then there was a push that you know
private sector I'm gonna call it private
sector holding Canada it's usually
called the corporate sector but I mean
for profit this is what you're talking
about for-profit businesses
um and then they say oh no yeah we are
working on the sdg so what happened and
I was looking at some of the you know
like RBC and a couple of other
um Banks and and companies here in
Canada they just you know just said oh
we work on these three as it is and we
have ever you know we've been working on
this forever
so they did not really do the m
mainstreaming so say okay so we take 169
targets and and we select 2030 to create
your business
and we redefine the indicators of course
then just at all these three we can of
course if you look on gender and we can
poverty whatever
uh one and there's plenty of actually um
examples uh unfortunately there's still
divide between kind of developed and
developed in countries but there's huge
amount of uh practice is best practices
analysis simulations
um all over the world in terms of you
know different practices now I'm
focusing more localization actually
going to the local level and you know
we'll have a new thematic window
mobilization just starting next week
um but Mary uh the one of the many
organizations that was supposed to be
collecting and making private sector
together is called Global compact
there is a global compact globally and
then there's Global compact in Canada
uh so they they were supposed to be
bringing you know different companies
together discussing how as it is related
to ESG how related and then developing
uh you know bringing putting together
data you know sharing best practices and
stuff like that but you know depending
on the country this was you know more or
less effective uh the reporting still um
becomes the mostly the in Canada federal
government reporting through viennas
which I'm gonna mention later on
um so just to check David I suppose you
need to move on just to check maybe I
had some other question did the
adjectives can be the point system no I
mean there's no
um
so the thing with the again sdgs are not
obligatory they're given and I'm using
P3 over your your concept which is
reference right I think you know that
that's that's a good communication uh
tool so it serves reference points
um and then everyone was supposed to be
doing it on their own
and producing reports so the reports
that are produced at the national level
are called vnrs voluntary National
debuts and the first word says it all
it's voluntary
so it started it like you know dozen
countries now it's I think three three
thousand countries or so so most
countries do not report some reported
once and then uh Canada reported once
and and it's supposed to you know uh can
they supposed to be reporting this year
as well but there's no again unified
methodology of how to do that there's
like some guidance but it's just very so
there are no sdg reports per se that are
obligatory that you would say Point
systems however that did not prevent
many countries to actually use the sdgs
as a framework for what and code point
system or something that they can use
domestically
to Monitor and evaluate their own
policies it's just that most countries
you know Canada included did not really
apply them they're just like a like an
appendix to what uh you know are regular
strategic Frameworks for the national
level and our national one developed you
know by University of Waterloo
Mary has more questions but I think
we're getting into the third categories
let's move to the third category and
we'll have more questions at the end
we'll start off with Mary when we come
back
thanks so um yeah I mean I think we
already got there a bit so where do we
stand in the 20 uh 23 and what happens
next so it's half a point so it's seven
years past and seven years you know
ahead
um so first of all as as always there's
already discussion about post 2030 so
you remember I mentioned post 2015 it
was after the mdgs now there's always
because again January 1st January 2020
2031
when the SGS are supposed to be
completely accomplished is not going to
be very happy day because you know
there's going to be some progress but
it's going to be very disappointing so
there's already discussion about you
know next 15 years stuff like that
there was a decent progress until 2020.
and I'm I'm talking about global data
right so globally things moved a lot
but that was mostly the effect of
developing China and then southeast Asia
and maybe some parts of Africa so there
were still countries that were lagging
behind and I just the other day I was
looking there I think six six or seven
countries in the world that account for
more than half of extreme poverty
so in six seven countries you have half
of the extreme Poverty of the whole
world
so things did not move you know equally
but so you know there was progress but
it was a bit
uh you know too aggregated didn't show
that it's not really the whole world
moving but you know there was there was
positive uh attitude and I mentioned
vnr's International reviews localization
of the sdgs was very important from the
beginning but not enough attention now
it's we are bringing it back
because this is where the outcomes
police outcomes happens I mean Federal
Ministry in Canada has nothing to do
with actual outcomes that they can do
policies but what happens in terms of
actual change as it is or otherwise it's
at the local
so more focused on localization has been
made more recently now as I mentioned
again a lot of this stuff already
mentioned so it was the whole point was
to mainstream to adopt these Frameworks
to National sub-national levels
universities and CSO csos is you know
sales site organizations which is ngos
Grassroots regions and stuff like that
no country even before 2020 was on the
path to achieve them all
not even Norway
close but not there so already 2020
there was a feeling like oh you know is
it going to really happen and of course
then it got much worse
and I I have this particular formulation
that we can always discuss uh bitter and
I sometimes do
um so it's not the impact of covered its
impact of the bad policy response to
covet
um then you know consequent inflation
um Ukraine
um and Western sections and then what
happened last year is something that was
still called triple crisis which is
energy food and financing basically most
of the world is in you know in deep deep
trouble uh because of the policy
responses to covet inflation uh Western
sections so and so forth and now it's
being called cost of living crisis so
with this
for the very first time I think in 20 30
years the the global developments
um was going the other direction
then of course that affected the shs so
things are now worse than in 2015 in
many ways
um funding and financing this idea of
you know mobilizing Millions to mobilize
billions to mobile Australians didn't
happen
and I don't think it's really about the
money if you put more money into the
wrong system it's not gonna necessarily
improve uh or it's not going to have
more transformative uh change and
there's a lot of sdg washing and
especially in the private sector now
there's the reference to sdg Transitions
so sdg Transformations
um the three main ones are food energy
digital and there are some others we can
discuss those and then there is a big
Summit in September this year uh halfway
through seven years left
what should be done to kind of bring
there's actual expression that you use
to rescue the sdgs but it's not about
the shs it's really rescuing the the
development itself not even development
itself because it's we are really really
regressing back to I don't know
decades decades back now this is just
illustrative thing so on food things are
much worse than it used to be they
improved by 2020 but then it became
worse because of the again triple crisis
and food energy and financing which are
interrelated
um so
um nearly one in three people like
Regular access to Advocate Foods even in
2020 now it's even worse
um on on gender equality I mean
this this goes back to what I said about
aspiration
even in 2020 and now it's worse uh it
would take another 40 years for women
and men to be represented equally
National particularly and that's a tiny
simplistic indicator of gender equality
it's about quotas so even quotas would
need 40 more years to be let alone
actual substantive equality uh so this
shows but again the whole idea was to
have positive trend right to the things
that are moving
in a good direction and then after 2020
they went to the other direction so it's
much worse or in the climate change I
mean stuff that that you know is being
part of Daily News already
now Canada and yes it is again I'm not I
kind of lost track of Canada for the
past couple years that I've been in New
York uh or working you know with the
headquarters
um so uh this is just a samurai Insight
so first of all there was very limited
interest in Canada and even the US
not even even more the us because there
were those U.N goals so this isn't ours
it's just some you know that's some New
Yorkers in New York
uh but EU and European countries really
really are all about adjectives that
they have adjectives across all their
policy documents everywhere and I
mentioned the German case of the
function review
um
then Canada in 2000 when when I when I I
did a I did there was a panel I was
participating in and I also wrote for
government
Canadian government is active I wrote
the article um on the sdgs I think it
was 2016 or something very few people
heard of the sdgs even in the
governments and they they were just you
know it was non-existent in terms of the
narrative or discussion but 2019 so you
see three years later and three out of
15 years is a lot Canada developed a
strategy and there was some funding but
all of that is in my point of view very
much a side note it's an appendix it's
not mainstream into the Canadian federal
government policies and if you look at
the where the passages are explained in
the government website it's
underemployment and Social Development
so it's not done the prime minister's
office it's not under something it's
just one quite narrow silo and this
might indicate how Canadian federal
government sees the sdgs you know it's
it's jobs and Social Security or
something like that
uh BNR uh volunte National Review in
2018 uh which is again before the
strategy so it's a bit doesn't make
sense you know like you produce a report
you don't have a strategy yeah and then
this year apparently candidate should
have the next one data is quite outdated
like if you look at the uh I shared the
link and David shared the link if you
look into the extreme power data is
2016. that's ridiculous like that that's
that's just useless
um universities and there's there was
some traction some some of the local
level BC provincial elections couple
years ago were all about sdgs I don't
know what happened later on
interestingly uh Alberta was very much
interested in the sdgs um and and at
some point in time most of the traction
even in the in the private sector
um on the sdgs was taking place in
Alberta all the conferences all the
discussions what actually in Calgary for
maybe obvious reasons but still this is
where the center of sdg discussion in
Canada used to be some years ago and
then of course there's a lot of washing
so this is just one example so they're
all different kind of strategic
Frameworks so one of those that is used
in Canada is this Canadian index
developing
and you can pick and choose of course
you can still work on this one not on
the sh this is an attempt from
University of Waterloo to relate SGS
with this uh planned index of well-being
the benefit of The Exodus is that this
is Lomo so if you talk to other
countries if you want to exchange
experiences if you want to compare nodes
you can talk in SG terms but you cannot
talk in terms of Canadian index
well-being because this is Canadian and
others have different one
but then do you want to use the
adjectives for the for the local
purposes
um I would still go for something that
is globally as a reference point Peter
I'm I keep using this word uh rather
than inventing something on my own
um and then investing a bit more in
socializing that with people uh rather
than just trying to invent this even
more complicated uh competitive
Frameworks but again that that that's a
good attempt and as I mentioned
University of Waterloo is has been
really serious about the adjectives for
for a while and is known
globally as one of the centers of
excellence at least
so this is the end of the third part
over to you David
uh so Mary and Peter have stuff going
back and forth would Mary like to step
up and then Peter will respond to that
sorry I I just
um I I've been following the sdgs
um and I've actually been involved in um
a hackathon uh one of the local colleges
regarding this
um and with the municipality and
pitching uh ideas but
the thing that
um I remember when I first
read them when I was first following the
news about them
and now all of these years later I'm
still keeping you know my eye on what's
going on but it just
the initial
my initial thoughts
um many years ago when it was presented
haven't really changed because I feel
like fundamentally
at the start that there were
I don't know like gaps that there were
gaps on the way
um in the way that it was being
implemented
um and for me then and even now it just
did not seem like their goal of this
2030 or like every 10 to 15 years
um it didn't seem that that was
um
achievable and even now it doesn't seem
that it is achievable and as a young
person then and as a young person now
it one of the things that really
bothered me was that
um it it did not it it seemed like they
they needed such huge buy-in
um and cooperation but that maybe this
was not this was not the way to to do
this this type of work that they're
trying to do
um and anytime you were asking questions
about like even how they themselves as
as the UN or even as their own countries
individual countries how they get
um they get their plans passed through
it didn't seem that though the uh that
type of um that type of thinking went
towards these these goals and if you
were like a young person and you're
seeing that that there's a way
um an actual path
um that that can be implemented to kind
of like change the future and to change
the future outcomes
um you you kind of get hopeful and you
you you you buy in right so a lot of
young people young kids uh University
students college students all around the
world we bought in to these ideas these
goals
um but it's many years later we're not
closer and I don't think we're gonna be
any any closer so I think that there
there were
flaws there were I I think what you guys
are discussing here there were system
thinking flaws that I feel like the same
people who who came up with this
um knew about or would have known about
then and more should have been done then
to kind of
um
perceive it going like
perceive it on on the outset right so
for me it just it just it doesn't really
ring ring true anymore and I don't know
if if people really understand that
they're they're letting um a lot of the
Good Will that was there previously and
that should be there and even now that a
lot of younger people are kind of like
really
down down on this this this future
change like like we don't actually think
that it's something that can happen you
know what I mean so that that's just
what I'm talking about or thinking about
as as I'm here
thank you all but um I and I I fully
agree with you I fully agree with you
um
it just
it's
thinking in terms of again that's why I
emphasize so much the context
before 2015 or even before 2000 let's
say mdges provided some context
it was very difficult to to talk about
development sustainable development all
this kind of stuff across countries
uh you default to talking about the GDP
right that's the responsible discussion
because gdps should be the least
relevant of them all so comparing to
what we had before this is huge
and I kept criticizing it
um did it change
um in terms of the uh you know seven
years ago yes but I think the failure is
not on the SGS
so much as it is it at the national
level at the local level and in the
private sector corporate sector uh you
know Grassroots they did not understand
the properly did not embrace them
properly
uh
uh one of the challenges and this I
think we have in systems in general is
the the the overwhelming effect
of 17 goals 169 targets
but I think the message is that you
cannot work on one without thinking
about the other ones
and I I don't think the message is you
know everyone should work on everything
I mean it's just impossible so applying
personal lenses whether it's individual
and yeah I think you know David wants to
discuss what we as Canadians individuals
can do as well
or business lenses or local lenses or
whatever
I think that's essential if that fails
then then it can be misleading and it
it's just missing the point
um but again comparing to what we had
before this is really really important I
am very concerned about the default to
forecasting
uh because there's less aspiration about
the future but again this is not in the
video with the SGS this is all the
effect of the you know policy response
to covet
um inflationary
um uh kind of Trends
um
sanctions against Russia the decoupling
geopolitics there's so much happening
that really has nothing to do with the
SGS which I I believe are at the cause
of this current
lack of more aspirational uh perspective
towards the future and I think we are
getting into something that you know
didn't exist for decades you know
closing of the countries more
nationalistic modernitarian systems all
that kind of stuff that again are very
different from the Baseline the starting
point in 2015 for the shs
I don't know if this makes sense
um but but you know again I'm the first
one to be critical about the sdgs but I
see the value huge value if you apply
them properly
David do you want to check some of the
other questions uh so so Peter was
mentioning about movement and movements
um could you uh speak up a little more
about that Peter
well yeah
let's see to clarify
um what's meant by that there
well
I'll go back I'll I'll tie this into the
discussion by saying that
um
when uh Ryan Murphy and I uh worked with
netard a few years ago on on
um essentially evaluating the process
for how theories have changed were being
developed and and looking for some of
the best approaches to theories of
change that were coming out of the
proposals for you know from from the
different countries in the sdg fund
and then Ryan and I were you know have
been working on kind of a joint projects
through different methodologies
um in what we call systemic theories of
change
and so taking an approach to theories of
change that would account for
systemic action and outcomes that
could be understood from the design of
that theory to its evaluation to the
ways of working with that theory of
change
as a type of systemic more systemic
strategy rather than this kind of
somewhat linear looking magical set of
set of outcomes that lead to you know
the the act the achievement of the sdgs
if even that like net had said
um had pointed out that even in that
small sample of different
um
um
kind of graphical or logic models of
theories to change that very few of them
even included the sdgs that were were
part of their impact strategy their ways
of showing how they're going to imagine
success for their National programs
in a sense and they're and they're
coming up with a you know story of
impact for that and it's kind of that's
one of the systemic issues as well
you know you're assuming which sdgs you
know because this is on the no one left
behind in Social protection which I
think is really a good place to start
and and also to even address Mary's
questions like well we don't even know
really the long-term impact of of this
kind of front the front loading if you
will of just the social protection
aspect of of the sdg funds program I
mean this is good for every country
that's doing work on you know um you
know on on on mother and child
um protection on it and on Educational
Services and social benefits and in
protecting you know child development in
different in different very often even
in very
um rural or traditional contexts like
you know sheep sheep herding families in
Mongolia and things you know it's a it's
a wide range of things that's that's
meant by by this leaving no one behind
and it may not achieve all the sdgs but
it's going to have systemic impacts that
some of which can be somewhat foreseen
not forecasted but oriented towards and
some of which are going to be invisible
to all but those that are really part of
those programs so there is like good
being done
whether or not at all is like part of
the agenda that's like you know more of
the political question so the the idea
of these different models of theories
have changed were
this is a this is an aspect out of
classifying the different
um theory of change models that were
being used and also to distinguish the
ones that might have more
um systemic impact and so again so I've
written about this some and basically
can just summarize there are four
different
sense making Logics for theories of
change the The Fairly traditional theory
of change that actions lead to outcomes
lead to impacts
call that action outcome and that's like
the traditional logic model
we have influence Pathways which is like
strategic Pathways or approaches to
tracing Pathways to change
um one we called process complexity
because we just needed a place to bundle
all the ones that were interesting in a
complex way but may have had their own
internal logic but no common structure
but they were processes that attempted
to account for complexity for their
outcomes so there was a some attempt of
systems thinking and then there's
movement coordination and the movement
of movement is one actually that
foundations have been interested in
probably more than even the sdg program
which really should be looking at this
more but the movement of movements is
one where it's more or less say fair in
terms of the attempt to coordinate it
it's kind of putting the strategy into
the hands of of the overall movement
assuming that there are many different
um it's like equifenality in bird along
these terms there are many Pathways that
can get to a similar to the same outcome
and that the foundations are interested
in
funding uh perhaps High leverage
projects that might cost them less but
have more impact because they're part of
an ongoing movement a social Innovation
movement a new economies movement a
reduction in poverty movement and so
they take advantage of the social
movement aspects the fact that other
foundations that they're talking to are
funding other major projects and so a
large Foundation like a mid-yard might
fund like 5 million 10 million dollar
projects and McConnell might come in and
Canada and fund five you know half a
million one million dollar projects over
an extended period of time and those
would be part of that same movement and
then they would look for the kind of
Cooperative effects to occur as as they
use things like developmental evaluation
to not just really to measure progress
but developmental evaluation is used to
inspire progress where progress is
starting to happen so it's looking
across a range of outcomes and then and
then and then reinforcing progress where
it's starting to show up movement of
movements is quite a bit about you know
that approach unfortunate Auto seems to
have backed off from that that was part
of their big push towards system change
um probably Ted hundreds and Tim
draymond's last few years there and
there are new people running McConnell
now and they're taking more of a
traditional approach
you know but there was really a real
kind of push there the the end of um Ted
and Tim's tenure to you know really
build on this kind of approach to
systems change and I think this is also
you know something that we're seeing in
some of the sdg programs
uh David yeah may I three I don't know I
think we are out of time but let me take
your questions if you allow yeah yeah so
so uh yeah so we have like 10 or 15
minutes so
um there was one question from Maxine
and then I actually wanted to return to
what's on the slide because we haven't
discussed those so for people who
haven't spoken if you'd like to put in
questions in the chat I will respond to
them uh but Maxima asked the question
could you please speak a bit more about
what the sdd transition could look like
in the coming decade yes thank you um
and just before that maybe to go back to
Maddie and some of the previous
discussions so I think one of the
challenges with yesterday's I have
nothing to do with the as it is it's the
challenges it you know complex system
change
um and I think systems literacy is one
of the reasons why sdgs by themselves
were not embraced effectively and more
widely so when you see you know 17 goals
169 targets
how do you deal with this kind of
complexity how do you avoid being
overwhelmed
um well you know you find you try to
find entry points where do you find it
depends on what your you know strategy
policy what's your mandate where do you
work and so on so forth what's your
business but you could take gender-based
violence you say okay so there is an NGO
Grassroots we can't generate department
so the whole idea of the sdg is to say
we are not narrowly we are not issue
based
approach
but we're looking into the broad
spectrum so how the database violence
relates to Poverty how this right to
education how it relates to health
decent jobs uh you know whatever
environmental change
um and then you zoom out from there and
try to figure out what's your kind of
you know how do you look at all these as
it is or you know to to bring it back
home to Inca to Canada is like okay so
extreme poverty so we want to eliminate
extreme poverty whatever that means so
how does that relate to other
um goals so it's kind of it's even if
you want if you would want to do some
sort of foresight
and then compare to the wind tunneling
of your alternative size in the future
against the sdgs as strategies you know
this could be a way to do it the the
other thing I wanted to to mention is
that um this again as you David
mentioned um the sdg transition so
sometimes politically speaking again and
all of that is politics at least the
context is to try to push the agenda
that kind of died a bit
because with the
post-covet situation the situation is so
bad
I mean I've been in this space of
strategic development for 20 plus years
I have never seen that in even and I've
worked in many problematic countries
um just recently we were doing a survey
and we were talking about food systems
which is the first let's say the first
transition
and governments around the world are
saying no no we cannot work on food
systems change
and the Food Systems approaches that you
don't look only in agriculture look into
the climate change you look into jobs
you don't you know you kind of do many
sdgs around food system situation
governments are saying we cannot we
don't want to work on exit on Food
Systems we'll deal with this later
let us address the current food
insecurity crisis and this is what's
happening with covet oh let's let's
finish with this coffee thing and then
we are going to do systemic change and
then it never happened so I think the
yes it is at least should send us the
message that well it is exactly during
the crisis that you should be thinking
about system change you cannot wait for
some you know ideal situations to start
thinking about something more
substantive so sdg transitions are a way
to articulate this new push for the lcgs
the the three main ones and then there
are sometimes called transformation
sometimes transitions but the three main
ones around the Food Systems which is
probably the most important one it has
to do with again it's like a subset of
sdgs so it's not only about food
Securities and then that is a huge Food
Systems crisis in Canada I mean huge not
only in terms of the the cost of living
crisis but also the agriculture this I
mean Canada could just say Okay so for
the next 10 years we focus on on food
systems and and that would be a very
aspirational
um the second one is around digital
transformation which I have you know I
have a digital background but I have
second tones about this but the idea is
that you know digital is this kind of
driver for change or whatever
um and then the third one is is is is is
around energy and and slash climate so
it's mostly about energy renewable
energy NHC access access to energy and
kind of this energy transformation area
but of course it's it's causated to the
climates and then there is a kind of
human well-being like a four transition
but the idea maybe teleological a bit is
that there's some point in future where
we need to be and we are transitioning
into that which again I don't like very
much because there's no such point in
future for all of us
um but again it's it's a it's it's a an
attempt to push the to the agenda
further
David
um so let's check a little bit on the
last question what can we do as
individuals and Canadians
are you asking me yes uh although anyone
else that wants to chip in uh I think
you're the authority here so you get the
heavy questions
I I I really think that you know as
individuals
well there's always you know some
advocacy for the sdgs but I think it's
more individuals within the
organizations I would say
so it's the organizations that that you
know different people are part of
whether it's you know in their own
businesses or you know corporate sector
or working for the government or for
Grassroots I think this is where the
idea so for me sdgs are a good
entry point to start talking about
systems change
if you do it properly so it's I think
you know okay so you know Synergy
trade-offs so what do we mean by that
and you start you know to create
dialogue around that
um leverage what's what's leverage
what's catalytic you know and I've been
involved in couple of Ventures here in
Canada
and when you start creating this
dialogue they don't get very far but
they move and then they kind of break
through some of the um the the kind of
uh the previous situation so you know
just talking about catalytic investment
so what does it mean to invest in a
catalytic way
across different sectors or Industries
or areas or policy domains what does it
even mean you know
you know so we put one dollar there and
we expect to do something which is like
this catalytic boom effect so for me
um as Canadians I think we should be
embracing a bit more systemic thinking
and practice and as it is an opportunity
for that and the second thing I would
say that to be a less Naval gazing
because when when
at least in my experience when you know
people discuss here in Canada
International best practices experiences
they compare notes with other countries
it's mostly us you can maybe Australia
um and none of these countries are
really good examples on almost anything
my personal opinion
um and certainly not on the sdgs
um and then there is certain resistance
to
not only go wider in discussing these
issues
but also resistance to
understanding that a lot of good ideas
practices even emerging practices if not
actual successes
have been done in countries that are
much less developed in Canada
I can give you just my example I've
worked in some 40 countries can I mean I
would never even try to do things that I
did elsewhere in Canada because it would
be just impossible it is so uh so so
kind of um
uh fixated in one place so when you look
into a small country like you know Peter
was talking about Mongolia okay so
Mongolia or they have herders who cares
about herders but if you make parallels
between herders
and some indigenous populations that
live in in you know in the Northern
Territories
and you look into how Mongolia managed
to transform child care
uh within two years well you could you
could be aspired at least if nothing
else but I think that there's some some
firewall there for for many of the
Canadians uh when they when they think
about you know what experiences they
should look at from from other countries
but again only my experience maybe it's
very nice
okay um just in closing I'm going to
actually do the last shot which is uh
since you've now motivated me to
actually look into uh into this more
I've actually been paying attention to
um the work in the Copenhagen consensus
Center
um and so they uh so Bjorn lomberg is on
a campaign with a book and um the target
is actually the fall and so he's kind of
leading up to it
um so I think that we're going to be
hearing more about the sdgs
um there is actually a uh interesting
two-hour Jordan Peterson interview uh
with lomberg and so
um some of the things came out were
surprising it was kind of like malaria
it's like you know if you look at the
ROI now he's now the interesting thing
about Lumberg is that he's doing it as
an economist and doing consensus work
and just saying you know Roi on fixing
malaria would be good
um Roi on uh providing uh some of the um
childbirth uh equipment so it reduces
mortalities
um and so given that I'm learning and
going up this curve just like everybody
else I'm kind of curious um because
Copenhagen consensus Center has been
around for a while and this is actually
a personal opinion what do you think
about what they're doing
I don't know so much about them but I
did actually watch that interview with
Jordan Peterson and um
I think uh well whatever people may
think about Jordan Peterson uh of course
but but I think
it's
there is a there is a tendency
um in the development sector whether
it's National or International to take
too many things as Givens
as kind of even holy cows right
and that I think kills debate kills
dialogue even more prevent innovation
so when we talk about climate change for
instance
there's so much that has to be discussed
not challenging the climate change of
course
but discussing rather than just kind of
imposing or you know kind of directing
from the above from the outside and and
for whatever reason this kind of
discussions are even less dialogues are
are less and less
happening less and less recently and and
around the sdgs we should I mean I think
we started uh Malana was asking about
you know human population growth
population well why not discuss that
that's a holy cow you cannot discuss
human population I mean no no no no
right well we should discuss it because
it has impact across almost every single
sdg Target so I I like this this what
what they are doing um uh because at
least they're asking questions and they
are legitimate because they this guy was
involved in the U.N discussions I mean
he's not some you know some conspiracy
theories whatever you know on the side I
mean he he knows stuff
um and you know for me also you know the
whole idea about what really cause is
currently and food crisis in the world
you know are we gonna open the box of
the industrial agriculture
and its impact on the climate and then
not go into digital agriculture because
it's going to be even worse not going
into more GMO because it's going to be
worse for the environment I mean there's
so many things to be discussed so
actually I like this is just because it
gives me an opportunity to say oh what
about this right to open another
um box and try to you know um go into
into that and then discuss the linkages
but again I appreciate every time I see
a different perspective and if I don't
agree with it because I suppose that's
the whole point of dialogue
thanks thanks for that and I think that
um this conversation we had today is a
good beginning I don't think it's the
end but my feeling is that the big the
newspaper headlines are going to start
coming in September October so I
encourage people to uh keep reading
paying attention to the sdgs and I think
that the conversations are going to come
back
so thanks Ned for uh providing your
expertise
um uh we are working on future uh system
thinking Ontario sessions
um I'll tell you that actually I'm I'm
working uh I we have July
um kind of um uh planned out and we have
August kind of planned out
um if anyone has an idea for June that
they want to press I'm open to hearing
that um I have an idea but
um uh that would mean me I'm leading the
discussion which I prefer not to do so
um so thanks Ned um and we'll see
everyone uh watch out for your
announcements for next month bye thank
you very much David thank you very much
and have a good day evening bye-bye
thanks David see everyone
