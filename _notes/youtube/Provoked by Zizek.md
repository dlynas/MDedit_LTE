Hello sublation magazine readers
solution media viewers sublation press
readers all use of leaders out there
it's me again Douglas Lane and me Ashley
Crowley and my dog marks oh hello marks
um Marx was uh demanded to sit in your
lap
um so this week we're going to be
discussing
um well we we had planned on discussing
uh the response to one of our streams
from someone named Theory pleb what is
the name of the the podcast that theory
plea runs oh um Theory underground yeah
so we're responding to we were going to
respond to Theory underground we invited
Theory pleiban there's been a series of
uh miscommunications I'm not sure if uh
Theory please gonna be arriving
um but uh in the background or is backup
Ben Burgess will be here uh and we'll be
discussing
um two things one is how should we think
about subjectivity or maybe we won't be
able to land on how we should think
about subjectivity but what are the
different accounts of uh subjectivity
that are prominent on the left and uh
when are we in alignment with our our
pal uh Savoy and when are we uh you know
dirty humanist Heretics
um and uh then I'll also we'll respond
to
um Rock Hills uh Hatchet job on g-jack
that was recently run in counter punch
um I have a finally finished a critical
Cuts video uh defending jujek I may run
it in this stream more likely I'll run
in the parrot room patreon only stream
um but
and
someone asks can't you just beckon the
plebe to attend you in your offices you
know Doug well I I tried that and
apparently my power is more limited than
I thought
um but uh it's limited when you don't
have someone on the payroll I think
that's that's the thing yeah
um so Theory peep is not actually part
of sublation media
um but actually this is a friend
definitely a friend of well I don't know
about a friend of the channel but I I
consider him a friend
um I don't know maybe because I I make
friends easily and if you consider me as
friend but I met him in London I really
liked him
um we did a uh uh what do you call it a
patreon after show I should say I'm
still jet-lagged because my kids are jet
lagged so I'm we're all waking up at
three o'clock in the morning one o'clock
in the morning so I apologize if I'm not
100 clear moment
anyway remember your dog sniffing
um he's so he's such a yeah he's really
really annoying he's a very demanding
little dog anyways um yeah so no I met I
met Siri play in London we did a patreon
stream and from really really
interesting and yeah we disagree on a
couple of things I think that the NT um
the theory underground did a kind of a
stream which was really nice over the uh
not very respectful kind of critique of
some of the things that sublation had
put out in our magazine some of the
things that I have said
um and I think the Crux of our
disagreement is that
um I have more of like a radically open
understanding of the subject
um and they kind of want to have I think
I don't want to mischaracterize them but
I think that they have a more of a
subject that is filled with content and
that content is
um explanatory in a number of ways so
the subject is characterized by these
things and these activities and this has
some sort of this has a an explanatory
um effect on why we have certain
problems or we need to understand it to
find our way out of capitalism and I've
always been
um suspicious and not suspicious but
reluctant to have that kind of idea
um because I I think well I've got a
background in anthropology as well so I
think you know there are as many ways of
being as there are human beings perhaps
there's many at least as many cultures
as there are
um and so it's very difficult to say to
make sort of grand statements about
human beings but we can say that there
are certain capacities and so I
um I tend to have a bit more of a
hegelian kind of outlook on the subject
being
um open and in this openness has a
capacity for almost everything that um
what is human nature is that we make our
own nature and I've taken that from the
the German ideology
um sorry I keep my dog is really nice
Spencer Leonard is in the chat and he
says he asks a question is subjectivity
a trans-historical category or even
historically invariant in the capitalist
Epoch and what I'll um say is that maybe
we can come back to the question of
whether or not our subjectivity is
historically determined and whether or
not
um a lacanian approach of subjectivity
is trans-historical in a moment but
we've got Ben Burgess with his uh
massive uh background behind him I'm
going to actually give him the entirety
of the screen if I can just so we can we
can see that there's Ben Burgess
um and he's going to be talking to us
about this attack by Rock from Rock Hill
on Z Jack and I asked him at the last
moment we had a virtual beer last night
together uh and you know just two
lefties commiserating on the state of
the world
um and he's nice enough to say he come
on uh today so she Jack Burgess
welcome to uh the ablation magazine
stream
thanks Doug
so
um
we've all three read The Rock Hill piece
um what was your uh
thoughts about about the this recent
round of severe criticism of of uh uh
The Lovable solo Zizek
uh I mean I found it
really unconvincated we could certainly
get into the Weeds about some of the
specific criticisms in it but one
I remember when I first looked at it you
know what what I found
um probably just in the opening
paragraphs was that he's
bringing up all this stuff about
uh ji Jack saying you know Hitler wasn't
violent enough and things like that in
in this way that suggests that yeah it
doesn't know how
how Zizek writes or or a sort of decided
for whatever reason to act as if he
didn't know uh how he writes uh because
you know it's like look I mean obviously
the way you know if you've actually done
the reading you know that what he means
by violence is something like you know
forcibly imposing your your will on
others on the world and
uh and he's and so you know he says the
same breath that you know that that God
did to his credit was more violent than
Hitler he's not making the historical
claim that God to kill more people than
Hitler and it you know I think it'd be
one thing to say
uh you know like what and you know I
should say like what he's saying is God
did throwing off this deeply entrenched
regime of British colonialism was doing
more to sort of impose his will on the
way that the world had been before that
uh that that Hitler was murderously
defended this capitalist status quo but
like
I'd be told like if you just wanted to
write an article saying oh this is a
silly way to use word violence you
shouldn't use it this way or maybe even
you just shouldn't argue or present your
writing the way that she does like I
think any of those would be fair game as
critiques like fine write any of that
right but it's like
even at those early paragraphs The Rock
Hill essay just just sort of say like
like throwing off that quote and be like
oh my God can you believe he said that
and like wagged your finger a little bit
and you know moving on to the next
subject just you know strikes me as a
bad way to argue
right and what I thought was that it was
symptomatic you know that to use a
psychoanalytic maybe uh language of of a
larger problem
um on the left this is uh well I
actually what did you you read the piece
as well right the The Rock Hill yeah and
I was really I was also similarly struck
by the incredible stupidity of the
misreadings and like the willfulness
readings of that line and it's just so
characteristic of online politics to be
willfully stupid and then be really mad
you know like just like come at people
with your stupid misunderstanding but be
super confident in it I don't know what
that is it's like a characteristic of
online politics that if you come to it
out of something else you're shocked by
it at first because you think oh this
person is so confident they must have
something to say and then you're like oh
they don't and you don't you know you
know so like the the violence and then
I've even seen people defending that
line who've misunderstood it which is so
bizarre because it's uh you know mg Jack
has also defended himself against people
who've misread that line and who've said
you know it's a common critique of him
that
um he dresses up commonplace
observations
um with a a controversial kind of veneer
and therefore you know by saying
something shocking then he appears to be
saying something important when he's
really saying nothing you know like uh
oh uh Gandhi oh sorry Gandhi was more
violent than Hitler and Hitler wasn't
violent enough and that's just a way of
saying like
um Hitler made Gandhi made greater
changes no there's two different types
um forgive me even I'm making this
mistake because I read this book when I
was a PhD student in like 2009 I read it
alongside Lennon's State and Revolution
and I always understood it to making the
same argument essentially the same
argument of state and Revolution but
there's a certain amount of violence we
imagine violence to be an upheaval
um something that destroys the order or
or disturbs it in some way but what we
fail to understand is that there's a
certain amount of violence that upholds
the order that a a zero level violence
that upholds the exist at the appearance
of peace and in that sense
um there's a like a kind of
um a violence that Hitler was enacting
that was trying to keep things the same
it's not that he was trying to change
things so then if you're saying that
Hitler was trying to change things and
then you think that Zizek was saying he
wasn't violent enough it sounds like
he's saying well he should have been
more violent in order to change things
but he was saying precisely the opposite
he wasn't violent enough to keep things
the same whereas Gandhi through not
being physically violent was more
violent in the sense of actually
changing things but also these are two
different types of violence oh let's try
to remember things from a long time ago
um yes the objective and objective
violence right that's that's the uh the
phrase that he uses in that book
yeah yeah yeah but there's two other
ones but anyways but there's two
different types of balance as well but
anyway it isn't a simple line most
people do see violence as an upheaval
and in fact uh as a disturbance of the
social order and in fact the fact that
people misread that line so spectacular
they shows that we we take for granted
that
um that as long as there's an appearance
of Peace everything is fine
I just find that to be so disingenuous
and just so annoying yeah and as you say
it's it's very uh it's very typical of a
certain kind of way of of talking about
this stuff online really specifically
like like I I think of this
um
uh
you know Freddie Deboer wrote this essay
years ago called planet of cops where he
he talks about people keeping like you
know it's like carefully curated
portfolios of screenshots you know with
like whatever they think is most damage
about you know about everybody so they
can Trot it out you know later you know
when they uh they really need it you
know and a lot of and a lot of the
article felt felt like that to me it's
sort of like pouring through all this
material uh this this like huge massive
of material itself was put out over over
the decades that said uh like oh I got
him here's something right you know I
can include the file
it's and I think it's partially
professional jealousy or a kind of
syndrome of I'm sorry Young American
grad students and I say this I say this
because I was once a Canadian grad
student although I was studying abroad I
remember this hubris that I had I
remember I went and saw Chomsky speak
and uh considering myself a good Marxist
and let Chomsky very much and everybody
at the end gave him a standing ovation
and I didn't like you idiot like
okay I still to this day I don't like
John sound I'm not I like John Smith
he's fine but yeah I don't fall it's not
my area and I'm not sort of convinced by
these kinds of arguments but I recognize
this is good work it's a quite important
body of work that he has done in many
many areas obviously in linguistics as
well and I sat there like I was so good
you know because I'm gonna be the next
person because everybody every grad
student thinks that they're going to be
the next you know that's why you went
that's why you went into it because you
think there's something real brilliant
inside of you and it takes a long time
to kind of get shut down a few times you
have to get peer-reviewed a few times
before you lose that but that's what I
recognize that that kind of syndrome of
just like time-rich people who want to
um bring down who you know we would love
to kill our prophets in a way and I feel
like that's part of it just professional
jealousy
yeah I mean he does like
I don't I don't want to uh
uh I don't want to speculate too much
about what's going on inside this guy's
head uh you know but I I do I will say
you know what like whether or not that's
a factor in this case uh
you know this guy who I I know you know
I know very little about the author I
don't I don't really care about him I
just think he wrote a bad article but
like he uh but there is a kind of funny
thing in it where he he actually
recounts begging gizak to to write like
an introduction for uh for something uh
to uh but then like something he was
translated and then he's like yeah well
that sucked and you know and uh you know
it's like
well yeah you can't output like that
without like using some of your old
stuff and you need to as well like you
try to avoid repeating yourself and then
you get criticized like oh you didn't
mention this and like well I did in my
last book and then you go and write that
thing it's like oh well everything you
do is repetition to be fair like
obviously she's like is famous for
repeating itself quite a lot and I do
want to say too I don't want to be that
jerk that goes and writes off somebody
as well
um yeah I wasn't convinced by this
article and I see it as emblematic of a
lot of what's going on in terms of
dismissals of zazak but I'm sure this
person has a body of work that is
otherwise quite quite good Earth there
are probably hits the best Wells misses
but yeah I I I don't think so
um
uh uh it seems to me that um Rock Hill
is
um well I just immediately read him as
being a tanky
um and by that I mean somebody who
is trying to hold on to the notion that
the Soviet Union remained a viable
project for socialism to the end
um that uh that there were no failures
of the 20th century that were internal
to the Socialist project
that critiques of socialism
from
uh from other leftists others you know
marxists uh are really just attacks on
socialism from imperialists and you know
capitalist running dogs and so on and
um I don't know why this person
has those positions he doesn't defend
them or explicitly State them here but
he does but he does seem to assume them
I mean like I I
so the thing that I wrote about this the
uh
uh don't cancel Zia and the sub stack I
I did like I would pretty far into the
Weeds on some of this stuff but like
a couple of the parts like so a lot of
this is Rock Hill's going into to ggx
history as a dislavia and
uh like the you know I I think I think
most of that stuff is is actually pretty
misleading if you start to if you start
to follow his links and look at the some
of the context but like the light I
found the most amazing in the whole
article a lot of those lines was where
he says
uh like zizak like as a as a distance or
possibly as a politician a 1990 I don't
remember you know when he said the slide
but he quotes him saying that he wants
to abolish slovenia's political police
and and just to underscore why that's a
bad thing to want to do to abolish the
political police uh Rock Hill like puts
like socialist in Brackets you know it's
like oh okay well you know if it's a
socialist secret police then you know
why didn't you say so now now you know
like now sure obviously it should be
uncontroversial that's a good thing to
have
right I mean uh someone has said here uh
in the chat that
um Rock Hill does indeed have an amazing
body of work he's actually researched
the CIA files and you know if if there's
a book or a series of essays That Rock
Hill has written that summarizes the
activities of the CIA
um and you know as a as a con scoring
and journalists I'd be interested in
that but they're reading this a critique
of Zizek there seems to be some
underlying assumptions that just like
you said Ben that that you know if it's
a socialist secret police and they're
they're obviously on the side of freedom
and progress and uh if it's a western uh
figure then they're clearly
part of the conspiracy against Marx and
the in the working class and so on
um I'm not a big I'm not a big the cutic
guy but uh he did have some good lines
of her now to get and one of those is
the thing about how you know when you
beat the people with the stick they
don't like it much better when you call
it the people stick
right right
um I'm not a yeah I'm not on the side of
bakunin either but that's a good line
um yeah I mean the the the the he's also
I understand I haven't read but I
understand he's a Critic of the
Frankfurt School
in in the way when when I find out when
I hear that he's like um researched the
CIA and that he's a Critic of the
Frankfurt School I assume that he is
going to be one of those people who's
claiming that the entire Frankfort
school project was a product of some CIA
fund or you know it's a cut out uh from
the from the state from the U.S state
interested about that too right because
it's like look I'm not I'm not a
Frankfurt School
fad particularly I mean the kind of
criticisms that like Vivek chipper makes
of them but in the class Matrix you know
I'm pretty sympathetic to that but like
it is weird that this sort of like
group of it's you know
that yeah this this uh this this group
of like intellectual theorists who you
know we're like pretty depressed about
the political drift of their era and all
that stuff like have played quite so big
a role in so many different conspiracy
theories from so many different
directions
mm-hmm well I'd like to I want to have
Vivek on and one of the things about the
problem with this approach and we we're
in danger I think of reproducing it in a
way because I just you know I called him
a tanky and
we're talking about his assumptions is
that you avoid I just wanted to be on
the record that I was more careful I
know
um you avoid actually disowns all of uh
everything you say but yeah
(Laughter)
I stand by my dismissal
um but but uh yeah you avoid having the
serious engagement with the questions
that are in the background so for
instance when when it came comes to the
Soviet Union and whether or not you're
going to be a tanky or not
you know that should be based on an
understanding of what socialism uh aims
to become and what the historical record
is uh around the social struggle and um
you know and and
you know and what's possible today so
for example
one of the things that I think Gabriel
Rock Hill wants to land on is a critique
of zizek's policy or position regarding
the US involvement in the NATO
involvement in Ukraine
and
um
rather than
actually turning his abilities to
uh unspooling the history of Ukraine and
the history of NATO and what the
possibilities actually are there and
what the possibilities might be for some
sort of socialist engagement Around The
Invasion and in the region he is
content to uh just go after
um Zizek is and his character and as a
symptom of
or a tool of the uh capitalist class and
and the ruling ideology without even
really an
unpacking what that ruling ideology is
or what on which ways g-jack might be
said to be serving it um
so I would say that the big problem with
the counter punch uh article is not what
it says about Eugene but what it refuses
to engage with
Ashley do you want to jump in and and
criticize me again for being
to uh too provocative or too simple in
my approach to dismissal uh no we need
that um
um no I was actually just I just got a
text from theory plebe that um he missed
your link
um and so he's gonna try his very best
to drop in if he can for a few minutes
because he he didn't think that you
would uh being in touch with a bit of a
miscommunication as we said
um so did you see that I I emailed him a
link
yeah yeah so he had missed it uh anyway
so um he'll just he'll drop into the
best the best that he can for about five
ten minutes
um and I think that'll be really great
because
um I think one of the really interesting
aspects of this whole discussion is the
idea of subjectivity
um Rowling in the corner right now marks
is growling because he he desperately
wants me to pick him up but I said no
more because he keeps sniffing the
microphone he's mad at you know God he's
got so much you know by the way I called
my dog marks because as someone who
thinks of herself as a Orthodox Marxist
I thought it would be funny to call my
dog Marx you know to like you know make
sure that I don't put him too much on a
pedestal and I you know I found it funny
to tell Marx to go and poop somewhere
I see
anyways um yeah so I think it's the it's
the idea of subjectivity that's really
important to this that I think
um actually it was just on Twitter a
couple of days ago or maybe yesterday
where a friend of mine said one of the
biggest
um problems or wrong terms the left took
was in abandoning Hegel and this kind of
openness to subjectivity
um and uh and I and he said no there are
a lot of people who
are Marxist but just like have abandoned
Hegel have abandoned key Marxist ideas
and I said yeah in addition to that not
only have we rejected an enormous amount
of what I think our key ideas to Marxism
but also we've imbibed a thoroughly
psychologized subject and I think people
who come from a lacanian background
people who consider themselves don't
really like that but I'm a very
particular reason why I say that
um and and and that is that subjectivity
or like what it means to be human
constructions of what it means to be
human so I have more of a descriptive
way of understanding subjectivity it is
I'm interested in how we constructed the
stories that we tell about what make us
human about what are not the things that
are natural to us that characterize our
behaviors and how those then become
implicated in stories about social
problems so that's that's my interest
whereas if you have more of a
um
uh I don't know like an ontological
understanding of subjectivity of like
this is what it is you're not gonna like
that very much because you're always
gonna be like but actually the subject
is always you know striving for the
object but yeah you know like and I'm
like okay maybe
um but I I find that what winds up
happening is you can go down this path
of like agreeing with neoliberals with
the sort of neoliberal consensus that
things go wrong because of people's
uncontrolled desires
um and things go wrong because of
something wrong with us and I think you
don't need that one you don't need that
to explain crisis and two when you use
that to explain crisis you go outside of
the capitalist system and you say it's
something in humans well if it's
something in humans then there's no no
point in trying to overcome it because
it'll just be reproduced again
um if it's something within the
capitalist system
um and we it you know the way that we
are is a product of that then it can be
changed or if it's something that is
internal to the uh capitalist system it
is going to reproduce itself so long as
we have capitalism and I mean like
Crisis and that sort of thing sorry Ben
you wanted to jump in well let's just
wondering if those issue issues have to
go together right in other words like
um
you know it are the face of it it seems
like you could have some you know fixed
uh fixed human uh nature which you know
would be very unsurprising for you know
uh biological beings who you know have
have brains that have revolved in
certain ways and all that stuff
uh but for that also not to explain much
uh historically right in other words
like you know
okay sure let's say that like humans are
a certain way which I mean I don't know
I'm not even I'm not even sure your dog
would disagree all that stuff about the
species being right you know but like uh
but like there there's a certain way
that humans are but like also that's not
going to explain very much about why a
particular thing happens at a particular
time in history because you know humans
have existed throughout the whole thing
different things happen at different
times that their their crises or they're
not you know so so how much of it could
you know like like you might you know
you might think that it's like yeah
there are sort of like Baseline facts
about how people are and we're not going
to be that different you know under a
different Society but also that uh but
also that like specific historical
events happen at specific times can't
really like that's not gonna do much
heavy lifted and explaining why that
stuff happens
yeah I mean to a certain extent it does
in the sense that like at a certain
point nature stopped changing us and we
started changing nature I can hear John
bunch's voice in my head we don't change
nature but
yeah we I mean that's the only reason
why human beings still exist today
what's that of course which had Stitch
that's the only reason why human beings
still exist today you know um I say this
all the time but like in many ways as in
our physical bodies we are thus adapted
to Nature than other uh other animals
um but uh what has characterized human
evolution is this like look how the this
cranial vaulting that we've got here if
you look at an ape they don't have that
um that's been the characteristic change
over time is our brain so we have
changed we change nature and in so doing
you know we change ourselves uh and this
has been the sort of characteristic
thing
um there's a famous line in the German
ideology where Mark says humans can be
differentiated from animals in any in
any way you wish but they themselves
differentiate themselves when they begin
to make their own means of subsistence
when they begin to act on the world and
modify the world and when you make your
own
um mode of production or you make your
own means of subsistence when you act
upon the world in order to sustain
yourself you do something very very
different than animals do and people say
oh is that trans-historical that is yes
that is trans-historical this the fact
that it is an Everlast Everlasting
nature imposed condition that man must
work on the world and in so doing he
works on himself
um but through that trans-historical
process of working on the world we
change who we are as human beings this
is what I mean by this kind of openness
so yes there is a kind of underlying
biology obviously but there's an
underlying basis for language use
um for
um well the need to work on the world in
order to subsist because you know we're
going to die otherwise you can't like
what's that story of that guy who went
out into the Alaskan like out into
Alaska and he was like uh human beings
are always trying to use stuff I'm just
going to go out there I think it's the
name of things yeah and he learned
learned very very quickly this lesson
that is because we work on the world
that we survive
um yeah and so it does there is a
dialectic between all of these sorts of
things it's not like we've disappeared
one day but to what how people wind up
taking it is like oh well men have this
problem with women because on the
Savannah grasslands you know they start
developing these Just So Stories that
explains we were uh our ancestors were
more likely to survive because the bed
did pick up the laundry yeah uh I wanna
I wanna throw something up here from
Spencer Leonard okay go ahead do you
want to just say like like just as a
footnote I I have like I'm really like
like I really wish people would like I
kind of hate that word trans-historical
because it's like I think it sort of
sounds like there's a substantive
critique there where there's really not
right because you say oh would that be
trans historical it's like well yeah
maybe some things are some things are
you have to take it Case by case right
what's what's your sort of General
metaphysical principle that absolutely
nothing ever like doesn't vary between
like different types of the history or
boats of production or whatever like I
think you you know I I you know I think
some things are allowed to be
trans-historical but I'm sorry Doug yeah
yeah
um well I think we have to be very
careful when we when we talk about
things that are trans-historical
um I mean obviously there are scientific
facts which we
to the degree to which we think they're
true we think they are trans-historical
like but they're all but science
scientific theories are often revised
but if we believe that germ theory about
disease is true then that is making a
trans-historical claim about disease
right but then there's other political
questions like what's the best way for
us to self-organize and what are the
assumptions that people have around what
Society should look like
um and those things tend to be
historical well those are very different
there's two questions that you just you
just listed are very different questions
from each other right because
uh so the first one you said is what's
the best way for for society organized
right that's an a normative question
then the other one was uh what do people
think is the best something something no
no what's what are the underlying
assumptions that help them okay for
inform people about what Society should
look like that's a that's a question I
think both of those I would claim
without arguing for it that both of
those no I can't argue for it but but
the both of those are historical
it's what should happen right and then
the second one was the psychological
question it's like what assumptions are
people making right that's and those are
two those are two very different
questions and you know you can you can
have transhistorical accounts of both is
my point you can have a trans-historical
account of what should happen you can
say well we should align ourselves with
nature we should align ourselves with
God we should reach this ideal which is
trans-historical and and so and I'm
saying we would be should be wary of
those kinds of transistors when we make
that trans-historical move especially
around prescriptive projects that are
well I mean like critical I mean I think
that you could
I mean maybe we're very way off topic
here but I think that uh the
I think that people often I worry
conflate two different things one of
which is
uh what you want to happen and that is
the other is how much of that you can
make happen given historical
circumstances that are not of our own
choosing so like uh so like in like the
critique of the Gotham program what Marx
is talking about
uh the you know the lower and higher
phases of communist Society he uh he
uses
um
you know there's this there's this line
that he has about how right could never
be higher than you know the social
conditions that give right to it which
which is often sort of uh quoted as if
it were a uh a way of saying that the
that like oh it's it's all just sort of
like what's what's even desirable is
just sort of relative to a bunch of
historically conditioned things there's
no trans-historical standard but like
the played meaning of it is exactly the
opposite of that right because if you're
saved uh right can't be higher than that
right you're suggesting a scale of
higher and lower right that's uh that
that's that you're going to be able to
step outside of all of this and evaluate
Things based on right that that the that
even though you know the higher phase of
Communism is impossible in society yes
it's just you know emerge from
capitalism but still more desirable it's
higher
right yeah it's a tricky um move there
uh that Marx makes I do think that he uh
so I'll give you an example of the kind
of
um normative aim that we might have
right that I think is historical
um and that at the same time I want to
hold on to as being a a part of the
spectrum of or hierarchical progression
right so
um and so the question is can we make it
can I come up with an abstraction that
would be historical that would that that
this would be an instantiation a
particular instantiation of maybe but um
uh so a lot we have the aim of
increasing our longevity on longevity
and and healthy lifespans that's for
everybody
um I think that is an historical

determined or you know arrived on the
scene historically I don't believe that
increasing the masses longevity has
always been a social aim
um can I just jump in with something
that Spencer said in the comments
um Spencer says is the question of the
best way for society to be organized a
normative question and I was about to
say no it's a question that is thrown up
by history and then he answered
uh oops sorry one more down here or
isn't a question of what tasks of
mankind actually imposed upon themselves
it is literally a normative question
we're asking what's best right that's a
that's a question about about what you
know about value
um you could say I mean you could say
the question has been thrown up by
history but I'm not sure how clarified
that is like that that's uh well well
because we're solving a problem right
like man never sets himself the very
fact that we're even having this
discussion is because the possibility
has become open to us sure totally
that's a separate question right like
whether the possibility has become open
to us of doing something and whether you
know that thing should be done right
whether it's a desirable goal or our
separate questions I mean that's the you
know that was the point of that example
about the about communism that they that
like uh that you know Marx's claim there
is that uh the you know the more
desirable thing is not historically open
to you as you come right out of
capitalism you know that you so you have
to do this you know somewhat less
desirable thing first you know if this
lower phase of copy to society and then
when it comes open to you you could
progress but I mean all this talk of
like right being higher or you know the
uh or lower higher phases or anything
like that
you know like
only makes Ned we could ask ourselves
you know how should we go about
eliminating every man woman and child on
earth and the conditions of possibility
might be such that originally we could
only do it very slowly with machetes
over a long period of time or that they
could open up so that we could use
nuclear weapons uh to wipe them all out
and but
um you know the quote the the question
would remain the problem you know of
wiping out every man woman and child on
the planet
um may not be a problem we want to solve
right there's a normative component
component to uh the the aim
um uh so you know but but the conditions
of possibility change historically yeah
I think that the chat the chat we just
saw the screen from Scott
is is make it exactly the right
distinction that you know that the
context the question is you know is it
the same as what kind of question it is
right
um
but but the girl that I phrased it last
week was um like you can do a bunch of
calculations to determine whether or not
an asteroid is going to hit you and yes
it is a normative Quest you know it is
normative to say I would prefer that the
asteroid doesn't hit us right the point
it's I I guess the the issue that I have
is like for people like oh it's it's
it's a normative thing it's like oh well
if we don't solve this problem or like
come to realize what it is we're making
in the world and become conscious of it
and control it then everything just
carries on exactly as it is no it's it's
it's like Socialism or barbarism right
it's
we figure it out to figure out the the
catastrophe that we use an area you
could prefer barbarism a bit that is
more or less I guess the theatrical
capitalist position right you know take
barbarism over uh over socialism is your
goal but yeah I'm sure there would be
groups in society that were like no let
the asteroid hit us sure
some uh a friend of uh sublation
um mentioned uh and chided uh uh us and
me I think particularly for forgetting
my con Kant had
um overcome the ought is distinction
according to Daniel
um but I don't think I would agree with
that no well but what can't I think did
was demonstrate that uh the there can be
no normative standard without the
conditions of possibility for that
normative standard to arise that doesn't
mean that there's no distinction between
the conditions of possibility and the
normative standard but rather the the
one relies upon the other I I would I
would have yeah I mean sure Auto Plus
can uh that's that's that's fair enough
right like it's right that's that's what
that's what Kant would point to that if
you yeah you can't you can't have a
normative standard like we ought to hold
our breath and continue to live for a
thousand years that's not a a normative
standard that you you that makes sense
of standard to exist it has to be
possible right right yeah so which is
another way I mean Mark to put that as
you know mankind does not challenge
himself with a task that he doesn't
already have the capacity to over or a
problem that he doesn't know they have
no capacity to overcome
um that's a that's kantian in that sense
uh but um but I do think it's worth
again going back to how much of the
problems
that are social
um are conceived if it's being
transhistorical or being uh and and
really they uh um
are so conditioned by what is that they
they can't actually be
trans-historical like for instance the
question of maximizing longevity that
could only really arise once um uh
certain Innovations in uh medicine
um and mass and the creation of uh I
think really could only arise after the
creation of a working class where we had
people who had at least technically
legally equal value in which case you
know increasing their longevity
uh and the life in the abstract itself
was of value and therefore increasing
longevity of every person would be a
valuable thing it Rose after hedonism
you know as an ethical system or around
the same time maybe maybe not an
historian and so I'm not making a claim
about literal chronology here but but I
just would say that understanding the
way in which our normative
aims are conditioned uh historically and
that also means materially because you
mean by conditioned historically is that
you have to have certain historical
circumstances in place
for that to be you know an aim that
anybody would worry about in either the
sense that uh you know I mean you I
guess in that example part of it was
that like you know the majority of the
population you know nobody would think
that was a you know worthwhile project
or maybe the you know maybe like you
know the slaves themselves would think
that living longer is a worthwhile
project but nobody was asking them or uh
but like certainly that it's
historically conditioned in the sense
that you need certain historical
conditions to be in place
for there to be enough of a possibility
of achieving it to like for it right
worth bothering with the question if
that's all you mean by historically
conditioned then yeah I agree I mean I
think it it goes a little bit beyond
that I think that the the larger claim
would be that to even conceive of the
question requires the conditions of
possibility
so yeah although that's going to be true
for lots of like you know you gave the
example of science earlier uh like there
are lots of scientific claims that
presumably we all agree have always been
true right but like it's only asserted
very specific points in time that people
could conceive of them
right I guess the the question is to
what degree are normative uh or
political questions always historical
and you know a matter of human
understanding as opposed to something
outside of human
uh understanding and and and if you
um so like I can imagine that germs are
in some fundamental way outside of human
understanding whereas uh what people all
together should aim at achieving in what
is held up as the highest value yeah um
might not be
um yeah I mean I would want to separate
those questions you know because you
said like whether it's historical I
think those two things are connected
because if you hold something to be the
highest value what is considered to be
the psychological preconditions and
that's going to inform what everyone
should aim at and we've already said
like you know material conditions uh or
the historical condition well I mean
there are historical conditions that you
know determine whether you can conceive
of you know lots of things I mean they
have a whether that's like in some sense
what makes it right that I think is a
different question and you know and I
don't think you have to say that there's
like
metaphysically stuff you know like Abe's
hanging for the sky or whatever you
could have a more grounded you know view
of it than that but like it's still not
clear to me what sense it would be true
that it's like the the thing itself
being desirable as opposed to possible
is a is a product of uh historical
conditions so the philosophy professor
and the philosophy undergrad have delved
into dived into the philosophical
conversation and I'll let the uh
as a sociologist I just when this
happens I just go to um
because I'm always thinking like well
what does this do like what does this
mean in the world when people actually
try to solve problems
um but anyway
um I think we should kind of bring it
back to our our original original kind
of critique oh okay fine our discussion
which is um one of the questions that I
wanted to ask is is part of the
rejection of capitalism well part of the
not capitalism freudians lit uh is part
of the rejection of Zizek at the moment
that he is just a shill for capitalism
that he is a liberal in communist
clothes
um and I wondered I've noticed this a
lot that at least in online politics
there's this sense that there's nothing
worse oh hello we'll have to come back
to that question and David said that he
wanted to drop in and uh and let us know
where are you
can you are you going into the woods
Dave are you uh gonna give up on
civilization and then
well after this experience perhaps you
know maybe
um
am I able to turn the camera around so I
can actually show you where I'm at or do
I have to do it oh yeah yeah I can see
it I can see oh look you're not out in
the woods
you're at Disneyland
this is the Millennium Falcon right here
so I I just I just got off of the
Smugglers Run ride here and uh
I'm I'm doing I'm doing my my
beaucheryard research you see uh oh yeah
yeah because Bojo talked about
Disneyland and so I had to come and
verify for myself if it's true
um but thank you thank you for bringing
me on is this the tail end of the stream
did I miss everything basically no no no
we're we've got a few more minutes I
wanted to ask you what your
um you I caught wind just through rumors
not really directly that that uh the
theory underground were critical of
sublation's understanding of
subjectivity and that we were not
projecting enough we were not good
Defenders of zuzak
um and I I was it deviated from the true
path by mentioning Freud yeah yeah 100
you did a really good job so far yeah so
have you have you have you owned up to
the error of your your ways or I I need
to be I need you to explain to me what I
said uh what so first of all are you
anti-jackabee do you like have a uh is
Jacobi anti-g Jack is there a battle
going on that I'm not aware of and then
and secondly um so what did I what what
did I say that Freud claimed that um
would be in opposition to Lacon or g-jek
for sure so uh and I have to say one
thing up front and that is that I am the
least
uh I'm the I I'm the babiestian of the
of the youngs and uh when I coined the
term for the group uh that includes
Michael Downs Nick and Andrew
there was tongue-in-cheek playing off of
The Young hegelian's idea because Marx
was one of the young hegelians early on
and so but you know I've been learning
and lacan from Michael down to the
dangerous maybe blog and so what I
understand when it comes to Jacobi or
Jacoby when you brought him up
um I had a red him uh someone someone
gifted me one of his books a while back
and I've been meaning to read it he's a
good defender of psychoanalysis I
understand but it's a Freudian
psychoanalysis not a lacanian
psychoanalysis and silicon brings Freud
into the 20th 20th and 21st century well
Jesus brings it into the 21st century
but
the what I understand that you said
about subjectivity is that
basically it's like The Reptilian you
know the drive is basically The
Reptilian Brain and the the that this is
uh the reason that so many people go to
theories about uh uh psychoanalytic
theories of subjectivity is basically
for a kind of determinism
um that we don't really have control
over our actions our choices or social
change
my understanding through Mikey and so
this is all kind of secondhand because
I'm just learning it but my
understanding is that no that that what
Lacon does as a sort of intervention
um is point out that Freud had been
famously mistranslated and misunderstood
because they translated the word uh for
drive and the word for instinct which
are two separate words they interpreted
those two words uh the same into into
American English and so the instinct is
is not the same thing as drive drive is
counter to Instinct Drive is what makes
us different from animals and it's also
what makes us free as subjects and then
the main point is that subjectivity is
not in any way synonymous with identity
in fact it's like the opposite of
identity in lacanian psychoanalysis I've
talked to Ashley a little bit about this
one-on-one she's coming from and I hope
I'm saying this right but I think you're
coming you're understanding or the way
that you use the term subject is more
from your fukodean days
but in the lacanian tradition the
subject is all of the it's that it's
that stuff that escapes identification
it's it's what escapes interpolation and
so for altuser we are reducible to how
we are interpolated within the bigger
mechanisms of capital and class but for
uh the lacanian theory of subjectivity
it's no the this this is the negativity
that cannot be reduced into or cannot be
fully controlled by the mechanisms of
capital or class right and so it's uh
it's a it's the space that creates that
uh the the wiggle room for freedom and
autonomy
is
can I wanna I wanna respond in two ways
first of all
um uh I I uh Russell Jacoby uh maybe
it's how I should say his name not
Jacoby
um is uh uh not claiming that human
beings are
trans-historically limited to reactive
being reactive machines relying on and
dictated to by their lizard brain which
is the source of the unconscious
but rather I was quoting uh you said
Jacoby's not doing that he's not doing
that rather the part of Jacoby I was
referring to was the part where he was
saying those ego psychologists and um uh
optimists liberal progressives like
um oh I think is well I think rank was
one of the ones that he would point to
oh Brown I think is another
um uh even Reich uh maybe uh are missing
the radical component of Freud's
pessimistic critique
which is to say that the individual uh
enlightened subject that uh the ego
psychologists say wanted to uh
speak to and help to reinforce had not
yet been achieved because the social
changes
um required for it the Revolutionary
changes required to really create an
enlightened Bourgeois subject hadn't yet
to be achieved and so in the present
moment we are buffeted around by uh
material forces and react like animals
and that that's something that needs to
be acceptable
against uh
what he conceived to be as sort of
soft liberal uh critics who were too
optimistic and and therefore not radical
um and and uh whether or not so I I have
no real
uh position on whether the drives are
biologically determined or kind of
saying determined by the structure of
language as lacan would say
um
go ahead and like he's dealing
with people
oh
okay wait I had a second thing I wanted
to do you're breaking up would you go to
the Millennium Falcon and find Mickey
Mouse along your way and get Mickey
Mouse to drive the Millennium Falcon can
I'd love to see Mickey Mouse inside the
Millennium Falcon is Mickey Mouse around
and can you get him to go into the
Millennium Falcon for us
I haven't found Mickey yet I haven't
found Mickey everyone's everyone's gonna
think that when I was saying Mikey
earlier that I was talking about Mickey
no I'm talking about Michael does but uh
there is an R2D2 rolling around
somewhere and I was hoping to find him
so if he comes by I'll make sure to
intercept but uh so really quick am I
back fully can you hear me yeah you're
back I can hear you now yeah
I tried to go to a quieter area but it
was probably out of the reach of the
Wi-Fi so I had to come back to the
louder area but basically if I so what
you're saying is that what Jacoby's
dealing with and I don't know if it's
Jacoby or Jacoby I have no idea but uh
what he's dealing with is uh people who
think oh well we can just rap you know
we can just reason with people and
they'll come to see what is in their
interests and uh he's trying to say no
it's a lot more complicated than that is
that that's what you're saying yeah I
mean he was the he the book is called
um uh social Amnesia it is a critique of
the way psychoanalysis has been
repressed here's another book called The
repression of psychoanalysis and the the
line that's the book someone gifted me
yeah yeah and um and I'm I picked it up
this morning actually uh because I
thought I might be talking to you and I
didn't know I might be talking to you
and Mickey Mouse but um uh what what uh
uh yeah the point is he's not some naive
Freudian I don't know to what degree his
understanding of Freud is complete or
correct but his but the pipe the part of
it I really liked was the part where he
said we need to accept our conditions as
not yet free individuals uh and that the
that you know understanding our what the
ways in which our Consciousness is
repressed the ways in which we are
determined is necessary if we are to
become free
um and that doesn't so uh that and
understanding that uh is not uh this is
just a matter of like reading the right
documents or getting all the right data
but you know
according to uh Jacoby or Jacoby and and
and Lacon I think and Freud a a process
of
um you know a facing both both
emotionally and intellectually uh uh are
through you know some sort of
psychoanalytic
process uh the conditions of our own
self-repression and repression by
Society
um
well
so I want to read the book and then come
back and talk about it more hopefully
yeah we should for sure but I just want
you to know like I I don't consider
myself to be some uh you know dedicated
Freudian on our war path against lacan
um uh
well to me to me that felt like the the
real issue is that you've not I don't
think you've had Jacoby on your streams
but you've had McGowan on your streams a
few times and you've published him yet
the version of subjectivity you're going
for is this more neo-fertian as opposed
to a lakini and mcgowanite approach and
it's just I just want people to know
those two things cannot be conflated
they're very different
more disciplined in the future and not
just quote things that I happen to be
reading on the stream I'll I'll make
sure I only you're better
books that we've published oh my God
watch out you've got the Imperial
Stormtroopers or after you Dave
I'll send these guys after you Doug
why am I so jealous right now like
it's like you're living the life right
now

yelling about theory on their phones
I drive on the point about
100
so can you all hear me right now am I am
I is the lagging
you're lagging no you're lagging okay
the main thing is let's
dang it okay well look if if we can't
talk about it now then I have to come
back later and we'll talk about the
difference between pleasure and
enjoyment in the sense the likenis use
it because Julie Sons ties into drive
and death drive and all that and that's
what has to be understood it's not that
we're not free
it's not that we're fully over
determined by all of these forces and
everything but it is that without
understanding the difference between
between drive and pleasure really we
can't deconstruct how we've taken the
Pleasure Principle for granted and uh I
understand that you were saying Ashley
that
this approach to subjectivity the
lacanian one can be appropriated or
co-opted by neoliberalism or
accidentally overlap with it
yeah well for sure I I guess I would
have to think a lot more about that but
for right now I would just say that uh
I anything can be co-opted if if
something works or if there's any truth
to it if there's any use value to it
then it's co-optable by Capital right
it's probably going to be co-optable but
the question is is there a kernel here
that we need to take seriously and for
me the Revolutionary aspect of learning
all of this over the last couple of
years has been to start seeing the
juices in situations like for instance
um thank you
getting all worked up in angry online
and and saying things that you regret
later
that I can catch myself in the act of
that half the time now and pull out
because I'm seeing Oh my God I I you
know I've rationalized why I'm doing
this I think that it's for some better
reason I think that I'm trying to
restore some balance to the force or
whatever the but in reality I'm
getting enjoyment from it I'm not
getting pleasure but I'm getting this
jewy sons from it and that's my and you
people end up in the grip of death drive
all the time and so and we rationalize
it but the point is to see to try to
start plotting those patterns in oneself
or in the case of social change how does
how do things like Julie sons from Lacon
or raison from Nietzsche how do these
things factor into organizing spaces and
and and uh and the broader left right
how does how do
I I do you live near Disneyland
no no
damn no remember I want I want to come
up I also have Theory work I need to do
on build yard and I think you and I
should go to Disneyland together
sometime I I now have found a reason to
go to Disneyland professionally and um
we should make a film there together
that I think would be great
um so uh we'll we'll have to plan that
um
definitely on the last question that you
said I'd love to talk about that more
because
to chat again
I want to do that let me make two plugs
really quick uh so the the first one is
for an article that just came out on the
dangerous maybe blog and it's it's
called jewisons in the workspace Jesus
could work okay so Michael Downs put uh
this post out that uses his personal
experiences in different kinds of
workspaces and he talks about how
jewisons is functioning in these various
Dynamics and it's a funny funny piece
because it's really about how
Politically Incorrect regular working
class people tend to be and the kind of
enjoyment people are kind of reveling in
and his point is not oh that's bad it
needs to be stamped out but mainly if
you're some PMC organizer who doesn't
understand how workers get their
julissons in the regular workplace
you're going to come in there and think
everyone's evil you're going to come in
there and think everybody's like racist
or whatever but you're just not
understanding
how blue-collar people get their Jewish
songs and and how there's a sense of
solidarity and camaraderie that comes
with that so read that and uh the other
thing is every day on my channel Yuri
underground there's been a new video 20
to 30 minutes long of Mikey teaching me
all of his theory stuff and so we're
getting through the intro to look on
stuff and I'm doing it in bite-sized
chunks so that it's not overwhelming and
then the the introdigic stuff will start
coming out on like the 25th of this
month so stay tuned for that stuff and I
hope to come back and talk more with you
all in the future
by the way hi Ben
yes
all right all right guys
um thank you Ben thank you Dave uh thank
you all for watching thank you Ashley uh
I'm gonna log us out here wait wait wait
wait
we now have the uh the patreon and all
right are you able to join us for the
patreon because uh yeah I'd love I'd
love to this is I I was so frustrated
because because you just started to say
what sounded like the most interesting
thing to me the whole discussion which
was about liberalism and I really and I
really wanted to
pursue that and uh in our whole our
whole previous discussion Dave
um that we had kind of got off uh maybe
off track a little bit and I wanted to
bring it back to some of the critiques
of zizak and one of them was that um
jijak is just a liberal and communist
guys and uh absolutely definitely want
to talk about that so I'll post a link
to the patreon
um uh as a comment on this video uh and
uh you know sign up there to get access
to that and um Dave if you want to stick
around on the stream in the patreon
you're welcome to as well but for now
I'm going to um sign us off here so here
we go
