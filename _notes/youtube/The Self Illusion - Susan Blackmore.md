Transcript:
(00:00) let me turn to the self because that's what I'm supposed to be talking about I would say the self as an illusion what do I mean by illusion I don't mean and and like Dan Dennett and other people who are interested in illusions you get accused of saying it doesn't exist the Buddha had this trouble didn't he to some people he would say of course the self exists and to all the people he's saying there's no self I think the point about this is it's not that there is or isn't the self is that the self is not
(00:30) what we think so look it up in the dictionary which is what I did when I started to get into trouble with this concept illusion in the dictionary is usually defined as something like something that is not what it seems to be something that we're deluded about its nature so I would like to ask you now just for a moment to be conscious and see what is it like to be me now right does it seem a bit like this well I know that you know that there isn't an armchair in your head that you're sitting in but I suggest many of you
(01:15) will have have dropped out of this feeling but you can probably drop back into it most people in the world I think do feel something like this it's very natural it seems to be the way the way we're built that we feel as oh there's my foot that's my foot that's my knee that's my tummy and I'm in here looking at that when I look they said I'm up here and I'm looking at my foot and I'm over here and you're out there that's a kind of natural way that we feel about ourselves
(01:40) but of course it's rubbish there is not only no armchair but there isn't any place in the brain this is what Dan Dennett calls the Cartesian theatre is this luring place that we kind of invent we may give up Cartesian dualism we may be absolutely sure that there isn't mind stuff and physical stuff or matter and consciousness we say where Manas but actually we still believe in a kind of experiencing self the experiencer and the experience and according to him and I would agree this is just it doesn't
(02:12) fit with what we know about how the brain works at all so that's why he says that when you discard Cartesian dualism as almost everybody does you must really discard the show that would have gone on in the Cartesian theater and the audience as well now people often throw out the audience or they think they do but it kind of creeps back it's even harder to throw out the show the feeling that I am having a stream of experiences is so compelling that we keep getting back into it but it makes no sense at all in terms of what's
(02:42) going on in the brain when you look at the visual cortex here at the back of your brain which is a good proportion of your brain vision is very important in humans you find there's something like 40 parallel pathways going on there some meet up again and separate out others don't different information beings you know going through the ventral stream and the dorsal stream and doing different jobs and they never come together into some kind of place where the picture is that you see in the world because you don't
(03:07) actually see a picture in the world we're kind of compelling this this feeling that oh I can see the whole room when you actually am that's another whole story in which I often talk about and written about but to do with change blindness inattentional blindness and so on we can show that there is no there isn't that kind of a representation there isn't anywhere in the brain where the show happens this just shows going on all over the place lots and lots and lots of parallel rows and what about the
(03:34) self who might be experiencing them well there's no middle mm you know it's the brain is not organized in such a way that stuff comes in and ends up somewhere and then orders go out not at all there's stuff going through here I mean the fact that I'm not going to crash into this is all happening very very fast through the event through the dorsal stream straight to motor cortex from eyes without going through the other part in the ventral stream which does all the perception and decides oh it's flowers that happens more slowly
(04:03) they don't come together these things they're separate separate I know that's kind of weird but it's important to know that because it helps to kind of throw apart intellectually intellectually throw apart the idea that there's me in inside here doing it and and and give rise therefore to understanding a little bit about what it might mean to say that I am an illusion or the self as an illusion it feels this way but it really isn't it feels I submit but I'm please argue for many of you it may not feel
(04:36) this way with an audience like this of people who've generally done a lot of meditation mindfulness you know exploration Oh Here I am seems to be me seems to be one me one me in charge of this body unified continuous it seems to be well it doesn't anymore actually but it used to seem to be that it was me a few minutes ago and before that it was me and the little girl and so on that there was something continuous about the Me's generated by this brain and this body it seems to be that there's a me having a
(05:11) stream of experiences and it seems to be that I have some effect on my body I can say I can raise my hand haha and I did it now there's plenty of psychological evidence needing stuff that's just an illusion we have thoughts no really really I mean libbets work is just the start we have thoughts there about an action say the action happens there's a correlation there in that order we jump to the conclusion that one cause the other but we can tell from what's going on in the brain that it isn't like that
(05:46) at all indeed we know so much now about the mechanisms of self control of decision-making of choices and so on and where they're happening in frontal cortex prefrontal cortex and so on again distributed and so on that the idea of there being and me who initiates actions is just bonkers but but it still feels that way okay the science I think is therefore very helpful because it goes on bang you know not in there there's just this stuff you know doing something whatever it is and we don't even know
(06:19) fundamentally what it is so I mean I've said that already there's nowhere in there where it all comes together there's just all this massive parallel processing going on causing this body to these words to come out and this body not to crash into the pretty flowers so let's take a different tack let's say are you going to come do something to me again later let's say I sit in meditation and look for myself or I could do Douglas Harding kind of thing couldn't I I look for the person who's looking and what do I find
(07:12) I find the world I can't go round and round I don't find myself as I thought it was I don't find a consistent experience of the experiences I find help I don't know instead I want to tell you a little bit about some simple explorations I warm one particular exploration actually and then I'll kind of wind up with some with explaining why I called the doc what I did call it years ago I used to teach a consciousness course in Bristol I did it for about ten years and it resulted in the textbook that I wrote about
(08:01) consciousness and I don't know how I got into it but it happened very early on probably then the first year that I started to get the students to ask a question every week they had to ask it hundreds of times as many times as they could every day it's amazingly difficult to get them to do it and they'd all come so I forgot and then they put stickers on the kettle and stickers on the door and brought each other in pairs to make them remember and all kinds of tricks still hard I don't know why it's so hard
(08:25) it is by the way are you conscious now well of course I love the ones who say of course that's confidence I also like the ones shaking their heads I don't like the people you don't say anything are you conscious now great we love a lovely mixture of yes/no and now there's a very very interesting thing about this question this is question number one in week number one of this 20 week course are you conscious now you've just walked in are you conscious now doesn't know the odd thing about this
(09:09) question is I know there were some of you saying no and there are various interesting reasons why you might be saying no but but normally basically if you ask am i conscious now the answer is always yes did any of you get the odd sensation when I asked you are you can't just now I've sort of kind of become yeah it's like oh you're becoming conscious because I've asked you yeah something like that now this can be very puzzling because you think to yourself well of course I was conscious before but but then
(09:42) something happened that was different what changed it felt like I was becoming conscious but does that mean I wasn't conscious before it's a very odd thing not all of you will have had it but perhaps if I tapped you on the back later on and you're not being very mindful you what was I can't just before so this took me to my next question this by the way um I I wrote a book about this which was originally called tenzen questions and then and then they decided to bring the paper back out and change the title which is really
(10:14) irritating so don't go and buy both books because they're the same and it really annoys me but it's a much more trendy title isn't it then in the art of consciousness anyway that that that peculiar thing that you experience then a few other people did led me to the second question what was I conscious of a moment ago I would like you would all to ask yourself that question now what was i conscious of a moment ago now I don't know if this works for any of you it took me a long time for this to
(10:49) stabilize and I mean a long time when I was writing this book some of the chapters are based on Cohen retreats you know with other people in you know organized Quran retreats most of them are based on the solitary retreats which I did on my own either up in the Welsh mountains or at home and I would ask the same question hour after hour day after day based in simple Zen meditation as I then calm the mind for quite a while and just let the question come when it comes what was I conscious of a moment ago okay I've just done it now now the
(11:25) obvious thought would be I was conscious of the words coming out of my mouth because surely I must have been thinking about them because giving a lecture you know it's quite you need a bit of attention but I can hear that humming noise over there as though somebody's been listening and I was sort of faintly aware of a man nodding over there I'd forgot I wouldn't have you know if I hadn't asked myself the question I would have that would have gone but it sort of feels as though well there was somebody
(11:53) listening to that noise over there but it wasn't me because I was concentrating on what I was saying when I was doing this out in the in the wilds of the mountains I would get this sense or no was more interesting when I was doing it at home have a meditation hut in the garden and because I was what are you conscious of what was I conscious of a moment ago and multiple parallel threads would be obvious I hadn't even noticed because I'm just sitting there's a great drilling going on in the road but when I
(12:25) asked that question it's as though somebody was listening to the drilling who was it somebody ah somebody was aware of that my bottom sitting on the cushion and the cat the cat's been purring for ages in fact I kind of remember the cat turning up and curling up next to me all of these things when I look backwards so what's going on now this is where that's the experience okay but I'm now jumping to an intellectual interpretation of the experience that might be wrong it's always dangerous to do that but my
(12:55) interpretation I tried inventing this little graphic this morning which doesn't quite do it justice but what I'm thinking is something like this most of the time most of our lives most of the time what's happening is what you'd expect in a complex brain in a complex body in a complex world there's multiple parallel streams going along and none of them is in consciousness or out of consciousness none of them is what I am experiencing or I'm not experiencing they're all just going along some bigger
(13:28) than others and that's what these lines are some are ephemeral very shortly some are rather longer some may be there ourselves maybe this one there's a kind of a bit of a self construct going along and we know where these self constructs are made in them in the temporary prattle Junction is the the body image made so we can even track those things if we wanted to um but what I'm suggesting is there might even be two in parallel there might be several in parallel the coming and going shifting uh but then dead are you asked the
(13:55) question am i conscious now or any question you like that that propels you into mindfulness um and then what happens all the rest can mover they're all brought together and you go oh here I am and that's fine but you make the mistake this is where the delusion comes about of going and I was conscious before and I've been conscious all day somebody mentioned that an Electra this morning just with utter confidence and well I've been conscious all the time I submit that you haven't and every time
(14:27) this happens which will be many many times a day if you're practicing something like mindfulness and falling out of mindfulness then if you're mindful it all the time then you're staying like this then if you keep popping back into it you think it's the same self or at least that's the delusionary way of thinking about it mindfulness is very interesting because I suspect it in the beginning what happens in mindfulness is to bring up itself I am being mindful and that's that transition there and you can keep
(15:02) the self for a long time with practice of mindfulness but I think what happens later on in mindfulness practices of the self drops out and we and possibly awareness can remain of this parallel state in which there isn't a self and then one he's seeing clearly only there isn't a self to see clearly rather there is just experiences without an experience but that's really um another issue so what happened in the last half an hour or so there was a me because I could be got quite nervous because there
(15:35) was a problem with wires there's a full away there's another one and then there's another one and then there's a whole tracted gap with a whole lot of things gone oh and Here I am again ah but I'm not this thing here is not conned into thinking it's the same me partly because of the science and partly because of the personal inquiry I say that wasn't the same me and looking forward into the future it won't be the same me either in a few minutes I'll be oh no in a few minutes I'll be answering your questions
(16:15) I hope and should of me pop up in a sensation of I'm over here and you're over there and I'm going to answer the questions that will be a new me she won't be me this one how do we live with this if it's true it may not be now I really like this is my kind of scientist nature coming out yeah have an idea have a hypothesis we'll go and test it right okay I'll go and live my life like this and see how how it works out and what happens and if I'm wrong someone can prove me wrong and I'll change your mind
(16:46) do something else equally daft maybe but how do we live with this one little trick I've discovered and I would love to hear from other people if any of you have been doing anything similar is this it is I'm gonna just discuss three things about it it's learning to let go of her this is very tricky because well as long as I feel that this is me I want to carry on and there's another interesting intellectual question why why do cells want to carry on why they so greedy to to exist and where they are so a
(17:27) practice that I've been doing is whenever there's a feeling of Here I am am i conscious now yes Here I am um I think and willing to not be in any way it's only like going to sleep at night isn't it I mean you know you lie down you think I'm going to stop existing until the morning and you sort of that's kind of why I don't sleep is such a weird thing but it's sort of the same going to sleep while awake or disappearing dying if you like just ah she's allowed to go and importantly and similar to in
(18:00) meditation the dealing with thoughts it's not go away it's not oh here I am go away no no I'll go away at some point letting her go away that's I think quite helpful it's also part of this kind of comparison between before and after the question the unified mindful state of being me experiencing stuff and the kind of nor normal everyday parallel processing distracted state looking back into that it reminds me of one of my favorite quotes from William James who who is my great great hero he tried a lot of
(18:39) interest introspection and he said introspection of this kind he's like trying to turn up the gas quickly enough to see how the darkness looks of course you have electricity now it would be it would be much quicker wouldn't exchange and you can't look into the darkness by shining the light was that any time left or stopped now Oh brilliant thank you um so this is an attempt if you like to look into the darkness but I can't look into the darkness but by letting myself go as it were her whoever she is this one who
(19:14) appears then maybe the darkness can can become light so that's one little trick but one might reasonably have a question about I called it morality but I'm not sure I couldn't think of a better word but if she won't be me then why should I care I mean if it's not going to be me in the future who's going to suffer the pain or the joy or the whatever it is then then why should I care about what happens why should I do anything why should I act now I think many of you would say well you don't actually and I
(19:46) agree one doesn't it's not me who acts neither scientifically nor experience me actions happen or to quote another Buddhist thing actions exist and also their consequences but the person that acts does not but then why should I care what I think the reason I you know concerned about this really because why do I care about her this afternoon if she's not me well she's kind of similar to me and we'll have similar memories and similar tendencies to behave because after all she's going to
(20:21) be constructed an illusion constructed by this body maybe that's the reason but I think actually more generally it's only the same as in general I see suffering all around in the world and kind of I'd rather people didn't suffer and the same for for these selves in the future and this thing here has some capacity to determine at least the the pleasures and and and sufferings of the similar cells that will come in future more than I can do anything for the rest of you so maybe that's enough but also I
(20:55) feel the kind of gratitude towards previous selves that put me here I had a lovely time last night I went out after dinner in the woods and it was nearly dark that was a bit silly of me coming back through the woods and there nearly dark was poking my eyes with a stick you know trees and what-have-you but it was wonderful out there I was marching round and round the trees thinking what I'm going to say today and I think a sort of mutual gratitude between the prior the previous and the future selves is also
(21:20) kind of encouraging - - but you know nice behavior rather than nasty behavior and what about death well all I've been describing is allowing oneself to die again and again all the time so in that sense it's only the same isn't it when the body finally goes well all of these rather similar selves will stop but hey they were all stopping anyway they were all being let go and this is kind of this bugbear about reincarnation like like so many Western scientists interested in in Buddhism and related ideas reincarnation just seems stupid
(21:59) what on earth is going to be reincarnated what's it all about I I get in trouble I had I've had an email thing on one of my blogs with with a Buddhist teaching you know getting really angry with me and I said I'm not a Buddhist and I can say what I like actually and so can you that's fine but why I think it's daft is because that what I've described as selves can't be reincarnated I think so what is all this stuff about the cycle of birth and death or rebirth what's that about then is it about
(22:30) anything well here's a very different interpretation yes it is it's actually a very straightforward insight into what it is to be alive it's constantly dying and being reborn again selves are rising and falling away and so long as you believe that it's the same self and it's continuous and unitary and has powers and does things and is in charge of its body and all of that you have still stuck in all of that delusion but if you just go oh here it comes here it goes you're not could that be something about
(23:01) what getting off the rebirth thing is about I don't know I throw that in as a pure speculation but let me go back to to where I was these self just pop up oh here's another one and she'll be about to say goodbye and I hope that makes sense of why I called it she won't be me
