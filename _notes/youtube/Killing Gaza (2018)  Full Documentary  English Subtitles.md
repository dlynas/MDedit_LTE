(Max Blumenthal) We began
filming this documentary
on August 15, 2014.
Israel and the armed factions
of the besieged Gaza Strip
had been fighting for weeks
when a five-day ceasefire was declared.
Journalist Dan Cohen and I
entered Gaza for the first time.
We headed straight
for the Shujaiya neighborhood,
where the most ferocious fighting
had taken place.
Peace be upon Muhammad
(people screaming)
(Max) This is the street-level view
from Shujaiya,
the area east of Gaza City
that extends all the way
to the Israeli border.
Block after block of ruin.
Multilevel family homes flattened
by Israeli artillery and missiles.
By nightfall, open fires
are the only source of light here,
and when we visited,
bodies were still being exhumed
from the rubble.
Much of this destruction took place
in the course of a few hours on July 23rd,
when the invading Israeli forces
found themselves
under ferocious fire
from local resistance forces,
enduring unexpectedly heavy casualties.
As the Israeli infantry fled
in full retreat,
they called in an artillery
and air assault,
killing at least 120 Palestinian civilians
and obliterating thousands of homes.
The Killing of Gaza.
(Max) Not everyone was able to escape
the Israeli invasion of Shujaiya.
Some, like Nasser Shamaly,
remain trapped in their homes,
and as they tried to escape,
they were hunted.
(Max) "The Israeli army
executes innocent people."
That's what Hisham Shamaly told us,
and he should know--
several members of his family
were killed execution-style,
including his cousin, Salem.
Twenty-three year old Salem Shamaly
led a group of volunteers
from the International Solidarity movement
into the rubble of Shujaiya
on a search for his cousin,
who had been wounded
and was in need of rescue.
One of those international volunteers,
Joe Catron,
explained to us what happened next.
(Joe Catron) On the offensive's 14th day,
July 20th, 2014,
four other activists and I
went to the Shujaiya neighborhood,
which Israel had bombed for days,
to accompany rescue teams
through the rubble
during a 2-hour ceasefire.
A young Palestinian,
whose name we would later learn
was Salem Shamaly,
asked us to go with him to his house,
where he hoped to find his family.
It sounds ridiculous now,
but at the time we thought
the ceasefire would make it safe.
(Joe) As we crossed an alley
with a clear line of sight
to Israeli positions
by the separation barrier,
a gunshot from their direction
struck the ground between us.
We scattered into two groups,
sheltered behind buildings
on either side.
After a pause,
Salem stepped into the alley,
hoping to lead his group to our side,
but was struck by another bullet,
and fell to the ground.
As he lay on his back,
two more rounds hit him,
and he stopped moving.
Oh my God!
Oh God, have mercy on us!
The gunfire kept us from reaching him.
When Israeli artillery
began flying overhead
and striking the buildings behind us,
we were forced to retreat, leaving him.
We only learned his name two days later,
when his mother, father, sister,
and cousin recognized him
in a video I had tweeted of his killing.
(Max) Destroyed cities
and shattered homes can be rebuilt
if the resources are there.
But what about the survivors?
How can they heal the scars
imposed on their psyche?
The youth of Gaza have grown up
through three wars,
each more devastating than the last.
At least 90% of adolescents in Gaza
suffer from post-traumatic
stress disorder.
With mental health services
pushed to the brink,
these unseen scars may never heal.
This video, filmed
from inside an Israeli tank,
shows how Israeli soldiers
prefer to engage
with the population of Gaza.
They are parked just outside Khuza'a,
which they had just laid ruin to.
(Max) Khuza'a,
a small farming town of 20,000,
located hard against the Israeli border,
and the site of some of the most gruesome
Israeli atrocities of the war.
This was the Ebad Al-Rahman mosque,
after Israeli troops obliterated it
with C4 explosives.
Like much of the town of Khuza'a,
it was turned to ruin.
(Max) Thousands of civilians
were trapped inside Khuza'a for days,
as Israeli forces established
a cordon outside its gates.
At a cafe in Gaza City,
two Palestinian Red Crescent
medical volunteers explained to us
how they attempted
to penetrate the Israeli siege.
They described entering the area
as a "doorway into hell."
(Max) The Rjeila family was
among those trapped inside Khuza'a
by Israeli soldiers.
They attempted a desperate escape,
and wound up running into the teeth
of an Israeli tank column.
The journey was especially daunting
for one member of their family.
Sixteen-year-old Gadir,
who is severely disabled
and confined to a wheelchair.
(Max) (Hani al-Najjar) managed to escape
the Israeli invasion of Khuza'a.
When he returned home, however,
he made a horrifying discovery.
(Max) Under siege in Khuza'a,
those too sick or elderly
to escape the Israeli onslaught
suffered the most.
Even the old were not spared
the cruelty of Israeli forces.
(Max) For 51 days, Israel bombarded Gaza
with the full might
of its artillery corps.
According to Israeli military estimates,
23,400 tank shells,
20,400 artillery shells,
and 2.9 million bullets
were fired into Gaza during the war.
That's two bullets for every man,
woman, and child
in the Gaza Strip.
This footage was broadcast
on Israeli Channel 2 television
at the height of the assault.
Do you want to eat sushi?
(Laughter)
(Max) Back in Khuza'a,
those who had borne
the brunt of artillery shells
designed to cause
indiscriminate destruction
described the savagery they had endured
and envisioned a bitter future
in the ruins of their homes.
(Max) Rafah, a city on the border
of Israel and Egypt.
Its outlying neighborhoods
were some of the first areas attacked
by Israeli forces.
And it was there that we met witnesses
to the atrocities that ensued;
and there that we learned
how the invading Israeli army
selected human shields
from among the civilian population.
(Max) We walked across the street
to the ruins of a home,
and in the center of a scorched field
we met Suleiman Zghreiby,
the bereaved father of Saleh.
(Max) By August 22, 2014,
it appeared that the war
was finally ending.
Diplomats in Cairo
had agreed on a ceasefire,
but with the Israeli public
clamoring for more war,
the military arranged
one last round of strikes,
this time targeting
the heart of Gaza City.
(Max) These are the ruins of Zafer Four,
a residential tower
with no military value whatsoever.
Its residents make up the core
of Gaza's educated middle class.
Nearly all of them
had been forced to evacuate
and watch as their homes,
their belongings, and their memories
went up in the flames
of an American-made bunker-buster bomb
fired by Israeli jets.
(Max) From a distant tower,
Dan Cohen filmed an Israeli drone strike
followed by successive bunker-buster bombs
launched by F16 attack jets
at the Italian Compound,
another residential tower
that was home to scores
of middle-class families in Gaza City.
The Israelis failed to topple the tower,
but they destroyed it nonetheless.
At the base of the shattered building
we met a group of workers
as they attempted
to retrieve the belongings
of its now homeless residents.
Deep inside the tower,
we found one of the 2,000-pound bombs
the Israeli military used to destroy it.
(Max) Hussam Barawi
was among the scores of families
rendered homeless
by the Israeli airstrike
on the Italian Compound.
(Max) After enduring
the trauma of death and injury,
having resisted the brunt
of one of the world's
most powerful militaries,
and having witnessed
the systematic destruction
of their homes, their towns,
their cities, and their places of work,
after 51 days of relentless war,
a ceasefire was declared
and the people of Gaza
poured out into the streets
to celebrate their survival.
(Max) In the ruins of Shujaiya,
the al-Qassam Brigades emerged in public
for the first time since the war began.
Having spent 51 days
literally underground,
these guerrilla fighters were free
to trumpet their gallantry
before an admiring population.
(Max) In the border city of Beit Hanoun
stood the Bisan Zoo and Amusement Center.
Before the war, the zoo provided Gazans
with a rare respite from the siege.
Now, the place was shuttered,
and shrouded in sadness.
(Max) Months after the ceasefire,
electricity had been reduced
to four hours a day,
while in Gaza's border regions
residents were literally
left in the dark.
In Shujaiya, the Abu Kheysi family
struggled to make do
in the ruins of their home.
(Max) As fall turned to winter,
Israel and Egypt tightened their siege.
The despair spreading across Gaza
was especially palpable
in the beachside Shati refugee camp.
(Max) Winter in Gaza
is especially harsh these days.
Thousands of families
have no place to shelter
from the cold rains.
This family relies on a camouflage tarp,
left behind by the Israelis,
to keep the moisture out of what's left
of the home those Israelis destroyed.
Without electricity,
sometimes the only way to warm your home
is to light an open fire in the salon.
(With) the sanitation equipment
embargoed by the Israeli siege,
low-lying areas like these
are particularly vulnerable to flooding.
(Max) Some 100,000 homes
were destroyed by Israeli forces
during their 51-day-long assault on Gaza.
Here, in Khuza'a, 55 families
left homeless by the war
had taken shelter in shipping containers
donated by aid agencies.
(Max) Months passed,
and the cold rains of winter gave way
to the baking heat of spring.
In Shujaiya, the Abu Kheysi family
was still living
in the remnants of their home,
but without its newest member.
Born during the war,
little Wadie did not make it
through the harsh winter.
(Max) In October, 2014,
world leaders gathered in Cairo
to raise funds for the reconstruction
of the destroyed Gaza Strip.
The damage exacted
on Gaza's civilian infrastructure
by Israel violence exceeded
eight billion dollars.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry
pledged only a fraction of that, however,
with just 212 million dollars.
Out of this conference
must come not just money,
but a renewed commitment from everybody
to work for a peace
that meets the aspirations of all.
(Max) In the end,
half of the five billion dollars pledged
at the donors' conference in Cairo
was funneled
through the security services
of the Palestinian Authority
which rules cities in the West Bank,
far from the Gaza Strip,
and in coordination
with the Israeli military.
By February 2015,
United Nations
Reconstruction funds for Gaza
had dried up completely,
and once again the people of Gaza
were left to their own devices,
forced to use whatever tools they had
to salvage anything they could.
(Max) Back in the border town of Khuza'a,
Yusef Hussein Najjar was still
languishing in a shipping container,
and sweltering in the summer heat.
(Max) In the heart of Shujaiya,
the site of Gaza's most ferocious stand
against its occupiers,
amidst the rubble and ruin,
where hardly a single home
had been rebuilt,
the first annual Karama
Human Rights Film Festival took place.
(Max) This is downtown Gaza City.
The symbols of resistance
are everywhere here--
a monument to the homemade M75 rocket,
and billboards honoring
the Al-Qassam Brigades
that defended Gaza
against the Israeli military.
"Run, khabibi" the sign read,
mocking the American-armed
Israeli Special Forces
who retreated under fire
in the Battle of Shujaiya.
In an olive grove to the east of Gaza,
volunteer members
of the Nasser Salah al-Din Brigades
drilled for a military escalation
that they saw as inevitable.
(Max) Nearly a year after we first met
the family of Salem Shamaly,
the young man who was executed
on camera by an Israeli sniper,
we visited his younger brother, Wasseem,
who explained to us how the pain of loss
had only deepened since the war.
(Max) Resistance takes
many forms inside Gaza.
These are the Camps Breakerz,
Gaza's first b-boy crew.
Their founder, Shark, explained to us
how the culture of hip hop
helped him keep his spirit up
in the time of the siege.
(Shark) We are dancers.
We use our dancing
for making us forget what's happening
by the Egyptians or the Israelis.
Because if we don't have something
to make us feeling
something better, like dancing,
we will be like psycho
walking in the streets.
There is a lot of people here
you can't even look at them
like they are alive--
it's like zombies,
walking in the streets--
because of this shitty situation.
That's why we don't talk
about political things.
It's not from our business.
We know that we will not have
a border to travel
from the Egyptians' or the Israeli's side.
If we are not having a good minds
we will go down, and give up,
and we will not live like normal lives.
But that's how we think here.
That's all.
(Max) For 15-year-old Malak Mattar,
a self-taught painter
and student from Gaza City,
the easel and the brush are as powerful
as any other tool of resistance.
(Malak) Art is something like...
If I don't do it, I won't be okay.
Sometimes when I just need
to draw something,
I just feel crazy,
full of energy,
that I just need to do this.
Art is like a language
which all the world can understand.
By my art, I can resist
with my own materials,
I can resist with my own paintings.
How simple is my art, but it could affect.
Most of the people here,
and the situation in Gaza,
(the) people are all about politics.
There is no space for creativity.
There is no space for talents.
In spite of the importance
of politics, I hate it,
because it's a bottomless well.
I don't like people
who are all about politics,
and thinking about politics
more than themselves.
I want to say that we are not documents,
and we are not numbers,
only mentioned when we are killed
or injured by Israeli aircraft,
but we are the human,
and we are the people of Gaza,
who have the right to live,
and express their feelings
as any human in the world.
I can tell you that I love Gaza,
but sometimes I need
to have opportunities,
to let the world know me
and know who is Malak.
Like in Gaza, here, nothing--
and no one cares, (and I don't).
If you do, or if you didn't do,
it's the same.
NOTE Paragraph
So my only hope is to travel abroad,
to move freely, without restriction,
and a place where the people
appreciate art--
any place.
I don't have a specific country.
Until now, even the kids
who are the same, with my age,
they are just still trying to recover.
They're still trying to heal
from the last war.
It is not something easy to forget.
Even in my short life--
I'm just 15 years old--
what I only remember is the last war.
If you just tell me about my childhood,
I just remember the war.
And there's no such--
It's the three wars,
and I've just witnessed three wars.
There is no such a good things
to be remembered, in the life.
So that's it.
There is no rights for us.
(Max) On the days
of October 9-10, 2015,
hundreds of youth gathered
at the buffer zone
between Israel and Gaza.
For the Israeli military,
this is a free-fire area.
According to its policy,
anyone approaching
within 300 meters of the fence
can be shot on sight.
The demonstrators came
without the approval of local authorities,
without weapons or armor,
with nothing more than the will
to confront their besieger face to face.
(Max) For two days straight,
the demonstrators
waved Palestinian flags,
and sent volleys of rocks
at the soldiers enforcing
the occupation of Gaza.
With a seemingly endless
supply of tear gas,
and a hail of live bullets,
the Israeli army tried to drive them back
from the buffer zone.
Some 145 youth
were wounded in the protests.
(Max) Seven others never returned home,
targets of Israel's shoot-to-kill policy.
(Max) For two days,
the youth of Gaza
put their bodies on the line--
to shake their cage,
to pound on the heavy gates of Gaza.
But with the war over,
and the world's attention
focused elsewhere,
they were left to wonder
if anyone was listening.
Sans everything
Bring a candle of your making;
Light it and see it beaming
In a very dark and cold room.
Wait until the last bit of it
Watch it standing in the gloom.
A candle after another
Flaring, lasting,
Comes a hurricane and blows it out
So weak, so helpless.
Carry your child wherever you go.
Nine months in the womb and
A lot more in life.
They bring happiness and joy.
They flare when all is dark.
Then long before the age of weakness
Comes an occupier and blows them out,
Chops them to pieces
Sans teeth, sans eyes,
sans taste, sans everything.
(Max) Since we last filmed
inside the Gaza Strip,
our permission to enter has been denied
by the Israeli Government Press Office.
Gaza has been virtually cut off
from the outside world.
Electricity has been reduced
to two or three hours a day.
Running water is becoming scarce.
Those who can get out do so,
as soon as they can,
and those who remain are left to wonder
when the next war will come down,
who will live, and who will be
the next to die.
Israel and its allies are killing Gaza,
and yet its people persist
in the face of siege,
continuous warfare,
deprivation and exclusion,
undaunted in their struggle to live free.
