Closereads: Paul Grice's "Logic and Conversation" (Part One)
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlbZstyv6u4)

## Transcript:

this is close reads a philosophy podcast
with Mark and Wes I'm Wes alwan and I'm
Mark lindsenmeyer

so we're looking at the 1975 paper from
Paul Grice logic and conversation
this was covered on the purchase exam in
life but you don't have to have listened
to that in order to appreciate this
because we're doing a close read of
course how you doing Wes
good how are you
good so this was the uh
paper where he is giving
he's accounting for the sorts of
assumptions that underlie conversation
parameters that make conversation make
sense
we're going to skip the intro because he
doesn't actually say anything about that
in the intro the intro is just about how
some philosophers think that
natural language is too sloppy and some
philosophers think that that's okay and
there's still logic within natural light
and he and he says actually I don't I'm
not going to have anything to say about
either of those but
the the common assumption between the
people debating the those two sides is
that
natural language does not have rules hey
I'm going to give you some rules in
natural language in its actual uh
practice in the conversational practice
has
so we're going to start this uh on the
third page the article called
implicature
sure
suppose that A and B are talking about a
mutual friend C who is now working in a
bank
or as I like to call it D sorry a s b
how C is getting on in his job and B
replies oh quite well I think he likes
his colleagues and he hasn't been to
prison yet
at this point a might well inquire what
B was implying what he was suggesting or
even what he meant by saying that c had
not yet been to prison
the answer might be any one of such
things as that c is the sort of person
likely to yield to the Temptation
provided by his occupation that sees
colleagues a really very unpleasant and
treacherous people and so forth
it might of course be quite unnecessary
for a to make such an inquiry of B the
answer to it being in the context clear
in advance
it is clear that whatever be implied
suggested meant in this example is
distinct from what B said
which was simply that c had not been to
prison yet
I wish to introduce as terms of art the
verb implicate and the related nouns
implicature
implying and implicate implicatum or
what is implied
the point of this maneuver is to avoid
having on each occasion to choose
between this or that member of the
family of verbs for which implicit for
which implicate is to do general duty
let's stop there for a second so
I'm not sure if this family of verbs is
supposed to be implied suggested meant
Etc that he just said because those are
all quite different things and they're
also different from entailed which
entailed would have something to do with
uh logical entailments that the speaker
might not even be aware of right if you
say that Superman such and such then
you're implying that Clark Kent is such
and such even if you don't know that
Superman is Clark Kent
um
I think we have to lean on the side of
implicate we're still this is still
fundamentally something about
what the speaker meant to say as opposed
to hear all the things that actually do
logically come from what he says or the
wide open space of what the hearer could
read into it we're talking about only
successful communication
between a speaker and a hearer
right so he's it's going to be a term of
Art
he wants to stick to a specific verb
because he's going to build up some
theoretical apparatus around that and he
doesn't need
connotations from other possible
meanings of other verbs or even
this verb to
interfere with that so we get a very
specific meaning of implicate Mark as
you just
um explicated it
right the point of this okay so I
already read that I yep I shall for the
time being at least have to assume to a
considerable extent an intuitive
understanding of the meaning of say in
such contexts in an ability to recognize
particular verbs as members of the
family with which implicate is
associated I can however make one or two
remarks that may help clarify more
problematic of these assumptions namely
that connected with the meaning of the
word say
uh let me just keep going here in the
sense in which I'm using the word say I
intend what someone has said to be
closely related to the conventional
meaning of the words the sentence he has
uttered suppose someone to have uttered
the sentence he is in the grip of a vice
given a knowledge of the English
language but no knowledge of the
circumstances of the utterance one would
know something about whether this about
what the speaker had said on the
assumption that he was speaking Standard
English and speaking literally
one would know that he had said about
some particular male person or animal X
at the time of the utterance whatever
that was so an utterance it doesn't have
to be words it could even be a gesture
at the time of the utterance either
first X was unable to rid himself of a
certain kind of bad character trait or
second
some part of x's person was caught in a
certain kind of tool or instrument
approximate account of course so let's
just stop there so I mean he's saying
these are speaking Standard English and
speaking literally and that too literal
meanings of in the grip of advice are
you know actually grabbed by a tool a
vice or unable to rid himself of a
certain kind of bad character trait
is that literally
is it the verb I mean a vice I
understand how that has two
yes meetings now I know the question
you're asking I mean the the problem is
yeah a lot of literal meanings have
their Origins and metaphorical usage
so
you're pointing to the fact that
it may be the case it probably is the
case that
the use of Vice to mean
something vicious
well I don't know I was actually
thinking in the grip maybe I shouldn't
be worried about this but
that well no I know versus the uh I
understand I understand what you're
saying yeah so
so yeah so we
so there's Vice the tool and vice as in
viciousness
and in any case let's suppose that that
the word Vice
is literally means the opposite of
virtue it can still have its origins in
a metaphorical usage of the machine that
grips it doesn't mean it's non-literal
literal will be just because its Origins
are metaphorical many words
if you look at them and it'll turn out
that way
the um the the
River you know literally is running
even though it derives that literal
usage from a figure to
usage
okay so in any way any case I'm just
well it's not that I'm just saying that
you know the river oh it was
figuratively the tree could be
figuratively
running the trees or anyway the trees
are cascading down its branches or
something like that that's a figurative
use but sure I'm I'm dwelling this of
course because he's trying to make a
distinction here between what is
actually said and what is implicated by
what is said
and
I think maybe that that's not a
distinction that one could make with
particular clarity
uh but I don't know let's I mean the
fact that I think he I mean I think you
think of it
like the what is what is said as in
there's some
proposition associated with the
utterance some general proposition I
think the way we've treated it
traditionally with our our previous
discussions
in analytic philosophy it just is what
it is there's a this one particular
meaning and that's the
proposition
I think for
Grice that proposition or what is said
literally is is almost a general bucket
which a bunch of different things can
fit into
so that we in a particular audience
utterance
it's fleshed out in its meaning but at
the level of what does it what does it
mean independent of
speaker intent that's quite
generic
which I think so is consistent with your
intuition
that it's not that doesn't fully have
content in a way
I don't know if I'm explaining that very
well that's the impression I got from
the other
papers right let's let's keep going I do
want to say here that like his attempt
to be precise and I know I'm not going
to belabor this point because I'm sure
Dylan
was ranting and raving on the regular
podcast which I was not on about this
but his attempt at Precision to me makes
things less clear
so you don't have to qualify
Vice the tool with you know
um a pro a certain kind of tool or
instrument approximate account of course
like all these attempts at nailing
things down this is this is the
caricature of an analytic philosophy and
and for me all the ones and twos and A's
and B's and C's
make it much more difficult to follow
that's out of my system that's it you
know a particular male person or animal
X and I I would as I was just reading it
aloud it sounded like the animal is X
not that that you know even putting in
the animal there for this particular
example does not seem useful
the man yeah I don't and why are they
advice what I'm gonna say that about a
dog or a tiger anyway
you're right
well I guess yes in the grip if if it's
the other meaning he is he has been
trapped
there's an animal that that you have
it's just because we can refer to we can
refer to
animals as he's that's all he wants to
capture the extension of he yeah okay
but for a full identification of what
the speaker had said one would need to
know a the identity of X that is the
person who's person or animal
B the time of the utter the time of
utterance and see the meaning
on the particular occasion of utterance
of the phrase in the group of ice a
decision between those two options this
brief indication of my use of say leaves
it open whether a man who says today
Harold Wilson is a great man and another
who says also today the British prime
minister is a great man
if each knew that the two singular terms
had the same reference have said the
same thing
but what decision is made about this
question the apparatus that I'm about to
provide will be capable of accounting
for any implicatures
that might depend on the presence of one
rather than another of these singular
terms in the sentence uh such
implicatures would be merely would
merely be related to different maxims
okay let me just setting aside that that
Superman Clark Kent thing with that
example
whatever decision is made about the
question
of
the open question of whether
these two people making statements about
someone under a different description
whether they've said the same thing
right okay
um
his account of implicature
will be able to account for either is
that what he's saying they would be
related by to different maxims okay I
mean this never comes up again in the
article so okay okay I don't know what
to really tell you about that but it
does seem like it is a
a significant difference
to which one of those you take that
you know that's the sense frega sense
reference distinction that
I think you you might wanna
Define what is said by the sense in
other words someone that says something
about Superman something who says
something about Clark Kent
has has those are two different
statements you have there are different
sayings uh
if we wanna
focus on the the speaker's meaning it
matters if the person knows that those
are the same because then
actually it is the same even if he
refers to him as soups
I you know he knows that that means
Superman who means Clark Kent so he has
said
it's one in the same proposition for
that speaker I meant that that unitary
proposition that that you might not
understand is the same proposition and
when you say it it might be you saying
two different things
is that just confuse matters or I mean I
know it's not confusing for you because
you know sense reference
no I think we can leave it at that um
keep going
in some cases the conventional meaning
of the words used will determine what is
implicated besides helping to determine
what is said
if I say smugly he is an Englishman he
is therefore Brave I have certainly
committed myself by virtue of the
meaning of my words so it's being the
case that his being brave is a
consequence
is a consequence of follows from is
being an Englishman
but while I have said that he is an
Englishman and said that he is brave I
do not want to say that I have said in
the favored sense that it follows from
his being an Englishman that he is Brave
though I have certainly indicated and so
implicated
that this is so
so he's not said it he's not explicitly
said
I don't know has he not explicitly said
that he's an Englishman therefore he's
great he's an Englishman therefore he is
therefore Brave so you're saying three
things he's an Englishman he is brave
and there's a logical connection between
the two of those they're all said right
there so I'm not sure what so I I do not
want to say I've said in the favorite
sense that's weird
I have indicated
and implicated it but I have not said it
in the favored sense what is the
favorite sense uh so looking back to the
beginning of the previous paragraph I
intend what someone has said to be
closely related to the conventional
meaning of the words the sentence he has
uttered
uh the conventional meaning of
yeah I can't
I mean that is the conventional meaning
of therefore the word therefore
well okay
is there some other meaning of therefore
that I'm missing um I mean is there is
it is the distinction between in his
case
he's an Englishman therefore he is brave
but that's actually different than
saying all English men are brave
can we make that distinction
I think he's trying to say that you're
actually only saying of this individual
but maybe you have implicated
the the general the general entailment
I mean I'm not sure I guess we're we're
part in part trying to figure out does
that
statement as it is listed actually
entail the general all English maor
Brave I mean technically not I guess
you could imagine a situation or a
different sentence where
uh
you know maybe you're just saying
Englishmen tend to be brave and if
you're the kind of I think that's what
he's saying now I think the next
sentence makes that clear all right I do
not want to say that my utterance of the
sentence would be strictly speaking
false should the consequence in question
fail to hold so even if it turns out
he's not brave
he can still be an Englishman
it's a looser
suggestion just what you said Mark
Englishmen tend to be brave but it's not
a hard and fast so so some implicatures
are conventional unlike the one with
which I introduced this discussion of
implicature
so some implicatures are conventional
they're not just
yeah okay I mean so again that one he
started with he hasn't been to prison
yet
uh
I know I know what you're about to say
that is conventional right when you say
um it's like you know have you stopped
beating your wife well it it certainly
suggests there that you were previously
beating your wife it would be an
improper use of stop and so
the word yet there it's not quite the
same but at least it implies that
there's some reason that he either
should be in prison now or is likely to
fall into temptation or maybe he's just
joking around I would if somebody said
that to me
like well how are you doing at your job
I haven't been fired yet like am I
really saying I suck so bad at my job
that I should be fired am I I mean I'm
just making a quip it barely has any
literal meaning at all
it really just means I'm all right
it's okay yeah I mean it depends on
context yeah
it could mean you suck at your job it
could mean everyone's out to get you
even though you're great at your job
or or not but um
it it could just be a joke
right so so yeah I mean that that's a
good example and with in the way of the
way a single utterance
can mean a lot of different things based
on implicature which
always involves context so we're talking
about pragmatics and and this is not
unrelated to the stuff we talked about
with thomasello
because
the idea there was that a lot of what
goes on when we
understand a communication
involves context and our Attunement to
other people's consciousness of that
context
but go ahead
I wish represent a certain subclass of
non-conventional implicatures which I
shall call conversational implicatures
as being essentially connected with
certain General features of discourse so
my next step is to try to say what these
features are
have we made it clear enough what a
conventional implicature is
well it sounds like that therefore right
uh I mean I would think it's even a
euphemism that is commonly used right I
just uh dropped the kids off at the pool
as I'm coming out of the bathroom that
that is a conventional implicature
it is uh
but I could a subclass of okay yeah if
if you're if if a particular speaker
means something that is
outside
what you could potentially find in a
slang lexography of the phrase for
instance
uh you know not a common use a
completely common use of the term a
different one that he uses in the other
uh one of the other papers is
if I shall be
helping the grass grow blah blah blah
and and and it it's revealed that the
the speaker meant
when I'm dead
and like pushing up the daisies which is
now even though that's also a metaphor
that is a conventional implicature this
would be an unconventional one it just
works in the context
yeah his example in the previous
paragraph is a simpler example it's just
therefore in some cases a conventional
meaning of the words
will determine what is implicated
therefore
but therefore is the conventional is our
is one of our content conventional
terms
for implicature
maybe you know we didn't really note
that if I say parentheses smugly he's an
Englishman therefore does the smugly add
anything does it add a
it's an it doesn't imply Whimsy or I'm
you know saying something in the same
offhand way
right
is this well he's not being he's not
being ironic he's being a
nationalist he's being self-centered
according to his nationality and we you
know earnestly believes it so I think
it's that seems to rule out
irony or it seems to rule out a doctor
Spock who has done population
research and wants to make a general
statements about the qualities of
certain groups yeah
all right why don't you keep going
um
the following me provide okay so my
so my next step is to try to say what
these features are the following maybe
provide a first approximation to a
general principle
our talk exchanges do not normally
consist of its secession of disconnected
remarks and would not be rational if
they did they are characteristically to
some degree at least Cooperative efforts
and each participant recognizes in them
to some extent a common purpose or set
of purposes or at least a mutually
accepted Direction This purpose or
Direction may be fixed from the start
for example by an initial proposal of a
question for discussion
or it may evolve during the exchange
it may be fairly definite or it may be
so indefinite as to leave very
considerable latitude to the
participants as in a casual conversation
but at each stage some possible
conversational moves would be excluded
as conversationally unsuitable
we might then formulate a rough General
principle which participants will be
expected Caterers paribus to observe
namely make your conversational
contributions such as is required at the
stage at which it occurs by the accepted
purpose or direction of the talk
Exchange in which you are get engaged
one might label this The Cooperative
principle
so at this point that's yeah to me
rather vague at this point
but go ahead say something
yeah is this positing that there is a
single
language game or
insofar as something is a conversation I
mean there might be of course many many
different language games within that
rubric you know the transaction that you
are doing at a bank or you know in any
sort of vendor purchaser relation versus
a romantic conversation you know they're
all these but just the fact that it is a
conversation it's going to have some
features
of what you're allowed to do and not to
do that are going to
far overshadow I'm not sure that he
actually says this but far overshadowed
the differences between the various
languages
do you think that
is accurate so far as you can tell in
the abstract
well let me
before I get to that
problem
I think here what he's saying is
so we might normally think about what
what makes sense what makes an utterance
meaningful
and we can think about that strictly in
terms of the grammar
of the language so that such that dog
night skim
later has no meaning it's not well
constructed
but that's not enough there's a lot more
that has to go on
for us to be
doing something meaningful or that
wouldn't seem crazy
or nonsense to another participant we
have to link propositions together in a
certain way so that that Insight or a
link utterances together in a certain
way
that that's an Insight which I find
you know really interesting so
and then the other okay so the other
element of this is that you're saying
that these are that sort of rule is
broader than the rule of any particular
language game and that seems right in
the way it seems to characterize
language games in general
which is that there is some Telos there
is some purpose or direction that
characterizes the game
and that we expect people to make moves
that respect that goal and if they don't
are if they're not oriented towards the
purpose
then we think what's wrong with you
what is going on I think I think ones
that are harder to see as using the
Cooperative principle is because they
might not actually be conversations that
an interrogation
not sure that counts as a conversation
because you it just it's one
willingness of both parties right or
threatening someone as they run away you
know that's not a conversation even if
the person then yells something back I'm
just not sure that that counts this is
what annoys me about academics using
this word interrogate
in their writing
as a metaphor I'm going to interrogate
the
whatever it is that they're
interrogating don't say interrogate
unless you have someone in a room
you know stripped down to their
undershirt tied to a chair
you've got a battery with some um
electric cables nearby don't use that
word don't use that word as a metaphor
it's obnoxious and you're not
interrogating you're just making your
own feeble human attempts at
understanding something hopefully or
saying something you're not a master
interrogator
who's gonna Dazzle us with how you
torture something out of the text but
Wes what is an interrogative
yeah I know I know okay all right I know
I know but it's that kind of fancy word
Play It's word play it's double entender
and it's funny though that that is what
we now see is the basic meaning
but really it just means questioning and
it's only as this no it doesn't if
interrogative means a question yeah but
that doesn't mean it means or at least
originally meant to question
and so it it doesn't it you know the
associations we have of being extreme
interrogation have now taken over the
word interrogation and that's the first
thing that comes to mind for us it
doesn't have to be an extreme
interrogation there's just an element of
coercion and yeah you're right that
literally if you take it a literal word
origin we could just say it means
question
but
um
so so you think it's though what it
means to jump back to the original if
since it no longer means that as a
primary thing then it actually is just
using it as a metaphor as a hyperbole to
to uh yeah the metaphorical meaning the
metaphorical meaning is the literal
meaning
and the literal meaning is no longer the
meaning
right Cooperative principle we've set up
on the on the assumption that some such
General Principle as this is acceptable
one may perhaps distinguish four
categories under one one or another
which under one or another of which will
false certain more specific maxims and
sub-maxims the following of which will
in general
yield results in accordance with the
Cooperative principle
echoing Kant I call these categories
quantity quality relation and manner
the category of quantity relates to the
okay we want to say anything about
he's he's making a needless comparison
to cut here because they're really not
preconceived when I saw that originally
I I wasn't thinking oh it's because he's
using the same words content that that
these are preconceptions that these are
something that we go
into the conversation
expect these are the a priority
conditions of a conversation
I mean maybe that's why he's making this
reference here
okay
that's interesting I hadn't thought
about this yeah go ahead the category of
quantity relates to the quantity of
information to be provided and under it
follow the following maxims number one
make your contribution as informative as
is required for the current purchases of
the exchange
and number two do not make your
contribution more informative that is
required
and he says there's a big parenthetical
the second maximum is disputable it
might be said that to be over
informative is not a transgression of
the of the CP The Cooperative principle
but merely a waste of time
however it might be answered that such
over informativeness may be confusing in
that it is liable to raise side issues
and there may also be an indirect effect
in that the hearers may be misled as a
result of thinking that there is some
particular point in the provision of the
excess of information
however this may be there is perhaps a
different reason for doubt about the
admission of the second Maxim namely
that its effect will be secured by a
later Maxim which concerns relevance
yeah there's a psychological term for
this which I'm forgetting when people
just go on and on with irrelevant speech
and it's it's used diagnostically
but of course if you're lying on the
couch you and you're free associating
then everything is relevant and it would
be weird not to say everything that
comes into your head even if it isn't
connected to the conversation in a
typical way but in general yeah it's
really weird if someone goes into
down these Avenues with lots of details
that don't end up paying off that don't
end up hooking up to the rest of the
account like well why did you
why did you tell me about X Y and Z if
it wasn't you know important to the
overall purpose of the conversation
I'm wondering if if we want to say that
you know which Grace does not say that a
police interrogation is borderline not a
conversation at all then you might want
to think therapy is also borderline not
a conversation at all because it is such
yes it involves two people talking and
their expectations and their rules and
so a lot of the characteristics of I
mean even in a police interrogation
if if the the suspect sat down and the
policeman just started going
you'd maybe something's gone wrong or is
that just well that could be an
iterative tick a technique that the
person is using I'm just trying to freak
you out and you know so it's it's sort
of like you're training a dog that is
not a conversation and so sort of
whatever works whatever you think
but it still seems like if the if then
the the
interrogator has a purpose and is doing
something that there actually is no
strategy behind
then they violated
at least that
they're playing outside the room the
rules of that language game so it's
certainly a language game even if it's
not a conversation
you're reminding me of uh
this show called the patient with Steve
Carell have you watched any of that
I forget is that on Hulu maybe but he's
kidnapped by one of his patients who
turns out to be a serial killer
because the patient wants to have as
much time with his and as possible and
actually do therapy
in the basement he's like I'm Gonna Make
You you know be my 24 7 therapist
and
one thing that the Corel character says
is that
we can't really do
therapy under the circumstances of
Seer and you know so me being afraid
that I'm gonna die or
being confined here against my will
doesn't work for therapy and I would say
that
there's there's an analogy there to
interrogation in which there's
the conversation there is no
conversation because it involves this
physical it involves physical forces and
externality it's not cooperation towards
a
goal it's the use of force and that's
that you know that's an interesting
contrast I mean with big political
implications but in the case of therapy
it is a cooperative
effort even if it's a weird type of
conversation and the therapist does say
something sometimes
and they are communicating with each
other and they do there is a goal and
there's
Cooperative principles and so
I think
there can be lots of different types of
conversations with very different
characteristics and goals and hence
or finely grained rules about how
they're supposed to operate and what
grice is doing here is giving us some
very
general rules about
what those conversations will
nevertheless observe so informative as
required that's quite vague and some
conversational situations that means
giving lots and lots and lots of
information in Psalm it means
you know really keeping it to a minimum
well and when you so all these rules are
put forward
such that when somebody violates them
they're not necessarily no longer having
a conversation or they're opting out of
the conversation
but they are as our guest was saying
rules that are made to be broken because
they give us a signal
that you're meaning something beyond the
literal meaning
that maybe you are
saying so little saying less than it
seems like you should in the situation
because you're actually trying to convey
I'm not allowed to talk about this this
is something I'm uncomfortable talking
about or or if you're giving too much
information well this is this was a
point that we were arguing about in the
episode is
does implicature always refer to things
that the speaker actually meant
in a broad sense because if somebody is
saying if you ask someone in a police
interrogation where were you on this
night and they start going into a lot of
very specific detail
then that might sound rehearsed that
might certainly the the person who's
saying it does not mean to make it sound
rehearsed
right he's trying to get away with
something but it might give evidence
which would be a form of not non-natural
meaning not the meaning in the speaker's
head but natural meaning a symptom of
something about the speaker
so that I I think violations of a lot of
these rules at least the listener is
going to take as a symptom that
something is going wrong maybe a symptom
that not not just something about the
implicature about what the speaker means
but a symptom that like
hey you don't actually know what
language game we're playing right
you know that's that's not part of the
speaker's meeting but that is what the
hearer would it is information that is
being imparted by what is being said to
the end of the year
and so does that does that count as an
implicature even if it's something that
was not meant
I don't think under his description it
does right okay do I but maybe I don't
know enough yeah well let's let's keep
let's keep going read the quality one
under the category of quality Falls a
super maximum try to make your
contribution one that is true and two
more specific maxims
do not say what you believe to be false
do not say that for which you lack
adequate evidence
under the okay so let's that's quality
and he's gonna give more detail in each
of these whether we'll get to it or not
I I don't know uh let's just now is that
okay
all right we could discuss that later
but
yeah is that is that always true that
we're
expected it to be truthful and
I mean I suppose it is I'm I'm just
trying to think of kind of and I don't
think it violates it if people are
in a situation where they're uh
imparting fiction to each other but well
that yeah this is one of the things when
he gets in the details on this that he's
gonna say there are plenty of particular
conversations where saying something
that is literally false is Illuminating
and
Clues delete the listener into the non
-conventional conversational implicature
of what is being said that if you use a
metaphor
then the person you know if you're
talking to a computer they might just
not understand what you're doing or
sarcasm is a good example you say the
opposite of what you mean yeah all right
so let's keep going under the category
of relation I placed a single Maxim
namely be relevant
though the maximum itself is terse its
formulation conceals a number of
problems that exercise me a good deal
questions about what different kinds and
focuses of relevance there may be how
these shifts in the course of a talk
Exchange
now these shift in the course of a talk
exchange that's a conversation is a talk
Exchange
how to allow for the fact that
subjects of conversation are
legitimately changed and so on I find
the treatment of such questions
exceedingly difficult and I hope to
revert to them in a later work
finally under the category of manner
which I understand is relating not like
the previous categories to what is said
but rather to how what is said is to be
said
I include the super Maxim B perspicuous
and various maxims such as
avoid obscurity of expression avoid
ambiguity be brief avoid unnecessary
publicity be orderly and one might need
others
and as he's gonna say pretty soon you
know this is not all the manner of uh
this does not include uh you know be be
polite or something he's gonna say in
the next looking at a paragraph uh
so it's it's a little
I'm not sure exactly what how how do you
think Manor
is that a fundamentally different mode
if it's about how it is to be said
if that's really different because you
know be brief avoid unnecessary
prolicity well that sounds like
quantity it sounds like what he's
already said
I think I think what he
Clarity is the things yeah exactly the
kind of example he is in mind is don't
use a ten dollar word when you can use a
a dollar word or whatever the expression
for that is
um
that that is just putting barriers
between you and the list
I mean let's come up for different with
different names for these like well we
manner I would just call clarity
yeah right because being orderly is
about stating yeah in a clear order
relation I would just call
um
relevance salience relevance yeah I like
that yeah
quality truthfulness or
yeah because quality is too broad
because that includes like if you
contribute irrelevant things you are
making a poor quality contribution to
the conversation you're not helping it
go forward in
to achieve its goals so quality is just
too broad to cover that and then
quantity
um
maybe that's maybe I don't know if
there's a better word but it's okay but
in any case you know it would have been
a lot easier to keep these in their in
one's head if you just used
the more reasonable words but he's it's
almost as if he's vile as if he's
violating his own principles he's using
these needlessly fancy terms in order to
come up with a parody to Kant
and I always just it means that I just
have trouble
remembering what they are unless I look
back at these definitions okay which one
is this which one is this you know
all right
uh uh where were we is it it is obvious
yeah it is obvious that the observance
of some of these maxims is a matter of
less urgency than is the observance of
others a man who's expressed himself
with undue prolixity would in general be
open to milder comment than a man who
has said something he believes to be
false
indeed it might be thought that the
importance of at least the first maxim
of quality is such that it should not be
included in a scheme of the kind I am
constructing
other maxims come into operation only on
the assumption that this maxim of
quality is satisfied
while this may be correct so far as the
general generation of implicatures is
concerned it seems to play a role not
totally different from the other maxims
and it will be convenient for the
president lease to treat it as a member
of the list of maxims I don't know if
you thought of was it Davidson that
somebody that we have to for
conversation makes sense assume that
people in general are telling the truth
right otherwise we would yeah know what
the meanings of words are at all and so
right if you're like you read this and
what conversations include you know
assume that we're telling the truth
don't people lie all the time well
people might lie pretty frequently but
still 90 99 of the things they say are
true
because otherwise you wouldn't
understand that they were even speaking
English
yep or I don't know what the what the
the percentage would have to be
certainly if they were telling the truth
less than half the time
we would really be confused by each
other
right
I mean he needs to tell us why how it is
that quality
uh undergirds the other
maxims exactly he hasn't done that but I
get the general
point I mean the exception is if you
have a twin
brother who always tells the truth and
you can always lie and as long as you're
giving directions to people together
then they can you know use their logical
brain to figure out all right
right
all right uh there are of course all
sorts of other maxims aesthetic social
or moral in character such as be polite
that are also normally observed by
participants in talk exchanges
and these may also generate
non-conventional implicatures the
conversational maxims however and the
conversational implicatives connected
with them are specifically connected I
hope with the particular purpose that
talk and so exchange is adapted to serve
and is primarily employed to serve
I've stated my maxims as if this purpose
were a maximally effective exchange of
information
this specification is of course too
narrow and the scheme needs to be
generalized to allow for such general
purposes as influencing or directing the
actions of others
different sorts of
speech hacks not just description or at
stick different goals other than
informing others are at stake
yeah and this even leaves open I know he
eventually
I'm trying to think certainly in his
meaning paper he he considers cases
where there are not two people actually
talking
that if you are if you are trying to
influence or direct the actions of
others
uh
yeah is that a borderline conversation
certainly if you're doing it through
like posted advertisements well that's
not conversation at all even though it
is an activity that is uh assumes that
conversation exists right that it's only
because we can talk to each other in
person that it makes sense that I can
send a letter or post a sign that's
aimed at you or at the general a wider
general public that I don't know who the
audience is exactly
writing for posterity writing in my own
diary perhaps for No One
hmm
um as one of my vowed aims
sorry
as one of my about aims is to see
talking as a special case or variety of
purposive indeed rational Behavior it
may be worth noting that the specific
expectations or presumptions connected
with at least some of the foregoing
maxims have their analogs and the sphere
of transactions that are not talk
exchanges
all right let's briefly one such analog
for each conversational category
quantity
if you're assisting me to mend a car I
expect your contribution to be neither
more nor less than is required if for
example at a particular stage I need
four screws I expect you to hand me four
rather than two or six
quality I expect your contributions to
be genuine and not spurious if I need
sugar as an ingredient in the cake
you're assisting me to make I do not
expect you to hand me salt
if I need a spoon I do not expect a
trick spoon made of rubber
relation I expect a partner's
contribution to be appropriate to the
immediate needs at each stage of the
transaction if I'm mixing ingredients
for a cake I do not expect to be handed
a good book or even an oven cloth though
this might be an appropriate
contribution at a later stage
manner I expect a partner to make it
clear what contribution he is making and
to execute his performance with
reasonable dispatch
all right let's just get the second next
paragraph out there too so we can see
what he how he thinks this relates to
the speech ones you know beyond the
obvious that you can apply these four
things to it these analogies are
relevant to what I regard as a
fundamental question about the CPE the
conversational
Cooperative principle Cooperative
principle and its attention let's say
the whole thing okay we have enough
abbreviations and acronyms yeah okay
it's a 10.
these analogies are relevant to what I
regard as a fundamental question about
the Cooperative principle and its
attended maxims namely what the basis is
for the Assumption which we seem to make
and on which I hope it will appear that
a great range of implicatures depend
that talkers will in general
in the absence of indications of the
contrary proceed in the manner that
these principles prescribe
in other words that normally people
follow them
a dull but no doubt at a certain level
adequate answer is that it is just a
well-recognized empirical fact that
people do behave in these ways
they have learned to do so in childhood
and not lost the habit of doing so and
indeed it would involve a good deal of
effort to make a radical departure from
The Habit it's much easier for example
to tell the truth and to invent lies
however enough of a rationalist to want
to find a basis that underlies these
facts undeniable though they may be like
to be able to think that the standard
type of conversational practice
I would like to be able to think of the
standard type of conversational practice
not really as something that all or most
do in fact follow
but as something that it is reasonable
for us to follow something that we
should not abandon
for a time as I was attracted by the
idea that observance of the the
Cooperative principle and the maxims in
the talk exchange would be thought of as
a quasi-contractual matter
with perils outside the realm of
discourse if you pass by when I'm
struggling with my stranded car I no
doubt have some degree of expectations
you will offer help but once you join me
in tinkering under the hood my
expectations become stronger take more
specific forms
in the absence of indications that
you're merely an incompetent medler and
talk exchanges seem to be to exhibit
characteristically certain features that
jointly distinguish Cooperative
transactions
well just say in general that I you know
I think so tomasello was
I think impressed not just by the
consigned but by grace and the
fundamental idea is that
language use is
a case of it is a particular case of
cooperation
and it is built upon certain Cooperative
principles that we see in non-linguistic
Behavior
as well and I think that's really
important especially if we're trying to
think about how there could be such a
thing as language at all which is very
mysterious until we
start
thinking about our capacity to read
other people's intentions
and engage in Cooperative behavior and
those two things are
very closely related
I mean I wonder if language game as as
catchy a term as that is
you know it should it should be subsumed
under games that
I know it seems obvious but
the whole point of of arguing that
language games exist is that when we are
that any Cooperative Enterprise you know
that you I guess game could just be
cooperative Enterprise
is there any is they bring any problem
because it implies that there's some
loose rules that you are doing
I don't know are there rules
well I think the way that they can sign
wittenstein describes the workers who
are handing each other tools and
cooperatively engaged in construction
that is a game that is
right that is where he begins with that
type of activity and calls it a game if
I'm not mistaken so and is he defined
yeah so I think you're right
is he defining the term game or is he
defining it in terms of of some previous
notion of game that we already have
yeah I think there's some trouble with
that right
I think we saw in our last doesn't that
lead us into quite a bit of a circle if
we
try to give necessary and sufficient
conditions for what it is to be a game
I can't remember
in any case
so what are the what are the features
that jointly distinguish Cooperative
transactions we're trying to say that
there are in Cooperative transactions
whether you want to call these games or
not or say game was just a metaphor to
clue you in on what I mean by the fact
that there are rules to things that
conversation
any sort of language transaction most of
which in our conversations involves
certain rules
just for it to make sense
right it's not that you're if you're
impolite you still make sense
right there if you talk with uh improper
grammar or you are you know you see
movie what you seem I don't know this is
this is sort of getting it right because
it says giving too much information
you're violating the rules of the game
but are you violating it aesthetically
or are you violating it so I just don't
understand what you're talking to I
think it has to be the latter as far as
Grace is concerned so there are there
are multiple reasons why you might not
want to talk too much
the one that he's concerned with is is
because if you do
I'll be like wait are we having this
conversation why are you saying I just
don't understand what's going on here
well giving too much information yeah
could have implications for clarity
which is to say
for manner
but it is strictly speaking the quantity
category
so what is the reason for not giving too
much information
the idea is that we expect
the information to have some purpose and
if it doesn't have any purpose
then what our time is being wasted or
being it seems like you know
maybe it seems like maybe that one is
reducible to a Clarity problem or
something I don't know well yeah he he
was asking before maybe we should put
quality as the master one because you
know like the Davidson thing I refer to
unless we're generally telling the truth
then like we just have can't have
conversation at all but I it almost
might be Clarity is the master when and
Clarity defines all the rest of them yes
are we do we both understand that we're
having a conversation that's the
fundamental Clarity it's a secondary
Clarity I guess the specific one that
the the Maxima is referring to is do I
understand the specific thing that you
are trying to say but there are other
types of unclarity that would make me
doubt whether you even know you're
talking to me maybe you're on your cell
phone and I thought you were talking to
me but you're talking in your headset
it's all about the purpose of the game
and whether we're obeying the rules of
the game which is to say whether we in
are engaged in
actual cooperation
and
so it makes sense that cooperation falls
apart if we're not being truthful
it falls apart
if
the
you know it you know the relation
category if you stop respecting the
the goal of the transaction
I can see that manner Clarity quantity
though
is a bit of an odd category because it's
not that you're directly
contradicting the goal of the game it's
just that you're doing extra stuff
on top of the cooperation
and maybe it's just too hard to be
cooperative while you're doing all this
extra stuff
so I guess his example outside of the
language game is I need four screws
if you hand me six let's just take the
example of you handing me six
so I yeah quantity is also providing too
little information so I have to revise
what I just said
too little information can grind the
conversation through a hall but silicon
too much
I don't know
we should move on we should keep going
but I I think we're out of time for this
um
here let me just read the the three-part
thing and this is seems like a fine
ending on page 48 here the so this was a
talk exchanges seemed to be to exhibit
characteristically certain features that
jointly distinguish Cooperative
transactions here they are number one
the participants must have some common
immediate aim like getting a car mended
their ultimate aims May of course be
independent and even in conflict each
may want to get the car mended in order
to drive off leaving the other stranded
and characteristic talk exchanges
there's a common aim even if as in an
over-the-wall chat it is a second order
one namely that each party should for
the time being identify himself with the
transitory conversational interests of
the other
number two the contributions of the
participants should be dovetailed
mutually dependent
and number three there's some
understanding which may be explicit
which is often tacit that other things
being equal the transaction should
continue in appropriate style unless
both parties are agreeable that it
should terminate you do not just shove
off or start doing something else
um so yeah anything we want to wrap
common goal
this all speaks to having a common goal
and a recognition of when the goal has
been
achieved
to be mutually dependent what I say
should actually depend on what you say
if I'm just saying stuff and then
pausing so you could say whatever and
then saying something else that I want
to say as might happen on some podcasts
that's not actually a conversation
right
all right let's leave it there and then
we can I think that's a good place to
start
again we can explore that more in our
next episode all right so you like this
enough that that we shouldn't just
consider yeah I think we should just
it's only six more paid or 12 more pages
so this will this is this will be the we
got through six pages or five and a half
pages today sure that's all right this
is interesting enough we're gonna have a
second part of this for those that are
signed up for close reads uh at
patreon.com close reads philosophy
thanks
thanks
