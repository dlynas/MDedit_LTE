## Transcript:
please thank you Gerald okay
um this session actually came about
because I did a previous one about a
year ago on marginalization and how to
tackle it using systems thinking and um
just as an aside during the process I
said uh oh there's a whole other talk
I've got on on conflicts as well as
marginalization and somebody said oh why
don't you do that next time so that's
what basically happened we got a date in
the diary and uh and I'm here back doing
this
um so this is what I'd like to cover
um
I want to present a systems theory of
entrenched value conflict
um and I want to explore the
implications of that for managing value
conflicts
um
that will take us to three different
ways of using systems approaches to help
people move Beyond those kinds of
conflicts and find new ways forward the
the reason I'm going to illustrate these
with practical examples from New Zealand
is because I actually worked out there
for seven years in a government research
institute so I was doing quite a lot of
systems practice on
Wicked environmental problems if you
like so that's what all the
illustrations here are going to come
from and I'm going to end with something
that is really obvious to any kind of
systems practitioner and that is the
connection the decision making
you could either do work that's divorced
from decision making and kind of handing
over a report or you can involve
decision makers and I don't think it's
news that the the latter is is more
useful
um but I think it's worth reiterating
that kind of message at the end
so I want to start
um with some basic
theory about uh boundaries to understand
conflict
um
the diagram that you see there
represents a boundary judgment that
means the inclusion of stakeholders and
issues or the exclusion of stakeholders
and issues it simultaneously
um uh both one and the other
um one of the fundamental assumptions of
a systems approach is that everything in
the world is either directly or
indirectly connected with anything out
everything else either immediately or
through time and that we can't have a
God's eye view of that
interconnectedness we always draw
boundaries and that's what's represented
in this diagram the drawing of a
boundary so that's about the issues you
include and the stakeholders that you
listen to link to that is a peak which
represents the purposes and values that
drive the setting of boundaries so we
see that
its purposes and values that actually
um help us rethink boundaries but also
we come into institutions that already
have boundary judgments made for us and
those actually make certain values easy
to express or difficult to express so
there's a two-way relationship between
boundaries and values which is why
there's a double-headed Arrow here going
between these two
nevertheless
um what I normally find in practice is
that if you can start off talking about
purposes and values it opens the
discussion about boundaries in a way
that
um just talking about boundaries alone
doesn't because people are usually
interpret a boundary as a constraint
and actually in the kind of theory it's
an enabling constraint a boundary
judgment both enables something to be
done but it also constrains other
options
so this is the kind of picture of of
um
of what it means to make boundary
judgments and this kind of Theory comes
from uh West Churchman from back in the
60s and 70s and Verna Ulrich in the 80s
and 90s
now what if we take that kind of model
of um of a boundary judgment and then we
look at what happens when you have two
stakeholders making different boundary
judgments around the same thing
so you end up with competing frames
so what we have here is one bad boundary
judgment maybe a one stakeholder another
boundary judgment made by another and we
have an area of common concern that is
framed differently because of the
connections uh with that common concern
with with people's separate concerns so
a typical example
um that I've come across a lot in in the
work in New Zealand was conflicts
between
um environmentalists and Farmers where
you have
um
competing understandings of what water
means so water in a river might be seen
as a resource for irrigation by a farmer
and it seen by um
by the environmentalists as a habitat
for fragile native species so people are
seeing the same thing but framing it so
differently so it literally means
something different to different people
those cut those
um uh different framings then make sure
that the elements of common concern are
seen as really fundamentally different
and what happens after that is you end
up with the conflict
and then you have when it really starts
to get entrenched stereotyping of
stakeholders and and their framings by
those on the other side so if you take
that example of environmentalists versus
Farmers Farmers start calling uh uh
environmentalists Tree Huggers in a
derogatory way and the environmentalists
start calling the farmers greedy
exploiters and it basically justifies
seeing things in terms of one Framing
and derogating the other so that's the
basic model of conflict
and I like all models of course
um a model is a simplification so it's
possible that this kind of
um a single conflict between two parties
might intersect with other conflicts
um so the reality can be a lot more
complex than one single conflict but
it's easy it's useful to visualize it
like this
now
once we see it like this
you can begin to think
um about some of the implications for
managing value conflict
first of all because everybody has a
boundary judgment here nobody's got that
God's eye view everybody has a partial
understanding now the word partial in
the English language has two meanings
and both are relevant here so partial as
in incomplete but also partial as in
values informed
um so there isn't an objective or not or
neutral position here everybody has a
partial understanding but instead of
seeing that as a problem you can also
see that as an opportunity that there's
a potential for development and change
if everybody has a partial understanding
that's an important
um that's an important starting point
because systems thinking facilitates
that development of values and
understandings and stakeholder
relationships and then it opens up new
directions for systems thing for the
decision making
and I contrast that with
um a traditional economic approach that
often says well we can get underneath
the problems that these sorry the
positions people are taking and find out
people's fundamental interests
now the language of interests tend to
mean that you then don't change those
interests once you've discovered
somebody's interests they're fixed and
therefore the only way to move forward
on that is to start looking at
trade-offs whereas trade when trait when
you're talking about trade-offs people
tend to interpret it as I'm going to
have to lose something or I'm fighting
not to lose something
um in the face of somebody else's
understanding whereas if you're thinking
in terms of development
um it's possible for people to change
their understandings begin to move
together maybe find areas that they can
accommodate even if they have continuing
disagreements all of this becomes
possible and of course if you can't
resolve a a conflict with a dialogue you
can always fall back on trade-off
thinking
um but that wouldn't be my first place
to go
now in the kinds of workshops I'm
talking about all stakeholders are given
opportunities to express their
viewpoints and listen to others and it's
worth saying that early intervention is
often easier than intervention once a
contract a conflict is entrenched but I
have done several conflict resolution
um exercises where the conflict has been
going for 25 30 years and one of the
examples I'm going to give you later is
exactly that situation a generation long
conflict between environmental and
economic values where the Regional
Council which was responsible for
Environmental Protection was actually
spending three million dollars a month
just on legal fees because they were
fighting farmers who were basically
challenging their environmental
regulations
so we're back to this model again and I
want to suggest that
um the model suggests three different
types of approach
so we've got approaches uh to improve
that improve Mutual understanding so
those directly tackle the stereotyping
of stakeholders
we've got approaches that make
connections across boundaries so you
begin to see that things in one person's
boundary if I can bring my cursor up
um that things in one person's boundary
here might actually connect with things
in the other person's boundary there
and there's transcending narrowly
focused values because once the conflict
becomes entrenched generally people find
it very difficult then to see multiple
perspectives and end up with quite
narrow focus and so an approach is to
actually open up the focus to other
possible values
so I'm going to start here with the
first approach improving Mutual
understanding and I'm going to give you
two case study examples of tackling
things with this approach and it's worth
saying that
um all of the mature methodologies
um will probably do more than one of
these things at a time but I think this
is it's useful to separate them those uh
separated into those three intervention
points because it helps you see
um ways into the conflict instead of
seeing a conflict as just a monolithic
entity
so the first project example I'm going
to give
um was a project on expanding Irrigation
in The Wider adapter The Wider wrapper
is a really dry farming area of New
Zealand it's mostly beef farming and
sheep which is really all you can do on
on dry land in in New Zealand and
um
a lot of money was being made by the
dairy industry now in order to convert
to Dairy the farmers needed to expand
irrigation but they knew that this was
going to be controversial because
um you've got a situation where a small
group of farmers had already committed
to doing it and wanted to persuade
others but the expense of building a dam
was going to be too large for that small
group of farmers to shoulder alone so
they were going to have to get everybody
in the region to
um
to commit to co-funding the irrigation
if a farmer
chose not to go in for it but ended up
paying for that irrigation and didn't
want to change their land use they would
end up as being unprofitable because
it's the the profitability of beef and
um and lamb is marginal whereas the
proper profitability of dairy was quite
huge so everybody had to go with it or
nobody had to go with it when we went in
there
um we had a discussion and we asked them
um how open they are to hearing
perspectives of people who might not
want to change their land use and they
actually said if we can't get agreement
with everybody then we won't go ahead
um so they were actually very open to
the dialogue but really believed it was
in the interests of the the whole region
um we used an approach called Q sort
which is usually operationalized as a
quantitative method but we we used it
um in a qualitative way and I'll show
you how
so the first thing you do is you take
the theme of whatever it is that people
want to look at and you find multiple
value statements on this so we trolled
the media and the internet looking for
Value statements around water
um we've got a wide range of value
statements also some of that came from
interviews with people in the locality
and we give the statements on cards to
people and ask them to order them on a
Continuum as individuals from agree to
disagree and here's what it looks like
you can see these um these two men here
are discussing
their orderings what they've done is put
them on a normal distribution so you've
got just a few that they strongly
disagree with just a few that they
strongly agree with and then you've got
a mass of ones they neither neither
disagree or agree with in the middle so
they order them in that way and it just
helps people visualize
um in a very quick way the the
similarities and differences between
each other
um now we did this qualitatively which
meant
um
that the people in the room were
basically circulated around and had
discussions about their similarities and
differences that was enough to get them
to um
see whether they had enough in common to
be able to move forward it's possible to
do this quantitative
quantitatively as well
if you wanted to do it quantitatively
you you basically take people's
orderings like this and you do a cluster
analysis and a cluster analysis doesn't
cluster the value statements like a
factor analysis would do it clusters the
people so what you see is
um who thinks broadly similarly to you
and who who thinks in a different way to
you and that just shatters people's
um uh stereotypes because they often
have similarities with people that they
thought they might disagree with
um and people can discuss the
implications of that now we didn't do
that quantitative
um phase because it just became
completely obvious through the uh
through the discussions between people
um that they broadly were uh in line and
um and they had really useful
discussions about points of disagreement
along the way
they went on in the end in this area
um to actually develop the irrigation so
they this actually headed off a
potential conflict rather than uh having
resolving one that um that already
existed
the second one is quite different in
some ways although it's the same basic
understanding about challenging
stereotypes this was highly conflictual
uh project where
um it was it was the genetic
modification debate in New Zealand uh
this work was led by Karen Cronin who's
one of my colleagues in New Zealand and
I came in really at the latter end of it
when we took her method that she'd been
developing in this work on genetic
modification and we started using it in
Industry to begin to have dialogue
around values around controversial areas
of Industrial Development but in this
case we were looking at genetic she was
looking at genetic modification and she
brought in 12 leading protagonists in
the genetic engineering debate ranging
from senior leaders in Monsanto through
to spiritual leaders Maori leaders
people in environmental movements
leading scientists on genetic
modification and one of the things you
need to know about genetic modification
in New Zealand is that the debate was
far more heated than it ever was in the
UK so you got situations where
um
where people had their cars pelted with
eggs where there was abuse being hurled
people wouldn't be willing to talk
together
um really quite vitriolic
slanging matches around this topic
so this is what the approach involves
so we started they
um Karen started by interviewing
something like 90 different people
um with a stake in in genetic
modification to determine the values
that pattern to people
and in a workshop then people can order
the issues from the core to the
peripheral and Karen talked about this
as as being a heart of the matter
analysis so what's at the heart of the
matter for you and one of the really
interesting things here is that just
about all of the stakeholders put
environmental issues at the heart of the
matter and that completely blew apart
the stereotypes because the Assumption
amongst environmental groups for example
is that the scientists doing the
research on genetic modification
wouldn't really be caring about the
environmental issues they they kind of
saw them as um in before coming in as
being kind of in the pockets of business
organizations really more interested in
the um the science than the
environmental effects but actually
issues of horizontal Gene transfer which
is about how genetic material can escape
from the organism into the environment
usually via a bacteria in the soil this
kind of thing
those kinds of issues were really
important to the scientists they were
doing a lot of work on that
um so that actually blew apart the
stereotypes and and started the
possibility for a common ground
discussion and there were really only
um it was only on spiritual issues that
there was really a difference between
the scientists and the um and some of
the campaign groups in the situation
because the campaign groups often put
spiritual issues quite high on their
agenda maybe the third ring out whereas
um the scientists put that right at the
edge but there was enough commonality
to enable a dialogue and for people to
agree to disagree on that kind of issue
so people discuss their orderings again
you can do this quantitatively or
qualitatively in this case it was done
qualitatively so people discuss their
orderings
or you can take it away and do an
analysis on it again what you're doing
is cluster analysis so it's clustering
the different stakeholders I've done
that myself in um in some work on
attitudes to drugs policy and again it
does blow apart the
um the stereotypes people hold because
you really don't have such quite
clear-cut
um
uh it's it's a lot less clear-cut than
you expect the alignment between
particular stakeholder groups and
particular perspectives
now one of the things that emerged from
this is policy options that both sides
could live with like continuing with
genetic experimentation but in the lab
so it was it wouldn't Escape so there
was enough commonality for real for real
policy options to emerge
so I'm going to go on now to the second
approach
and that's making connections across
boundaries
on my page
so this diagram here
um really don't pay attention to the
detail of it it's the
um the fact that it's a causal complex
causal Loop model that that matters and
um the basic idea here if you haven't
seen these before is that you're
representing people's perceptions of
causality
um in this kind of model now the the
model comes from a project that my team
in New Zealand did on
um the transmission of campylobacter
which is a food poisoning bacterium from
animals particularly dairy cattle to
humans via water so New Zealand has the
highest rate of Kampala back to food
poisoning in the oecd countries and the
government wanted to know why so they'd
committed commissioned some scientists
to investigate that and they'd come out
with the view that it's Dairy miles
pooing in the rivers and human beings
are picking up the bacteria through the
water system because a lot of the water
the waters uh that people drink in New
Zealand is untreated what was untreated
at that time
um and um of course that became
immediate front page headlines of the
newspapers because actually the dairy
industry accounts for more than 50
percent I think it's something like 56
percent of New Zealand exports so it's
huge when somebody criticizes the dairy
industry so it's front page news and
words like dirty Dairy we used that sent
the
um the Farmers Union and the and Farmers
themselves into a really kind of
um outraged
um reply and um it got to the point
where people were refusing to actually
engage together and
um a lot of the scientists work actually
depended on being able to have the
cooperation with the with the farmers
and the farmers were threatening to
withdraw their cooperation from the
science and it was getting very very
heated indeed
um so our group was called on not to
solve the problem
um around the transmission of of
campylobacter but to help get the sides
talking again so that you could have a
reasonable discussion about it and we
approached that by
um working with them on causal Loop
modeling so at the beginning people
wouldn't be weren't willing to actually
go in a workshop together so we talk
with people independently in small
groups and the area at the top for
example is is the farmer's view about
the human sewage system the area to the
left is the scientist view about cows
and there are actually lots of other
bits and pieces that were involved as
well in people's modeling and once
they'd actually built their individual
models they were quite ready then to
come together because they thought their
task was going to be to justify their
perspective to other stakeholders but
when we got them in the room we did
something a little naughty we we pulled
the rug from out from under them because
instead of asking them to to justify
their perspectives we asked them instead
to walk around the room and look at
other people's models and find things
that in those models that causally
connected to things in their own models
and across a morning we built up this
kind of picture that you see here and it
gradually began to Dawn on people that
you can't talk about
um one area of campylobacter infection
in isolation from others the it was
compiler back to flowing through the
whole system and
um
and and it just didn't make sense to
bound the system in such narrow ways now
once you people began to have that
realization they actually were started
to talk reasonably again
um and some of the interventions were
really simple like things like people
washing their hands after they've been
in fields with with cattle but
um the point is that we got the
stakeholders back on side discussing
again and interestingly the the
scientists were saying that um this
model will give them 10 years of
research now to quantify it
um which was a kind of spin-off benefit
for them
second one is the one I mentioned
earlier where the conflict had become
really
um strong between
um
farmers in the Canterbury region of New
Zealand so
um the Agriculture and Horticulture and
Forestry in Canterbury accounts for 40
of the exports of New Zealand again
therefore it's massively important to
the government of New Zealand
um
they've been an entrenched Conflict for
25 years
um I I'd been to public meetings where
people were literally just standing up
and screaming at each other
um the um the uh conflict was so intense
with Farmers basically saying that it's
unacceptable that the Regional Council
is restricting its water use even though
it's dry land that they need access to
the to the rivers and you've got you had
the council itself an environmental
stakeholders basically saying that
um
Canterbury is one of the few places in
the world world that has braided rivers
with um its natural ecosystems intact
and those have to be protected against
pollution at all costs so we had that
kind of conflict lasting for a
generation the council the council
itself couldn't Solve IT initially well
for that 25 years they were split 50 50
between urban stakeholders who took the
environmental stance and Rural
stakeholders who took the um the
farmer's dance and so they're often ties
in Council meetings with only the chairs
voting to be able to to move it forward
so politics wasn't going to solve this
problem a news chief executive came in
by the name of Brian Jenkins and
um it's he should really have the credit
for this work I got called in to do some
consultancy on it halfway through the
program
um but I'll I'll talk you through what
we did
so he started Brian Jenkins started
after kind of
getting his feet under the table in the
job and learning about the situation he
hired a consultancy company to use open
strategy which is a systems approach
strategy to consult on a full range of
values and uses around water so they
went out to literally every town and
Village in the region and held public
meetings where they where they gathered
value statements and
um Brian came to me after that exercise
was completed because they had 40 000
value statements about water and he kind
of said to me what the hell can I do
with 40 000 value statements it's just
too complex to to deal with
um so I was asking him if
um it's possible to condense those into
key value statements what's what's
driving that amount of variety and he
said well it's often connected with
local water bodies but actually there's
some standard themes and so they
condense them into 10 key decision areas
or or value value statements that would
have to be dealt with so there were
things like water quantity how much can
you take for irrigation water quality
um how pure is the water and will it
support biodiversity which was another
area climate change was another area
there were 10 areas in total that would
have find
and I suggested to him that he works
with a selection of key stakeholders who
he knows have very deep feelings on the
issues but are still open-minded to
listen to other perspectives and he said
well that's great because I've got an
Advisory board that is already in that
position so there's 20 people willing to
do that and I double checked with him
that these are people who will actually
go back to their constituency and have
that dialogue with them and won't just
won't just be closed in the room and he
said absolutely they will so we ended up
doing an exercise of strategic Choice
with them
and one of the core exercises in the uh
in strategic choice is to identify
decision areas so we already had 10 of
them to look at what the policy options
might be for each of those decision
areas
and then
you don't just look for the
compatibilities between policy options
in the different decision areas you look
for key incompatibilities and that
quickly separates out what you can and
can't do together so for example if you
want to increase irrigation
you can't at the same time have improved
water quality because taking water out
condenses the pollutants and lowers the
water quality unless that is you can
find water from another source which was
one of the things that they actually did
um and that allowed them to identify
alternative feasible strategies which
they can then take out
um to consultation with the community uh
now there were three essential
strategies the first one was
um
uh Environmental Protection above all
else so an absolute moratorium on taking
more water for irrigation and they have
said in that case we we simply
sacrificed any any of the goals for
economic growth the second option was
economic growth above all else in which
case the environmental Integrity of the
rivers would be sacrificed and they
would simply accept they were going to
be damned and um and and the water would
be used for irrigation and the third
strategy was one that evolved throughout
the workshops which was a really quite
creative one because they realized that
a lot of the farmers were using out of
date technology and you could have a lot
of water savings by using better methods
for irrigation and that there's also ice
on the Alps the mountains nearby that
could be used to to irrigate rather than
taking it from the rivers so they the
the Third Way was not about balance
between environments and economics it
was a more creative solution they ended
up going for that and they reduced water
consumption by 80 percent so while the
option to build a dam was still on the
table they actually didn't need it
because they got the water either from
the Alps or they had these massive water
savings now when we took out those
options to public consultation it was a
completely different atmosphere there
were still people disagreeing in the
room but people were talking reasonably
about it and there wasn't a consensus on
that this third strategy was the one
that needed to go forward now that
consensus really uh spread right across
at the Canterbury region but it didn't
extend to national government and what
happened is that national government
ended up
um
moving in and they abolished the
regional elected Authority they were so
upset that they had found this Third Way
rather than going for economic
development above all else that they
abolished the elected Authority and put
in a quango of 12 uh
government-appointed individuals to run
the water system with a view to them
overturning this water strategy
um and what I what one of the amazing
things that shows the robustness of this
work was that it only took them two
weeks to reaffirm the strategy because
once they actually talked to all the
stakeholders and realized how difficult
it was going to be to get any kind of
agreement if they didn't follow this
strategy
um they they actually changed their mind
so it kind of shows you the robustness
of this kind of systems work mixing the
bridging of boundaries with widespread
Community engagement
so now on to the third
um
approach here which is around
transcending narrowly focused values
um in this case I'm going to
um only show one case study in the
interest of brevity because I think my
time is going to come to an end soon
um
this is a case where again it's a
situation where a group of farmers
wanted to build a dam
um and they wanted us to do a
feasibility study for that Dam but we
said we wouldn't do that if they take uh
as a starting point that they must have
a dam why don't we open up the
possibility that there could be other
options
um now they had done some research to
show that water was already 20 over
allocated in the region and during our
work on this
um we had scientists doing some further
work and they were actually ended up
showing that they were 60 over allocated
so drought was a major problem and there
was no potential for expanding
um industry
um if there if there wasn't some kind of
dam
now what we were told in no uncertain
terms is that this has to if we want to
have widespread Community consultation
we have to do that
in the format of a two and a half hour
public meeting so it was a challenge to
us to develop a systems approach that
you could actually Implement in just two
and a half hours and could be really
quite tightly facilitated
um so what we ended up doing is running
two workshops we we ran a workshop with
the landowners and and some of the
um other stakeholders related to farming
we ran a second Workshop
um with the community
Anglers kayakers all the various uh
other stakeholders Hunters
um they're bird watchers all sorts of
people came to that second workshop and
some of the farmers came in as observers
so they could see what other people were
saying and we started the
um the workshop with key facts about
Water Systems it was just 10 minutes on
showing people how the rivers connect
underground because we didn't want them
to make naive assumptions about what was
possible without having some of that
biophysical knowledge
just took 10 minutes to do that and then
we explored meanings of drought to
different stakeholders that was really
important because we needed people to
hear that drought was important to
everyone
it's not just the farmers who were who
wanted more water for irrigation but
kayakers couldn't kayak properly if the
rivers were low Anglers couldn't get the
fish if if the rivers were low these
kinds of things
then we identified values that mattered
we used a diagram a bit like that heart
of the matter diagram I put up earlier
except it was less rings and we
identified
um values that mattered to different
groups and then we simply are uh took
large sheets of paper and we put
um various options for water management
that people had identified
along the top and the values that
mattered to people along the bottom and
we asked people to go into small groups
and evaluate the options against the
full range of values and these were
qualitative statements put in not not
numbers and
it was really interesting uh the the
small group I was in for example there
was a woman there who was absolutely
saying at the beginning that we mustn't
have a new dam and then when she
listened to people and it it she began
to realize that actually they couldn't
uh address drought without a dam because
water conservation would only
um achieve about 10 water efficiencies
and it was already more over allocated
than that so Adam was going to have to
be an option then the question meant uh
the question became what kind of dam and
also how could you stop
um the the region getting into this
state in future so a lot of people were
saying if we build a dam
the farmers are just going to put more
land into productive use and we're going
to go back into the same situation in 10
years time where we're going to be over
allocated so let's have a a
sustainability policy that
um allows more water be to be taken but
with limits so that you don't get into
that same over allocated position in
future and that's the policy that
emerged from that work
um so we reported that as part of a
feasibility study but I think the real
gains actually happened in those
workshops and I think the um
the the proof of that comes in what
happened after this project was over
because the council in its wisdom
um we'd actually investigated two
possible rivers that could be damned and
stakeholders had a clear preference on
one of those two rivers and the council
in its wisdom
um suddenly announced that it was going
to look at a third River
and when they put it out for
um public consultation all of the
objections
um were to damning that Third River and
um the um because it had already been
worked through on the other two rivers
what what the uh option was and what
they ended up doing was go back to the
river that everybody had agreed on
so
what I've done is present these three
different approaches to
um
to intervening in value conflicts we
we've got the
um
the challenging of stereotypes we've got
the making links across boundaries and
we've got the transcending narrow value
uh positions but I would just want to
end with a few words on connecting with
decision making because you can do this
kind of participative work and then
report to decision makers that is the
usual approach
um and um the alternative is to actually
involve the decision makers in workshops
and that that actually allows them to
learn directly from engaging with people
who bring different perspectives in into
the room it's the reason why in that
last project I mentioned we brought the
farmers into the room
um but silently listening so they could
hear what the um what the stakeholders
were saying and they were shocked that
productive land use and and
profitability of the Farms was pretty
low down on their on people's list of
priorities and they was saying to us
afterwards a lot of these people are
employed by us don't they realize that
they're going to bring their own jobs
into question if they don't don't affect
this but that listening really made a
difference to them because they
understood
um
they understood
how they could actually address a
broader range of values
so direct engagement can support deeper
learning than just reading a report so
it's much more likely to inform decision
making now I appreciate there are some
contexts and government is one of them
where that's very different difficult
indeed you can get the civil servants
involved but it's often very difficult
to get the politicians involved I've had
a few projects where I've been able to
bridge bridge that with the politicians
as well but more often or not they will
just want to reserve the final decision
nevertheless the more participation you
can get the better in my view so I'll um
I'll leave it there and open up to
comments and questions thank you
Gerald thank you so much for that's
fascinating to see how the Dynamics of
the interactions worked
um any quick I mean we have time for
about 10 minutes worth of questions
um I see straight away miles hand up and
um Williams hand up so can I go to
William first please
you'll mute them and there you go we can
hear it's not actually a hand up it was
a clap
oh oh very well thank you
um congratulations thank you very much
Russ you do have a hand up I do thank
you I think Jesse got a hand up before I
did though
of exposing people to the context in a
way that lets them make better choices
uh which they don't do when they're
thinking by themselves doing in the
closet or whatever
um no in the U.S we have two very large
groups of people at each other's throats
constantly
who is going to be wise enough to ask
for help
um because it seems that if they both
are highly
devoted to America
with totally different understandings of
what that means
and has changed the language
substantially so that it it's doubly
hard to communicate anyway who who would
ask for help
this this is the issue is getting people
in the room in the first place
um in each of these conflict situations
people have reached a point where they
were
um well we could create the conditions
where they would be ready to talk and I
have seen experiments online bringing
um people with very different political
Persuasions in the us together in a
social setting to to have dialogues and
it really does it is possible to bridge
those kinds of perspectives but
um the way politics is constructed
um actually Miller takes against that
it's the reason why in the in the um
late 1980s I chose to lead politics I
used to be a member of a political party
and I chose to leave because
um
I found that it was conflict all the way
down you would often have two factions
um not only do you have two political
parties in the UK it's labor and
conservative buying but then within the
parties you often have two factions over
every issue
um and then within those factions you
have two more factions vying for it it's
just conflict all the way down and it's
a a simplistic construction of arguments
and as I began to see myself being
forced by other people to take sides I
said it's time to withdraw because I can
I'd got to the point now at this point
where I realized that I was um wanting
to work in systems thinking and this was
a better way basically so I I chose to
step out
I did a quick search
um and I can't find anything recent from
you apart from two calls for papers
which very was very tempting
um have you published anything you said
that this is a new uh this is a new
systems theory of value conflict so my
I'm researching ambidexterity so I'm
interested in the micro foundations and
you know this could be lovely but it's
the conflict that interests me anything
published maybe you can put it in the
chat as as we go through the next one
yeah there's there's a working paper a
research memorandum from 2016 that has
this this talk and I it's in a
conference proceeding as well I've got
it half turned into a journal paper and
I haven't finished it yet it's been
sitting there for about three years
waiting to get finished
um anything you could share I would yeah
well I'll share the um I'll share am I
able able to upload a document to the
chat yes yes you can put a link as well
yeah
there isn't unfortunately the university
and its wisdom
um when it refreshed our websites wiped
out all our research memorandum so I've
got a copy on my my uh I'll say I'll put
my email directly so in case okay if
that's easier let Toby carry on with the
proceedings thank you so much a
wonderful wonderful lecture thank you
thanks
thank you so much
um any other questions or thoughts I
mean there are quite a few questions in
the chat

um
interestingly what the Joe raised the
whole series of questions around the
subject to values about the sort of you
know what what are value statements what
are values to what extent how do values
sort of related and whether you wanted
to comment to that journal about the
idea of
what what our values how do they work
how do they how are they structured okay
so the way I use the term values there
are different different views on how you
use the term values I use it to mean
um
the the things that matter to people in
a context of action
um and I'm very specific about that
because I'm not talking about
um General virtues like kindness or
benevolence or
um uh these sorts of things
um it's what matters to people in the
context of action so it's a little bit
broader than purposes because you can
say purposes
um let's let's think of an example so
the um an environmentalist may want to
be protecting uh the uh aquatic
environment for Native species
um and their values may be around
biodiversity so it's a little bit
broader than just protecting this River

um
yeah
interesting
um Jesse asked another question on the
chat which I think is the the being a
profession of constructive engagement
facilitators
um I would like it to people like you
and other systems thinkers but um the
issue seems to be not whether there are
people but whether there are others
willing to allow us to be engaged
yeah I mean all I can say is that I've I
feel like we've gone past a Tipping
Point on this now
um and I can only say that about the UK
I can't comment about the USA the USA
seems to be particularly entrenched
still but
um if you think about the systems
thinking community of practice in
government now last year there were 300
members of it this year there's 600
that's a doubling in one year of people
who are self-identifying as a systems
thinkers in in government I mean that's
hugely encouraging I mean we we all hope
it's not just a fad
um but um still it it means that there
are a lot of people out there
appreciating that you can't handle
complexity
um using some of the more traditional
approaches
um if you really want to get somewhere
on these kinds of working problems
cool thank you
um I think I'm going to bring it sort of
to a close because I think we are ready
for a break oh uh but I see one last
hand up so Willa if your question is
quick and you can get go for a quick
answer then we can we can fit you in
yeah it was just um you know within
software development users stories user
cases yeah is there a similarity here in
terms of the way in which you express
value
um
okay
um it's interesting you that you said
value there that I mean I would make a
distinction between value and values
um because people talk about value
um in in relation to what they can get
out of something and values
um uh I think more to do with them
what's what's surrounding what matters
to people in relation to that uh context
of action value tends to be perverted
often into a more economic uh kind of
analysis uh
so I'll give you an example as a as a
fisherman as a fisherman I would like to
have
um water quality that is able to support
the indigenous fish
yeah so that would be a value statement
yeah yes that makes sense yeah so in
actual fact there is a certain
similarity between the two and then
there's a simple method that one could
use to actually enable people to make
these statements yes yes yes
I did have an interesting discussion
with somebody in um one of the a large
multinational I won't say which but they
were talking a lot about value mapping
and when I said the you know value the
word value in that context and the
values
um in uh
it's it's the same basic route this guy
was absolutely shocked and he was saying
uh you're right we could actually we can
actually think in um in values terms and
then I was saying and think about
service too that service has um those
double meanings you've got services and
Commercial service but Service as in
service to others and uh yeah we had an
interesting discussion interesting thank
you Gerald
um thank you ever so much Gerald for um
um coming and speaking to us and sort of
opening up this really interesting space
um once again of course
um and I hope that uh that your session
tomorrow whatever you're doing that
leads you to be away from home in a
hotel room is okay
