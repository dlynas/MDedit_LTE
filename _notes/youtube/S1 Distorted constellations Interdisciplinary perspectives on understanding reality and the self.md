S1: Distorted constellations: Interdisciplinary perspectives on understanding reality and the self
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qv1gnETHm8)

## Transcript:
let's see
all right for those people that are in
person uh welcome to Symposium one
distorted constellations uh
interdisciplinary perspectives on
understanding reality in the self the
speakers for the Symposium are all
joining us virtually so I'm going to
turn it over to them to introduce the
session to you further when we get to q
a portions of the talk I'm going to also
be monitoring the in-person questions so
if you do have a question when it's time
for questions just watch over to the mic
and I'll make sure that you're folded in
alternating with virtual questions as
well all right so we'll get started
okay thank you
um Erica and um thank you for welcoming
us to this session distorted
constellations interdisciplinary
perspectives on understanding reality
and the self I will keep talking unless
someone tells me that they can't hear me
um I do hope in Toronto that if you feel
comfortable enough and want to wear a
mask that you are doing so I would
highly advise that
um so um my name's zarima ochu I'm a I'm
about to become actually an associate
professor in immersive media at the
University of West England I'm
until September at Manchester
Metropolitan University in the northwest
of England and my background is in
neuroscience and I also trained as a
Storyteller so it's my great Delight to
be able to bring this interdisciplinary
contributed symposia together with some
very incredible artists and researchers
so um the focus today and I kind of
wanted to kick us off by saying that
we're going to have a series of talks
but we're going to have some
conversation in between each talk that
will make connections between the work
of our artists uh Wando ibizi and then
there'll be opportunities for questions
which of course you can put your
questions in the chat we'll pick those
up and I should say that for Francesca
paletta who unfortunately is not with us
today because she had clinical
commitments and some and personal uh
challenges so um the session lasts
roughly 90 minutes and um
I'm hoping that actually we might not
take all of that time but let's see
where we get to so to kind of introduce
um our our contributed symposia
um the first thing that I wanted to say
is that we want to kind of get you in a
bit of a state of mind that will bring
all of yourselves to this and to be
really grounded in thinking about what
you want to get from this session and so
if you can do take a breath and then
think about answering this question and
then I'm going to introduce Wando
so the first kind of question and I
would love for people to put kind of
answers into the chat is to
think about how far could you imagine
the sky how far could you imagine the
sky if you feel like it I'd love you to
share your answer and where you're
located and if you feel like it your
disciplinary specialism it's not a trick
question it's just to get a sense of of
who's in the room and how we kind of all
think a little bit differently
so yeah I'd love it if people would uh
feel like they could um drop that in the
chat if you're in the room you might
just want to to write it down and we
could hear about that a little bit later
okay so
let's see I'm going to stop sharing now
and I'm going to introduce our our first
speaker
um
so where are you
where are you one Wando oh hello yeah hi
so wonder is EB is a multi-disciplinary
artist whose work converges around art
personas experimental theater
Neuroscience music and African diasporic
ritualistic dance wando's unique strand
of afrofuturism and Research into
cognition is inspired by her
neurodiversity and live art
participatory practice
so we're going to hear from one of those
particular perspective on a condition uh
response I would imagine to a condition
that's known as visual snow it's a
neurological condition and in the
literature it says that it's experiences
augmented reality of auras glowing lines
depression anxiety and depersonalization
and whilst visual snow can produce a
collection of different symptoms it has
now been clinically recognized and
Francesca per leader if you've been here
would say that people living with this
condition were crucial for the diversity
of this condition to be described and
the symptoms to be described and and the
the condition to be understood
that was first described in the
literature in 1995. I'm going to hand
over now to Wando who's going to give us
bring us into her world and her lived
experience of the condition through her
work distorted constellations

much that introduction um
that first slide and so um Sophie Scott
is also with us he's a really important
part of the team's been an important
part of this project
um okay so I'm just going to share my
screen
um
and so we can begin
nope of course this is going wrong
already
stop share
sorry having slight technical difficulty
which is
course what we want
I'm gonna just start this all again
hey
such a screen
that's looking good okay we're good to
go
so I'm just gonna play
um a little bit of footage and it's
going to show you
um a clip of the piece that I created
distorted constellations in one of its
iterations
foreign
so in my work as a multi-disciplinary
artist I create alternate realities and
invite visitors into these worlds one
such project is the one that I'm sharing
with you today distorted constellations
and you just saw a little clip of it
there you're going to see a lot more of
it during this talk
um so the idea of constellation is a
phenomenological approach that I have
taken on for myself to kind of like
spatially physically understand my inner
world and how it connects to the outer
world
I have attempted to reach out of my own
perceptual bubble to connect with others
and in the work that I do revealing my
own perception I try and hold up a
mirror to people for them to see their
own
this constellation that I've created has
invited in researchers from ritual
practice action research and the
cognitive Sciences
each representing an aspect of my own
personal way of making sense of the
world my perspective is post-colonial
it's neurodivergent and it's
interdisciplinary I would sometimes
describe myself as a natural philosopher
um and in this talk I'm going to be
sharing my approach to firstly
understanding my own cognition through
the cross-disciplinary science way that
I work I'm really interested in Sharing
how this could be a useful model for
scientists and artists to work together
to create citizen science to create art
as science experiment for the
advancement of scientific understanding
and finally I want to
um explore how vital it is that those
that the science is about are included
in its design how it's studied and
shared and in that I'm very inspired by
the social model of disability and I'm
interested in creating provocations
around the medical model of disability
when exploring neurodiversity
so the
um really came from from from the idea
of understanding that perception is a
process of inference making a best guess
of what is out there in the world given
sensory inputs and our prior knowledge
of the world
um I wanted to create this piece of art
in order to help people understand that
their limited window on reality was
subjective
the desire was to create an immersive
installation that would externalize my
internal reality demonstrating and
normalizing the subjectivity of
perception
the project began in 2016 and runs to
this day and it offers a process and a
way of approaching the world
it constellates layers of cognitive
science represented by the different
scientists that I collaborate with
moving from cellular through to the
cognitive psychological out to society
public Consciousness with me in the
center as an important in a link with my
lived experience of visual snow syndrome
um it uses augmented reality techniques
to immerse and draw you into an altered
perception so to better understand the
other or to better understand the
impossibility of fully understanding the
other rather to understand yourself
as one on an infinite spectrum of
possibilities
so background to creating the piece
um
as far back as I can remember I've seen
the world in a way that was apparently
not the accepted Norm
in 2014 this came to a head after a
series of conversations with family and
friends when I began to ask them clearly
do you see what I see
and I'd ask when you look at the sky do
you see the sparkling fizzy dots when
you look at the lights do you see
streams of light sparkling and these
were all questions that I'd asked as a
child but I'd never really received
satisfactory answers
I went to see the optician and they
confirmed that there was nothing that
they could see wrong with my eyes they
couldn't explain the visual phenomena
that I was experiencing
but still the people around me that I
talk to up to that point were not
experiencing the same reality
and often they'd suggest that I was
mistaken that I didn't see what I
claimed to see or that there was a
logical explanation such as glitter that
had fallen into my eyes
I mean I was really interested in this
misplaced argument from incredulity or
the appeal to Common Sense and it was
something that I came up against again
and again and I found out it's really
common for people with perceptual
differences
so I began the search to find an
explanation for what I perceived to
explain my reality and in that year I
found a paper that just been written
that that really coined this condition
um visual snow syndrome
and it's the first time I'd really found
a clear description of how I describe
and elements of My reality
so
um I um from the quotes that quotations
from that paper there
um and I approached one of the authors
of that paper
um professor godsby and began a research
project into perception
and this began a string of projects
where I was collaborating with
Scientists at art galleries including at
the welcome collection in London and
that culminated with the creation of
distorted constellations in 2019
so what do I see
um it's a world full to the brim of
glowing lines and shapes whizzing
fizzing dots auras that glowing around
around all the objects in my visual
field
when I experienced sensory overload or
stress or strenuous activity the visuals
can grow very intense and kaleidoscopic
and can amass into pulsating geometric
shapes
on a clear day looking at the sky it
seems like it's just full of trillions
of fizzy dots
um you could describe it as a kind of
transparent bluish TV static
um or it might be described as a bit
like a pointless painting
um when it all gets very intense it can
form into an optical migraine or a
migraine Aura and the sound might begin
to kind of coalesce with the light and I
could get a lot of pressure in my head
um
so
most people who experience visual snow
syndrome also have a host of other
symptoms
including
starbursting Halos auras double vision
and these are some that I experience
and then there's also non-visual
symptoms some of which I've tried to
capture in some of the sound work that
I've made
um ringing humming buzzing sounds
tinnitus
depersonalization
anxiety brain fog dizziness there's a
hollow symptoms
thank you
so inextricably linked to subjective
perception visual snow syndromes
manifestations I think offer a
fascinating case for how near a
difference can Inspire appreciation and
understanding of diversity sensation and
unfixed realities
visual snow nose syndrome it's a
never-ending refracting reality it is a
space full of spaces in all its
amorphous blossoming it contains
universes of parallel realities
one filled to the brim with visual noise
a pointless painting come to life and
spread across the sky
a landscape littered with landscapes
its existence poses questions about the
nature of reality
as an experience it suggests a
physicality to the intangible
like a rumbling GIF it reveals the cross
modality of the senses
the world of visual snow is Rich never
still broken and breaking over and over
again
there are layers of reality each Speck
of dust has its shadow self each spot of
light and time has its sister spot of
light in the past past is overlaid onto
future reality augmented
visual snow is a labyrinth offering the
person submerged within its walls a
never-ending Journey it is a framework
for stories to tell yourself about
yourself
illness neurodiversity magic sci-fi all
a possible Mythic palette from which to
paint the colors of your own story
it is a patina rough and raw scratched
across your eyelids that reveals
something of yourself and Mark it says
is this what the brain is is this how
the brain works
I'm aware that I hold contrasting
realities in my mind at the same time in
a way I've always known that the visual
phenomena were both like there and not
there kind of like how when I lucid
dream
um I'm aware that I am asleep but I'm
somehow conscious
and one question that's come up for me
is could this have led to a unique way
of relating to reality and is there
something interesting in this to share
as a multi-disciplinary artist I work
across many different art forms
installation Sound Performance and
ritual and this project was designed
within the fields of immersion utilizing
virtual reality augmented reality and
mixed reality because I think VSS as a
phenomena is an interesting analog to
all these Technologies
so I think it tells us not only
interesting things about how the brain
works and how reality is perceived but
also could hold interesting ideas for
scientists and technologists and
philosophers to collaborate
visual snow is a revelation of an
unknown world
a parallel universe living side by side
revealing that we all inhabit our own
just Within Reach of the next person
it's a denial of absolutes there is no
black for somebody with VSS indeed a
common cause for very real distress for
people who have a sudden onset of VSS is
the fact that they will never again see
the color black
and there is no white equally apparently
I've never seen those colors there's
just no opacity
all of space and matter and stuff are
connected by a never-ending stream of
content information World Without End
reality is slippery
visual snow is a piece of electronic
music trees Echo
Birds reverberate light saturates
air coalesces into analog static

she who experiences visual snow realizes
that reality is constantly being
repeated matter distorting and bending
and she creates herself
she finds visual snow syndrome at the
intersection of ritual myth and
Neuroscience and so phenomenological
approach makes sense
self-repeated
another self is next to herself The
Other Self is another possibility of
what one could be it's a self in a
parallel Dimension if she had only
she sees her mirror self in an infinite
regress of possible possibilities

visual snow is an ocean it is a black
Atlantic a sea of possible
interpretations double Consciousness a
world teeming with mysterious sensory
information a Dream Within A Dream
visual snow is a ghost plane A Wasteland
of broken fragments the ghost fragments
dance and fade play like spectral
children and half-forgotten Melodies are
haunting
visual snow is a time machine visual no
is a Shadowland a distorted mirror world
of all these things is I made a piece of
work about
to see
if I hold up the mirror to others
perceptual realities held them up
against mine what would they see of
themselves
what could they understand about the
subjectivity of reality
so
I'm circling to a point I think I think
this is this is the constellation for me
it's it's really consolating all these
areas and ideas
um but to try and sum it up I think the
ideas behind it
were really about encompassing this
phenomenological approach to the to
accessing the concept of reality I want
to see how I can create an immersive
Tech piece of psya that could do the
following it could give an experience of
a neurodivergent reality creating a
neurodivergent LED space
it could create art as science
experiment
it could create a playground where
scientists can become artists and
artists can become scientists and
participants engaging in the scientific
process through creative workshops
ritualized site art performances and
immersive provocations and I wanted to
offer a real contribution to the current
landscape of neurodiversity research
I also wanted to demonstrate and
normalize the subjectivity of perception
creating opening points for people to
discover perhaps that they have VSS in a
safe space where there's information
about where to go next
I've also tried to create pockets of
community for people who have VSS to
feel seen heard and understood
as it's coming from many neurodivergent
people vs sufferers can report High
incidence of depression anxiety and
other debilitating hidden psychological
issues and so I hope sharing my
explorations of the condition creatively
and demonstrating the positive impact
it's had on my mental health could help
others
the exhibition as Festival the
installation as research projects would
also provide conversations with
researchers working in cognitive science
um where the neurodivergent could find
creative ways of expressing their own
neurology
so we've already talked a little bit
about how it's functioned as a research
project in the multiple respects across
its iterations
in the iterations in Manchester Brighton
and London we also had a sensory space
where people could spend a lot of time
they could write draw paint and talk to
an access artist
over 50 000 people have experienced
distorted constellation so far in person
and online and that's been a really
diverse range of people
um and people have reported
um also their own neurodiversity within
their Communications with us and it's
also been a wide range of people with
different disabilities and we've
collected lots of information in the
form of drawings writings essays and
doodles
we've also recorded written
um and and vocalized responses so it's
been really helpful to know that it
actually exists I'm I'm really grateful
that this exhibition has happened and
there's been a neurologist talking about
it and hopefully more people will
recognize that this is what they have I
mean it's really difficult to gauge how
other people who don't have it might
perceive all those things
it was a really stressful my under
microscope version of of sometimes the
way I perceive my visual snow I
um and it really made me question and
it's like I said a practicing artist
um I'm a bit of designer
and I I maybe think that I couldn't um
couldn't produce something because my
vision of the world was um I questioned
my vision of the world so much more than
I had before and how could that be
relevant to other people
coming here today has been incredible
because
um I've seen someone who has vigil snow
who's created an incredible like I
really like
an immersive installation that's really
effective I think I found it really
moving and effective my parents did as
well and like they don't visual snow at
all and I've seen a lot of people here
today like enjoying that and responding
to the work so it's making me feel like
I can do it too you know I'll go out
there and I'm gonna pursue my artistic
career the plum so thank you very much
um in the London iteration we also had
an action researcher who conducted a
project and wrote a paper interrogating
the visitors experience of
neurodiversity accessibility as well as
the impact of this form of research on
the experience itself
in Manchester Brighton and London there
are a series of talks workshops and
happenings led by artists and scientists
to explore in depth the sources
knowledges and possibilities that came
to and from the exhibition
in London I invited Sophie Scott and
writer Joe mugs to co-present a salon
the approach was to layer ritual actions
inspired by ASMR autonomous sensory
Meridian response in order to bring
people into a relaxed state to make them
gently open to suggestion and intimacy
so here you can see
um some of the people lying down they're
very relaxed there's also performers an
acting ritual actions including touch
also cooking some pancakes which went
down very well
um so so this this kind of performative
ritualized approach was
um was was layered underneath the
conversation with Sophie about
neurodiversity reality and the self
which she will talk about a bit more in
a while
um and the Hope was the mixture of these
Technologies approaches would permeate
layers of defense against perceived
ideas of difficulty or the abstract
abstractness of cognitive science
leaving people more open to receiving
the ideas
and finally in um in the science Gallery
in Melbourne which was the last
iteration of the show that we presented
um Simon Cropper
um and I conducted a research and Simon
will be sharing more detailed
information into the study that we
conducted later on
a fundamental importance to this whole
journey has been finding ways to make
the work accessible for others and
myself
I wanted to create an exhibition and a
project that would be a way of
continuing to discover my own brain my
own needs and myself
um
in last year in 2021
um I created the stores of
constellations Volume 2 which was this
online iteration of it
um a 360 degree video environment that
can be accessed on social media
audiences are invited to locate
representations of their own perceptions
and engage with new possibilities and
share their experiences across social
media and this was made in collaboration
with designers filmmakers and Technical
experts
and use specialized sound
and we can see a little bit of it
um this isn't
unfortunately this isn't in um 360
degrees because it's a I don't know I
couldn't show it but you can see some of
the visual snow symptoms that were made
there and these all versions of me
dancing
um
yeah
so that's that
um we also made um a visual snow
syndrome filter for Instagram
um and the filter allows the users to
layer their own surroundings with a
selection of visual snow syndrome
effects through the phone camera
and it also has audio symptoms
um the interesting thing for me with
this is using augmented reality to
Signal the potent the potential of these
kinds of filters which are all in common
use as a useful tool to better
understanding and potentially even
diagnosing visual snow syndrome
and you can see this is a little um
video example of what it looks like to
look through a feet into a field
so one of my questions in creating this
project has been around empathy my own
understanding of it versus the
scientific framing of the word versus
people's General understanding of it
um what is it to try and evoke one's
perceptual experience can it build
empathy can people feel a connection to
someone else's perception
um I've found that people definitely see
themselves in the mirror of the work but
equally people reported feeling a sense
of the impossibility of empathy they
might have realized for the first time
how impossible it is to truly inhabit
somebody else's perceptual reality
being in the installation in that space
you can feel other people feeling as
well so this is the reason that I
recommend people to come and to see to
share their feelings
with each other

so to kind of bring this to a close
um I'd say distorted constellations uses
augmented reality techniques to immerse
and draw you into an altered perception
so to better understand the other or to
better understand the impossibility and
build a fully understanding of the other
its knowledges of Neuroscience myth and
ritual combined to offer a
neurophonometrical perspective as well
as an afrofuturist landscape towards
transformation it raises questions for
us all
given the problems in our world created
by extremist thought and trench biases
are there ways for artists and
scientists to collaborate on Research to
create spaces for changing Behavior
what could happen if people outside the
scientific Community could understand
the subjective nature of reality
what can VSS as a perceptual difference
reveal to developers and Technology to
designers of new realities
is it possible to separate the disease
from the idea of neurodiversity I.E
following the social model of disability
to treat the debilitating symptoms
whilst accepting a difference in
perception and what difference could
that make to the patient psychologically
how could this lead to a difference in
treatment for people with perceptual
differences or sensory sensitivities
and finally how can we utilize the tools
of Art in diagnosis in understanding the
self and in understanding reality

thank you
thank you Wando
I wanted I wanted to
um now invite
um Professor Sophie Scott and I have
just updated oh
um what we were provided
um because obviously um Professor Sophie
Scott leads the speech communication Lab
at The Institute of cognitive
neuroscience at University College
London in the UK Sophie is a cognitive
neuroscientist whose research is focused
on the neural basis of vocal
communication how our brains process the
information in speech and voices and how
our brains control the production of our
voice I'm going to hand over to Sophie
to give her talk and and welcome her to
the stage and then there's going to be
some questions and discussion between
Wando and Sophie who's been
collaborating with Wando
thank you very much thank you very much
Rondo for that presentation and um I'm
just going to share my slides
yeah sound on brilliant
what I've done here is I've forgotten
that I've put my slides right for this
now so let's get back to the beginning
my turn to Fantastic
so um I'm going to talk about
neurodiversity and neural difference and
I'm not really going to be talking about
um the sort of intense
experiences that can be associated with
what sometimes considered to be you know
for example developmental disorders or
issues but I'm expanding it out into
um just thinking about difference and
what we can learn in neuroscience and
cognitive science by embracing
difference and listening to the
difference so for example a very kind of
common way of thinking in my area of
cognitive Neuroscience is to think you
know let's let's look at brain areas
that are processing speech and kind of
group everybody in there but because
what we're interested in are the brain
areas that are uncommon to everybody and
you can do that and you can find some
interesting areas that's not an
interesting thing to do when we start
looking at individual differences beyond
that what we tend to do is still think
in a very kind of linear way so we look
for a sort of a spectrum along which
people vary and then flip for brain
areas that vary along those same kind of
parameters and I think it may be worth
again that's a very important thing to
do but I think also sometimes things can
just be different and I think thinking
about those differences and actually the
best way of capturing those and thinking
about those has been very interesting
for me
um primarily actually is I've had to
work with people like wendo people who
are artists and who have kind of guided
how I've developed a study based on
their experience of what they do
um
so I just want to start with an example
of this so here are the brain systems
that are recruited when you do what I'm
doing right now and that's speaking
aloud it's an incredibly robust brain
system you tend to find very similar
areas in everybody you get auditory
cortex activated sensory motor cortex
classic Brokers area the left inferior
frontal jarus on the left and you get
some cortical Fields it's so robust that
you can sort of see something very
similar when you just put one person in
the scanner but what are they saying
what is the speech that's never the
stuff that gets involved in these
studies we're just you know they're
often just naming words or answering the
question there's nothing very kind of
uh representative or sort of um
complex in how we're thinking about the
speech in these contexts and this is
actually a study that I did some years
ago now where the first artist I ever
worked with a voice artist called Duncan
wisby and he is professional
impressionist he does impersonations of
people for radio programs and television
programs and this is an interesting shot
here here he is in the UCLA anechoic
chamber and what he's doing is he's
making recordings of his voice so he's
doing different Impressions here you'll
notice however although what we're
recording is his voice he's changing
he's doing hand movements he's he's
doing different things with his eyebrows
he's changing a lot about his body that
doesn't directly affect what he sounds
like and I was interested in what this
meant in terms of his what was happening
in his brain and in fact he designed the
study that we went in to then go into
fmri and see what's happening when he
does changes change his voice I have to
say his voice vocal expertise is quite
extraordinary this is just a very quick
clip of his vocal tract doing some
different
um turning the sound down because it's a
bit out at the start he's just going
from his very deepest voice up to his
highest voice and then back down again
so these aren't Impressions this is just
a vocal difference
larynx right down the bottom there
and he's going up and up and up and up
and up

so we're seeing somebody there with a
tremendous kind of flexibility in their
vocal range and in the scanner we just
asked him to say the same thing over and
over again either in his own voice or
doing a an accent or doing a particular
individual
and because the results were so
interesting we repeated the whole study
with people who are just people not not
vocal Impressions just people who have a
go at changing their voices people like
me who have happy to have a go at doing
an impression of somebody when we do
that what you find in non-experts is you
get a greater activation of the brain
than you see just for talking aloud all
those areas I showed you before and
particularly you start seeing right
areas in the right side of the brain
recruited which when you're listening to
speech you're actually very much more
interested in who's talking than they
are in what's being said so we're seeing
probably people seem to be thinking
about the sound of the voices they're
trying to achieve when they're changing
their voice to do this you see something
very very different when Duncan is doing
an impression instead what you see
that's him talking aloud and here in the
bottom right these are the brain areas
activated when he is doing an impression
and they are not the same as what we
find in the non-professionals he's
showing activation in brain areas to do
with the movement of his hands and also
in basically in visual imagery so he's
thinking about what people look like and
how they move and that's how he's
actually accessing a different sound to
The Voice
this is a completely different kind of
acting approach to Someone Like This is
actually the actor Julian Ryan Tutt who
I did a project with for the welcome
trust and he was very interested in what
happened when he was performing so in
this study he wanted to see what's
different when he was acting and he read
the poem The exploration by John Dunn
about a lost love and he either read it
in a very neutral Voice or he properly
performed it and what you see up here is
just what it looks like when he's
speaking in his normal voice and down
here this is when he is acting he's
reciting the poem and if we compare the
two what you find again very differently
from Duncan all the activation is coming
up here at the top of the brain in areas
to do the representation of the body and
he is his words was when he was acting
this piece he felt it he felt that
emotion he felt that loss and there is a
theory in emotional processing that says
we map out emotions in our physical body
and he seems to actually be accessing
this when he is performing in this way
a different completely different kind of
vocal performer here we have um a
beatboxer beatboxing and this um this is
completely serendipitous uh I've been
doing the work with my with my vocal
Impressionists and my um postdoc Carolyn
mcgaskin said you know we should do all
this with beatboxes as well so she went
to the UK beatboxing championships and
some sort of shouting we can we scan
your brain to uh to beatboxes and reap
Swan a very very talented beatboxer said
yes please and he's been working with us
ever since this is reap Swan or Harry F
in the scanner
so this is just looking at his Vocal
Track look at the sheer range of
movements that he's making absolutely
extraordinary
I used to think that speech was the most
complex sound in nature until I
encountered beatboxers who are just
starting to probably
truly explore the possibilities of what
the human voice can do
foreign
so for example when you study phonetics
you get taught that when we speak we can
make a we make a kind of constriction at
one point in the vocal tract and at any
one point in time that's the sort of the
speech sound that you're making but you
can only make one Harry at the end there
was making at least three different
sources of sound he was making a noise
at his larynx he was making a noise at
the back of his um but the battery's
nasal cavity kind of nasal harmonics and
he was also making noises at his lips
and he's controlling those three
pictures separately so beatboxers did
not study phonetics and don't know
they're not supposed to be able to do
this when we take this into the scanner
I think we're seeing something
qualitatively different from those two
different acting approaches because
effectively Harry f is doing something
different when he beatboxes because he's
an extremely fluent and skilled beatbox
so here's just a comparison between him
and a novice beatbox a full disclosure
that's me I can't beatbox and here I am
having a go what you're actually seeing
is something that looks like an expert
brain here in Harry's brain you're
seeing activation in that's much tighter
in many brain areas but he's also for
example doing much much more in the
cerebellum than me because he's
coordinating many more complex actions
and I just want to finish with another
kind of music so I think one of the
things that working with artists has
made me realize about the human voice is
that that is still a form of Music the
human voice is a musical instrument that
we've kind of repurposed for speech and
language very effectively but it never
loses that musical aspect and this was
um from an opportunity that I had to
work with a musician and composer David
Arnold and here we were looking at him
listening to music but critically he was
listening to music that he absolutely
loved Now Music activates the brain a
great deal when you're listening to
music a lot of your brain is processing
because there's a lot going on there's
Rhythm there's pitch there's vocals and
you get emotional responses and physical
responses to the Rhythm and this is just
from a review paper kind of picking out
brain areas that are involved when you
listen to music you also get reward
networks activated if you listen to
something that you like here I'm going
to show you David's brain this sorry
this is just David Arnold's brain one
thing I really did destroy I have not
talked about brain structure at all so
I've just been talking about brain
function but one of the things we
couldn't miss when we scanned him is he
has an absolutely enormous primary
auditory cortex and I'd love to know
more about musicians and composers and
this kind of structural aspect
um this is David's brain when he listens
to music that he loves and importantly
here the contrast is just music music
That's not of any particular interest to
him and this is really important because
we've subtracted away from this contrast
just hearing music what you're seeing
here is him hearing the activation
that's extra to hear a music that he
absolutely adores and you're singing
anything so much more activation than
just to music itself it's it's
activating memory areas you're seeing
very strong activation and retrospinal
cortex you're seeing very strongly
bilateral activation lots of frontal
activation not so much visual activation
not so much sensory motor activation but
this is something that and in fact the
music people do seem to have learned
this a lot sooner than everybody else
you do see different networks activated
to music if you let people listen to
music that they love so I think again
listening listening to people leaning
into the differences thinking about what
you can learn from exploring how people
experience their own skills or
perceptions and letting that lead you in
the direction of research can really
help you I think help us start to build
a much wider model of how we can and
should perhaps be exploring
neurodiversity in the brain instead of
looking for brain areas and nice little
Spectra let's go on a journey that
acknowledges sometimes difference can
just be different and let's let's find
out more about that let's celebrate that
foreign
tastic
um
going on a journey
um let's bring back uh Wando to come
with your questions for Sophie
hello
hi how you doing
I'm doing well thank you thanks so much
for that
um
first of all it just looks like you've
just got a really exciting life meeting
really cool people
I cannot lie to you one of the one of
the most enjoyable parts of this job is
just the different interesting people
and their interesting brains that I get
to work with I've learned they've all
been brilliant I've learned something
from all of them
so I mean I guess I mean one thing I was
wondering when when what watching that I
mean so
um I mean is this is this typical is it
typical to work like this
no
um I think because
because the brain Imaging techniques
that we have they often are you know you
often need to have more than one person
to be able to see the data
so you tend to go pretty conservative
you look for group data you don't look
for single individuals and if you do
look for individual differences you look
along a linear parameter that's you know
what brain areas are affected by this
correlate with this behavioral score for
example or this clinical score so I
think it is it is unusual and I think
um I probably to the extent to which I
do get away with it which you might
argue I don't I have done a lot of the
really kind of conservative stuff where
I've looked for here at brain areas we
find that everybody here are kind of
linear variations
um but I think it's I've learned so much
from Simply letting people you know look
letting the artists I've worked with
Drive the direction in which we take the
study what what they what answer they
want to know about
from their insight into what they do
has has led to completely different
studies than I would have devised on my
own and that I think has a real
advantage to it I think there are
definitely don't stop doing the kind of
small C conservative stuff because that
that's telling us about the networks
that and they're fundamentally how they
work but really to be able to kind of
grapple with difference I think you can
I think we should let ourselves
acknowledge that sometimes difference is
just difference and it may not have a
meaningful relationship to something
else let's just look into what that
thing is let's try and relate that to
people's own lived experiences which
might just be one person
and I mean do you have any thoughts on
on how like how your approach and way of
working can come more into
uh
a wide way of working for other for
other researchers
um well
you know I've I've done the due
diligence I've also published papers
um you know kind of with the artists and
we've and those tend to be more not just
look at this crazy brain but you know
something that's got you know got more
participants in it and is um and it's
more a kind of fitting within a
traditional scientific publishing
format but I do also put these other
examples when I give talks I'll say look
that's not the whole story because look
at this you know here's the music
network but look look what happens when
people listen to this guy listens to me
to see absolutely adores it's different
and I think that's um
hopefully you know scientific change is
slow and the whole system is
conservative but there used to be a
a tradition of kind of Natural History
in how we engage with scientific
publishing and I kind of still hanker
for that in my heart I am a natural
historian that I like I do observational
sites I'm much more interested in
finding out about what's out there than
in running an experiment you know what I
do is almost always observational and I
think that they there there should be a
place for this if you look at the
development of neuropsychology which is
a an area that was completely built up
on people studying individual patients
and looking at how they're changed
experiences and issues following Strokes
or head injuries related to you know uh
things that they know they still had no
problem with or how that relates to
their brain injury and that was always
completely based on single cases and
it's been in a tremendously valuable
area for understanding the human brain
and Human Experience so I think we could
do something similar here it's a sort of
you know like a natural history a
neuropsychology of the of the brain that
is being driven by by working with
people with different experiences or
different skills
I think I think that's one of the
reasons why really
as well but yeah definitely that actual
historian like natural philosopher okay
is what really excites excites me
because because yeah all you need is
some it's some type of perception to to
do that and then and just to delve into
it and so yeah I was wondering if you
could talk a bit about how like how how
we've connected and how like your your
way of working is like related to to my
projects
um well I I was really Blown Away by
your distorted constellations uh exhibit
and it was I really enjoyed getting to
see it again just sitting in this screen
about
um felt like something from a dream that
night and I don't think I've seen
somebody do such an interesting kind of
reinterpretation of their experience but
in a physical space where it was at the
same time beautiful and mysterious but
also you know you want your curiosity
was peaked you wanted to go in there you
wanted to find out more but also it was
being completely valid to your own
experience so you were putting a version
of that out that you weren't sort of
trying to replicate it for people but
people had the opportunity to start
engaging with aversion
of an idea of what to see the world to
your eyes might mean so I thought it was
it was really lovely because it was
beautiful and it was artistic but it was
it was a scientific Enterprise it was
your you were making this available for
people to go into an experience and to
and to actually perceive elements of
that so I thought that was really really
fascinating so I really like how you
your but you're a polymath you know
you're just working across so many
different disciplines and you somehow
managed to pull up something so coherent
from that
and accessible but as I say we're making
sort of just beautiful and engaging and
as we saw from the examples of people
talking about it that people have really
profound experiences when they engage
with that
thanks
um yeah I mean do you have any questions
for me
um so would you think if somebody said
right we've scanned you wendo and these
are the brain areas that are different
in your brain from somebody else's brain
would that be of even any interest to
you at all or would you want to know
more than that would you it's just do
you want to see the difference or do you
want to would you want to say okay like
now let's see what happens in my brain
when I do this
I love I love getting in a scanner so it
makes a great noise I find it very
relaxing I'm a bit weird like that and
so I'd love to do that anyway but
um I'm I'm I'm really curious about the
populations who've been in Scanners so
where the kind of bass lines are coming
from
and
um
so I think that's that's my my first
thought about comparing
um I mean maybe you could tell tell me
about that do you feel like there's been
like a like a global kind of enough of a
global represents presentation of of of
scans yeah well I mean it hasn't been
because you know the classic thing in
Psychology is that our our participants
are the weird you know the white
educated they're very they're not from a
very diverse of people in fact and I
didn't talk about this but I did publish
a paper with Harry yes the beatboxer
where we just looked at beatboxers
electric guitar players and
non-musicians listening to music and
looking at how people's brains engaged
when they heard the instrument that they
could play
and that was the first study I've ever
done where because of the groups we were
recruiting we were recruiting people
that didn't weren't either doing degrees
or had degrees
and weren't all white and middle class
so it's so the Baseline is it's an
important point
but I suppose what I was trying to push
you into saying because obviously I want
you to I've got a dog in this fight I
think you probably could investigate
your brain doing things without needing
a baseline at all the Baseline could be
you
yes I yeah I'd love to be the Baseline
I'd love to be a baseline
um
so I think that that would be how I
would take it because it's always an
issue what what's the comparison and if
you say okay well if the Paris is just
the person himself and what we're going
to look like with Duncan when he's
talking or doing an impression he was
his own Baseline there and that's giving
us and that did show us something
fundamentally different from what we saw
with with non-professionals and it does
seem to be through how his experiences
or how he was born or maybe actually
probably through his music all the
Impressionists I've ever met are
musicians
um he's just engaging with voices he
hears voices differently
and when he thinks about how to be
someone through their voice he's
thinking about the whole person to get
to that he's not break I thought I
thought Impressionists would be like
phoneticians and they'd break speech
down into lots of little pieces and then
build it all up again and I literally
couldn't have been more wrong but I only
see that when I treat him as his own
control I mean I think that's so
interesting and and yeah I totally hear
what you're saying this it's I guess
it's it's like it's quite a new idea for
me this idea that yeah you could there
could just be me and then and what the
brain scan says is it says things about
me specifically which and um but but
yeah it speaks it's so interesting I
mean it's a bit of deviation but in
terms of artists I just I think I think
any kind of art is inherently physical
so that also doesn't kind of surprise me
that that yeah that I would assume that
I I think everything that I do if I'm
making music if I'm if I'm thinking up
an idea it's I feel it's a very physical
thing yeah which is probably one of the
reasons why I want to physicalize things
in in space and I've got I've just got a
very strong connection to to
spatialization to work out with
spatialized music and I I I I wondered
if that's also because I've just got a
sense of space that might be different
to a lot of people because it's it's
full
yeah no such thing as empty space yeah
yeah
and I think that's entirely possible I
don't I mean I sometimes think that um
I don't want you to get the impression
that I think the only way we could
explore this would be through looking at
your brain I think brain's very
interesting
the brain scanning remains a very blunt
tool and it's not very good example for
unless we've got some really good
immersive VR into the scanner which
remains not completely possible but you
know you'd still be stuck in a tube so
looking at you and your reaction to
space would be harder to do with a lot
of our traditional techniques not
impossible with some more mobile
techniques that people are developing
but if you wanted to answer what I'm
saying is we wanted to know about your
brain and space we would actually really
want you to be engaging with those
spaces wouldn't you
um so they're gonna see if there's any
questions
yeah if we could go to uh Erica in
Toronto to see if we've got any
questions from the floor for this
section of the uh symposia so questions
for Sophie and Wando anybody here in the
auditorium want to come to the
microphone to ask a question now is a
good time
you can also bump to questions in the
chat
if there are any there oh we have one
question yes
so a very interesting talks I was
wondering when you create those visual
effects how do you
make sure that they are people feel the
same way that you feel like uh
in this uh where you see the visuals
knows
in your visual field because how do you
communicate do you have other people to
help you calibrate
thank yeah thanks for the question I
think well I think first of all there's
um I I don't know how I always feel I
think it's it's a really I think one of
the things that I feel about about this
whole piece that I've learned through
the it's been a real struggle making it
because it's trying to create a version
of my perceptual reality and it's just
impossible
um you know with all with all the senses
that we have it's really complex and and
having visual snow syndromes one element
it's just one slice of my perceptual
reality so how I and how I feel about it
changes all the time and it has changed
in response to making it so I feel like
it's really complex
um and I'm I'm really really okay with
the idea that people have their own
responses to it and feel how how they
feel
um I've I've definitely found
commonalities people because I've been
at most of the exhibitions and be able
to come and talk to me about it and
people have had
feelings of feeling very similar to me
or feeling very opposed or just had
completely different ideas you know I
mean that's the the art element of it as
well it's definitely not a um
it's I've found that it's an impossible
and interesting challenge to try and
create something that is um
shared it's it's it's a type of shared
experience but it's it's really diverse
it's a really diverse experience
does that yeah does that
answer yeah yeah thank you very much
thank you
perhaps whilst we have Sophie I do know
Sophie that you do have to go
um one question from me so my background
is in neuroscience and I've made this
journey from Neuroscience into the Arts
and Humanities as a space to kind of
work with immersive experiences and like
you love working with artists and
hearing from artists
um one question on your side is
um obviously you're you're a professor
um that initial route in to Having the
courage to kind of work in the way that
you're working where did that come from
and in a way the same question to one
though you know the courage to be able
to work in a way where you're kind of
going against the grain essentially so
you know coming from the social model of
disability
um wanting that difference is accepted
and Sophie on your side in thinking
about
um science as you know having this
normal normative perspective
um and you know a control of one that
sounds unheard of but very interesting
so what was the what gave you the
confidence to um go in that direction
um I
back in 2007 I'd come back from
maternity leave and I was feeling a
little bit invisible
and you do kind of I think probably
taking leave for any amount of time and
then coming back for any reason you do
sort of think oh have people forgotten
about me and we had brain awareness week
coming up and I said at work we were
trying to decide what our plans are
going to be and I said I'd really like
to do something and so it kind of
stemmed from me wanting to sort of be
seen to a better phrase and what I
wanted to do I thought what I'd I
thought for a while I wanted to get hold
of the brain of an impressionist I
wanted to find out more I wanted to talk
to them about it and it's actually very
hard to get help them Impressions
because they're really busy so I stalked
several online and in the end I got hold
of Duncan through
um for a lot of circuitous route but he
was interested and got back straight in
touch with me and we've continued
working we were just doing something the
other weekend up in Blackpool and
I think
it's no exaggeration to say that that
experience changed everything for me it
wasn't like the being seen at work part
sort of disappeared I just got so caught
up in realizing he reframed everything
I'd ever thought I knew about voices and
speech and Drew out the music and voices
the emotional connection to voices all
of these ways of talking about voices
and that's even before we got to him and
how he was changing his voice what he
was actually doing in his brain and his
vocal tract so that was the sheer
fascination of it and the fact that no
one had ever ever looked even at
different ways of things that we might
you know reading aloud is different from
talking right now and we just hadn't
really even asked those questions in my
area at all so for me it just seemed
like a like it's no exaggeration State
changed everything and that made it
um something that I was Keen to keep
doing and it is true to say every single
time I've worked with an artist it is as
informative and as exciting for me as
every time I've worked with you know but
I've done a lot of work in
neuropsychology and I've worked with
people with who've had brain injuries
and I've always you know very grateful
and honored they spend their time with
me and I've always learned a great deal
about the brain from working with them
and it's as much if not more from
working with artists it's just reframes
and re what I thought I knew it makes me
think differently about and that's just
exhilarating once you've started doing
it and I've had to continue
that sounds fascinating and and you talk
very briefly about virtual reality you
the experience with Wonder was around
kind of all wonder you call it augmented
an augmented reality experience in
essence are you doing stuff with virtual
reality
um are you thinking about that as a kind
of tool for for doing your um your work
that's a question for Sophie right on me
for both of you okay
I would love to
particularly I mean no wonder and I've
talked about this before but the um you
know I'm interested in ASMR and how kind
of sound and space and tactile sensation
are processed in the brain and being
able to explore kind of different
environments and sounds in a controlled
way in a way that you could take into
the scanner would just be amazing to be
able to do that but what would you think
mando
oh my God I mean I think it'd be so
amazing I mean my my feeling about
um to Virtual Reality which is you know
it's the full reality is that
um I I I'd be so curious to see how the
how a brain is behaving our brain looks
in virtual reality compared to real real
real reality
um and and I would guess that it would
really really vary for people I bet it's
it's not similar at all like I know that
for me when I experience virtual reality
um because I feel I'm in a kind of
augmented reality all the time
um my the the visuals are very um
overwhelming I think I'm I'm probably in
the case for like someone who's very
susceptible to Virtual Reality like if I
have a headset on for too long it does
something very strange to my sense of
self
um so I'd I'd be so fascinated to what
you could explore and I think the
interesting thing is that even if you
created a realistic version of virtual
reality I still think it would reveal
something different to to
real reality yeah I'm calling it yep I
completely agree I completely agree that
sounds like a new collaboration forming
right there fantastic
um Sophie thank you so much for joining
us and uh really look forward to what
you do next and thanks for taking the
time to
um come come along and get involved
thank you I really enjoyed it thank you
and thank you wendo and uh I'm really
really grateful thank you so much thank
you
brilliant
um we're now going to go to our next
speaker Dr Simon J Cropper I like this
there's a kind of double version of and
a time delay to to I'm seeing two videos
of myself I'm gonna introduce Dr Simon J
Cropper who's based in the Melbourne
School of psychological Sciences Simon
research is human sensation and
individual differences in perception
including color perception the nature of
hallucination hallucination and the role
that personality plays in what we see so
handing over to you Simon
thank you thank you everyone
you just see if this works can you see
that I think you can see it oh yes you
can see it because you can see me seeing
me seeing that confusing enough as it is
good uh well good afternoon to everyone
there or wherever you are it's actually
morning here early morning and uh there
might be a five-year-old joining me
we'll see when he wakes up
um and thank you Sophie and Rondo for
really and interesting discussions and
presentations and I worry a little bit
I'm proud to be a bit dull so I'll try
not to be
as I am in Australia I would like to
acknowledge there were injury people the
cooling Nation where I live
um the traditional owners of the land
where I spend my own time
and uh whilst there's a different type
of constellation in this picture here
there I've been doing some work on
indigenous astronomy and the absolutely
mind-blowing amount of knowledge that
the Australian in fact that many
indigenous populations had about the
relationship between the sky that they
saw in the land that they lived on
and the way in which to observe and use
that sky and its structure by extracting
meaning from what is a remarkably sparse
stimulus
um in order to be able to survive in
what often amounts to quite in
hospitable environments it's the more I
find out about it and the more people I
talk to about it the more phenomenal it
truly is and it's about time that we
recognize that generally uh in order to
understand more about the planet we live
on and maybe stop harming it quite so
much
but it does have some relationship to
what we're talking about which is the
idea that we construct our own reality
and a reality where you have such a
uh like a symbiosis in many ways but
also a dependence upon understanding
what's happening way way above you in
this sort of almost unachievable
uh sense of distance which relates back
to arima's original question
and how that dictates your day-to-day
life and it's uh it's a really
interesting question
well I'm going to talk about today is
how uh the work that I've been doing
recently
um relates to the kinds of things that
Rwanda has been doing from her
perspective and from her practice and
how
remarkably similar they are although I
think one day does it way better than I
do
um in terms of trying to understand
how different people see the world and
I'm also I'm sort of going to present it
in many ways in a way that I presented
it to my students when I first
challenged them with this the idea that
everyone does have their own version of
the world and whether We're Dreaming
hallucinating or existing in something
that we believe to be our own reality
they're all I think they're all similar
States along the same Continuum and
they're just a product of the brain
doing its job and its job is to make
sense that's what it is it's a sense
maker it will do whatever it can to make
sense of whatever comes then
and I've always felt that arts and
artists tell us a whole lot more about
this than often they're given credit for
or we often realize something Rando
again is a really good example of this
it's been a long-held question in
philosophy back to Bishop Berkeley
and probably before that but I've always
sort of found this you know one of
Nietzsche's various various versions of
the same thing as he often did but quite
a pithy little uh
um phrase he has that the apparent world
of the true World means the world and
nothing which of course is the one
extreme end of the argument about what
is reality that it's entirely in your
head and nowhere else which then raises
to question of the assistance of the
brain at all anyway but it's something
that I think that so I certainly get the
students to consider when they first
come into stock
um because I think it's important that
you have to consider the you know the
two poles of an argument from being yes
there's a physical world out there and
when we do our very best to work out
what's in it and that's you know that
world exists right up to the fact that
the whole thing is just a construct of
the brain and there are many aspects of
vision research which is my background
that our farm leaning far more towards
the the nature end than the platonic end
of there being a real world out there
um and that's always been something that
I felt has been increasingly relevant in
the work I've done and I started off
principally in color vision and color
vision is one of those areas of
uh psychology and vision science where
and there's this strange conflict
between it being one of the most finely
quantitative versions of vision science
measuring inputs down to nanometers of
wavelengths and all sorts of things yet
it is the arguably the simplest
Sensation that we have
we are unable to actually communicate it
completely to anybody else our sensation
of color is unique to each one of us and
we've developed the whole set of terms
entirely for the communication of color
which is critical in our understanding
of our world and the way that we
communicated to each other but
indicative of the fact that we have to
use a word specif specific to our
sensation in order to communicate it
rather than being able to share it
directly so that sensation is unique to
each individual which when you look at
the sort of the basic process of vision
how we see
is perhaps not so surprising right from
color up to actually everything that we
perceive that's how everyone's world
starts it's a load of numbers the output
of your photoreceptors are a grading
potential and that is what the brain has
to make sense of that's its job so that
might seem completely meaningless but
then at some point in the process of
whatever individual is using that set of
numbers it becomes something meaningful
in that case it's Gulliver who is not
yet awake but could be soon
um
and it's hardly surprising that if that
the process in each individual's brain
goes from that set of numbers to
whatever it is they're looking at that
there and given that the wiring is
unique for each person anyway that there
are individual
differences and versions of the world
which come about now largely we have
quite similar versions of the world and
we do the best job we can communicating
them to one another but that tends to
ignore a lot of the subtleties and even
in you know between two people who don't
have a noticeable and uh easily
descriptive not necessarily easily but
well-described difference in their
versions of the word there will be
significant differences which given I
suppose depending on how long you might
spend with somebody you will find out
that you will see things quite
differently colors are another good
example that people are always arguing
about colors because they're slightly
different uh distribution of wavelengths
that eat into each individual is
sensitive to
and
I I was trying to remember when doing
this when did I first sort of click that
this is what artists were often trying
to say and show and scientists and
offers often very good at listening to
that or certainly weren't
um and
uh I think it must have been some time
ago when I was visiting the tank when I
was back in the UK so it would have been
like 20 30 years ago and um
I realized that so many of the things I
was looking at were actually more
suggestions of what was out there rather
than some photorealistic version and the
post-impressionists are a really clear
example of that and it was an obviously
an important part of the way that they
worked and I've always quite liked this
quote by Suzanne the eyes not enough one
needs to think as well and just looking
at his work and many other people's work
so much of what's there is suggested
rather than clearly described and
presented so it's sort of it's not a
kind of here it is look at this it's
like here are some suggestions put this
together for yourself so there's a
there's a demand in on behalf of the
viewer that they actually do some work
in creating what they're saying and the
artist is saying to them you know it's
not just you're not just a passive
viewer of this you're you're active in
it which is something that clearly
Windows taken to
um orders of magnitude more
uh
more more suggestive
um
and I do remember quite clearly seeing
Bridget Riley's work for the first time
and I was already interested in color
and how we saw it
and the way that she uses color and
structure to create pieces that
don't even stay still I mean this is the
thing that's not even as if it's just a
static piece of paper there's movement
here there's all sorts of things in it
and the color bleeds and moves and flows
into one another and the way that that
happens for each individual has to be
unique to that
and it was I thought it was quite a
turning point I think for me because I
was at the time looking at the the very
the quite low level mechanisms of color
agitation and discrimination and trying
to using psychophysics actually trying
to work out what's going on at a neural
level and then I looked at this and
thought well how what on Earth am I
doing like I'm going to be able to do
this at all and you know we don't know
the answer even now after hundreds of
years of looking at it
um
but it was quite a an eye-opener for me
and something that I've
always uh
taken with me since then and actually
integrated more specifically into the
work I've been doing as I've become a
little less narrowly focused on visual
perception and a bit more on well how do
we create reality how do we extract
meaning in the world and what even what
is meaning what is Meaningful because
what's meaningful to me might not be
meaningful to somebody else
and a sort of a more
recent and I think quite remarkable
example of the same kind of thing as
James Terrell's work with light and
color
and the the things that this is him uh
stood outside the bit of Arizona desert
I think he owns where he's making an
installation I think he believes he's
still making it
which one day I want to go and see where
the as he says we think we receive all
that we perceive and in fact we actually
give this guy its color because we give
the sky its color as in the sky space
here talking about the Arizona desert
I can make the sky any color you choose
which is such a sort of
uh
beautiful bombshell into color
perception that it's uh you know I
constantly come back to that and again
we're trying to get students to sort of
get interested in color perception in
all it that's uh all of its my new
details are asking them to think about
this and then think about color
perception suddenly makes it a whole lot
more interesting because it's not as
obvious
and again a few years ago now
this came up which still has sort of
some currency certainly when you're
doing lectures which is the address
which was a horrible photo of a horrible
dress but still raises an argument about
with how you see the colors in that
dress do you see black and blue or white
and gold
and there are so many things there's
been some specific work done on this to
try and work out how we do it no we
don't know why that's the case it's a
bit of an anomaly as in yes colors of
color perception is very subjective and
color language is very restricting but
to have such an apparently
contrasting view of exactly the same
image which people will argue about and
did argue about and still do in a
lecture theater
um is quite remarkable from the point of
view of a vision scientist when you're
trying to get people to understand that
yeah your view of the world is actually
your view of the world nobody else's
because here's a quite demonstrable
example of exactly that so whilst yeah
it was annoying and I wasn't
particularly interested what can you
thought about it it certainly Still
Remains probably absolutely the best
example of this there's been many
wannabe copies of it but this complete
accident still is the best one and is
really useful in terms of considering
that question of like well is the world
that you see the same as the world of
dicey which then comes back to the whole
philosophical question of do we all see
the same around Etc
um
so sort of related to that but also sort
of related to you know some work I was
doing with a PhD students at the time
and
um
the idea about how does an individual
affect what they see and what sort of
level of that perception is that effect
coming in so obviously you know your
life experience sort of all of these
things that previously have contributed
to who you are make who you are right
now
and what you know that affects and how
you respond to things and your views on
all sorts of sociopolitical issues but
does it affect how you see stuff and uh
this became this was you know became
more interesting to me and we wondered
whether we could measure it and as a
sort of a attack on that can we actually
say whether people are you know people
who do different things consistently who
are more creative uh do they see the
world differently and is that measurable
so this idea of measuring subjective
reality was actually tricky to say
listen but we were far from the first
people are trying to do it in a
quantitative way and there had been
previous approaches to it will we
developed a particular kind of similarly
one which sort of uh took into account
the environment the natural environment
that our visual systems are evolved to
detect and which actually is mirrored
quite nicely in the structure of the
brain and the function of the brain and
how that works that kind of natural
structure is consistent throughout in
the way that you know you look at a bit
of brain it also looks like the middle
of a cave and all sorts of things so
there's that same natural structure to
the to the the processes involved
um and we use this idea of a false alarm
which was uh
convenient for us because it also meant
we could actually measure what people
were saying
um using signification Theory
and we've presented participants with
unstructured random visual images and
this was just they were students
initially we've done quite a lot of the
people do it now by now doing it
um and investigated this occurrence of
false alarms which is basically somebody
saying something's there when it's not
it's like an hallucination but you know
in my new way in a very short period of
time to a specific stimulus that you
give them and in this way these false
alarms are an index indirect way of
exploring hallucinary or in you know the
context of artists creative experiences
and interrogating the subjects of
reality
these were the facility that we used
which in this case are faces embedded in
noise and the difference in this there's
two critical differences which I think
might helped it work quite well
is that the noise itself is of a
structure which is equivalent to the
average statistics of the natural
environment which is kind of what the
system has developed too and responds
best to and we embedded the faces rather
than just having a signal on the face
and the noise which is the background
here overlaid on top of one another we
actually vary the pixels according to
whether it was a signal pixel or a noise
pixel and that we felt was more
equivalent to making a false alarm
internally where you make a false
correlation between two bits of space
and decide they are part of the same
thing when in fact they're not and
they're sort of like uh
a kind of a
sort of a backdrop to this is we also
took the approach that signal and noise
are basically the same thing whether in
the context of the brain and in its
processing uh it ends up being what's
considered signal or noise it's entirely
dependent of the problem whether one
neuron affects the neurons is connected
to that's all the brain does it has
neurons they're connected to one another
they affect one another
um and so what could be signaled to one
neuron because it does have an impact on
its output which then impacts these
connections could be noise to another
urine because it might just not have an
impact upon that you're only going yeah
not interested not passing that signal
on so each of those my new processes are
tiny decisions
and taking that approach sort of allowed
us to
uh look at whether people were able to
discriminate whether a face was present
as in these and these are different
levels of noise or absence as in just a
noise field and then measure
whether people were similarly sensitive
to all of these stimulate or whether it
actually depended on the individual
now kind of a broad summary of that
which sort of moves into looking at our
uh the kind of stuff that we're trying
to look at now
is that seeing that meaningful image in
the noise is correlated personality and
is correlated to the level of creativity
and creative output of the individual or
creative activity of the individual in
their day-to-day life
results are consistent with an increased
internal noise level which is considered
with quite a lot of other things
actually
artists interrogate their perception far
more carefully it seems and they tend to
make fewer false alarms but only after a
little bit longer of examination of the
input and you were talking about you
know they were presented for a second
but artists tend to take a little longer
to respond
and often would report that yeah I did
see something I thought something was
there but then I thought again about it
and realized it wasn't so they're
tending to they're actually using their
day-to-day practice to respond in the
experiment and look at it and going up
no there's nothing there whereas someone
who isn't as nuts who isn't used to
doing that all the time with everything
they see
um or here is is basically just
responding far more immediately going
yes I see something
we were trying to look at currently
whether that sort of extraction of
meaning actually kind of goes up the
hierarchy from being a simple perceptual
meaning to something to do with semantic
relationships or inside problem solving
and it seems an interesting preliminary
data in the case that actually that that
kind of predisposition to extracting
meaning perhaps a little bit more
liberally and maybe a little bit easier
does tend to hold across different
levels of meaning which is quite
interesting
but it does give us some indication this
measurably different subjective
realities of the world I mean we can
kind of say yeah everybody is seeing a
different version of the world now the
vast majority of the time with most
people
we probably either discount it it isn't
that important it's not something that
even comes up we don't necessarily have
to discuss everything that we see with
everyone else and even if we could the
language is probably sometimes so
limiting that we can't even manage to
explain what a discipline is saying but
we felt like it does it really does
suggest that not only do people
uh
have these unique versions of the world
and we can measure it artists do seem to
be dealing with that uniquely different
version of the world differently which
is consistent with kind of what they do
all the time and have something to say
about that
which comes to distortical
Constellations by wander which is
um now I think I might be the only
person here who's actually seen it in
Melbourne because it was in the science
Gallery which is downstairs in the
building I work and um
it was
it was quite remarkable actually because
I sort of heard about it and Wanda and I
talked about and I think I'd seen some
videos of it online
but when I went into the exhibit to sort
of work out how we were going to do the
the questionnaire stuff uh it was you
know the as with so many pieces of art
seeing it in online or pictures or
descriptions of it do not do it justice
and it was one of the most
um okay I agree with everything that
everybody sort of says about so but one
of the things that I found was intensely
hypnotic it kind of
there are fragments I mean I don't
experience visual snow and it's
something that I've only you know around
you relatively recently since meeting
window but then also since meeting Wando
other people have said to me oh yeah I
have visual snow or since going to the
exhibition in Melbourne have come out of
it saying oh that's interesting I
thought every you know I was the only
one that had this
um there are fragments of in fact quite
a lot of it which is very like
day-to-day perception and just stuff
that you kind of you don't really think
about we used to think oh that's not
particularly Pleasant because you might
be a bit tired or whatever and there's
that kind of
this is something I think I've always
felt about artists they're able to sort
of look into what they how they perceive
the world and then pick out bits which
they have a really strong sense people
will actually see it's like the perfect
metaphor by a writer the perfect
metaphor as far as I can stand is
something that when you're when you read
it it's like how beautifully and
brilliantly that metaphor Works yet you
have never heard it before and you
wouldn't have thought about it yourself
but as soon as you're suggested to you
it's like that's it that's exactly right
in you know that kind of it's a
suggestion but it's enough of a
suggestion to pick up those those
threads if you like in the carpet of
somebody else and put them together and
that's something I really felt strongly
about distorted constellations and where
it kept going down quite a few times
just to stand in the middle of it and be
assailed by everything there
and I have to know I really like the
rhythmicity of it as well but that's
yeah because I kind of like that stuff
what we were interested in
um was
to get a sense of
well I you know I feel like you know
when I was thinking about this world do
we really want to know is the thing
about something like this is it's in
inherently exploratory and also the
worst thing you can do and scientists
have an awful habit of doing this is to
take something that's really interesting
and then bookend it with some really
dull stuff which really spoils the
interesting thing in the middle as soon
as Cesar has to be absolutely the best
example of that it's fantastic but every
little tiny bit of size that seems to be
done on cine senior synesthesia takes
away the beautiful subjectivity of it
and turns it into something which is
sort of frustratingly objective and
therefore not very interesting anymore
maybe I'm being a bit harder on
Synthesia there but it's something I
suppose it's again it's something that I
find so intensely wonderful and I'm
incredibly jealous I don't have it
but we wanted to know how visitors
responded to the experience but without
spoiling the experience for them so it
is simple and exploratory and I feel
like um you know I spent too much time
around psychopologists having to having
to apologize to that exploratory nature
but I'm not apologizing I'm just telling
you
um whereby we asked some some simple
quick questions that they answered on
their phone before immediately before
they went into the exhibit which was
that it was in the content in the
science Gallery it was a
an exhibition called mental which had
lots of
different
exhibits which challenge people's view
of I think normally normality really
and whether you know mental as a sort of
a slang term was at all valid it's
really good
and distorted constellations were sort
of quite a big piece towards the back so
people have done generally tended to
wander through who do these other things
and then come to distorted
constellations
we gave them
um three quick questions before
they went they went into the exhibit and
the three quick questions after was then
an open-ended question about you know is
this equivalent of anything that you've
experienced
the questions were do you think what
you're seeing here is an accurate
reflection of what's out there do you
think everyone experiences the same
sensory world and do you think there's
such a thing is normal so all very much
related to the same thing they could
answer yes no and maybe
which I know everyone's going to go oh
you shouldn't have done maybe but why
not
um here a plot in that is really basic
very descriptive or barely descriptive
statistics because you know arguably
it's not the kind of thing to do
statistics on anyway
but also the exhibitions they recently
closed and so this is as far as we got
um what we look have here applies to the
number of responses just the raw
frequency against the three different
options to know maybe and yes before the
individual engines or before the
individuals went into the exhibition and
afterwards
this is what you see and hearing snack
reflection accurate reflection of what's
out there apologies for being cut off
and one thing that you know there's
really no skill here that prior to the
exhibition
there was more yeses than those and
maybe he's tended towards more than both
of them but after going through
distorted constellations
significant number of people changed
their response from either maybe or yes
to no as in no now I don't think what
I've seen here is what's actually out
there they're an accurate reflection of
what's out there so they're changing
their category After experiencing
distorted constellations which I thought
was pretty neat actually it's had an
effect on everyone that's going on there
everyone but a significant number of
people that have been said we had 347 I
think it was completed surveys we
actually had 700 surveys not all of
which were complete
and that was there were more people who
went through not everyone had to do the
survey obviously
here with the questions do you think
everyone experiences just the same
uh version of the world and this excuse
me surprised me
in that
so many people said no I kind of
expected more people to go yes you know
the world's a bit boring it's out there
we're just looking at it and pleased me
as well I was uh happy that that's
indeed is what people said admittedly
they had been through the rest of the
exhibition
some of them are my students of course
they were going to say no but uh that
was you know I think quite a nice
response and equally do you think
there's such a thing as normal which
again the the whole of the Science Guy
exhibition was about
but you know the point of it was to ask
people and maybe get into question like
no there isn't normal normals a
construct that we tend to use to help
explain things I suppose and that's
understandable but it is can also be
problematic when there's an expectation
that yes people are going to behave
normally and then if they don't we're
going to have you know discriminate
against them in some way we're not great
with differences until we see a
statistics advantage in them and that's
quite a problem
so again I was quite pleased that there
was this uh do you think that some such
thing as normal the vast majority of
people said no and
more people said no after the um the
experiencing distorted constellations
Simon sorry to um interject we only have
about six minutes left of the session
right if it's possible to come to be
quick conclusion yes I'm coming to the
conclusion
so did it remind you of any experience
you have which in most is the uh most
interesting bit uh
and the major themes were migraine or
psychedelics nightclubs music festivals
outside at night dreams and sleeping
anxiety and feelings and panic
thunderstorms arranged so all of things
that you might think well if that maybe
seems obvious but to actually have that
as a consistent set of themes coming out
particularly the migraine because my
there's been a fair bit of work done a
migraine that similarity it's worth
looking at as with psychedelics
one of the nicest responses I felt was
when somebody said yes this is almost an
exact representation of what I
experienced and I thought I was alone in
this and from a window so there's quite
a few people who said that which means
it's really it's changing people's lives
when they get that kind of affirmation
and reassurance of what's going on
and I think given the time I was only
going to show some silly pictures there
so
um I'll end it there but just to say
that it's not only is it an absolute
pleasure to do something like this and I
want to do more of it
um
I just want to thank gwendo arima and
Sophie for
involving me on this thank you
thank you Simon wonder if we come to you
with a question for Simon and then Erica
will come to the audience in Toronto for
the final question and then we'll close
yeah uh I mean we could even go to if
there's an audience question we can we
can go to that sorry I was just really
thinking about what I was thinking about
uh okay I mean I guess actually the
question I've got for Simon is if you
could go back again and ask different
questions
because that's why I was thinking to
myself I'm thinking oh would I want to
ask different questions
I don't know I mean I was thinking this
and I think you know this kind of
the further questions are so similar is
in terms of a psychological
questionnaire structure is it's not
standard not great but that's not really
what it was so I think it was a kind of
trying to get a context of the
individual so what changed that
individual before they went in and
afterwards
and I was I remember when we talked
about I was quite aware it's got to be
really quick and really simple so
because they're there to see distorted
constellations they're not there to
answer questions that I'm going to ask
them
um
actually I'm not sure certainly none
needs one there was nothing that I felt
like I wish I'd ask them that what I am
really interested in is and I'm glad we
asked them is their interest in doing
further work and we've got 68 people who
are interested in doing further work
getting them to come back quite a few
have said yeah it's like this and then
we can actually you know talk to them
more
and I wanted to show them the faces and
noise to see if they respond differently
to the focusing noise because if you've
got this constant overlay of noise which
is naturally there in the old version of
the world and then yeah I'm doing giving
you a signal to noise discrimination
task that is going to have an effect I
think
and so you know having those 68 people
hopefully want to come back and do
something a little bit more detailed and
specific related to what they
experienced in distorted constellations
is I think the most useful thing I think
no fascinating because that's like that
that is a self-selecting group that that
means some what does it mean who are
these people that have all they've got
something particular from this
experience what what is this group of
people oh yeah that's that is
fascinating wow that sounds it does
sound fascinating I'm gonna have to stop
us because
um let's see if there's a question from
the audience and then we will need to
wrap up sorry to interrupt uh Erica
any final questions
from folks out here
looks like we're good here
you want to write
yeah
um so I mean just some quick I don't
want to summarize because it's been such
a wonderful and wide-ranging
conversation a couple of things that
really stood out for me was this idea
that signal and noise are the same thing
when I used to do electrophysiology I
did wonder about this and it's really
interesting to hear this from Beyond
psychological side a control of one from
Sophie we also heard the possibility of
new experiments so uh how what could
virtual reality combined with brain
scanning um create and and wonder would
be great to hear from you your thoughts
on that well I know you really um opened
up for me this idea of thinking about
color in a very different way and then
linking that back to what Simon
presented us we've had these remarkable
insights um to
um a brilliant site distorted
constellations of Art and science
experiment and the ways in which it has
shaped people's understanding of the
self and reality wonder I wanted to hold
hand over to you for the final word
about this but I hope that this has
offered people the opportunity to see
what a more inclusive cognitive science
might become
one though last word to you
I want to say thank you to all of you
for for being part of this journey it's
been a really incredible way for me to
explore to explore myself and reality
and I'm just I just love that it can
continue to to do that for other people
so thanks brilliant thank you and to
wrap up
um this session has been brought to you
by a platform called open Light which I
founded during lockdown informed by a
poet poem by Audrey Lord called Cole and
it's an exchange platform for artists
cultural entrepreneurs and researchers
and it's supported by welcome and ukri
Nook the natural Environmental Research
Council in the UK
um Wando I think your work has been
supported by unlimited and Arts Council
and space and a whole range of other
venues so thank you to you for listening
and thank you to all of our speakers and
thank you Erica for keeping us to time
good night or good morning morning in
Simon's side of the world enjoy your
breakfast and good morning to yourself
thank you
