(00:11) our country produces enough to feed us we can even exceed our production unfortunately due to lack of organization we are still obliged to reach out to ask for food aid is it food that I like that we explains installs in our minds this habit it is a reflex to buy after sale jean jacques thomas sankara dynamics liga 2005 the phase does not understand the fiq and the big

(01:54) time that the person here does not wish that the earth is able to use easy the one that he does not wish he can go out when his plane is gone everything that he does not have in the world pay we wish thomas sankara african the great patriotic fight a radiant future of our country has not taken or death we will conquer where bah

(03:42) I all the ministers were supposed to travel in second place because you told me you are in first class or 2nd class when the plane ati you land at the same time when it decorates you take off at the same time so there's no point wasting the poor taxpayer's money buying first class to have the pleasure of drinking champagne in first class and your

(04:49) two majors simply from bancaja james sankara educating the pioneers was the basis of larivot the isr dancing where we could the youth who were under 12 years old who had to be trained ideological and political even from their young age of so that when they become the great one, it will be against harmful ideas

(05:52) what we call voracity selfishness egocentrism and according to the actors more of the revolution at that moment revolution victory failure belongs to the reaction is to learn it revolution comrades imperialism the students had activated the teachers because a great gentleman of the counter-revolution the vipers you have the guinea fowl smells the tastes of the petty bourgeoisie step by step by step I always found a little ridiculous everyone and red beret let's go there

(06:59) only have taste and once I allowed myself to be useful we see too many soldiers here it's not good I mean it's not that's not what we like in a society in motion which is inhabited by valves or words as formidable as yours and he laughed will tell me we like that but you understood it was the game but it was not the military imbecile who believed in violence or who believed in discipline where imbecilities of this type were cyclical I believe

(07:34) when you have a soul that can breathe fire is first and you can receive orders to stand at attention in front of a flag without knowing who benefits from this man who benefits from the rifle and well we become a potential criminal who does not only have the trigger to sow terror around us how many soldiers are turning in this or that country such that it battlefield damned and the nation is written but without understanding that they themselves are fighting hordes and women

(08:09) who fight for the same ideals as if they were aware of them to forget that they see their part in going on strike against reactionary regimes but who because they entered the army accept to fight for the benefit of the managers and shareholders this therefore exists a soldier without political and ideological training is a potential criminal generic name in the fridge which means that we will have to give each woman the job we must give each woman the least amount of earning

(09:06) honestly the films in his life and bing in establishments like in France do we have the emancipation challenge it is not necessary that here also a convention to get rid of this art you slab according to prices and slabs of the education which gives us who told us that the boys who play in the south the girl at school same camp as the girl when the girls are pregnant things like that we send them back with hope we exclude them no even look for not know if the staff with whom she

(09:54) had the pregnancy those who are not by chance in the class and even if that's all even if that's all we leave it to him the boy in the grass can make as much money as 'he wants from the 6th grade to start having children until the final year we will never change but the girl succeeds in one yoke of her baccalaureate she is 1 1 in valeo to send them there is really a policy or at least the intention to make a policy and to bring women back to a human being in traditional society

(10:28) Burkina Faso where there is a certain tradition are still very strong such as forced marriage, excision and the fact that in the couple it is the man who is our commanders in the family all these things have been postponed in question and practices that are truly free are fought it is thanks to the revolution that we saw women engaged alongside men with the advent of military training where we saw many women commit she was able to do

(11:10) what men could do to manipulate a soul to walk or not wear the same outfit as the zones I believe it was the first African head of state who gave positions to women other than minister of the status of women he had appointed minister of planning minister of the budget and extremely competent women he knew how to find them on the occasion of women's day March 8 or how indicated it is women's day today we are going make the exception instead of

(11:49) it's the family who goes to the market every day today it's their day they will stay at home and the men will go to the market instead for the city he admits to market to buy some tomatoes, condiments and everything needed for the day's cooking and it was good it was a good laugh the men also liked it but they were able to discover since it led some young people to know the realities of prices on the market there we love sankara gatti to work program

(14:19) sankara and creates concern for the environment and he has taken several initiatives which aim to fight against desertification an example that we can give is the operation a village a grove it was at the level of each village that the young people can create a grove which would mark at the same time their desire to stop desertification to create the reflex of reforestation wherever possible in order to reduce the harmful effects and develop a

(15:20) generally a reflex of environmental protection sankara we had no money at the time so what do we have to do we had able-bodied arms we have the entire population who got involved and then

(16:23) well people raised the dispute and that's how we did a certain number of Sankara kilometers and Sankara's projects were essentially to make the bookeen a little autonomous give him back a form of autonomy so he taught his compatriots and water and all Africans to use local products and local products our country produces enough to feed us we can even exceed your production unfortunately due to lack of organization we are still obliged

(17:23) to reach out to ask the animators for these food aids which please me which tells us that they install in our minds this habit it is a reflex of beggars to assist we will have to put aside these beings by our large production we must succeed in producing more product more driven more because it is normal that the one who fed it you legally say his wishes the pros at this moment that what we control there are some who ask but you where is the 'imperialism imperialism will watch

(18:16) on your plates when you eat the seeds from the grain store on my list 2000 imported that's it that's it climbs from vialis don't go any further no further 1700 kg of wheat fair share it's is the average of the region it is the Sahelian average of the region so in Africa is already in 86 the burkina per hectare exceed 3800 3900 kg of blain per hectare so in Africa an agrarian reform is said that they involved the some change of ownership the masters of the earth

(18:56) lost their power the poll tax which disappeared and the fertilizer which arrived and the irrigation which arrived and an efficiency he defeated the end he made that Burkina in four years became food free self-sufficient so it's something quite exceptional is quite remarkable bringing the league 1 camp there you are lavette the screw advertisement of the most viewed Levis good that's good I see their factory the jeans with it is well sewn in Lévis

(19:36) it's good but that's American even see its lamb brand in San Francisco it was that they learn what you want us to demonstrate and that's how to do it the other the cow came to ask the question the halle van damme what despite it for the patient there was no longer knowing what but here to the lawyer who has no plan for you like that you move family there had been so this policy which required that state officials consume guti did not have and that the

(20:27) people in the services are dressed in these outfits which are therefore made from cotton time by Burkinabè artisans which separates accidents which had been welcomed by artisans documents what is happening is what most people went to the service in western outfits 1 but had in a bag this traditional outfit because it is well known that thomas sankara made impromptu visits to the ministries and services and when the most flow in the corridors that sankara was there everyone put

(21:07) very quickly was held there so that night was called sankara ali thomas sankara and the french bars françois mitterrand with félix houphouët

(22:37) Boigny president of Africa is adapted from France by France's African policy finds it very French, that is to say it resembles other French policies yesterday France was in such and such a country africa for evening maintain a leader a leader the TV is to disembark from a caravel another that we take away with care still today from France also has face ankara quickly it was used to use a pictorial language to gather around of the king

(23:35) ministers and his vassals vittel it's a bit this is reminded to the African heads of state that they evolve in a given political era which had this evening there were also the famous networks the foccart networks network this network this crowded under the waters the networks are good and we could make and break the heads of state we could not provoke strikes which would lead to their fall since the budgets of African states are sometimes supplied 50 to 60% by the former metropolis so it is a situation of vassalage

(24:24) real on the financial level as well as on the economic level I think I know you all or more or less I know where your ideal is heading what are your ideological choices what are your friendships I am allying you and you have every right to have a different conception of the world but I tell you by committing that I think that it would not be good for any conflict or any difficulty on the surface of the planet to become an additional element of an East, West and North African crisis or African

(25:37) brilliant gatier I don't care about Lacroix my question is for Captain Sankara I would like to know what you know have been looking for in Moscow and Cuba recently because your travels also raise questions for France but for neighboring countries like the Ivory Coast good I was a month I was in Cuba and elsewhere also I was not only in this country because we maintain excellent relations with these countries with the visions of country we have projects that seem extremely

(26:10) important for our development we are looking for partners if a country closer to us to avoid a number of trips to Moscow we see absolutely no disadvantage people offered help which I refused I do not believe he only lacks concord because nature but less that's all when thomas sankara met the other heads of state he did not consider himself a god and he did not consider them as god either he lightened the atmosphere

(26:53) he relaxes things he accepted being the little brother which allowed him to say what he thinks and what others were not used to hearing I would like our conference to wait the need to make it clear that we

(27:57) we cannot pay the debt not in a warlike spirit of lawfulness this to prevent us from going individually to be assassinated if Burkina Faso alone the son of p the debt I will not be in the next conference on the other hand with the support of all when I need and when we say that the debt cannot be paid does not please that we are against morality dignity respect for speech because we believe that we do not have the same rank as others

(28:39) I laugh I ask it there is not the same morality the Bible the Koran cannot that life in the same way the one who hopes that the people are the ones who exploited it would take a computer edition of the bible and the editions of the current dear brothers with the support of all with the support of all we can do fishing will also not be able to use its immense potential to develop Africa because our only return underground are rich we have enough sheets we have a match and it works very wide from

(29:25) north to south from east to west we have enough intellectual capacities to create or rather less tender technology science not everyone will be able to find them but on the president made sure we developed this single fund index at 2 abeba the debt to ensure that it is not if he said it does not want a decision to limit the arms race between weak countries and pau the googlers cutlass that we buy are useless let's also ensure that the market

(30:07) African is the match and to apply produce in Africa thanks to the application to consume them in Africa producing what we need and consuming what we produce we have just imported Burkina Faso has come to expose you here cotton produced in Burkina Faso I was in Burkina Faso for Burkina Faso has good and Burkinabè my delegation and I ourselves are dressed by our differences our countries'' there is not a single style that comes from Europe or from America

(30:43) I am not doing a fashion show but I would simply like to say but I simply want to say when we have to accept to live African it is the only way to live free to live ti I thank Mr. President not all death we will overcome I nadine and 10,642 radio and television and a half such audacity Greece in the

(32:15) logic of the destruction of the place of the neo-colonial state we started again to free people from civil servants and soldiers from the army of magistrates of justice because it was obviously necessary to create a state conform to ethics revolutionize the condemnation under the revolution when we through these suspension it means that we work for a certain time but for free for the people and he went release the releases you are chased out of the public service in

(32:48) the form but the tpn and was an attack on freedom at the individual level to the extent that the guarantees of defense were not ensured since there it was it was not possible to to be assisted by a lawyer secondly and that was perhaps more serious there was what we call invs is the reversal of the burden of proof, that is to say that it was accusing one of doing the proof of his innocence and not the accusation to support the accusation help it is the proof of the

(33:29) guilt us at the college level we established it master of the ATP to judge those who go against the ideals of the revolution many of our comrades went to the tpr at college and we also denounced our director and then a trial of France and many other teachers and each time where to listen to us but we had to regularly make adjustments because the revolutionary atmosphere everything that was happening rockets that we can not be objective

(34:49) mx2 first strike of primary school teachers result there was I believe at the time nearly 1200 or 1400 insisted that they were chased out of work in a country already where young man dancing very limited compared to the needs of the country so all of a sudden 1400 veterans find themselves on the sidelines to make up for this lack I remember at the time we had recruited people who we called revolutionary transfers so everyone who comes who agenda is he introduced himself and art is training for ten days

(35:33) they were going to take a position in certain revolutionary cancers but we approved we estimated where we are in the revolution where it is not in the revolutions if we are in the revolution does not have the balls of strike and we have general assemblies we have a lot of training courses where you can express yourself if you are going to die you are going to go on strike that means that you are against the multimedia revolution it is completely normal as a young person or had approved through this rule they were created for

(36:36) channel all this popular enthusiasm to facilitate the participation of all the popular masses in the construction of your luccioni to entrust military training we were assigned to security tasks it made it possible to carry a weapon a Kalashnikov and therefore to have a military outfit and everyone knows what success the Rambo film had in the 80s in Africa and so if there are a lot of people who have decided it comes only to stick to this image which saw at the cinema which was tattered

(37:16) he who kills everything that passes when he passes the air pushes us the more there were many people who arrived at the head of the committee of the triangle the revolution without having had the preparation because there sometimes had spontaneous applications someone who comes out of nowhere who becomes responsible well sometimes it can go to his head and he commits a certain number of errors that he himself would have criticized if they were not in the committee but that I think it's it's

(37:53) desolate youth which I think was also inevitable sankara drift and that they develop a note of algae and there are even cases it must be said especially during the prayer of the abyss our settling of scores in our garden it is necessary to say it also is that sickness because militant cdr responsible for security equipped with a big rifle we are not even sure that it hits but finally tanner or the shot was at 7 p.m. at 7 p.m. ten show up for this game, comrades

(39:00) and begins to say the level to the other candidates but it's their soon 1 and to leave you have to leave if you don't leave need to do and yes and some who asked that the cool be maintained for that they can do nothing well we have news the couple flows to the people that we are all equal already that they must play during incapacity and following the dna of blandine high schools this thomas sankara webcam françois mitterrand ouagadougou a small feat in france j I have this weekend pittsburgh has president

(40:13) of turn out to be killers like pieter botha had the right to travel through france so beautiful and so pop they tried to taint it with their hands and feet covered in blood and all those who allowed to carry out his actions will bear full responsibility here and elsewhere today and always if like him and say that they think I also say it and I find that in a certain number of these judgments and there they went sharply a beautiful youth the merit of a head of state totally drinks

(41:08) people and I admire these qualities which are rendered but they will decide as low it goes further than is necessary to my friend who allows me to speak about them from the height of my experience jacques foccart félix houphouët boigny president is the man who was responsible for the contact link with the president

(42:14) houphouët boigny had blaise compaore and it appeared quite quickly that it was his dolphin he did not like at all sankara who was named uncontrollable predictable in a country where there is still with whom he had a lot of links many links of subordination certainly since he considered that the Burkinabè at the time the Voltaics were there to work for the Ivorians but all the more reason to control the situation a little there to have his soul in Ouaga and of which he was clear that he had already designated

(42:50) blaise and it was even he who introduced him to his current wife so blaise owes him a lot sankara blaise compaoré in belgium france and his mass because originally this phase had already been quite unpopular and is weakened and inside it increased internal dissensions and there was a fairly developed climate of distrust between the different traces of break-ins within power which could be summarized in two major trends to move quickly via the

(43:55) clan of thomas sankara and had the clan of blaise compaore who moreover still held most of the military power thomas sankara what the French strenx died at the agreement in cape town boukary kaboré my opinion the star me I had personally asked tomorrow which will be gently meters from the other said to stop the blaise compaore cartel because it must go up to his assassination he told me no the friendship does not not working I say thin and the most friendship people present

(44:41) will be able to plan dutil and it's not good the idea it's the same it's not correct friendship it's not Annie detailed friendship that and detailed I would like to turn a bit like a cyclist who camps a steep slope which has precipices on the left and right he is obliged to pedal we continue to pedal otherwise he falls then to remain myself and promise to feel myself I am obliged to continue in this momentum there you feel isolated Africa is poorly understood in any case

(45:21) misunderstood misloved manila we talked about che guevara and I said but listen to the 8 next october 8 is the 20th anniversary of the assassination of che guevara almost all night we were discussing the che and the manifestation of memories and suddenly that I remember as if it were yesterday they looked at me told me he died at 39 years old am I like che will I reach 39 years old and then the conversation resumed a sort of premonition of death it is not

(46:01) arrived at 30 africa once again shaken by the demon of the coup d'état the news was confirmed this morning in ouagadougou thomas sankara former head of state of burkina faso the former upper volta was killed yesterday during the attack on the presidential palace thomas sankara a president not quite like the others but blaise compaore 140 bis thomas knew very well that he was going to die I think he accepted suicide because somewhere also it was a big and he will still do good for

(47:04) to say that he is a great man that those who are against him can at least accept that because a man who agrees to die for you is greater then that must be recognized in this reason of the common value it's a French journalist from the fp who is in yaoundé and he said that it's the first time in his life that squirts in life is what this already crying ago slam this hadith crosses a hundred people like that of dozens of people of alaric full and

(47:40) when we are reassured from the north how much they have just learned of the assassination of Sankara which those all tell you it is not only Burkina Faso which felt that I think that society mows the days which followed but it's all Africa of blaise campaoré 1 guys.

(47:59) 5 president fabien choné chenaux press to have lost a friend of course and with regret also at moments of his life he is thought of us the equine scrub carreno brest quimper systematic the great men to a certain extent

(49:56) radiates their people he said their time well after their departure I say well after Le Mans because it is when you have lost something you realize some true value he is one of the important figures in level of the African continent who continue to be cited for his exemplarity for his courage for his integrity for his creativity for his the barrel of Afro-pessimism in general Sankara has become morally and spiritually a kind of master standard

(50:55) the themes make the Burkinabè except on the city the city a vulture map lomé in the night and with his voice of knowing vegetables he disturbs the silence of the night and all the men still a salt worker who feels hurt have rotten with an alarm and all of you has resumed its flight it is the parts I don't know where oh oh
