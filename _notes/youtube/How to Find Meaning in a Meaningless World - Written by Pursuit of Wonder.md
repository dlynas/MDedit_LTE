Transcript:
(00:00) this episode of after skool was written and  narrated by Robert Pantano the writer and   creator of pursuit of Wonder check out more  videos on pursuit of W's YouTube channel our   knowledge our conditions and our capabilities  as a species have and continue to progress at   unfathomable rates and yet with each new  generation in the modern world it seems as   though we have and continue to sink into greater  states of hopelessness and cynicism it is no   secret that an underlying tension between each new  generation from Gen X to Millennial millennial to  
(00:30) gen Z and almost certainly whatever is next to  come is an increasing degree of pessimism that   makes the previous generation look almost bubbly  and naive displays of this can be found in media   in art in advertising and in humor as things  like irony and dorismar over time to paraphrase   19th century philosopher Friedrich n optimism  is dead and we have killed it fundamentally   so many of us have outgrown more comfortable  shortsighted narratives and explanations of   life with increasing knowledge and awareness  we have now moved into a new realm in which  
(01:03) there appears to be no clear narrative or reason  for life at all what we seem to be left with is   in absurdity and meaninglessness to everything  we have reached the top of this world and yet   we see nothing from it this is perhaps one of if  not the greatest contemporary issue of humankind   finding motivation and a sense of meaning during a  time in which existence has revealed itself to be   or at least appears to be meaningless in order  to take any steps towards trying to Gra apple   with this problem of meaninglessness it can be  helpful to take a few steps back all the way back  
(01:35) to the late 19th century here German philosopher  friedi nche would find himself positioned at the   Forefront of the disintegration of meaning in  the Western World a primary aim of his life's   work would become centered on this problem at the  foundation of n's philosophy was the recognition   that there is no Universal objective truth to be  known or discovered in life there are no facts   only interpretations he wrote n denied the very  constru stru of any sort of Truth with a capital  
(02:02) T and suggested rather that all attempts to find  one are misguided and are what prevent Modern   Man from rediscovering any meaning in life the  pursuit of universal objectivity or meaning in   the world Beyond this one takes the spirit out of  the present Earthly Human Experience of meaning   which is inherently subjective independent and  expressive from here n argued that the individual   should thus turn away from dependence on any  universalities Collective experiences or cultural   mechanisms for meaning and instead he placed  the creation of meaning squarely in the hands  
(02:32) of the individual suggesting that it is found  in the personal pursuit of creative expression   and subjective greatness this philosophy would  be embodied in what n would term the Ubermensch   or Overman which he would first introduce in  his book Thus Spoke zarathustra the Overman is   described by nche as a sort of defiant confident  independent individual who pursues their personal   desires with Vigor and dignifies their independent  beliefs unapologetically someone who deviates from   the collective exhibits strategic selfishness  and acts with a sort of aggressiveness and  
(03:02) grandiosity these characteristics were justified  in n's view by the fact that a new morality that   opposed the moral views rooted in Christianity  which praise weakness and modesty was needed to   better suit the natural condition of the human  experience which he believed involved the desire   for Vigor power and greatness this view is not  without reasonable critiques and unreasonable   misinterpretations however perhaps what is more  important than n's definition of the Overman is   what the concept serves to represent in slightly  broader terms n sets up the Overman to function  
(03:34) as a sort of idealized version of oneself an  image of a perfect and Powerful being who has   overcome all their fears and deficiencies which  one can and should set goals to strive toward of   course as an ideal it can never truly be reached  but that is functionally the point the desire and   striving toward the ideal of the Overman serve as  Perpetual fuel for the process of self-growth as   one works through a continuous cycle of self-  dissatisfaction self-improvement and self-   rediscovery over and over for n this process what  you would term self-overcoming is fundamental to  
(04:07) answering and resolving the problem of meaning  and value in life so long as one establishes   one's goals of growth in the name of what one  deems to be an idealized life affirming version   of themselves this process transmutes life into  something worthwhile and personally redeemable   if we have our own why in life we shall get along  with almost any how n wrote several decades later   20th century writer and philosopher Alber Camu  would come into the picture largely picking up   the Baton from n what makes C's insights worth  stopping at on the topic of meaning is the way  
(04:38) in which he defined and engaged with the problem  cimu defined Humanity's relationship with the   universe and our pursuit of meaning within it as  the obsurd Camu writes if I see a man armed only   with a sword attack a group of machine guns I  shall consider his act to be absurd but it is   solely by virtue of the disproportion between his  intention and the reality he will encounter of the   contradiction I notice between his true strength  and the aim he has in view from the simplest to   the most complex the magnitude of the absurdity  will be in direct ratio to the distance between  
(05:09) the two terms of my comparison the Absurd  is essentially a divorce it lies in neither   of the elements compared it is born of their  confrontation in other words neither Humanity   nor the universe is necessarily absurd on its  own but rather their relationship is absurd as   we exist with and act out on our innate desire  for me meaning reason and order the universe   responds with none of the above thus what we want  and expect from the universe is fundamentally   in contradiction with what we get like n Kimu  rejects the nihilistic hopelessness that might  
(05:43) sound like a reasonable conclusion from this and  instead somewhat deviating from n Kimu provokes   the absurdity of Life as a means of finding worthy  and potent experience within it for Camu to become   aware of and accept the absurdity of life is to  transcend it and being conscious and appreciative   of the absurdity we can more freely look for  find and create things that are interesting   and personally meaningful F Camu continuing on in  life and using its absurdity as a means of virtue   exploration art and unique experience is perhaps  the highest and most worthy achievement it is thus  
(06:16) the absurdity of life that makes it worth living  in the first place furthermore Kimu suggested that   in recognizing our absurdity we can better accept  and Share value with other people because we can   better understand that all people are struggling  victims of the Absurd although these Concepts from   n and kamu are very useful there are still of  course significant challenges to creating one's   own meaning one especially difficult challenge is  deciding how to go about doing so with essentially  
(06:42) an infinite number of choices and combinations of  choices for how to determine one's ideal self what   to strive for and what to do with the absurdity of  everything the anxiety of choosing properly can be   difficult to Bear ironically though the choice we  make here and reaction to the anxiety of choice   is perhaps the most important choice choice of  all around the same time as Kimu and following   a similar thread of thought as both Kimu and N  the work of 20th century French philosopher Jean  
(07:08) Paul SRA helps provide us with useful insights and  motivation for getting over this hurdle SRA argued   that since in his view we are not created with a  specific purpose prior to existence we create our   purpose through the choices and actions we take  in life man SRA writes is nothing else but what   he purposes he exists solely in so far as he  realizes himself is therefore nothing else but   the sum of his actions nothing else but what  his life is since this responsibility can be   so overwhelming the easier knee-jerk response  is just not choosing to mindlessly assimilate  
(07:42) popular beliefs follow standard routes of life  and deflect nearly all the responsibility of   choice onto others s to refer to this however  as bad faith a form of lying to ourselves and   denying our basic freedom in other words it  is a short-term attempt to dampen the anxiety   of being that in turn costs us our authentic  self and experience of life even choosing to   not choose is still a choice there is no escaping  the requirements of choice and this is perhaps the   fundamental existential determination to choose or  not to choose in this Choice one either harnesses  
(08:15) the anguish of human Freedom or relinquishes  it either builds a life of intention or lives   a life of complacency SRA Camu n and many others  unmentioned saw the ground crumbling underneath   them and made it part of their life's work to  preserve deserve some of the foundation for us   what we are left with now and perhaps what we will  be left with for a very long time is merely that   foundation on which we must build our own homes  we must realize that this condition is not Barren   but ripe for opportunity that it permits us to  no longer be subservient to some specific Grand  
(08:48) meaning or template of life that we don't have  to discover or join in on someone else's ultimate   answer rather we can and should attempt to create  and build in this world using the blueprint of   our own design Dy it is of course all incredibly  hard and complicated but the challenge found in   this in the whirlpool of uncertainty absurdity  and responsibility is perhaps the unavoidable   price of the great gift that we are all given at  Birth to face up to the abyss to feel the anguish  
(09:16) of choice and potentiality to Bear the weight of  self all are but visceral humbling and beautiful   reminders of the potency of Life running through  our veins we are perhaps the only stop on this   evolutionary train that is outside the tunnel of  Darkness able to take the material of everything   and make it into something beautiful or helpful or  interesting to understand and create the meaning   of meaning itself and to do so just because we  can because the universe for some reason gave us   a blank page to write on we hope you enjoyed  this collaboration it was comprised of a few
