(00:05)  you   on July 8 2014
(01:36) Israel launched a devastating military attack on the Gaza Strip over the course of 51 days the Israeli military dropped nearly 20,000 tons of explosive on Gaza the densely populated area the size of Philadelphia killing over 2,000 Palestinians mooting tens of thousands more the overwhelming majority of these casualties were civilians this strip of land is being bombarded from the air sea and land Israel launched at least a hundred and sixty strikes on the Gaza Strip and there's one less Hospital in Gaza now Israel today flattened Wafaa
(02:13) hospital the sheer scale of the attack sparked outrage and condemnation around the world Israel's month-long pounding of Gaza shocked many people around the world mass demonstrations have been held in many of the world's major cities but in the United States the story was different polls showed the American people holding firm in their support for Israel this is the latest CNN o RC poll of American shows 57% of those polls say Israel's action in Gaza is justified 34 percent say unjustified these numbers
(02:51) were striking but they weren't new over the course of a conflict in which Palestinian casualties so far outnumbered Israeli casualties the American people have consistently shown far more sympathy for Israelis than for Palestinians it's very difficult to divorce public opinion on any question from the media coverage that people rely on to form opinions and I think the most prevalent lesson from looking at the coverage is that the coverage tends to see this conflict from the Israeli side study after study has demonstrated that
(03:23) Israeli perspectives dominate American media coverage so by far the most common thing we've heard is that everything comes down to Israel's right to defend itself Israel is a state that implements its right to defend itself and its citizens it is a talking point that is set from the top and by the top I mean from the highest officials government officials who are commenting on this issue which the media obsessively covers and repeats a man's got to do what a man's got to do in your countries got to
(03:53) do what a country's got to do we have to defend ourselves in the most recent war in 2014 when we looked at mainstream media outlets almost by a margin of 3 to 1 Israeli spokespeople over-represented compared to Palestinian spokespeople so almost every time you turned on the screen there was a Israeli representative on the screen telling you Israel is the one that's in a position of defense it is being attacked and basically is really saying hey you don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand that if rockets flying your
(04:28) head you allowed to defend yourself add to this the fact that you have American elected officials also reinforcing Israel's right to defend itself as I've said many times Israel has a right to defend itself against rocket and tunnel attacks from Hamas and you hear some of the same framing by bankers who reiterate and reinforce many of the same talking points that the Israeli official spokespeople are making Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas of course a group that is firing rockets on
(04:58) Israel coming out of tunnels to attack Israelis that imbalance there was very significant in shaping the way the the public understood this conflict I worked in the European media for a long time the coverage is the opposite there's Palestinian legislators Palestinian thinkers Palestinian intellectuals pro palestinian thinkers many voices so let me say ready very frankly it's very easy to blame the victim it's very easy to pull out a terrorist label you come to America and you think that you're an
(05:29) alien you're looking at the different world or different planets and I'm thinking what's going on here when a narrative is so dominant thousands of rockets were without any visible descent or complication it's it's extremely difficult to make clear to people that it is it is basically a propaganda story Israel is under siege by a terrorist organization how do you make that clear when the mainstream spectacle is so unrelenting and total we hear over and over again that the conflict comes down to
(06:03) Palestinian terrorism and Israeli security and what gets pushed out of the frame entirely is the fact out there for almost 50 years Palestinians have been systematically dispossessed from their land and denied their most basic human rights pioneers and refugees from countries of the oppression young and old they are going now to a land which accepts them they will march to their work in the Jewish settlements to build roads to quarry stones they will drill wells to restore to Palestine soil it's wrong neglection truthfulness
(06:50) Zionism the nationalist movement that emerged in Europe in the late 1800s was dedicated to the idea that the Jewish people after centuries of living as persecuted minorities within other countries were entitled to a state and historic Palestine the biblical homeland of the Jews more than three thousand years before but there was a basic problem with the choice from the start Palestine was already home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs who had been living in Palestine for centuries first under the rule of the
(07:22) Ottoman Empire and since World War one under the control of the British Empire and for decades had aspirations of their own for an independent state in Palestine tension steadily escalated during the 1930s placing more and more pressure on the British colonial government to reconcile the competing interests of both sides after World War 2 and the Holocaust the situation reached a breakpoint ultimately the British colonial government made the decision to withdraw and to pass the problem onto the newly created United
(07:57) Nations in 1947 UN resolution 181 recommended that Palestine be split into two parts Jews who were a third of the population would receive 56 percent of the land Palestinians who were two-thirds of the population and possessed more than 90 percent of historic Palestine would receive 44 percent these terms were immediately rejected by Arab leaders as unfair but in the spring of 1948 Zionist leaders declared Israel a state along the proposed borders anyway triggering the first arab-israeli war after winning a crushing victory Israel
(08:41) took possession of even more land by the time armistice was declared in 1949 Israel controls 78% of historic Palestine the creation of the new state would be celebrated by Israelis as a triumph but to this day it is commemorated by Palestinians as the Nakba the Arabic term for the catastrophe in memory of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who were driven from their homes to make way for the new Jewish state all told approximately 700,000 people more than half of Palestines native population were uprooted there is a lot
(09:17) of sympathy that can be generated I think rightly so for what Jewish people as a whole have dealt with in Western societies and globally because of anti-semitism the question then becomes what is the proper response to that the zionist answer is of course statehood and there's many people who would sympathize with that if it was in fact done in a vacuum and if it was in fact done for a people without a land in a land without people the reality is that's just not the way that it happened there were people here they lost their
(09:56) homes their livelihood their nation their everything this was a land in 1910 that was 93 percent Palestinian Arab and 67 percent Jewish how did it suddenly become 80 percent Jewish and 20 percent Palestinian this was not a normal demographic transition this was a consequence of Israel's desire to create a Jewish state and to do that I'd have to get rid of as many Palestinians as possible there's other more complex factors but that's cutting it to its bare-bones as we see it that is I think in a certain sense the core of the
(10:27) conflict the Palestinians have suffered inordinately as a result of the creation of Israel the creation of a Jewish state in a country that had an Arab majority necessarily and inevitably caused the irreparable harm the Palestinians used the term catastrophe to speak of the 1948 consequences when they lost their land the first time around in 67 it was another Nakba another catastrophe in June of 1967 Israel won what was perceived as a stunning underdog victory over much larger Arab armies during the six-day war with
(11:04) victory in addition to taking land from Egypt in Syria Israel began to militarily occupy all remaining Palestinian territory in the West Bank the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem suddenly all of Palestine is now lost we now had no Palestinian land left under Palestinian control you had a huge Palestinian population living as refugees or living under occupation Palestinians are governed under military law they are essentially prisoners they are treated as if they were all prisoners of war they have no rights and
(11:42) the immediate aftermath of the 67 war the United Nations Security Council passed resolution 242 citing international law forbidding the takeover of territory by war 242 explicitly called for Israel to withdraw its Armed Forces but to this day Israel has largely failed to comply not only holding Palestinian territory the confiscating additional land and building massive Jewish settlement blocks in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in direct violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention which expressly forbids States from transferring
(12:19) civilian populations into territory it occupies in addition Israel has established an entire matrix of security control on Palestinian land to secure these settlements including checkpoints that prevent Palestinians from travelling freely within their own land and a 440 mile security wall along the Israeli border that cuts into Palestinian territory we're talking about massive denial of human rights for millions of people at the most basic level the government that is ruling over these people is not a government in
(12:54) which these people the Palestinians have a voice there's really no way to fully understand why the Palestinian people have resisted Israel for so long without understanding this basic history of dispossession and occupation but for the most part this isn't a story we get an American media coverage instead the legitimate grievances of Palestinians including their right to resist an illegal military occupation get pushed out of the frame by this constant discussion about extremism and terrorism and anti-semitism
(13:27) you know rational clear minded people understand that Hamas is a terrorist and wiping Israel off the face of the earth that's not debatable that's a fact it's never about land somehow that gets dropped out it's never about settlements it's always about they hate us because we're Jewish whatever the Palestinians have done is portrayed in terms of mindless violence against Jews out of some kind of primeval anti-semitism no sense of how this started where that animus comes from it's completely
(13:58) inexplicable in them and in the way in which it's generally presented and these people basically kill because they hate and they hate because they're irrational Muslim fanatics or whatever and I think Americans largely get it they know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are this is not an illusion American public opinion is generally supportive of Israel because it's been led to believe that Israel is in the right and the Arabs are bad guys none of this is by accident is the result that with the
(14:24) deliberate effort to shape American perceptions of the conflict a propaganda effort that really begins to take shape with Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982  Israel unleashed another massive air attack on Palestinian guerrilla targets in Lebanon today Israeli Jets tonight Israel has never been closer to nor more in control of an Arab capital in the summer of 1982 Israel invaded neighboring Lebanon in an attempt to drive the Palestinian Liberation Organization out of its encampments on the southern border with
(15:05) Israel Israeli officials justified the attack as a defensive action required to take out terrorists that is the story played out on American television a different narrative began to emerge one that presented Israel as the aggressor what in the world is going on Israel's security problem on its border is 50 miles to the south what's an Israeli army doing here in Beirut the answer is that we are now dealing with an imperial Israel which is solving its problems in someone else's country world opinion be
(15:36) damned the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 was a watershed it was Israel breaking out beyond its immediate region to aggressively attack another country and it was a bit of a shock to many people Israel was always that Gallup little underdog democracy fighting for survival against all the odds now the Israelis have annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights settle down more or less permanently on the West Bank and occupied close to half of Lebanon in the interests of self-defense that gallant little underdog Israel has suddenly started
(16:19) behaving like the neighborhood bully by the time the war was over the Israeli military would kill 17 thousand Lebanese and Palestinians and wound another 30,000 almost all of them civilians the phosphorus shells locate those concussions in fact directed to other facilities just a few months later American media coverage who take an even darker turn there's been another horrendous turn of events in the Middle East hundreds of men women and children perhaps as many as a thousand people in all have been massacred in two Palestinian refugee
(16:59) camps in West Beirut Israel's Lebanese allies operating with the consent of the Israeli government had massacred several thousand Palestinian civilians in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila and American news media had the pictures to prove it the Israelis permitted an armoured column of right-wing Christian gunmen to enter West Beirut late Friday they took up positions surrounding Shatila refugee camp last night and this morning they were gone bloody massacre which has heightened tensions between the US and Israel sabasha tila was
(17:29) hardly the first massacre committed by Israel against Palestinians and against Arabs there's a dirty legacy of Israeli massacres from the pre state through the creation of the state and beyond the big difference was this one was televised by all appearances groups of men had been ordered to stand against the wall and then gunned down in cold blood they're killing our family this was a game changer in terms of how Israel was going to deal with the question of publicity they went on the offensive for the first
(18:08) time all the direct or implicit accusations that the IDF bear any blame whatsoever for this human tragedy in the Shatila camp are entirely baseless and without any foundation the government of Israel rejects them with a contempt which they deserve it was perhaps the first time they recognized at the highest levels inside Israel how much they needed to do that if they expected to maintain the kind of understood support in the United States Israel can do no wrong Israel as always the the victim Israel is the little David
(18:44) against the big bad Goliath two years after the Lebanon invasion the American Jewish Congress sponsored a conference in Jerusalem to devise a formal public relations strategy known in hebrew as hospira participants included PR and advertising executives media specialists journalists and leaders of major Jewish groups according to a brochure from the Congress no single event brought home the need for a more effective hospira or information program more persuasively than the 1982 war in Lebanon and the events that
(19:18) followed as one conference participant put it Israel is no longer perceived to be little David but the lie of steamrolling across the map the primary aim of the conference was to develop strategies to spin unpopular Israeli policies and to counter negative press coverage by shaping the media frame in advance news doesn't just jump into a camera the conference delegate said it's directed it's managed it's made accessible Israel based advertising executive Martin Fenton would put it in even more blunt terms
(19:50) propaganda is not a dirty word he said face it we are in the game of changing people's minds of making them think differently to accomplish that we need propaganda the conference was chaired by US advertising executive Carl spiel Vogel the legendary ad man who created the highly acclaimed Miller like beer ads in the 1970s the choices feel Vogel makes perfect sense he's known as a master of image inversion and rebranding the ad man responsible for transforming Miller Lite which had been viewed before
(20:24) as a woman's beer into a manly beer that tough guys were trained the best part is that it tastes so great the best part is it's less filling no it tastes great less filling his job with Israel would require the same kind of rebranding only in the opposite direction to help soften the image of a country that's coming to be seen as a bully so he recommends creating a cabinet post dedicated exclusively to explaining policy whose job would not be setting policy but presenting it in the most attractive way to the rest of the world
(20:56) classic PR is to say the problem is not the policy it's the presentation when the policies are so reprehensible that many people become critical rather than acknowledge there's anything wrong with the policy there's a doubling down on the PR effort after Lebanon you start to see the basic Hasbro strategy in action images of Palestinians fighting back against Israel's occupation make their way onto American television screens and Israeli military crushes this resistance in brutal ways that undercut Israel's image as underdog
(21:31) and victim helicopter gunships deliberately fire a missile into a crowd of civilians last night killing seven Palestinians and wounding 70 more then Israeli officials going to Full House BrahMos an act of the occupation doesn't even exist framing all Palestinian resistance as terrorism and Israeli aggression as self-defense we will do whatever it takes to defend ourselves and defend ourselves we will that's the basic Hasbro strategy in a nutshell even when you're violently crushing resistance your own brutal occupation
(22:07) portray Israel as an innocent victim by demonizing Palestinians as nothing but terrorists the Palestinian terror campaign continues it only justifies again and again that we Israel have to continue and defend ourselves there have been horrific Palestinian terrorist attacks and I use that word very specifically to mean what terrorism means which is attacks on civilians for a political purpose anger in Israel today at last night's suicide bomb in Tel Aviv which killed four and wounded 50 those are horrific attacks which
(22:40) should be condemned they are violations of international law period but the problem is Israeli violence is assumed to be legitimate because it's always self-defense some of the people who have been killed are said to be civilians in fact two of them are said to be little girls but the Israeli military says they try to the best of their knowledge make sure whoever they are striking was unknown militant all the cases when Palestinian people were killed by the Israeli military and this is not called acts of terror and one
(23:10) should ask why if it is civilians who are being killed but from a plane and not by a suicide bomber why this is not terror and only terrorists when somebody is killed by a suicide bomber if the terrorists label can only be affixed to one set of people but not another set of people then you're in an Orwellian zone you're down a rabbit hole of linguistic manipulation the last thing they want is a political settlement what they want is more demonstrations more rights more bodies that's what they want and so this
(23:45) becomes the framing of this situation Israel is defending itself which means Israel is not the aggressor here that doesn't square with the reality on the ground and we know that you have a right to defend yourself you don't have a right to occupy people deny them their human rights and then cry foul when they resist that's not the right to self-defence that's the right to repression that's what Israel is asking for here let us do away with these dissenters these Palestinian dissenters and call it
(24:17) defense as news media have proliferated over the years Israel's public relations efforts have only become more and more explicit and intense in the united states we have a show called The Apprentice where Donald Trump auditions people to work in his corporate boardroom in Israel the version of The Apprentice is called the Ambassador the ambassador in a world where the real battles take place in newsrooms and TV studios the ability to create a positive image for your country is a crucial task for every ambassador
(24:58) it's a show where Israelis compete for who can offer the best Hasbro that means explain in Hebrew explain our situation while The Apprentice test contestants ability to sell lemonade on the street or handle office politics the Ambassador finalists have learned that selling real politics is a lot harder the problem is that when you sell emanate nobody hates lemonade say that your lemonade occupies territory okay your lemonade kills babies Israel's mechanism of projecting its propaganda or what they call
(25:33) Hezbollah is one of the most sophisticated arms of its government it's a weapon of Israeli warfare and when you look today at how the media cover the conflict you see just how successful Israel's propaganda has been in reversing the legacy of Lebanon if there's any complaints and there should be about civilian deaths that they they belong the responsibility and the blame belongs in one place Hamas I don't think anyone should get that wrong the Israeli position is the first position they are allowed to
(26:01) determine the narrative determine the facts on the ground Hamas is a tear or ghen ization committed to our destruction they fired thousands of rockets at our cities it becomes a story of Israelis responding to Palestinian attacks Israel says this is a response to the almost 800 rockets that had landed in Israel from Gaza this year alone again and again the wider context of Israel's occupation simply drops out of the coverage so it comes across as is confusing an endless cycle of violence that begins when Palestinians attack and
(26:31) Israelis retaliate in self-defense three Palestinians were shot and killed while allegedly trying to attack Israelis with kitchen knives this cycle of violence continues when Hamas launches rockets from Gaza is real hits back cycle of violence presupposes this back and forth retaliation it's the same sort of thing with a lull in the violence or a relative calm after three days of relative calm the violence is once again picking up here in the Middle East well relative to who into what right what's actually going on on the ground is not
(27:06) ever a lull in the violence for Palestinians in fact occupation is a system of violence that goes on every single day just because there's no violence that Israelis are witnessing for a particular period of time before it resumes again does not mean that there's no violence facing Palestinians from the occupation so this law and the violence is only seen through the prism of Israeli victimhood not Palestinian victimhood it's no wonder that Americans would identify with the Israeli side or or support it it would be shocking if
(27:40) they didn't and I think this is the lesson to be drawn from 30 years of media coverage that I think has been slanted heavily in favor of Israeli interests what we've seen is really another kind of occupation an occupation of American media and what we could call the American mind bry pro-israel narrative best deflected attention away from well virtually everyone recognizes as the best way to resolve this conflict and the occupation and the settlements so that Palestinians can finally have a state of their own
(28:16) ladies and gentlemen mr. Arafat chairman of the Executive Council of the Palestine Liberation Organization His Excellency Yitzhak Rabine Prime Minister of Israel the president of the United States the ongoing peace process that began with the Oslo peace accords in 1993 was designed to negotiate the terms of Israel's withdrawal from Palestinian territory in accordance with UN resolution 242 which made an explicit connection between Israeli withdrawal and adjust and lasting peace for decades there has been an overwhelming
(28:53) international consensus on a political settlement of the conflict namely a settlement on the internationally recognized border the international consensus for a two-state solution is based on the borders in place before the 67 war this means that Israel gets 78% and the Palestinians get the rest 22% of historic Palestine 22 percent that's it but since Oslo Israel has actually taken more Palestinian land for its Jewish only settlements in 1993 there were approximately 200,000 illegal Jewish settlers living in the occupied
(29:31) Palestinian territories since then that number has more than tripled with approximately 650,000 settlers now living in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in addition since 1967 Israel has also demolished approximately 28,000 Palestinian homes the United Nations says there's been a big increase in the number of Palestinian homes demolished by Israeli forces this is what Palestinians have called ethnic cleansing demolitions and evictions carried out by Israel in the occupied West Bank so if you look at the result
(30:14) not the words and the pretty phrases what's happened over the past 20 years and was inaugurated at Oslo was not a peace process it was an annexation process what has happened is that now 1 in 11 Israeli Jews live in these illegal settlements so the failure to confront the settlement enterprise from the very beginning I think has created a almost insuperable obstacle to the creation of a Palestinian state there's no place to put it and that's what the settlements are all about it's to claim the land
(30:46) facts on the ground that become nothing we can do about it now it's too late Israel wants as much of the land as they can get away with with as few Palestinians on it as possible Israeli governments from the very beginning after the 67 war never considered giving up Israeli control of territories Moshe Dayan who served as defense minister and foreign ministry people asked them what will be the future now we're controlling the territories and he said the future will be exactly what it is today we must continue to retain the control
(31:23) of these territories just listen to Netanyahu talking in private to his right-wing settler base in 2001 about how he has no intention despite what is really great so at Oslo a giving up land and ending its illegal settlement expansion in the West Bank and the rest of the Jordan Valley now is clear that Israel's not giving anything up but it's also very clear that the way to make that argument is to invoke security threats and is especially confident but it can manipulate the American people to buy into this argument and this of course is
(32:33) exactly the case is made to the American people time and time again whenever Israel's been called out for refusing to end the occupation and its settlement project we're willing to make great concessions for peace but there is something that I will never compromise on and that's Israel's security the conventional wisdom is that continuing the occupation makes Israel more secure and if you buy that argument then it's a license to occupy indefinitely what we're talking about here is something that is completely
(33:09) indefensible Israel knows this Israel knows this very well and for that reason wants to talk about anything and everything else they'd rather talk about terrorism they'd rather talk about security they'd rather talk about Iran anything but the occupation the reason they've been able to so effectively change the subject isn't because they're practicing some kind of mass mind control the main reason is that the US government itself has had a vested interest in promoting the same narrative
(33:39) for almost 50 years now this goes back to the start of the so-called special relationship with Israel in the late 1960s when the u.s. decides to deputize Israel and make it what the Nixon administration called a cop on the beat to protect American interests in the Middle East especially US energy supplies ever since the American government has continued to give Israel roughly three billion dollars a year in military aid while also vetoing one UN resolution after another condemning the occupation and settlements the challenge is to make
(34:11) sure that the American people stay on board with us aid despite what Israel is doing a number of well-funded public relations organizations have emerged within the United States to help Israel justify his policies especially the occupation and settlements on security grounds one of these groups is the Israel project in 2009 the Israel project turned a conservative poster and rebranding expert Frank Luntz Frank once this is the man that reframed the estate tax as the death tax health care reform as government takeover of health care
(34:47) now some critics have called Luntz a spin doctor who manipulates public emotion but lunch would reframe that as Fox News analysts the Israel project hired him to determine which talking points used by Israeli and US officials over time have been most effective in maintaining American sympathy for Israel lunch wrote up his recommendations in a 2009 report called the global language dictionary if you want to understand how the propaganda works especially in the US you need to read the lunch document he's really clear that the occupation
(35:20) and especially the settlements are a problem and he points the polls that show a large majority of Americans actually think that Israel should retreat to the 67 borders in fact he says when you talk about land in terms of 67 you completely flip American sentiment against you but and this is a solution if you bring up the danger of terrorism you win back to support the key Lunt says is the claim that the fight is over ideology not land about terror not territory in fact these three words terror not territory summarize the
(35:56) basis of the propaganda campaign in the US and Lance goes on to say that one of the most effective ways to make the conflict about terrorism is to refer to an obscure political document written in 1988 by a small group of ideologues charter that calls for the destruction of Israel even though the Hamas leadership effectively disowned the charter a long time ago it's been PR gold for Israel lunch research has discovered that when Americans hear the words of the Charter Israel goes from bully to victim and sympathy for the
(36:28) plight of the Palestinians dissipates so he says don't just quote it read it out loud again and again and his advice has been taken up often hysterically by Israel's advocates Hamas charter not only costs resources structures ladies and gentlemen article 7 calls for the murder of every Jew it costs for the murder of every Jew it's a Nazi document we have the Israeli prime minister saying movements like Hamas that are national movements are the same thing as Isis Hamas is like Isis Hamas is like Al
(37:06) Qaeda Hamas is like his Butler Hamas is like Boko Haram and they are completely not the same thing and anyone who understands anything about the Middle East and political dynamics there will explain to you exactly why that is the case and and immediately spot that for the propaganda that it is Hamas is as much a nationalist movement as it is an a religious movement in fact that often assigns priority to its nationalist goes over its religious girls this false notion of Hamas is part of this al Qaeda Network is not bought even by important
(37:47) elements of the American military in 2010 the United States Central Command or CENTCOM the highest military command in the US issued a classified report the questioned the current US policy of isolating and marginalizing Hamas as well as Hezbollah in Lebanon the report described the two groups as pragmatic and argued that putting them and al-qaeda in the same sentence as if they're all the same is just stupid and it directly repudiated Israel's publicly stated view that Hamas and Hezbollah are incapable of change and must be
(38:18) confronted with force warning that failing to recognize their grievances and objectives would result in continued failure in moderating their behavior and the US military isn't alone in this assessment Isis itself has attacked Hamas again and again because they're not radical enough they're too pragmatic and too compromising but none of these facts thought people from going on and on about Hamas charter anyway in order to paint Hamas with the same brush as Isis I spent a lot of time on my radio program going over Hamas is
(38:51) charter what it says it wants to obliterate Israel it wants to destroy the Jews it is a sick twisted you know perverted ideology a religion that has been hijacked by radicals and it manifests itself in different forms Muslim Brotherhood Islamic Jihad Hamas Hezbollah Isis al Qaeda you know it's all the same thing meanwhile you hear next to nothing about another extreme political charter that is much more relevance to the conflict the platform of the ruling Likud Party in Israel well if you look at the language that's in
(39:26) that Charter the allah kuch arter it flatly rejects quote flatly rejects the existence of a palestinian state anywhere anywhere on that side of the Jordan River in other words completely denying the right of a state of Palestine to exist that's far more relevant to have language like the language in the lucu charter being the charter of a party that is the largest in an Israeli government driving an Israeli state and has the capacity to act upon the words in their charter in a way that no other party does to strengthen the case that
(40:02) the conflict is about terrorism and not territory Luntz points to the effectiveness of another well established israeli talking point the claim that israel gave up control of Gaza in 2005 in hopes of achieving peace and a two-state solution and got only Rockets in return we left Gaza completely we had Gaza they could have turned it into a flourishing wonderful place to live in look at what they did they turned into a haven of terrorists coming from all over the world it's completely untrue Israel left the the Gaza Strip they did
(40:35) withdraw their colonists but at the same time they tightened their control over the Gaza Strip this is goss's main freight route into Israel and normally this road would be bumper-to-bumper with heavily laden trucks but it's completely closed as is every other border crossing in the country nothing's coming into Gaza and nothing is getting out so the idea that Israel left is 100 percent bonus Gaza remains occupied Gaza has no control over its Coast over its waters over its harbor over its airspace over the land
(41:11) or its borders over its people who can come and go is totally at the Israeli discretion in Gaza there are constant military attacks by the Israeli Air Force by drones targeted assassinations go on all the time it wasn't really a withdrawal but the conventional shorthand in the media is that Israel was willing to give up an enormous amount to the Palestinian side and the Palestinians responded with violence Israel for since 1967 controlled Gaza they gave it to the Palestinians in a gesture of peace and all they got are
(41:50) bunch of rockets this is the basic frame of Israel's PR campaign make sure the media stays focused on terrorism and a masked extremism as a source of the conflict not the occupation and the settlements if you want to see this in operation just look at the coverage of any of Israel's many attacks on Gaza over the past few years good evening in the sixty years of conflict between Israel and the Palestinians there have been few if any days like this one the scale and intensity of this attack was surprising
(42:24) a deadliest operation against Palestinians in decades after an intense three-week assault 1,300 dead 5,000 wounded in late December of 2008 Israel launched Operation Cast Lead a massive ground and air assault on the Gaza Strip over a period of three weeks the Israeli military dropped over 600 tons of bombs on Gaza nearly 1,400 Palestinians were killed and thousands more engines the wounded were carried on corrugated iron the worst one-day casualty toll in Gaza anybody can remember normally of a conflict civilians can run for their
(43:15) lives Gaza was one of the few if not the only modern conflict were the helpless civilians who were subjected to massive technologically advanced firepower by the Israelis had no escape route with Gaza City bombed and burning Palestinians heeded Israel's warning to get out of the way but found they had nowhere to go what's a safe place for us to go the woman cried not the UN compound where 700 people took shelter Israeli artillery hit it then hit it again that was a brutal murderous attack devastating this attack was murders as
(43:55) with the Lebanon invasion three decades before horrific images of destruction spilled onto television screens around the world but this time the Israeli government was prepared six months earlier it had set up a new unit within the Israeli prime minister's office to help coordinate the government's messaging once the invasion started Israel is defending its action saying this assault is in direct response to almost daily rocket and mortar attacks if you asked any American why that war started they would say because
(44:25) the Palestinians started you know firing rockets at Israel Hamas keeping up the rocket fire that triggered the Israeli attacks in the first place Hamas once again firing several dozen rockets into Israel today they're always preparing Americans for an attack against these people who are incorrigible terrorists who are constantly shooting rockets and never ever giving the other side of the story we were told endlessly in any media outlet you want to look at that Israel had to invade an attack the Gaza Strip
(44:55) because of an unending assault from Hamas and various militant groups in Gaza what are the goals of that operation right now to change totally the behavior of the Hamas is a terrorist regime that keep shelling Israel with thousands of rockets and a motor sense what this forgets is that for the latter half of 2008 there was a very successful ceasefire that curtailed rocket fire into Israel dramatically almost to the point at which there was none this was shattered in November of 2008 when Israel attacked what they said was
(45:35) a tunnel building project killed six Hamas militants at that point the ceasefire was off now the New York Times the so-called paper of record reported this very clearly one time the story gets buried on page 8 of the New York Times and hardly registers anywhere else why well look at the day that Israel chose to break the ceasefire November 4th 2008 which just coincidentally happened to be the day of the historic election of Barack Obama it virtually guaranteed that no one in America would notice and that's exactly how it played
(46:07) out when Hamas resumed rocket attacks after Israel broke the ceasefire Israeli officials went on American television and got away with blaming Hamas for breaking the ceasefire you know it was Kumasi that unilaterally tore up the ceasefire understandings it was camasta escalated advance that reached a crescendo on Christmas Day when we had in one 24-hour period some 80 rockets mortar shells and missiles coming into Israel attacking our civilians now we want to work with the power in government and the law was then
(46:37) repeated uncritically by US news media games there's no question here is there that Hamas started this well look I don't think Israel had any choice it was a ceasefire that was broken by Hamas they fired something like 300 rockets into Israel I mean this is an act of war what are they supposed to do just compare this to how media outside the US dealt with this isn't it the fact that during the ceasefire not a single Israeli was killed and the reason for that was because Hamas fired not a single rocket no I think you're wrong
(47:04) unfortunately because during that ceasefire of six months they were firing rockets on a daily basis on channel 4 in Britain you saw an anchor presenting evidence that the Israeli government itself acknowledged that Hamas observed the ceasefire actually a document that's given to journalists by the Israeli government and in this document it says and I'm quoting Hamas was careful to maintain the ceasefire he's right the official clearly caught in a lie attempts to change the subject to how evil Hamas is but the interviewer
(47:30) doesn't let him get away with it yeah we're firing rockets and they're always trying to target civilians their main goal is to try to kill children and women I'm gonna have to stop you because this document is published by the intelligence and terrorism Information Center at the Israel intelligence heritage and commemoration center and they say foreign journalists by the government listen now the fact you like the facts or you'd like exchanges like these are unthinkable in the u.s. even though
(48:06) Israel itself behind the scenes acknowledged Hamas said observe the ceasefire something another British reporter forced Israeli spokesperson Mark Regev to admit on camera there were no Hamas workers during the ceasefire before November the 4th there were no pinaster offered for four months and that's correct Israel officially recognizes that until it broke the ceasefire if I must in fire single rocket I mean the propaganda is so powerful that these truisms literally truisms are almost in experienceable the
(48:39) lesson is that this conflict started when we say it started and we say it started when Israel was attacked in 2012 and again in 2014 Israel goes to more devastating attacks on Gaza Israel can saturate the media with its spokespeople but there's still the problem of massive Palestinian casualties showing up on television screens you can't make those images go away and Israeli official actually said in the war of pictures we lose so you need to correct explain or balance it in other ways here again the lunch document spells out
(49:25) which talking points have been most effective in spinning the brutal reality of Palestinian casualties he says the first thing the pro-israeli spokespeople should do is to express empathy for the innocent victims unfortunately innocents do get hurt and we we really grieve that we're sad for every civilian casualty the entire situation is tragic once you've done that lund says you also have to get people to empathize with Israelis by describing what life is like for them living in constant fear of Hamas rocket
(49:56) attacks so again and again we hear the focus tested phrase that the rockets are raining down on Israel we have thousands of rockets raining down and our civilians rockets were raining down on Israel and the advertising executive will tell you the essence of propaganda is repetition rockets raining down on southern Israel rockets raining down on Israel Hamas rockets rain down on Israeli border towns then lunch tells PR spokespeople to turn the tables and ask the American people what would you do so what would
(50:29) you do in the United States you imagine what America would do if it were facing a similar threat you always try to ask you the question we ask ourself what will you do what would you do what would you do if more than 3000 Rockets had been fired on your cities what would you do 3,000 rockets what would you do if terrorists were tunneling under your frontiers what would you do if three kids are kidnapped because of a tunnel network what sort of question is this of course anybody would act to defend themselves against unprovoked aggression
(51:00) but it is a court that is completely devoid of any context what drives society to a point where after multiple devastating Wars they continue to resist with these most feeble methods they don't want you to ask that question they don't want you to ask what is behind this what's the history here who are these people where did they come from why are they so desperate no they want you to understand Israeli behavior Israeli behavior is always characterized as a reaction to unprovoked violence then on top of that when massive numbers
(51:32) of Palestinian civilians predictably die from Israeli attacks Israel claims is part of a deliberate Hamas strategy to drum up sympathy they use telegenic ly dead Palestinians for their cause they want the more dead the better so they end up in this upside-down Orwellian world where Israelis killing civilians becomes an unforgivable transgression against Israelis it is hard to come away with any feeling but that we are in the midst of a world gone mad last week I found a quote of many years ago by Golda Meir one of Israel's early leaders which
(52:08) might have been said yesterday we can forgive the Arabs for killing our children she said but we can never forgive them for forcing us to kill their children it's not difficult to imagine Americans identifying with Palestinians who are suffering but they need to be able to see that suffering on their television screens and in their newspapers Israel said today it's new offensive is targeting terrorists and when your sense of the coverage is that there's something that these people did to deserve this or that they are affiliated
(52:43) with terrorists and terrorist minded governments the fallout of that is an inability to identify with people who are suffering in far greater numbers and in far greater proportion than their Israeli counterparts the effort to shape American perceptions of the israeli-palestinian conflict has been taken up by a number of pro-israel groups
(53:14) based in the u.s. together these groups are commonly referred to as the Israel lobby nowhere has the lobbyists power to shape a pro-israel narrative being more visible than in the US Congress too largely to the efforts of one of the most influential lobbying groups working on Capitol Hill today the American Israel Public Affairs Committee better known as APEC  it is great to see so many good friends from all across the country I see more than 10,000 people young and old apex annual conference draws nearly 10,000 attendees from around the country
(53:53) including the most influential members of both houses of Congress from both parties  as you leave here today to meet with your Senators and Representatives I want you to go there knowing with certainty that you'll make a difference with every member that you mean you're gonna feel so good when six months from now you see the three major talking points evolved to three points of legislation for the u.s.
(54:25) gov bill it would be very hard for ordinary Americans to know that they're being deceived that that some very competent experts that's been management are in fact deluding them they're many reasons for this one of them is that the American political class has basically swallowed the line hook line & sinker they kept getting rocket attack after rocket attack and then they're criticized for human rights problems because they defend themselves this is particularly true for Republicans but responding mr. speaker to attacks on
(54:57) their civilian population I mean what is it that they want well we know what they want they want Israel obliterated from the map mr. speaker but it's also true for many Democrats we stand with our ally we stand with a democratic state of Israel we stand against terrorism this administration will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself they made the mistake of actually leaving a pax fax address on one bill that was actually laid before Congress and of course nobody was apparently embarrassed
(55:29) the fact that AIPAC writes the legislation for them or writes their speeches for them doesn't seem to in the least bother people there's nothing happening here that secret are under the table it's not a cabal it's not a conspiracy it is in fact domestic politics the way it's practiced here in the United States they're roughly three dozen or so pro-israel PACs that give money over the last 15 or 20 years they've given fifty five sixty million dollars in American elections there are
(55:57) one or two Arab American PACs and I believed last time I look they'd given you know eight hundred thousand to a million so you've got fifty five million dollars of PAC contributions on one side and you've got maybe a million at most on the other side and that gives you a pretty good sense of what the the power is if you're planning on running for Congress it's all about the money and I do see a lot of old friends here and I see a lot of new friends of Israel here as well Democrats and Republicans alike evening
(56:32) Netanyahu got a joint session so that Democrats and Republicans we have the opportunity to stand up and cheer for him and it would be good for their campaigns to raise money he put out the most hardline propaganda that went entirely against US policy the border will be different than the one that existed on June 4th 1967 Israel will not return to the indefensible boundaries of 1967  and he gets on ir 39 standing ovations what are they applauding the continuation of the conflict are they employing that more Israelis and
(57:09) Palestinians Israel keep dying is that what they're applauding no they're applauding we want more money in the next campaign that's what it's entirely about there is no other issue like this for the most part the lobby pushes policies that are consistent with US interests anyway and when he's interested on a line we see the limits of the lobbies power as we saw with Obama's Iran policy which passed despite an intense campaign by the lobby to defeat it so we shouldn't overstate the
(57:39) influence of the lobby on American foreign policy but at the same time we shouldn't underestimate the lobbies power to limit debate by the Israeli policies in the occupied territories especially far-right Israeli policies that are often way out of step with the political views of most American Jews in fact it's not accurate to call it the Jewish lobby at all it's the Israel lobby the actual views of most people in the American Jewish community according to every poll diverge greatly from the extreme right-wing neoconservative views
(58:11) of the entire establishment leadership of that community most people in the Jewish community are much more liberal they're against settlement they're against occupation they want a two-state solution the lobby and it's the various other institutions are the main supports and props of settlement and occupation and of protection of the status quo and there are some key elements of what we call the Israel lobby that are Jewish so-called Christian Zionist evangelical Christians in America have become
(58:37) Israel's staunchest Ally in an increasingly hostile world powerful groups like Kufa Christians United for Israel lobby Congress for an expansion of Israeli territory because they believe that's what the Bible calls for Kufa representatives from all 50 states went to Capitol Hill their purpose was to personally speak with their elected officials and express concerns for Israel's security and their support of Israel's right to the land by biblical mandate and the United States roughly a third of the popular
(59:08) believes that every word of the Bible is literally true if the Bible is literally true then the Land of Israel was promised to the Jews by God and they have every right to make it over from the surfers listen closely those of you who are listening in the liberal media the Jewish people are not occupying the land of Israel they owned the land of Israel Israel is God gave the Land of Israel to Abraham in an eternal blood covenant 4,000 years ago the Land of Israel belong to the Jewish people then it belongs to the Jewish people today
(59:55) and it will belong to the Jewish people forever the land is their land one of the problems with the influence Israel lobby has in the United States now is it has been hard for government officials to have an honest discussion just look what happened to President Obama when he made the mistake of simply saying out loud what the international consensus is we believe the borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps so that secure and recognized borders are established for both States it didn't
(1:00:30) matter that Obama was just repeating what have been official US policy for decades or the right wing President Ronald Reagan had said essentially the same thing in the 1980s in even stronger language UN resolution 242 remains wholly valid as the foundation stone of America's Middle East peace effort it is the United States position that in return for peace the withdrawal provision of resolution 242 applies to all fronts including the West Bank and Gaza further settlement activity is in no way necessary for the security of
(1:01:03) Israel and only diminishes the confidence of the Arabs that a final outcome can be freely and fairly negotiated when Obama said it he was immediately accused by right-wing groups of setting up Israel for another Holocaust as President Obama abandoned after strong support by 11 consecutive American presidents it appears Obama has moved sharply toward Israel's enemies and the results could be disastrous the leader of Hezbollah has vowed to finish the job it was started up till now America's strong backing of Israel made that impossible
(1:01:32) but with Obama's waffling for the second Holocaust be on the way it's a pretty ingenious tactic how are you supposed to have a rational discussion about the occupation when pro-israel extremists core the 67 borders that al Schwartz borders these are the two alternatives you're either gonna be now switching to support Israel because Israel was in fact created in the wake of the Holocaust it isn't that extraordinary that the two would be linked that way I have a problem with the idea of exploiting the links and using those six
(1:02:05) million Jews and almost in my mind it's like saying Anne Frank would want the occupation to continue you know the Jews have gone through unspeakable historical trauma right but the fact is that if you look at other sort of reactionary or right-wing propaganda as various kinds you know nationalistic and so on you see that what they all kind of have in common is this view that we are being endangered we are victims they're trying to destroy us if history start the Jewish people anything it is that we must take calls for our destruction
(1:02:43) seriously we're a nation that rose from the ashes of the Holocaust when we say never again we mean never again you're the victim so anything you do in self-defense is okay even though it has you acting like a monster right a suggestion that Israel has committed war crimes is particularly offensive given that the Jewish people suffered under the most horrific war crimes in the Holocaust it's their argument they always use remember the Holocaust always invoking the Holocaust in order to justify Israel being held to a different
(1:03:26) standard than everyone else's being held - I see a lot of manipulation here about the victimhood of Israeli Jews the sense of victimhood and I'm a child of survivors Holocaust survivors so I'll be the last one to underestimate the importance of history and a history of persecution of Jews in the Israeli Palestinian context but does it mean that Jews now in Israel go everyday and think about Auschwitz I doubt it anyone who is critical of the special relationship criticizes the activities of the lobby or disagrees with the
(1:04:04) policies that they recommend or is critical of Israel's conduct is virtually certain to be attacked usually in very harsh ways by Israel's defenders there are watchdog groups that keep track of what different media organizations publish or broadcast and if they're not happy about it they either publish their own attacks they organize consumer boycotts Israelis and the lobby do not think there's ever any problem with policy the problem is only the way it's covered which is why they have organizations like camera
(1:04:36) which is no committee on Middle East accuracy accuracy means that you present this side that makes Israel look good the lobby and the Israelis believe that the mainstream media in America is pro-palestinian I mean it's laughable consistently The Times has suppressed any story that would portray Israel sympathetically and on the other hand has written dozens of stories portraying the Palestinians to sympathetically Israel is now portrayed and much of the major media especially CNN the BBC as the aggressor as the predator nation and
(1:05:12) the poor Palestinians and Arabs as the victims it's one of the most profoundly successful tactics of right-wing media pressure and media criticism groups and they were going to argue that it's true in violation of all the facts you're saying that because CNN has interviewed Palestinian families and shown Palestinian children who have been wounded or killed if somehow CNN is saying that Hamas is okay I don't think that those two are equivalent we're not allowed to show the civilians taught on the cross fire of
(1:05:43) course you're allowed to show civilians caught in the crossfire you should also mention all the restrictions that FAMAS puts on your reporting inside the Gaza Strip you should also mention all the context with regard to come us putting children in harm's way you should also routinely mention the fact that Hamas this charter calls for the destruction not only the State of Israel but for the murder of Jews across the world which of course here none does not that's silly Ben we talk about that all the time we
(1:06:03) talk about the Charter the Hamas charter that says that they want to obliterate Israel and wipe Israel off the face of the map that's you're just not being fair that's not true in the you mention it occasionally in the midst of the vast swathes of imagery about Israel using what you would term excessive force the media outlets don't see the pushback from the other side they don't see the upside to standing up for for their own reporting so I think in most cases they cave look at the pressure that came down
(1:06:33) on veteran NBC reporter I'm in my Elden when he was covering the 2014 Gaza invasion for NBC my Elden was playing soccer on a beach with four Palestinian kids just moments before they were killed by an Israeli rocket and he talked about this on social media and shared video of the heartbroken reactions of the kids parents   and what did NBC do it responded by pulling my old in from Gaza and of course there's no greater weapon in the attack arsenal than equating critical coverage of Israel's policies with
(1:07:23) anti-semitism any fair-minded person follows aljazeera knows it's anti-american and anti-semitic correct yes I am it doesn't it doesn't come more anti-semitic now they would they would they would do violence to you who are new journalists at Al Jazeera Network they would hardly think so Abba Eban wrote an article in which he explained to American Jews what their task was their task is to show that anyone who's a critic of Zionism by which he means a critic of the policies of the State of Israel must be either an
(1:07:56) anti-semite or a neurotic self-hating Jew that covers 100% of possible criticism we'll start tonight in the in the Middle East where Israel what Israel is this supposed to defend oh yeah Mexico bomb Texas will be the same self-hating Jew so used to be that was always called the self-hating Jew and and everybody like me was called a self-hating Jew I am now not only a self-hating Jew but they also call me that to Semite how I was by four Jewish grandparents I'm still an anti-semite my wife was born in a
(1:08:41) displaced persons camp in Germany and I'm an anti-semite they have for a very long time been able to effectively defend the indefensible to the American public through mis-education and misinformation campaigns through effective talking points through smearing individuals on the opposite side of things labeling them all kinds of things sympathizers with terrorism I've done dozens of interviews which begin from the terrorism departure but when given an opportunity to actually speak and present a different
(1:09:17) perspective that can dissolve rather quickly is Hamas a terrorist organization do I get to actually speak now you get to answer the question it's a simple yes-or-no question you invited me on here is a mosque whose charter calls for the destruction of Israel is that a terrorist organization that's a yes or no question thank you for your question I'm very telling to me that and it should be telling to your viewers as well by the way that the moment you have a Palestinian voice on your program who begins to explain the legitimate
(1:09:51) grievances of what part of this can you get through your thick head I think yes or no the only thing that you're gonna say is what we want you to say and if you don't say it we're not gonna let you speak so you end up with reporting but gives way more priority and weight to the official Israeli perspective than to the Palestinian one look at how American media covered Israel's 2014 attack on Gaza a keyword search of all the major networks showed that over the course of the 51 day assault Israel's ongoing
(1:10:27) military siege and blockade of Gaza were barely mentioned compared to the thousands of times a massed rocket attacks on Israel were mentioned why is Hamas launching missiles into population centers of Israel the basic propaganda frame is built into the very assumptions journalists bring to the table since Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005 8,000 Rockets have been fired from Gaza into Israel this is how propaganda works it works by getting your words in the mouths of other people especially the mouths of supposedly objective media
(1:11:02) commentators I'm wondering though whether you're outraged by the conduct of Hamas starting the conflict by firing rockets building tunnels to kill and kidnap Israelis being more than willing to sacrifice Palestinian lives by embedding them into into their own kind of Arsenal and using them as Israel contends as human shields do you have a level of outrage at Hamas itself it doesn't seem like propaganda at all it just seems like news and this goes across all the major media including the supposedly most liberal local Rachel
(1:11:35) Maddow on MSNBC who's known as the leading progressive voice on mainstream television she did only four segments on the war and during these few segments she never once mentioned Israel's ongoing occupation of the West Bank or its siege on blockade of Gaza and never once mentioned the fact that the US has armed Israel with the very weapons that were being used against the defenseless civilian population instead choosing to frame the invasion as part of a senseless cycle of violence perpetrated by both sides it's been a constant cycle
(1:12:08) of fighting between Israel and Hamas for the past several years in Gaza and the fighting and the cause of the fighting feel terribly familiar because this is basically a recurring war and if it feels like deja vu feels like I've heard all of this before you are right because this really does keep happening over and over and over again Rachel Maddow the most important woman on MSNBC the leader when it comes to politics in six weeks or four never mentioned the word blockade occupation illegal settlements never mentioned the support that
(1:12:43) Congress have for Israel and conditional amount of money billions of dollars what is that disappointment our media operations national media is a scandal when it comes to Israel I look at the UK with all its deficit and there's a real debate for example there's this anchor called Jon Snow channel 4 in the UK and he interviewed Mark Regev and he grilled him with questions grilled him Mark Regev how does killing children on a beach contribute to that purpose what was the point of bombing the L waffle Hospital for goodness sake there are
(1:13:18) grave uncertainties about whether you're acting within the law oh yes you are deliberately neighbourhoods in which you know there are women and children you've tried everything with Gaza you've besieged it for seven years the people live an intolerable and ghastly life and you know that better than anybody why don't you try one other thing talking why not talk why not be brave and talk directly with them why not I can never see this in America I never seen anything like this in the United States there are being occasional
(1:13:50) examples of American journalists who've had the courage to challenge the official Israeli life back in the 50s CBS's Mike Wallace didn't back down from grilling Israeli ambassador Abba Eban but Israel's illegal takeover of Arab land the fact remains that Israel benefited territorially from a war from armed violence as a member of the Judaic faith which cherishes social justice and morality do you believe that any country should profit territorially from violence and years later Wallace didn't
(1:14:23) shy away from comparing the terrorist tactics of Palestinian militants with the terrorist tactics of Jewish militants in the 1940s the fact is that innocent people died from terror whoever the terrorist the Jewish independence fighters trying to hasten the exit of the British from Palestine and to intimidate the Arab population they're bombed bus stops and office buildings railroad trains and shopping crowds the fighters of stearin and ilgwon took a toll of innocent victims that ran into the hundreds more recently in 2012 during a 60
(1:14:59) minutes piece the late Bob Simon dared to report on what day to day life is like for Palestinian Christians who live under Israeli occupation Israel has occupied the West Bank for 45 years turning the little town where Christ was born into what its residents call an open-air prison Christian Astor's lives with her mother Claire her father brother and sister in this house which is surrounded on three sides by the wall how do you live with this Asami's report was seen as so unusual and so in century that Israeli ambassador Michael Oren
(1:15:33) actually tried to spike it censor it leading Simon to directly confront him on camera when I heard that you were going to do a story about Christians in the Holy Land and myosin and had I believe information about the nature of it and it's been confirmed by this interview today the thing has been confirmed by the interview mr.
(1:15:58) ambassador because you don't know what's going to be put on air okay I don't true mr. ambassador I've been doing this a long time and I've received lots of reactions from just about everyone I've done stories about but I've never gotten the reaction before from a story that hasn't been broadcast yet well the first time for everything Bob these are examples of exceptional reporting but they are the exception and there's a reason for that in each of these cases these journalists were mercilessly
(1:16:30) attacked and labeled anti-semitic it didn't matter that they were both Jewish that's how the climate of intimidation works it's almost impossible to get any view that isn't one way or another shaped by an Israeli perspective almost impossible it cannot get in without facing a firestorm of pit bull attacks to make sure that the line is followed everyone who's trying to tell the American public a different side of the story I'm an alternative view of the conflict that's a reality-based has
(1:17:00) already crossed a barrier of fear and I think they've already told themselves well I'm gonna pay for this but I'm ready to pay the price over just the past few years the proliferation of social media and Internet news sources has made it increasingly difficult for the Israeli government and pro-israel groups in the u.s.
(1:17:27) to manage American perceptions of the conflict video footage and reporting from the ground bearing witness to the reality of the occupation are now more accessible than ever on the Internet in addition over the past few years a number of high-profile documentaries made by Israeli and Palestinian filmmakers alike have trained the harsh light on current Israeli policy in the repression of Palestinian rights I think shelah note at the same time a powerful new boycott divestment and sanctions movement has been gaining momentum and raising awareness of the
(1:18:15) occupation while activists from the black lives matter movement have been making explicit connections between police violence against African Americans in the Israeli military's repression of Palestinians we stand next to people who continue to courageously struggle and resist the occupation people continue to dream and fight for freedom from Ferguson and Palestine the struggle for freedom continues and all of these developments seem to be having an effect polls now show that while sympathy for Israel remains at all-time
(1:18:47) highs among older Americans it has been hemorrhaging among young people despite the efforts of the lobby something really striking is taking place lots of young people are abandoning the mainstream media and turning instead other independent sources so they have a totally different way of making sense of what's happening an unfiltered view of Israel's repression and pro-israel operatives like Frank Luntz are in a panic in his latest report he calls what's happening with young people a disaster and demands that Israel supporters
(1:19:19) respond and people have answered the call you have powerful right-wing billionaires like Sheldon Adelson a major donor to Republican candidates bankrolling a campaign to silence and intimidate student activists on college campuses but it's not working groups like students for justice in Palestine we see what's happening to Palestinians as a civil rights issue have refused to be intimidated they're refusing to back down even though they're being labeled as anti-semitic and terrorist sympathizers and their numbers are
(1:19:50) growing as the discourse begins to open more people are starting to understand this as a rights-based issue not an issue of radicalism this is a movement for the rights of people whose rights are being denied who are living under occupation who want to live in their country freely just like anybody else you can see just so many video clips of kids having their hands smashed by soldiers with batons you can see just so many pictures of thousands of people being killed as happened in Gaza and at a certain point
(1:20:30) you there's a cognitive dissonance you realize that what you're being told is a pack of lies let's just get away from the mythology's and talk about the realities and then maybe be able to persuade people that they should not any longer give their unwavering support to a nation engaged in a policy that's not just inhumane and and brutal but ultimately suicidal given the central role that the United States plays in backing Israel seems to me Americans all Americans have a right to question
(1:21:03) particular Israeli policies and in particular the prolonged occupation the fact that the Palestinian people have been kept without a state and without any political rights for decades now for us in the United States I think the issue has to be what is our government doing how is our government allowing enabling supporting arming defending Israeli violations in the end this comes down to a battle for the minds of the American people a battle of the stories they're told to make sense of this conflict a battle over perception the
(1:21:38) more Americans are able to see the reality of occupation with their own eyes to see images of routine daily violence of the repression and humiliation that never make their way into mainstream news the more they'll question the image of Israel as this tiny little David up against the bullying air of Goliath and start to wonder this actually the outgunned Palestinians who might be the real David here when that's thoughts becoming the dominant perception here in the US all bets are off it all comes down to
(1:22:07) American public perception that's the one way to change anything changing perception and understanding here leading to a change of policy here as long as the United States supports Israel nothing's going to happen the US government will support it as long as the u.s. population tolerates   surely what a hard time tells from the launch site evidences of the settlement so my hard drive diminish with my heart dad at the end there that car ride when I thought it checkpoint you go into apartheid soldiers red military green at
