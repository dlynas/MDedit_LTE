Transcript:
(00:15) today we are faced i think with the approach of  what may be called the ultimate revolution the   final revolution where a man can act directly on  the mind body of his fellows well needless to say   some kind of direct action on human mind bodies  has been going on since the beginning of time   but this has generally been of a violent nature  the techniques of terrorism have been known from   time immemorial and people have employed them  with more or less ingenuity sometimes with the   utmost crudity sometimes with a good deal of skill  inquire acquired by a process of trial and error  
(01:03) finding out what the best ways of using torch  imprisonment constraints of various kinds but as   i think it was a metanic said many years ago you  can do everything with bayonets except sit on them   that if you are going to control any population  for any length of time you must have some measure   of consent it's exceedingly difficult to see  how pure terrorism can function indefinitely   it can function for a fairly long time but  i think sooner or later you have to bring in   an element of persuasion an element of getting  people to consent to what is happening to them  
(01:46) well it seems to me that the the nature of the  ultimate revolution with which we are now faced   is precisely this that we are in process of  developing a whole series of techniques which   will enable the controlling oligarchy who have  always existed and presumably always will exist   uh to get people actually to love their servitude  this is the seems to me the the ultimate   in malevolent revolution should we say and  that there seems to be a general movement   in the direction of this kind of ultimate  revolution this this method of control  
(02:31) by which people can be made to enjoy  a state of affairs which by any   decent standard they ought not to enjoy  this i mean the enjoyment of of servitude   and first let me talk about a little bit about the  improvement even in the techniques of terrorism   uh i think that there have been improvements  pavlov after all made some extremely profound   observations both on animals and on human beings  and he found among other things that conditioning   techniques applied to animals or humans in a  state either psychological or physical stress  
(03:18) senkins how to say very deeply into the mind body  of the creature and where extremely difficult   to get rid of that they seem to be embedded  more deeply than other forms of conditioning   in this context i would like to mention the  extremely interesting chapters in dr william   sargent's battle for the mind where he points out  how intuitively some of the great uh religious   uh teachers leaders of the past a hit on the  pavlovian method he he speaks specifically   of wesley's method of producing conversions  which were essentially based upon a technique  
(04:02) of heightening psychological stress to the limit  by talking about hellfire and so making people   extremely vulnerable to suggestion and then  suddenly releasing this stress by offering the   hopes of heaven and this is a very interesting  chapter of showing how uh how completely on   purely intuitive and empirical grounds a a skilled  natural psychologist as wesley was could discover   these pavlovian methods well as i say we now  know the reason why these techniques worked and   there is no doubt at all that we can if we want  to uh carry them much further than was possible  
(04:51) in the past and of course in the history of  recent history of brainwashing both as applied to   prisoners of war and to the lower personnel within  the communist party in china we see that the   pavlovian methods have been applied systematically  and with with evidently with extraordinary   efficacy i mean i think there can be no doubt that  by the application of these methods a very large   army of totally devoted people has been created  the the conditioning has been driven in so to say by kind of psychological ionophoresis into the  very depths of the people's being and has got  
(05:41) so deep that it's very difficult for it ever to be  rooted out and these methods i i think are a real   refinement on the older methods of terror because  they combine methods of terror with methods   of acceptance method that the person who he  subjected to a form of terroristic stress   but for the purpose of inducing a kind of  involuntary quotes acceptance of the state and   the psychological state into which he  has been driven and the state of affairs   within which he finds himself so that as  i say there has been i think a definite  
(06:28) improvement shall we say uh in the even in the  techniques of of terrorism well then we come to um   consideration of other techniques  of non-terroristic techniques for   uh inducing consent and for inducing people to  love their servitude first of all there are the   methods connected with uh straight suggestion and  and hypnosis i think we know much more about this   subject and was was known in the past people of  course have always known about suggestion and   although they didn't know the word hypnosis  they certainly practiced it but we now i think  
(07:10) know pretty clearly the sort of statistical  structure of a population in regard to its uh   to its suggestibility uh it's very interesting  when you look at the the findings in different   fields i mean in the field of hypnosis in the  field of administering placebos for example   in the field of general suggestion in states of  drowsiness or of light sleep you will find the   same sorts of orders of magnitude continually  cropping up you will find for example that the   experienced hypnotists will tell  one that the number of people the  
(07:53) percentage of people who can be hypnotized  with the utmost facility just like that   is about 20 20 percent that about uh corresponding  number at the other end of the scale are very very   difficult or almost impossible to hypnotize and  that in between there lies a large mass of people   who can with more or less difficulty be hypnotized  that that they can gradually be if you work hard   enough at it be we got into the hypnotic state  and in the same way when the same sort of figures   crop up again for example in relation to the  administration of placebos a big experiment was  
(08:35) carried out three or four years ago in the general  hospital in boston on post-operative cases where   several hundred men and women suffering comparable  kinds of pain after serious operations were given   injections whenever they asked for them  whenever the pain got bad and the injections   fifty percent of the time were of morph and  fifty percent of the time were distilled water   and about twenty percent of those uh who went  through the experiment about twenty percent of   them got just as much relief from the distilled  waters from the morphia about 20 percent got no  
(09:13) relief from the distilled water and in between  were those who got some relief or got relief   occasionally so here again we see the same  sort of of distribution and i suspect also   that it would not be at all difficult to recognize  in very early childhood who were the those who   were extremely suggestible who were those who  extremely unsuggestible and who were those who   occupied the intermediate space quite clearly if  everybody were extremely unsuggestible organized   society would be quite impossible and if everybody  were extremely suggestible then dictatorship would  
(09:55) be absolutely inevitable i mean it's very  fortunate we have people who are moderately   suggestible in the majority and who therefore  preserve us from dictatorship but to permit to   organize society to to be formed but once given  the fact that there are these 20 of highly   suggestible people it becomes quite clear that  this is a matter of enormous political importance   uh for example any demagogue who is able  to get hold of a large number of these 20   of suggestible people and to organize them  is really in a position to overthrow any  
(10:34) government in any country and i mean i i think  this uh after all we've had the most incredible   example in recent years of what can  be done by efficient methods of of   suggestion and persuasion in the form of hitler  anybody who's read for example bullock's life of   hitler comes forth from this with a sort of  horrified admiration for this infernal genius   who who really understood human weaknesses i think  almost better than anybody and who exploited them   with all the resources then available i mean  he knew everything i mean for example he knew  
(11:19) intuitively this pavlovian truth that conditioning  installed in a state of stress or fatigue   goes much deeper than conditioning installed at  other times this was why all his big speeches   were organized at night he suspects because  of this quite frankly of course in my country   says this was done solely because people  are tired at night and therefore much less   capable of resisting persuasion than they would be  during the day and we see in all his techniques he   he was using he had discovered intuitively and  by trial and error a great many of the of the  
(12:03) weaknesses which we now know about on a sort of  scientific way i think much more clearly than   he does than he did but the fact remains  that this differential suggests ability uh   this susceptibility to hypnosis i do think has  is something which has to be considered very   uh carefully in relation to any kind of thought  about democratic government i mean if there are 20   of the people who can really be suggested into  believing almost anything as evidently they can be   then we have to take extremely careful steps  to prevent the rise of demagogues who will  
(12:53) drive them on into extreme positions and  then organize them into very very dangerous   armies private armies which may overthrow  the overthrow the government well   this as i say is in this field of pure persuasion  i think we uh we do know much more than we did in   the past and obviously we now have uh mechanisms  for multiplying the demagogue's voice and image in   a quite hallucinatory way i mean the television  and the radio hitler was making enormous use of   the radio he could speak to millions of people  simultaneously i mean this this alone of course is  
(13:41) creates an enormous gulf between the modern  and the ancient demagogue the ancient demagogue   could only uh appeal to as many people as  his voice could reach by the yelling at the   at his utmost but the modern demagogue  can touch literally millions at a time and   and of course with his the multiplication  of his image he can produce this kind of   hallucinatory effect which uh is of enormous hypnotic and suggest suggestive importance  in these techniques which where the object   of application is the human being you're  obviously up against the most dangerous situation  
(14:32) and what will be the temptation for those in  power i mean after all we pray regularly not   to be led into temptation and this is a very  profound and important prayer i mean experience   sadly shows that if we are tempted long enough  and strongly enough we almost invariably succumb   and that the the whole process of setting up  a decent society is essentially setting up   a society in which temptations to abuse  power and shall be reduced to a minimum   but these new techniques i i think do  constitute a series of very powerful temptations  
(15:18) which to those in authority maybe finally  turn out to be irresistible i hope not but   i think what you say is is something which we  have to think about i mean that this might be   applied with justification as you  say in the highest patriotic and   moral terms even in democratic societies  i trust not but but one never knows in our world there will be no emotions  except fear rage triumph and self-abasement   the sex instinct will be eradicated we shall  abolish the orgasm there will be no loyalty  
(16:07) except loyalty to the party but always there  will be the intoxication of power always at   every moment there will be the thrill of victory  the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is   helpless if you want a picture of the future  imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever   the moral to be drawn from this dangerous  nightmare situation is a simple one don't let it happen it depends on you
