Ashley Hodgson: "The New Enlightenment and Behavioral Economics” | The Great Simplification #109
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEUhSSl83-Y)

## Transcript:
Greetings. Today's episode is with my friend, 
Ashley Hodgson. Ashley is an associate professor  
of economics and runs the economics department at 
St. Olaf's University in Northfield, Minnesota,  
which is very close to where I live. She teaches 
behavioral economics. Ashley's YouTube channel  
is called The New Enlightenment where she 
explores topics on economics, governance,  
and the epistemic of a world of social 
media and increasing concentration of power.
In this episode, Ashley and I discuss our 
systemic predicament from a perspective  
rooted in behavioral economics. For those of you 
who watched last week's episode with Steve Keen  
you might understand that I don't have a lot 
of practicing economic professors in my circle  
of friends, but Ashley is one of them. I love 
her curiosity, her teaching ethic, and similar  
to me she has a compulsion to share these ideas 
with the public. Please welcome Ashley Hodgson.
Professor Hodgson, good to see you.
Good to see you.
I'm waving to you 25 miles across the river.
Do you ever do these in person?
I have never done one in person, though you and 
I could have because you are by far the closest  
guest that I've had. You teach in Northfield, 
Minnesota, which is a less than a half hour  
drive from me. I don't have the equipment 
to do it. This office that I'm sitting in  
is really like six foot by seven foot. It's really 
small. I don't think that you could fit in here,  
but over time, maybe. I think I don't ever expect 
this podcast to be super popular because it's  
speaking too much truth to power and it's not 
necessarily a feel good thing, but I do think  
there is an energy and a humanity of two people 
being in the same space that's different than  
doing it remotely like this. So who knows?
Yeah. No, I think of your podcast as being  
comforting, actually, because if people are 
aware of this kind of thing, I think you have  
an attitude and a perspective that actually 
makes it seem more hopeful and manageable.
Well, thank you for that. And the podcast theme 
and purpose is to send a bat signal to people like  
you that feel that way. I just meant it's never 
going to be uber popular because it's complex,  
it's threatening, there are no easy answers, 
and I'm not trying to gloss over and wave away  
the problems. I'm trying to look at them 
head on and integrate them. So welcome,  
finally, after three delays. Not only are you the 
closest person to me but you've also been the most  
delayed podcast because of my schedule and farm 
emergencies, et cetera. So finally we're here.
You are a professor of economics at St. 
Olaf's University. You have a YouTube channel,  
two YouTube channels. One where you 
do lectures on behavioral economics  
and the other is something called the New 
Enlightenment. I think, at the end of the day,  
there's energy, there's ecology, there's climate 
and environmental issues, but it's our behavior  
that is going to dictate what is possible and 
what pathways are open to us. So can you give  
us a broad overview of how you think behavioral 
economics can apply to our cultural transition,  
which I label the Great Simplification?
Behavioral economics is basically building  
the insights of psychology into economic models. 
And I think what needs to happen is there needs  
to be a rejiggering of the nervous system of 
the Superorganism. There's the three layers  
of economics, governance, and knowledge 
systems, and the incentive structures and  
the way resources flow, the way information 
flows across the body of the Superorganism,  
that's what needs to be rejiggered.
And in some ways it's built on top of  
human beings, like the human soul, human groups 
with all of their quirks and all of their biases  
and all of their ways of interacting with the 
world that are not necessarily... that are not  
always helpful or rational at an individual level 
and I think sometimes can get more unhelpful and  
more irrational as you move up the layers of 
the system. So behavioral economics is really,  
okay, if we're going to design a system for real 
human beings, how do we take that into account?
And does behavioral economics look at 
individual behavior or human aggregate  
behavior as a nation or as a global society?
I see it as both. I think many behavioral  
economists would say it looks at individual 
behavior because it's mapping individual quirks  
and individual irrationalities. I use that in air 
quotes. Because it's mapping that into models,  
I think models can map how humans work together 
in different roles and different systems,  
and this interaction between, I 
don't even want to say groups,  
I want to say systems and individuals. And so I 
think it's trying to be a bridge between those.
Is behavioral economics... I know when I was 
getting my PhD, started it almost 20 years ago,  
people were looking at David Laibson and 
Kahneman and others. Is it becoming more  
accepted within the field of economics or is it 
still out there as a crossover with psychology?
I think it's more accepted. Sometimes it's a 
little bit hard to tell, what is the ethos of the  
whole field of economics? Given that most people 
I interact with are into behavioral economics,  
or at least accept it and see its value. 
But I think it's a little more accepted.  
You'll see it in introductory textbooks.
And is game theory? Would that be under the  
umbrella of behavioral economics?
Game theory... is in some ways,  
if you think of game theory as having payoffs, how 
do you come up with what are those payoffs? And  
behavioral economics basically helps you build 
in these human biases into those payoffs. So  
in some ways I don't view game theory as being 
under behavioral economics, I view behavioral  
economics as feeding into game theory models.
I know, since we've talked several times,  
that you follow this podcast and that you actually 
have a video coming out, which I think will be out  
by the time this one airs, on the Superorganism, 
that you've shared a draft with me. So given the  
Superorganism framing and The Great Simplification 
framing, can you give us an example of how game  
theory could apply to the situation that I've 
described on this podcast? How could it be useful  
or a frame that might be informative?
Yeah. I think one of the dilemmas- 
Not to put you on the spot.
No, no, this is good. This is  
exactly the stuff I'm thinking about 
all the time. I love the Superorganism  
analogy. I think it's going to be central. 
And I think if we think about your podcast- 
Why is that? Why is that?
Because I think it's really  
hard to move into a new system, and you need 
analogies that build on peoples' brains what  
I call the mental infrastructure, like the common 
understanding of how things work. You need ideas  
and things people are familiar with. And the 
Superorganism is sort of this... it's like going  
from a single-cell to a multi-celled organism. 
We're going from individualistic society to a  
system that makes human beings work together.
And we certainly have a human Superorganism  
now that is not functioning well, and many 
people are experiencing the downside of this,  
but to move into something different, that's not 
going to happen naturally. It's going to require  
really good analogies and really good ways for 
people to understand what they're moving into. And  
I just think this one, it's sort of like, yeah, 
the body system, it has these incentive structures  
and these informational structures that make the 
body work and that heal it when it gets wounded,  
and that aggregate information across the body to 
prioritize pain and all of that. And I just think  
this analogy, I just think we're going to need it.
But you asked about, how does game theory relate  
to your podcast? And I do think a lot 
of people who listen to your podcast  
probably have this problem that they 
recognize what's wrong with the world,  
with the system. They recognize its complexity 
and yet they're also embedded in a system where  
their job and their material wellbeing and their 
relationships and everything that's of value to  
them is embedded in this system. And so at 
that point you have this dilemma, which is,  
on one hand I don't want to contribute to this 
problem that I see destroying everything. But  
if you try to be like, "Okay, what can I do 
that would make me not contribute to this?"
You've got the drop in the bucket problem, 
which is part of game theory where your  
individual efforts cannot change the system. 
And it's not even like you can say, "Well,  
if we could somehow force everybody to do this, 
that would fix it," because you actually need  
totally different incentive structures. And in 
the current set of structures, there's no way  
individual humans can make that left-hand turn.
So how do you deal with that problem as an  
individual? How do you not contribute but also 
not give up the things that make life meaningful  
and valuable to you? And the solution to that, I 
think, is going to have to be a collective action  
solution of some sort, which is the game 
theory solution. It's sort of like, "Okay,  
this is a multiplayer prisoner's dilemma."
Well, I agree. And if everyone cooperates by  
consuming less and respecting nature, the whole 
system would be better off. But if everyone's  
not going to cooperate, everyone defects 
and keeps consuming, and Netflix and chill,  
and ordering those brown boxes from Amazon, 
and still worried about the future but  
compelled to stay in the present sort of thing.
Yeah. Well, but the worry about the future,  
it sucks people's energy away. It's like you 
may need to contribute in a way that brings your  
human energy and your emotions and your spiritual 
wellbeing into the equation. And if that energy,  
that spiritual wellbeing is degraded 
through looking at the problem in the face,  
looking at reality and being worn down 
by your helplessness in the face of that,  
it's a hard problem to solve individually.
Here's a quote that I saw yesterday that I might  
have to do a Frankly about, and it speaks to what 
you just said. It's from Rilke: "The future enters  
into us in order to transform itself in us long 
before it happens." And I do think that is a risk  
for those of us who are working on these scary, 
complex futures that don't have a direct pathway.  
That we imagine all this stuff and it changes 
what we're doing and how we're thinking and how  
we're living today. I digress from your point.
No, I feel like that's exactly the point I was  
trying to make, is I think in some ways the right 
response to this dilemma is to look ahead and  
to think, what are the skills and what's the in 
infrastructure that I could be building now that  
could be part of that collective action mechanism 
that switches us from one system that's serving  
nobody well to a different system? And how do you 
do that when nobody can actually see what the new  
system would look like? It doesn't exist in its 
current form. It's probably fragmented ideas here  
and there that will need to be patchworked 
together to create something eventually.
But I kind of view the two parts of this 
collective action mechanism that could get us  
there. One of them I think will be digital, like 
algorithms of some sort. And the other part that  
has to be matched with that is going to be more 
creative, more relational and community-oriented  
and trust-oriented. And right now those two sides 
are not coming together yet. They're in separate  
spheres. And developing in yourself the skills in 
at least the sphere of trust and relationships and  
community. And then if you have the skills to 
develop the infrastructure that's digital that  
could compliment that, it's sort of like a lot of 
this infrastructure cannot happen automatically.  
It can't happen quickly. So when the right moment 
comes for that switch to happen, are there enough  
people? Which doesn't need to be everybody, 
but enough people who have those skills.
So is that what you broadly 
call the New Enlightenment?
Yeah, that's pretty much the New Enlightenment.
Okay, could you unpack that? Why did you call  
your YouTube channel that? And how does the New 
Enlightenment compared to the Old Enlightenment?  
Maybe you could briefly cover both of those. 
What was good about the Old Enlightenment?  
What were they thinking about at the time? And 
then how do you envision a New Enlightenment?
Yeah, the Old Enlightenment, I view it as this 
paradigm shift in all three of these realms,  
the economic, the governance, and the knowledge 
systems. And I think the purpose for those  
thinkers back then was, how do you get out 
from under the thumb of tyranny? And they  
were thinking really carefully about different 
types of tyranny, like tyranny of the majority,  
tyranny of the leader, tyranny of all these 
kinds of things. And they were developing  
ideas and concepts and processes that included 
things like the idea of human rights and due  
process and checks and balances on power. In the 
knowledge realm they had the scientific method,  
which helped them get out from under some of 
the knowledge-based forms of oppression that  
at that point came through the church.
And the problem is systems depreciate.  
And so even if you set up a system that's 
intentionally designed to get around some  
of these forces of tyranny, eventually there's 
going to be some form of power to the powerful  
that gets ahead of the system's ability to fix 
that. And I think that's where we are now.
From a biophysical standpoint I could 
understand why systems depreciate,  
but you're talking about it maybe from a 
different lens. Why do systems depreciate?
Yeah. Well, I think the biggest one here is going 
to be this power to the powerful notion where,  
if you have a system where, when you get a 
little more power, you can use that power to  
gain advantage and get more power, you 
get resources and other scarce things,  
attention is a scarce resource, sucked more and 
more toward a smaller and smaller few. Unless  
you have mechanisms to stop that, recognize 
when one group is getting too powerful and  
sucking up resources. And I think part of 
the problem here is it's not just resources,  
it's not just status that's getting sucked up 
through what Peter Turchin calls the money pump.  
But it's like the ability to write the rules of 
the game so that the economics and governance and  
knowledge system rules, those increasingly 
get handled by a smaller and smaller few,  
and then if you add on top of that, the digital 
age, it just speeds all of this process up.
Well, the parallel in my work is that in 
hunter-gatherer times, there was no way  
to accumulate advantage. You could have higher 
status than others, but then agriculture created  
hierarchy, then fossil fuels created energy 
surplus, which created an accordion effect  
of the power law distribution of wealth. Then 
fractional reserve banking and fiat currencies and  
digital claims on reality exponentially increased 
it, and now AI is going to exponentially increase  
it again. So can you talk more about... I know 
you did a YouTube video on Peter Turchin's work.  
How do you think that's relevant here on 
the concentration of wealth and advantage?
Yeah, well, Peter Turchin, he is a cyclical 
view of history person, and he's looking at  
data to figure out when will these moments of 
revolution or these moments of violence that  
sort of overturn the existing order, what predicts 
those historically? And he finds the top two are  
elite overproduction and mass immiseration. And of 
course he's looking historically so he's measuring  
people's height and looking at kingdoms.
Mass what?
Mass immiseration, I think is what he calls it.
Like misery for more and more people.
Yes, exactly. Exactly. Sort of increasing 
poverty, increasing... well, historically,  
it's the lower heights of people, which meant that 
they weren't getting as much nutrition and all of  
that. And when you have sort of frustration 
in the population that's growing because of  
their economic situation combined with a lot of 
people who are vying for those elite positions,  
where few of them will get them, it's kind of 
this recipe for the frustrated elites who want  
the elite positions but don't get them, can 
recognize the injustice and they can kind of  
use the frustration of the masses to marry the 
power that those aspiring elites may have. They  
have access to more avenues to change things. 
And when you combine that with the energy of  
a frustrated populace, that's a recipe for 
some sort of major change in the system.
And how do you see that... I mean, I think that 
describes what's happening right now. Yesterday,  
I did a roundtable, which will be out in a few 
weeks on poverty in the United States and 41% of  
American families are what's called ALICE, which 
is asset limited income constrained, but employed,  
41%. So poverty is much wider and deeper in 
this country than most people are aware. And  
yet if you look at the average wealth and 
income in this country, it's quite high,  
but the average, the mean is quite different 
than the median. So how do you see the  
digital age affecting kind of Turchin's thesis?
Yeah, I mean, I think what the digital age does is  
it speeds up the interconnections people have and 
it creates more interconnections such that people  
can connect meaningfully with people all over the 
world kind of like you do. But that means these  
networks also had this Matthew principle.
Matthew principle. What is that?
Yeah, so the way I explain this in class is if you 
do an experiment where you give everybody $100 and  
you start off with a luck-based experiment 
where everybody can bet half their money,  
and if it's heads you gain, if you bet 50, you 
get your 50 back plus another 50. If it's tails,  
you just lose your $50. If you do that experiment 
starting everybody from the same point,  
obviously that's going to create inequality over 
time because some people are lucky for all 10 of  
the first 10 rounds, some people are unlucky 
for all of those 10 rounds. But I think the  
thing that surprises people is after 10 rounds of 
that game, the person who's the average luckiness,  
which is like 50% lucky, 50% unlucky, 
they're not at $100 after 10 rounds,  
they're at like $23. And if you-
Why is that?
I mean, it's just a mathematical reality. It's 
sort of like people who have more when they bet  
their next round, well, they're at 150, so now 
they can bet 75. People who lost the first round,  
they're down to 50, so they can only bet 
25. So just the nature of the mathematics.
So who ends up having the most? 
The consistently lucky people?
Yep. Well, in this little experiment, it's 
consistently lucky. But of course the real world  
isn't just luck, it's also skill and hard work. 
But if you were to redo the experiment, except  
how you win the bets is where are you on that 
spectrum of how hard you work? If you just say,  
okay, people at the 50th percentile how hard they 
work. In a system like this, they would be sort of  
falling farther and farther behind as well.
And if you sort of add on top of that,  
the fact that when you get more resources, it's 
not just that you can bet more and lose more,  
it's also that you can influence the rules of the 
game. You can sort of control pathways of upward  
mobility. Those properties, when you add them 
together mean people who are even sort of in the  
middle are going to get farther and farther behind 
in many systems where gaining wealth and gaining  
power leads to the greater power. And that's the 
Matthew principle based on the Bible quote that  
says, "To him who has more will be given to him 
who is not even what he has will be taken away."
That was in the Bible?
Yeah.
That's kind of a nasty phrase. So the United 
States is often described as a plutocracy where  
the power lies with the wealthy who are some 
combination of lucky, hardworking, and skilled,  
and also probably recipients of the Cantillon 
effect, which is when new money gets created,  
they're closer to the source of the money 
in their investments, et cetera. So does  
this wealth inequality translate in our country 
and in the world to power inequality as well?
Yes. I think power is actually the more important 
aspect here. I've started not even thinking of it  
as power to the wealthy. I've started to think of 
it as power to the people who were placed around  
the important nodes of power. Because I'm sure if 
you rewind sometime in the system, it was okay,  
yes, the rich are getting richer, and that's the 
main force at play. But if you think about this  
sort of Matthew principle where, okay, first the 
bottom 10% gets sucked dry and then the next 10%,  
and it sort of moves its way up to where, 
okay, now if you want to suck people dry,  
it's going to be the 60th percentile or whatnot. 
Eventually that system sort of leads to the only  
people who are able to use resources to suck 
towards themselves are people who are really  
well positioned on other dimensions of power.
Where here we're talking about resources like oil,  
do you have control over one of those nodes or 
media power or military power or administrative  
power, institutional power? There's sort of 
these different nodes at the top of the system,  
and in a lot of ways there's negotiation between 
those nodes, but a lot of really rich people  
actually don't have any leverage at one of 
those nodes. And I think many of those people,  
even if they're super, super wealthy, may be 
looking at the system. They may even be like  
an aspiring elite who's like, "Wait a second, 
I see these problems that are serious. I would  
like to use my resources to do something about 
the problem," but they just don't have access to  
that power node that's a specific resource.
Well, since I'm talking to an economist,  
I just had a nerdy thought that I'll express 
while you were talking. There's resources which  
are very important to our economy. Then there's 
the control of the resources, which might be the  
first derivative of the resources. Then there's 
the control of the control of the resources,  
which is where the real decisions and 
the behavioral dynamics happen at very  
influential nodes at the system. And my fear 
is like you were saying before, you suck the  
bottom 10% dry and then the next, is that with AI 
and blockchain and the rapid fire technology that  
we're going to end up 10 years from now with 2000 
humans that own everything on the planet. I mean,  
not exactly that, but that's the direction that 
we're headed. What are your thoughts on that?
Yeah, I really like the way you just framed that. 
I completely agree. And I think when you said,  
okay, there's the resources, the control over 
the resources, and then the controller influence  
over that, I think a lot of the energy trying to 
solve the problems is that a layer that's lower  
down in the system where it's like, okay, 
how do we tweak around the edges of these  
people who control a node and they have some 
power, but actually there's multiple layers  
above them where the real power is happening. 
And so if the energy to fix the system is not  
pointed at a pretty high level, if not the very 
highest level, I don't think it'll get fixed.
So there needs to be a change of consciousness 
of the elites in the world for any real change  
in the Superorganism. Otherwise, it's just going 
to continue on that second derivative of control  
over control of resources and optionality 
for more monetary wealth, which is a claim  
on social power until it consumes the earth and 
sucks the bottom quintiles dry to summarize it.
Yeah. Well, and I think the question is does it 
need to be all of the elites? I don't think the  
whole populace can go against all of the elites to 
accomplish this, but how many people need to be on  
board with a system change to make it happen?
Yeah. This is a deep conversation and also a  
threatening and uncomfortable one, especially to 
a tenured professor. I don't think it's the fault  
of the elites that have gotten us here, but it 
now is the responsibility of many of the elites  
to help steer and change the way out of this. And 
then we run into game theory for them, which will  
be a barrier like you were saying before right?
Yeah, exactly. So the collective action mechanism,  
I think it's going to have to operate on different 
levels. It's going to have to operate on the  
population level and on the level of the elites 
who are willing to change this system, which is  
almost certainly not going to be all of them.
It's been a while since I took an economics class.  
This is not the stuff that they talked about 
in economics classes when I was in grad school  
or undergrad. How do you do all this? How do you 
manage thinking along these lines and doing your  
online lectures and your New Enlightenment videos, 
plus you run an economics department at a pretty  
prestigious school. How do you manage all that?
I mean, I don't know how I manage it sort of  
sometimes barely above water. But I mean, once 
you start to realize these problems, I went into  
this field because I cared about the problems, 
and then you start realizing, wait a second,  
when I'm trying to solve this problem, I can't 
and I have to zoom back and I'll try to solve it  
from a different level, and then I'll zoom back. 
And I feel like my whole career has been doing  
that. It's been zooming back another layer and 
another layer. And once you sort of realize, wait  
a second, we're in a place as a system that... I 
mean, it's scary in terms of what could happen,  
but it's also exciting because it means there 
could be a moment for real change. I can't not  
think about this stuff. So it's like my YouTube 
channel is just this outlet where I can be like,  
I need to get this out, and I'm hoping to 
talk about it with other people, and that's  
just a good way of organizing my ideas. Yeah.
Well, I'm glad I found your YouTube channel,  
and I imagine if you zoomed out nine times you 
found my YouTube channel, but I feel the same  
way. I can't stop thinking about this and my 
Franklys and this channel are... the Franklys  
are my personal expression on ideas that I come 
across. And then the Great Simplification Podcast,  
you and I right now is highlighting other people 
that have found this and are thinking about it  
and trying to change the software of the operating 
system of the Superorganism. And we have to change  
the software in order to change the hardware. 
I don't know how good a metaphor that is. 
I like it.
Okay, first time I've used it. And it  
doesn't look great, but it's also not impossible. 
And we are functioning akin, as you said in your  
Superorganism video. We're functioning akin to a 
cancer, which is unbridled growth that is slowly  
but inexorably impacting the life support systems 
of the only planet known in the universe to  
harbor complex life. But that doesn't mean that 
that is our epitaph or a foregone conclusion,  
and that's my hope. So what sort of hopeful or 
possible trajectories under the New Enlightenment  
are you advocating for or steering towards?
So I think the knowledge systems are going to  
be the foundation because yeah, the economic 
systems are built on top of knowledge that  
moves incentives. And so rethinking how 
knowledge networks work, I think is going  
to be the most important. And that's going to 
be considering group think sorts of biases,  
just because communities of thinkers like academic 
communities, they can develop sort of a social  
dynamic and a power dynamic within that community, 
which can be bent toward power. And that's one  
thing we'll have to get out from under. I think 
it'll have to involve salience. A lot of the facts  
that we disagree with strongly online when there's 
communities at each other's throats. I think they  
sometimes think they're disagreeing about the 
facts, but they're not really, they're disagreeing  
about the salience of particular facts. And it's 
like, how do you place this particular fact in a  
worldview? And if your perception is, okay, this 
fact is representative of something bigger that's  
harder to see and it's growing, you're going to 
have a very different relationship with that fact  
than if it's just like an isolated fact.
So facts are secondary to ideology,  
is that what you're saying?
No, that's not what I'm saying.  
What I'm saying is how a person takes a series 
of facts that may be scientifically validated or  
indicative or whatnot, and constructs those facts, 
pulls those facts together into a worldview that  
places them properly so that you can use them 
and you have an accurate perception of reality,  
the mechanism that helps you place facts into a 
salience frame. That's really important because  
like salience, it's like most facts out there 
are invisible to you, and most facts probably  
should be invisible to you. But yeah, it's 
a behavioral economics concept that I always  
use the example of when my friends have children, 
suddenly they see daycares that they could never  
see before. Those daycares were invisible to 
them, but there salience frame changed when  
they had children because it's relevant. So how 
do you take information about reality that's been  
perhaps validated using the scientific method and 
figure out what parts of this should be invisible,  
perhaps what parts of this should be really 
salient, but right now they're not reaching  
the brain of the Superorganism? I think 
sort of rejiggering that is going to be key. 
I assume when you've read Turchin and others 
that you've looked at historical cultures,  
are there notable past societal responses 
to turmoil that are suggestive of  
possible pathways for our current situation?
So I don't know if I'm the best person to answer  
that because Turchin looked at the New Deal in the 
1930s as a positive example. And I think I could  
be convinced that that's a positive example, but 
I'm not yet. If the New Deal had happened without  
World War Two, would there have been more of a 
leveling like there was an inequality and did the  
New Deal even solve things the way they need to? 
I mean, I don't think that's even remotely close  
to what needs to happen. I think it's going to 
need to be a much bigger system change. And then,  
yeah, I think what's going to need to happen in 
the digital age is just so different from past  
societies that the closest thing I can think 
of is going from apes to humans where humans  
have this moral mechanism in our brains and our 
hearts and our human nature that sort of helps  
us enforce a collective action mechanism such 
that you don't get a bully like a single alpha  
male in the chimp groups that rules everything. 
Like humans can act against that using moral  
communities. And in some ways, I think that 
is the closest parallel, even though human  
communities vary widely in terms of some of them 
are super egalitarian, but that's enforced using  
moral communities and concepts and some of 
them are more hierarchical. So yeah, I don't  
necessarily have a good answer to that question.
Yeah, it's an interesting one. So I assume that  
you standardly teach your students micro and 
macroeconomics and the things we're talking  
about on this podcast are not your bread and 
butter of your teaching, but you spend a lot of  
time with young people. What is your sense being a 
college teacher, I haven't taught in a few years,  
what is your sense of young people and are there 
intergenerational dynamics that are going to be  
relevant to potential systems change?
I definitely think we're going to need a  
collaboration across generations because my 
students, they're very aware of how social  
dynamics work both in the digital space, but 
also the way the digital space spills over  
into real world space. And I could never 
be at their level in terms of that kind  
of social understanding. It's like the part of 
our brains that is socially attuned. For them  
that part developed in the digital world. I'm 
almost certain whatever change we are going to  
have is going to have to use digital tools.
So you need people who understand how that  
works on a level that no model could capture. 
I think the young people are going to do that.  
I also sense that there's more awareness among 
that generation of the frailties in the system  
than say in my generation because in some ways 
they're trying to envision their own careers,  
their own pathways, and I think they recognize, 
"Wait a second, when I try to envision forward,  
what is my role in the system?" It 
doesn't always work. So they do,  
I think many of them have an intuition about this 
kind of stuff, even if they're not explicitly  
watching your podcast or keeping up with some 
of the other people talking about this stuff. 
So in a way, they've grown up with social media 
and digital world. They've kind of outsourced  
a little bit of their system to the cloud in a 
way, their social physiological system resides  
in these devices in a way that you and I 
grew up in a little bit different world. 
Yeah, exactly. And that could be an advantage 
or it could be a disadvantage if there's sort  
of a lot of mechanisms inside the phone that 
point understanding toward power. And so it's  
like how can we switch the phone and the 
way people outsource their knowledge and  
their trust in a lot of ways from the phone 
to a version of the phone that's healthier,  
which might still mean that many people have 
different pathways that they're going to in  
the phone. I don't think we need everybody to 
think the same way or use the same trust pathways  
to reach information. But almost certainly 
the pathways right now bend toward power. 
So when you walk into your classroom, are the 
kids talking to each other or are they kind of on  
their phones and then you get their attention?
So I've been intentional about... I have had  
semesters, especially since COVID, where 
people were not talking to each other,  
which was different. I've been intentional 
about getting them to do icebreaker questions  
or sometimes they just kind of know each other 
and are talking. So right now, this semester,  
there is conversation between them before class, 
but I do think it's a real thing where there's a  
little bit less comfort with that. The skills 
for in-person communication are lower among  
that generation, which I think most of them 
acknowledge. Yeah, our generation does have  
a lot of our social building online where you can 
kind of smooth out the hard edges that like most  
social skills is figuring out how do you smooth 
over awkward moments and hard edges and those  
little uncomfortable parts of interaction.
Yeah. Jonathan Haidt, social psychologist,  
was on my show earlier and recently. He's 
been researching and tweeting out a lot on  
how bad social media is for young people's mental 
health, depression, self-perception, self-image,  
all that. So it's both a vector for positive 
change because it connects the global brain  
of humans in the Superorganism, but it's also got 
this sucking your mental energy constantly out of  
it. So I don't know what the ultimate answer is.
Yeah, it's definitely going to have to involve  
something where incentives are pointed more toward 
real world communities and maybe that pointing  
toward is mediated through the digital world, but 
there needs to be incentives to just show up and  
be with people and persist through the inevitable 
conflict that happens with human communities. 
You mentioned briefly earlier blockchain. 
What are your thoughts on blockchain,  
Bitcoin, et cetera, as one possible 
avenue towards the new enlightenment? 
Yeah, so I don't know the answer to that other 
than, I mean, I think the kind of switch we need  
to a new system, it's going to require tools. And 
I think the hope of blockchain is that it does  
offer some really helpful avenues like having 
a universal computer that anything written on  
that computer, whether it's rules about how the 
game works or rules about governance or whatnot,  
having a place where people can trust those 
rules are not being manipulated by someone  
behind the scenes in favor of power. 
I think that's going to be essential. 
Now, I think the question is, are the current 
iterations of blockchain, could those withstand  
a shift to a new system? And I don't know the 
answer to that, but I do think the people who  
are investing in those tools and building that 
out, I think they're doing essential work that  
is likely to move us to something better. And so 
even if perhaps some of the incentive structures  
or mechanism designed behind some of these may 
or may not work out, it could work out absolutely  
with the current set of tools or it could not. 
I think the endeavors are really important. 
I agree with that. So let's circle back to 
this shifting the Superorganism idea through  
the new enlightenment. So at the beginning 
of this conversation, you said there were  
three major areas to guide the building of new 
institutions, economics, governance, and knowledge  
or epistemics. So how do we begin to shape these 
three elements to address some of the issues that  
I cover on this podcast that we just talked about?
Yeah. Well, so I mentioned the changes in the  
knowledge systems. I think that's sort of 
the biggest part, but they're intertwined.  
The economic systems, I think we need to get out 
of the ruts we have of the current debates, the  
debate over socialism versus capitalism. I think 
if you start talking about different systems,  
it's really easy for the conversation to sort 
of veer off toward the same debate people have  
had for years and years and years. And I think if 
you spend too much time in that particular rut,  
you can't think your way out of it. It's 
sort of like there's this impetus that's  
either you're super afraid of capitalism or 
you're super afraid of socialism. And both  
of those fears are totally valid. And if we need 
something that's different, I think we're going  
to have to focus more on the feedback loops 
that capture is this system depreciating?
Is there a power to the powerful thing, 
a rewriting of the rules of the game by  
people with power? Is that happening in this 
particular institution, which could be a firm,  
it could be a government institution, but it could 
also be the institutions that are written on our  
hearts like our moral code or what we view as 
legitimate or illegitimate uses of power, what  
we view as the obligations behind money and debt 
and things like that. So I think we're going to  
need to recognize that almost any institution will 
depreciate and recognizing when one has started to  
depreciate and having ways of channeling resources 
away from those that are becoming cancerous. And  
in some ways, I think this will need to involve 
some kind of creative destruction of institutions  
where creative destruction, basically, it's where 
we don't want to point adversarial resources  
toward things that aren't working because then 
you get this big fight and they fight back. But  
when the resources just sort of get rechanneled 
toward a healthier institution, reinvested there,  
I think something like that is going to be key 
to the changing of the economic structure.
Could you give an example of redirecting 
resources towards a positive institution?
Okay. I need to think more carefully about... 
I feel like any example I give is going to be  
embedded in something that's really not working 
right now. So I mean, capitalism has one source of  
creative destruction and it's an imperfect source, 
and it's subservient to institutions that aren't  
subject to this kind of creative destruction. But 
the source in capitalism is if you have a company  
that is not doing well, the idea is that it would 
financially not work out. It's going to go out  
of business and people instead would start buying 
from some other place. Now that particular version  
of this mechanism is no longer working in the way 
it should be. So there's sort of institutions at  
a higher level that are actually influencing 
that whole game in ways that are not healthy.
So that's a theoretical one version of this. I 
think you could have similar versions with social  
media or say influencers or podcasts where if you 
have a thinker who starts to, I don't know, just  
talk about ideas that are bad or be disrespectful 
or something goes wrong with that thinker,  
people may just stop listening to them. So people 
are choosing, I'm not going to put my eyeballs on  
them. They've started to go crazy, I'm going 
to go elsewhere. But that's another one that's  
totally out of whack, given a couple of layers up 
inside the system right now. So I don't think it's  
going to be easy to get this right, but I think 
the focus, if we're going to try to rejigger the  
system, does need to be on those feedback loops 
that hold parts of the system accountable to their  
social value and that instead of inciting a lt 
of battles, there will need to be battles, like  
adversarial energy and lawsuits and stuff like 
that, I think something like that will still exist  
and be important, but there's not infinite energy 
for that, so just having ways of rechanneling,  
I think, is how I'm starting to think about this. 
And I haven't fully fleshed out this vision,  
that's the task of the channel is to, bit by bit, 
try to figure out what could be an element here. 
Your channel and your concept of The New 
Enlightenment, you are figuring it out over time,  
because you're curious, and then you explore 
some concept, and then you do a video on it,  
and you're learning and figuring out 
what paths are false and what paths  
are dead ends and what paths are possible?
Yes. The false and dead ends, that's actually  
a really important point here. I actually think 
we need a lot of ideas that are not viable,  
because a lot of times, people will put out an 
idea for a new system, and people will look at  
that with a critical thinking brain that's been 
developed inside the current system, and they'll  
say, "Actually, that doesn't work." And it's not 
that the criticisms are wrong, it's that, okay,  
if we're going to have a new system, it's not 
going to arrive in anybody's brain fully formed,  
it's more like we're going to have a bunch of 
different ideas from different people, they're  
all out on the table, and there's going to be a 
mixing and a matching, and by the time the mixing  
and the matching leads to an actual new system, 
it will be different enough that we're going to  
need different ways of thinking about critical 
thinking. So I think people need to be not afraid  
to put out specific ideas that won't work.
Why? Because the more unviable ideas that  
we see and recognize as unviable, the more we 
get steered into the direction of things that  
actually might work, is that what you mean?
No, I mean if we recognize that something's  
unviable, it could be that that thing that is 
completely unviable in the current system with  
people's current set of expectations and mental 
infrastructure and social infrastructure and  
all of these institutions, it's like, okay, in 
this environment, that's not viable. It could  
be that if you take 50 of these unviable 
ideas, and mix and match them together,  
and duct tape them together, to move toward a 
new system, each of them is actually going to  
function really differently in a new system. 
So something that's not viable in this system  
could actually be a very viable part of a 
different system that we can't yet envision. 
Got it. Yeah, I agree with that. So do you 
advise graduate students, or do you just  
teach undergraduates there?
I just teach undergraduates. 
So how might graduates of your school and 
graduates of schools around the world and  
other academics begin to work in these areas 
towards a new enlightenment, do you have any  
thoughts there? Because the academy, which you're 
a part of and I used to be a part of, is kind of  
a miniature Superorganism, in many ways.
Yeah. Well, I think the first thing is,  
if you're interested in solving this problem, 
you have to somewhat let go of the incentive  
structures inside of academia, because if you're 
on the path of, oh, I'm going to publish a lot  
and get my accolades through the system, it 
will steer you away from this kind of thing.  
So that's number one is let that go, even 
if it means letting go career opportunities. 
But then, after that, I think there's not going 
to be just one type of thinker, we actually  
need people who develop out expertise in really 
different fields who can talk to each other. So  
it's not about getting rid of biases, you can't 
get rid of biases, and in some ways, following  
a particular intellectual pathway is going to 
lead you down a journey that will create its own  
biases, and that could be good, especially if the 
biases you're developing are different enough from  
current systems. So in some ways, I think it's 
about figuring out, where does your brain fit  
in this system? What are your passions? It's like 
understanding enough of the whole Superorganism to  
find a place in that, that is meaningful to you, 
that you feel like could be one little piece of  
the puzzle in rejiggering the system.
I am going to ask you some personal  
questions, Ashley-
Okay. 
... that I ask all my guests. I'm sure you know 
what they are. What sort of advice do you have  
for people aware of these issues choosing to take 
in the full enchilada of the metacrisis and think  
about the future? Do you have any personal advice?
I think for this collective action mechanism to  
happen, I think we're going to need people 
in different idea bubbles who are capable of  
developing trust with people in other bubbles. And 
I think this is the biggest thing that anyone can  
develop, but especially people who are into this 
kind of thing, is that recognizing, okay, in every  
little idea bubble, people in that bubble are 
aware of some problem, and they're deeply aware of  
it, and they have this language for describing the 
problem that is a little bit inside the bubble.
But the problem is, a lot of slogans and buzzwords 
and people come to represent the bigger idea set,  
and people inside that bubble know, oh, yeah, 
that little slogan, I understand the depth of  
that. But people outside the bubble, what they 
experience oftentimes is just people in that  
bubble dismissing their ideas. So if each bubble 
has something they're in touch with that's a real  
problem, they're really frustrated when people 
outside the bubble dismiss them, and so they  
start to dismiss those ideas, like, you're trying 
to fight for your problem and you're putting your  
problem above mine. So it's like social media 
gives us this intellectual armor for dismissing  
people who say things that are threatening to us.
This is why this podcast is increasingly  
difficult, because there are so many 
bubbles that are covered in the content. 
Yes.
And I think what you're describing,  
in the past, I've referred to as mimetic tribe 
diplomats, that we need translators that can  
walk between the bubbles and suppress their own 
identity in order to broaden the conversation. 
Yes, that's it. That's so essential.
Right, I agree with that advice, and that may be,  
in our society, one of the key things that 
we need. I'm really nervous about, no matter  
who wins the next election, there are going to be 
these ideological bubbles in this country that are  
going to be potentially violent, and we're going 
to need translators, no matter who wins, we're  
going to still face the same set of problems.
Yeah, and usually, in most of these bubbles,  
even if there's a little bit of incorrect 
information or false perceptions and all that,  
there's usually something inside every bubble 
that's like, that's a serious problem that needs  
addressed, but they can't hear each other, and 
it's like, okay, wait, all of these problems are  
connected at the underlying layer of the system.
So do you have any other recommendations  
for listeners aware of the metacrisis?
Well, my number one recommendation is to try  
to learn about other bubbles. But I think my other 
recommendation is, almost it seems counteracting  
to that, which is we're going to need communities 
and strong relationships, and I feel like putting  
your relationships at risk by trying to learn 
about the other bubbles through people in your  
close relationship circle who disagree with you. 
I do think there's this danger to that, because  
the structure that we've inherited from social 
media has set up ways that we can't perceive  
each other's painful spots, we can't perceive the 
language that's contemptuous that our tribe uses,  
or that's interpreted as contemptuous. So putting 
relationships and community above any of this,  
but then, with that in mind, developing 
those skills to cross the boundaries,  
I think that's a hard thing to navigate.
How would you change your advice for young  
people? And as a college professor, I'm sure 
at the end of the semester, you become friends  
and you wear different hats. If I recall, 
I was their teacher, I was their counselor,  
I was their coach, I was their friend. What 
advice do you give to early 20-somethings  
headed into the things that we face?
It's really developing these skills. It's  
developing the skills, especially the in-person 
skills of just communicating with people,  
apart from social media land, and recognizing 
when is the social media space bleeding into  
these relationships and into these communities, 
and trying to foster spaces that are separate  
from that, because I think the in-person 
skills are essential and they're easy to lose.
I agree. What do you care most 
about in the world, Ashley?
I think I care most about my relationship with 
God, and I think the serenity prayer captures it,  
it's like the wisdom to know the difference 
between what I can change and what I can't,  
and following out what I can actually change, 
and finding my place, and letting my place in  
the world be different than other people's, and 
letting them have the space to be doing something  
that I don't understand or can't understand, but 
interacting as best as I can with those people.
I'm struggling with that too at the 
moment, I'm trying to do too many things,  
and I think you're right, we each have to 
do what we're best at and let others do  
what they're best at. I think you also 
care deeply about learning, don't you?
Yes, that's like an obsession.
Yeah, it's good. Curiosity 
is a really important skill,  
especially for people that can pass the baton 
to others, as teachers like you can. If you  
could wave a magic wand and there was 
no personal recourse to your decision,  
what is one thing you would do to improve 
planetary and human economic societal futures?
Well, so I don't know if this is allowed in the 
thought experiment, I love the thought experiment,  
but it would be for everybody to have three 
communities that they knew well, where they knew  
the personalities, they had enough experience, 
meeting once a week or just being together,  
to where they could function as a community, 
handling challenges and crises, because I  
feel like that would be the infrastructure 
upon which a new economy could be built.
Why three and not one?
So there is risk with communities, and sometimes 
you need to take risks to speak up and say things  
that will disrupt the power balance of the 
community, or that will be outside of what  
this community is normally used to hearing, and 
when you have multiple communities like that,  
it lowers the risk. It's like, okay, 
if I take this risk in this community,  
I'm not risking my whole social structure, I'm 
risking a big part of my social structure, but I  
think it'll make people more willing to take those 
risks. So I do think it needs to be multiple.
I like that idea. I recently, in episode 100, 
which comes out next week, talked about people  
having three core groups, one, people they just 
have fun with, one, people that they have an  
intellectual affiliation with, and one that they 
do stuff, like hands-on stuff, three different  
groups of five to seven core friends, because you 
can't expect that one would have all the things  
that you're interested in, and I think there's 
a health and a diversity and a diversification  
that happens there. So I agree with that idea, but 
that was salient that you said three and not one.
Yeah. No, I like that. And it 
lowers the pressure on any one  
group to be everything to everyone in the group.
Yeah, totally agree. This has been great. So 
I know we just scratched the surface of your  
thinking on these things. I will offer that the 
next... Let's do a follow-up podcast in 2024,  
and we'll do it in person. We'll 
find a studio in Northfield or  
Red Wing or Minneapolis or even 
maybe here, I could rejigger it,  
and we'll take a deeper dive. What's one 
topic that overlaps between the two of  
our interests that you would be willing or 
interested to take a really deep dive on?
Well, so it's one that you suggested for this 
podcast, and I nixed, which is economics in  
general, the field of economics. This 
is the field that's looking at scarce  
resources and allocation of scarce resources 
and incentive mechanisms, it's so essential,  
but this groupthink idea, and the notion that 
communities of knowledge can be bent toward power,  
even it's a small amount that can compounds 
over time, I would love to talk with you about  
that. And I think you and I might think of it 
slightly differently, and I didn't want to talk  
about it this podcast because my fear was, if 
we tried to do it in five minutes or 10 minutes,  
that it would just lead to misunderstanding, and 
I think we're kind of on the same page mostly,  
but I would love to talk with you about 
that, and in person would be fantastic.
Okay. It is a plan. Thank you so much, Ashley, 
for being here today, for teaching young humans  
about the world, and for your channel, The New 
Enlightenment. And stay warm and be careful of  
boxelder bugs, I just recalled the name. Do 
you have those there in Northfield? You must.
I know what bugs you're talking about, 
but I haven't seen one in a long time.
Yeah, boxelder bugs. There are thousands 
in the office here on the walls,  
so I'm going to have to deal with 
that. To be continued, my friend.
Definitely.
