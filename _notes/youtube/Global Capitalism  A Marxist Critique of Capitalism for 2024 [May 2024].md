## Transcript:
Welcome Friends to another edition of
global capitalism a bonly presentation
of democracy at work and the left Forum
I want to thank you for coming and
joining with us to go through this
material this has been a special month
for us because we produced an extra
global capitalism in honor of Mayday a
few days ago this is our regular bonly
for May 20
24 I want to also mention before I begin
that you will see during this
presentation occasional signs on your
screens or something you may hear
reminding you of the websites and the
donations that we depend on I just want
to direct your attention this time to
those because while we try to minimize
the financial side of all of this it
still is there the bills still have to
be paid and for those of you that can
help in financing the work that goes
into this please know that we will
enormously appreciate your doing that
May 5th was the birthday of KL Marx a
little over 200 years ago and we were
mindful of that for the usual reasons
and those are the
following no other theory of how Society
works is as tabooed as banned as
minimized as the Marxist
approach there's no support for that out
of an intellectual framework there's no
support of that in terms of wanting to
understand the world the marxian
approach is one way of doing that not
the only way no one is asking anyone to
support it as though it were the only
way but to ban it to make it difficult
for marxists to have jobs in American
universities which has been and is the
case at all times in my lifetime uh from
the day I was born in this country to
this moment there is no justification it
just denies the American
people an awareness a theory of how the
world works that would be fascinating if
they were exposed to it and that I want
you to know is something I went and
learned on my own known because the
universities I attended Harvard Stanford
and Yale claiming to be bastions of
civilized understanding systematically
excluded Marxist teachers Marxist
material and so on throughout the 10
years that I spent in those
institutions I have learned enormously
from the marxian tradition I would never
deny that it would be a kind of
intellectual dishonesty
but I urge you all of you if you have
found my
presentations or perhaps my writings of
interest if you think I've had something
to say worth thinking about then please
understand that part of the reason I'm
able to do whatever valuable work I can
do is because I make use of Marxist
theory and Marxist writings and the
entire Marxist tradition
that is an important reason for you all
I hope to pursue some exposure to it
yourself if you have not already done so
it's also a reason why I decided to
devote a presentation today right now to
offering a a quick
overview of how a Marxist theorist
approaches the world we're living in
right now 2020 4 what would a Marxist
critique of capitalism today look
like
okay here we
go Marx was a Critic of capitalism you
read him you study what he wrote and
what the tradition he developed wrote
Because it offers a critical view of the
capitalism that was emerging dominant in
Marx's Lifetime and has been the
dominant economic system for the world
ever since roughly 200
years so the interesting
thing is why not
balance approaches to capitalism that
celebrate it and those are what we learn
in school those are what are taught in
our schools that is what my profession
economics is all about celebrating
capitalism and I have no quarrel with
that being
done but it needs to be balanced if
you're serious as an intellectual or
just as a thinker it needs to be
balanced with also considering how a
Critic of the system as opposed to a
celebrant thinks about it that's just so
you have a reasonably
rounded understanding
critics as you've noticed in your own
life see things that celebrants don't
and vice versa and that's why we look at
them both but the problem is here in the
United States you get
99.99% exposure to the
Celebration and
0.1% if that for the
criticism my teachers either ignored the
marxian approach to social social
science or dismissed it with a kind of
casual wave of the hand as if it isn't
worth
it even if you believe that here's the
another
reason Marx's
ideas spread once he articulated them to
every corner of the
world every country on Earth has Marxist
thinkers Marxist magazines Marxist
journals even the United States where it
is repressed systematically it
exists it has meant a great deal to an
enormous number of people on this planet
that we live
on there are even governments like the
People's Republic of China which are
officially endorsing Marxism all the
time and have been doing so since they
won their Civil War in
1949 that's a long time so even if you
don't want to take it
seriously for one reason there's another
namely it's a real part of the world you
live in and that you will have to make
your way in not to understand it not to
spend a little time learning what it has
to say is foolish and
blind and strange if you think about
it I have found my education here in the
United States terribly lopsided in its
refusal to get anywhere near the marxian
tradition and especially not in a
systematic way so I'm going to try to
explain it
now I begin in two ways at the same time
here's the first way many of you think
if I can borrow the words of Bernie
Sanders that the economy is rigged that
there's something built in to our
economic system
capitalism that
produces odd outcomes some of us are
very rich and a huge number of us
aren't some of us have enormous
power many of us
don't what's going on
here some of us go to work can make the
decisions about the workplace that we
give our lives to others of us go there
and are mainly interested in getting
through another day we have no power at
all we arrive at work we do what we're
told our biggest interest is in the
money we get at the end of the week so
we can go and do something that we
actually look forward
to people think the economy is rigged to
get those outcomes but what they don't
seem to want to understand is that
there's a whole science of how it's
rigged and why it's rigged so that if
you are really upset that it's rigged as
I know many of you are then Marxism is
the most developed argument about how
and why it's rigged because it's an
argument about the system it's not going
to say it's rigged because these people
are bad that's childish
even if you believe there are these
people that are bad or greedy or power
hungry you have to answer the obvious
question a why are they that way and B
why are they in a position to impose
that way on the rest of us the minute
you ask those questions you have to
analyze the system that produces those
who win in it and those who lose from it
Etc
but there's a second way I can get at it
and this is to play on the part of you
that is again a child and by a child I
mean an infinitely curious person having
been born into the world is looking
around like all babies do to understand
who are these people what are these
lights what is this food what's going
on and and think simply and here we
go every production of a good or a
service that we all depend on the
clothes we're wearing the food we're
eating the transportation we rely on the
home in which we live our
lives all the goods and services that
together make up what we depend on as
human beings literally to survive but
also to grow to laugh to love all of
that all of the
production think about it most adults
spend most of their adult time five out
of seven days the best hours of the day
at work doing
work at home in the workplace in the
Enterprise in the larger Community it
varies but production work is a central
activity in all societies of human
beings as far back in history as we can
count and what can we say about that
well we can say with
Marx that human beings have arranged
work this crucial Central
activity of the adult population for
which the youth are being taught their
role as they grow into those adult life
situations we know that they have been
organized
differently for example in a slave
system which has existed in different
parts of the world over the
Millennia including here in the United
States as we all know in the early years
of our country's history culminating in
a civil war over the question of slavery
in slavery we organize production by
having a few people be what we call
Masters and the people doing the work be
slaves the slaves produce
output and then what all of it belongs
to the master why because the slave
himself or herself is also a property of
the
master and so everything the workers
produce is the Masters who then decide
whether and how much they give back to
the slave so that the slave can survive
and keep
working what a remarkable
arrangement we got rid of that as a
human race we don't have slavery anymore
the 13th Amendment of the United States
Outlaws it we don't want
it of course the 13th Amendment does
allow it in American prisons but that's
another story then there's another
system called
feudalism fism doesn't allow some people
to own others completely different work
gets done the vast majority of people
are working but they're called
surfs and they are controlled by a tiny
number of people called Lords that's a
completely different system no
slavery what the Surfs produced part of
it anyway they kept another part they
turned over to the
Lord and then we have capitalism
and that's Mark said yet another way of
organizing
production it's different from slavery
nobody can own anybody it's different
from feudalism nobody is anybody's surf
nobody has a subordinate relationship to
a lord the very words Lord
surf no in capitalism we have a
different arrangement
one group of people
employers another group of people
employees and you know how they get
together to undertake
production by a deal a buying and a
selling deal a market
transaction the employer
buys the ability to work from the
employee employee can't sell himself
that would be slavery the employee sells
his her their
ability to use brains and muscles to do
work and the employer says that's what I
want from you I want to buy your ability
to work your labor
power I want you to come at 8:00 and
stay until 5: and work eight hours and
take a break here and there you know the
arrangement you're used to it because
you live in that system you're used to
selling your ability to work would have
struck a slave as bizarre the slave
couldn't sell anything because he was
the property of somebody
else they didn't buy and
sell slaves were not bought and sold in
terms of their daily work they were
bought and sold as animal
people surfs the same thing surfs didn't
sell their ability to work there was no
wage in slavy there was no wage in
feudalism wages are about our particular
system the wage system it's often called
for that
reason but notice the similarity Masters
were a minority small one Lords were a
minority small one and employers are a
minority in capitalism a small one the
vast majority of people were slaves in
slavery surfs in feudalism and
employees in capitalism
and right there is a huge inequality
which we're going to come back
to so
capitalism is this particular
system not
unique in the world as a particular
system slavery was feudalism was Old
Village communities were there's a lot
people working on their own as
individuals self-employed we might call
them they don't have an employer
employee di dialectic or relationship CU
there's only one person who's
both what can we say about this
capitalism that gets us to where Marx
wants us to be here's a
way all production looks as follows
there's a bunch of
stuff produced in the past that we need
to carry on production now we need
materials tools equipment a place I'll
use an example suppose we are producing
I don't know wooden
ladders well we need Timber raw material
wood then we need tools and equipment
Hammer Nails saws you name it and a
workshop where it all can take
place and then we know what we know that
in every production of every good and
service after you buy the raw materials
tools and equipment whoever you
are work is going to be done labor is
going to be done you're going to
transform the wood using the nails the
Hammers and the saws to produce a
finished product the wooden
ladder whether the finished product is
an ice cream cone or a wooden ladder or
a software program that's really beside
the point because every one of those
uses raw materials tools and equipment
transform them by labor into a finished
product now here's what you know even
though you may not have thought about it
before you
know that the stuff done in the past
using my latter example the wood which
had to be found in the forest and cut
down and processed cut up maybe treated
with some chemical whatever you know
that that wood that raw material is the
product of
labor the trees don't come by themselves
labor is involved in
producing the ready to use pieces of
wood labor likewise
made the hammer the saw the nail
they're all the products of
Labor and the person now the worker now
who works on the raw material with the
tools and equipment is adding more labor
that's what transforms wood into a
ladder that's what transforms pieces of
paper into a finished document that's
what
transforms milk and sugar and flavoring
into the ice cream cone
so when you think about it here comes
the
punchline
labor is the crucial item
labor is what makes
everything but now we come to the
employer and the employer says something
marvelous and magical to us the employer
says no no no wait a
minute I
own the lum
I own the tools and
equipment I bring them to the production
site to the factory the office the
store the worker only adds labor now I'm
the one who brings the capital General
word for all the stuff I already own if
I'm the employer because that's why I'm
called a
capitalist because I own the stuff that
I bring the tools and raw materials in
the
factory but Marx reacts you didn't make
those things you may own them but you
didn't make them it's not your labor
that's congealed in those tools
equipment and raw
materials somehow the labor done by the
people who made the lumber and made the
nails and made the hammer and made the
saw somehow that labor that made
them got lost to those people they don't
own it you do you didn't work on it but
you own it they did work on it and they
don't own it now that's interesting how
did that happen because you can't be Mr
capitalist Unless somehow there's a
built into this system some way for the
products of
Labor to come to be owned by people who
had no role in making that
product Marx has an answer which is one
of the reasons why we need to learn from
what he
wrote It's the S probably the single
most
basic understanding he offered
us namely it's an
explanation of how and why
the people who do the
work end up not
owning and having power to decide what
to do with the fruits of the labor
they've
undertaken in other words he explains
how past labor produced stuff that now
belongs to people other than the
laborers Mark said that was the key
question to ask because it will give you
the answer namely how the system works
why the system works the way it does
which is on your mind a lot of the time
that you're conscious and a lot of the
time you're not in your dreams in your
imaginations so let me do it for you and
see whether you can't find something
interesting to think about as I go
through
it I'll do this by going back to my
little latter story by looking again at
every production process like the latter
raw materials have to be assembled tools
and equipment have to be presented
present and then a working person a
laborer uses the tools and equipment to
transform the raw materials into a
finished product that's really what
economics is about this production of
the goods and services we all depend on
a secondary part of Economics discusses
how those things get distributed in a
society so first something has to be
produced and then it gets distributed
but ironically after something is
distributed it is often put into
production the capitalist buys the tools
equipment and raw materials and puts
them into production with the workers
that the capitalist have has hired
you're familiar with that because you're
part of
that now let's follow the
logic very very important and we're
going to use numbers very very simple
please do not be
dissuaded from listening because there's
a little bit of numbers
here let's
assume that the tools equipment and raw
materials together
cost 100 of anything $100 100 euros 100
rupees it doesn't
matter the capitalist in capitalism the
employer has to have the
money with which to buy the tools
equipment and raw materials for 100 so
our capitalist takes a 100 and buys the
tools equipment and raw
materials the second thing our
capitalist then does is hire workers the
ones that do the
work who actually transform the raw
materials using the tools and equipment
into the finished
product the capitalist does not do
that it's only in rare exceptional
situations that are very small as a part
of our economy where the capitalist
participates in some way in actually
doing the work capitalists like to tell
you how hard they're working and that's
very nice but if they're working hard
it's at running all of this not at doing
the work of all of this as most of you
know now let's assume that the
workers during the
week add value to the tools and
equipment and raw materials which is of
course what they do their labor
transforming the wood into a ladder adds
value the ladder isn't worth a 100 that
100 is already in the ladder in terms of
the tools equipment and raw materials
used up in making the
ladders the worker who makes the ladder
adds value
adds to the in what's in that ladder
relative to what was in the tools
equipment and raw materials and again to
keep it simple let's assume the worker
adds a 100 worth of value so we know
what the ladders will be worth the hund
worth of tools equipment and raw
materials used up in producing the
ladder plus the human labor labor right
now done to make that transformation
happen the value of the latter is 200
100 tools equipment and raw material
plus 100 Val value added by
workers okay we know what the capitalist
does in our system with the laders the
capitalist sells
them and we're going to make the
simplifying assumption that the
capitalist sells them for the value
that's in them
200 and now follow
me when the deal is done when the
capitalist has sold the ladders for 200
he takes 100 out of the 200 and replaces
the tools equipment and raw materials
that were used up so he can continue to
be in the ladder producing
business or whatever business he might
be
in okay he sold the ladders for 200 he
used up 100 of those to replace a tools
equipment and raw
materials now what is he going to do
with the other hundred well we know that
there's one thing he has to do he has to
pay the workers he hired because if he
doesn't they won't come back and if they
don't he can't produce ladders so the
only way this system works is if the
employer takes a part of the hundred
left after selling the ladders for 200
100 and using 100 to replace the tools
equipment and raw materials the
capitalist has got that 100 left and
he's got to give some of that to the
workers he hired if he's going to
continue in business well now watch the
bouncing
ball he could give them and many of you
I think imagine he might be able to give
the
workers the hundred has left over and
that would be interesting because that
would mean that the workers added a 100
when they worked and are now getting
paid the equivalent they're getting a
hundred back they added a 100 to the
they gave the employer a 100 and the
employer is giving them back a 100 a
fair deal an equal
relationship the problem with that story
is what's left for the capitalist if he
does that and the answer is nothing and
Marx points out that he's never met a
capitalist who undertakes a capitalist
production process knowing and expecting
nothing for himself out of
it that's not the way the system works
and indeed if you talk to any capitalist
today they'll tell you they're in
business to make money they want to get
more into their hands than it cost them
to undertake the pro they want a profit
don't they they're driven by profit they
seek to maximize profit in the language
of capitalism profit is the bottom
line and Mark says yeah it is and I'm
going to explain to you
where the profit comes from and out of
that explanation I will teach you about
capitalism in a way you have never
thought about it before so here's the
explanation the capitalist doesn't give
workers the equal of what the workers
added in value by their labor to stay
with my latter example the workers added
a 100 what is the employ employer going
to pay them I'll pick something 50
50 the workers added 100 and they got
paid 50 so where did the other 50 end up
uhuh in the hands of the
employer he's the one who sells the
ladds he gets the 200 he uses 100 to
replace the tools equipment and raw
materials he uses 50 to pay the workers
and he keeps the other 50 for
himself that's the profit capitalists
are looking
for it's what they take from the workers
who produced
it now look at what we can
understand once you understand this
you'll understand why the employer is
constantly trying to press down what he
pays the workers the
wages why look at our story the less he
pays the workers the more he keeps for
himself in my little example I said he
paid the workers 50 if he could get away
by paying the workers 45 he would keep
55 instead of
50 wow so capitalists are always looking
to yeah
yeah spend less on workers lower the
wage bill economize on labor costs they
have a lot of ways of saying it but it's
all the same
game and you know how Society is shaped
in this way I'll give you three examples
from today of the United States and
around the
world capitalists are busy firing
workers and replacing them with
machines and they only do it if the
machine is cheaper than the worker
because then they can get away with
giving
less to the workers in machines than
before they had to give to the
workers and that's more for
them here's another way they do it they
move production away from where workers
are high wage to where they can get away
with paying low
Wages that's why millions of jobs have
moved in recent decades out of the
United States to the People's Republic
of China or India or Brazil or Mexico or
wherever there's no Myster here if you
push down the wage there's more of the
value added by your workers that you the
capitalist the employer get to
keep and here's another one immigration
bring in people that will accept lower
wages than your indigenous native
population might accept and that'll be
great for you because you will give less
of the value added by the worker in
production than you had to before
leaving more for the employer the
endless effort never stops of employers
to squeeze
more out of this
Arrangement is why workers are
constantly discovering that the employer
is trying to nibble away at their
bathroom time or their lunch break or
anything else where they could save
because it taking it from the worker is
bringing it into your own
pocket now take a step back with me as
Marx
does and ask
yourself what a way to set up production
what a way to organize an economic
system what you're doing is setting up
in every workplace in every store in
every office in every Factory a conflict
of
interests a battle that never stops Marx
calls it the class
struggle it's what every worker
discovers wherever he she they are
working that there's this endless
struggle to squeeze
more press down the wage
which means the employer will hire
Specialists Engineers lawyers
accountants to figure out every
day hire a new MBA graduate who might
come in with a new idea of how you can
squee it's a conflict ridden
system and in that conflict the
employers have the upper hand most of
the time
what do I mean well they take that
difference the difference between the
value added by their employees and the
wages they pay to those employees that's
their profit and that's of course where
they get the money with which to buy the
tools equipment and raw material so now
we know how those things which were the
products of Labor ended up the property
of non- laborers
it's the people working today who
produce the profit taken by the employer
that enables them to be the capitalist
in the first
place it's a self
reproducing system yeah it is rigged of
course it's
rigged You Now understand how it's
rigged and why it's rigged this way
capitalists have the need to do
this they have to worry that there will
be people stop buying what they produce
because tastes
change because some other capitalist is
able to offer a better product or a
cheaper product or
both car companies producing gas powered
cars are confronted by Tesla and
electric
cars how do they survive they have to
have as much profit as possible to go
and either produce electric cars
themselves or come up with some new
development capitalists are always
worried they'll be outco competed if you
like and so they want more profit sure
it's also to live luxuriously which they
do take a lot of that profit for their
own personal
consumption but they're driven by more
than that they're driven by the
competitive situation that everything is
always insecure there's always some
other capitalist trying to grab on to an
opportunity to profit at their
expense so it's driven not only by the
conflict between capitalist and workers
but by the competition among the
capitalists that's why it has this
driven
quality that no matter how big it gets
it needs to get bigger no matter how
rich the employer gets has to get
richer it's a kind of crazy
system it's not just rigged in one way
but it's also driven in a kind of crazed
manner that's why many religions know
that there's something wrong with a
system in which the real Almighty is the
almighty
dollar the American example of
capitalism being the dominant one for
the last 75
years the consequences of a Marxist
understanding of production are
incredible they give you something to
think about and let me give you just a
few examples number one inequality this
is a system that breeds inequality the
workers are many they're producing a
profit received by a few employers are a
few according to the US sens employers
are 3% of our population all the rest of
us are not
employers most of us are
employees so we have an arrangement in
which large numbers of people are
gathered together in factories offices
and stores to produce a lot of value by
our labor we get a wage back but a large
portion of what we produce is kept by
the employers and that's 3% of the the
people so yes they become quite wealthy
they are the
3% or if you like the 1% it doesn't
matter it's a tiny percentage who become
wealthy Americans these days think about
their annual salaries in terms of tens
of thousands of dollars cuz that's where
most Americans are but then there are
some like I don't know Elon musk or Bill
Gates or Warren Buffett or Jeffrey Bezos
they count their wealth in hundreds of
billions of do this is
crazy you have to go back to ancient
slave
societies like the Pharaohs in Egypt
when there were masses of slaves who
produced enough
profit in their system for their masters
so that the Masters could erect the
pyramids as their
tombs cuz they had all these people that
they could put to work in whatever way
they
thought
appropriate Bezos and musk they don't
make pyramids they do something similar
space programs to see what they can find
out in space or they decide to own 26
yachts or 50
Mansions come on you want to understand
inequality I just answered it Marx did
the work for
us whatever you want to do about it Marx
explains where it comes from and there
is an implication here that's
tough the implication is if you really
don't like don't approve don't agree
with the
inequalities all around us rich and poor
countries rich and poor states rich and
poor neighborhoods you know you grew up
in a country full of these extreme
inequalities Marx's message if you don't
want those if you want a community not
divided into rich and poor and all that
that means all the bitterness all the
Envy all the jealousy all the the
defensiveness all the
violence then Marx's argument says you
got to deal with an economic system
because if you don't you'll fail and
what do we know about the last 150 years
of American History we've had repeated
efforts to say this inequality is not
good for us this inequality is excessive
this inequal and yet what have we done
we've had a great society program a war
against poverty they all fail they all
fail and why because they don't dare
deal with the economic system out of
which this inequality emerges as its
product Marx had a a fun line in capital
he said it's true that capitalism has
been productive of great wealth the
problem is it has also been productive
of great
poverty and the worst of it it
reproduced produces the one every bit as
efficiently as it reproduces the other
and that's the problem you want to deal
with poverty you want to deal with
inequality well then you got to deal
with capitalism as a system if you don't
you will not solve the
problem and I leave you with that
message if you don't you will not solve
the problem and yet we live here in the
United States and in any other countries
in places where systematic study and
learning from
marks is prevented is a taboo is denied
is repressed which therefore blocks
people from
understanding that part of any solution
to inequality and poverty has to be
changes in your economic system or else
you're just not
serious okay a second example
the marxian
argument also addresses another basic
question people particularly people who
have a little bit of a critical
perspective have
asked why is capitalism so
unstable in other words as a system not
only has it got this extreme inequality
which it cannot overcome even having
tried to do so on many
occasions why is it so
unstable and what do I mean here well
I'm going to rely on the research of a
very important American institution the
National Bureau of economic research
NB they do the very useful service of
charting the ups and downs of the
American economy and basically what they
have found is that on average every
every 47 years capitalist economic
systems
crash yeah they crash every four to
seven years and what does it mean this
crash well it means the following
suddenly huge numbers of people are
thrown out of work it's not because
they're not doing good work it's not
because their skills have disappeared
it's not because they're too drunk to
come to work none of that they are just
as efficient and just as
hardworking when the crash happens as
they were 2 months 6 months 10 months 2
years before suddenly large numbers of
businesses
crash those workers lose their jobs
those businesses are forever
gone what
happened well it's the way the system
works we're told what yes in the
University we are taught about business
Cycles that's a nice word sounds much
less word uh terrible than
crash now it is true that each crash is
unique in some ways they don't last the
same amount of time they don't Peak and
drop to their bottom in the same way
some of the crashes are shallow and
quick and short some of the crashes are
harsh deep and last a long time the
Great Depression of the 19 30s lasted
over a decade over 10 years and was
horrible unemployment at its peak was
33% eight or nine times what it is right
now but we haven't been able to get out
of it the governments of capitalist
countries have tried
desperately to stop these cycles and
there's a simple reason
why a system begins to lose support of
the people if it's producing mass
unemployment and the collapse of
businesses left and right that's a time
when people question the system are
angry about the system are bitter about
how it has destroyed their livelihoods
their educations their hopes their
dreams young people in America are going
through that right now
so the system is nervous when it
crashes it's terribly frightened that it
might crash harshly for a long time it
wants to make it short it wants people
not to think about it it wants to
distract
folks but Marxism is not in the business
of saving capitalism it doesn't like
capitalism and thinks we can do
better so Marxism has said well let's
take a look this system is UN stable any
system that crashed every 4 to seven
years would have to have the label
unstable when I teach this in the
University I lean across the podium and
I say to my students if you lived with a
person as unstable as capitalism you
would have moved out long ago and they
laugh and the point of Marxism is to say
you ought to laugh too you're a a member
of a system you participate in a system
that threatens you with
unemployment every 4 to S years let's
take a look at American
history we've had three
crashes in this Century so far in the
first year 2000 we had what we call the
do crash in 2008 and N we had the
subprime mortgage crash and in 2020
2021 we had the covid-19 crash we can
put a different label on each one but
we've had three crashes in 23 years
right about the 4 to seveny year average
isn't
it when the crashes come terrible
suffering unemployed people are shown
there's lots of studies they turn to
alcohol they turn to violence in the
household they get more physically and
mentally
ill divorces shoot
up family problems
explode people lose their home lose
their car you all
know what kind of a system do we have
that every four to seven years drops
this
bomb why are there not questions as to
what in the world is going on
the few economists that have dared to
ask have mostly come up with the right
answer which
is the crashes happen when capitalists
decide that they're not going to put
their wealth to production they're not
going to hire workers they're going to
wait a year or two because the
conditions aren't good the market isn't
there or the technology isn't there or
the workers are demanding too much money
or whatever the reason it's when
capitalists decide to hold
back if they don't hire workers then
those workers don't have an income and
if those workers don't have an income
they can't spend and if they don't spend
then the goods that were produced by
other capitalists can't be sold and so
they lay off their workers and we get
that snowball called a recession and if
it goes further and last longer a
depression so much power is in the hands
of of the 3% who are employers that
their decisions what to do with their
wealth shape the ups and downs of the
whole economy in other words the
structure of capitalism produces the
instability that everybody including
capitalists neither
want nor can do anything
about and these are signs that you need
system
change now let me conclude
it's all well and good to show that a
critical approach to capitalism has much
to say much to teach us everything I've
just gone over with you is pretty simple
and pretty straightforward it is the
core of what the marxian economics
tradition has to offer there's much more
that's been done it's a very rich
tradition as any visit to a decent
Library will show you and I urge you to
do that learn about it
it'll only make you your thinking about
the world sharper clearer more
comprehensive and basically more
adequate to the crisis we are now living
through which is a crisis of capitalism
yet
again it's a little different this time
because the crisis of capitalism is felt
more in the old places where employer
employee capitalism has existed
Western Europe North America and Japan
those are the places where capitalism is
in deep trouble younger capitalism where
the employer employee relationship is
newer and is being shaped more by the
government working with the private
sector rather than by the private sector
pushing the government away and I'm
talking here about China India Brazil
and so on they have less of a crisis
they're on the up swing we have more of
one cuz we are on the
down and that too is an application of a
marxian
approach but are there Alternatives is
there anything else or are we stuck with
this system is the message really resign
yourself there's nothing better than you
that you can get well luckily people in
the past didn't believe that the people
in slavery fought hard felt they could
do better and in the end they did and
people in feudalism those Lords and
surfs there were plenty of them who were
resigned who were happy about it but
there were enough who were critical that
they could and would do better that's
how we have capitalism because people
fought to do better than slavery and to
do better than
feudalism well what is the Marxist
tradition about it's about people who
felt and who feel that we can do better
than capitalism we don't have to have a
system that produces extremes of wealth
and poverty we don't have to have a
system that's unstable and all the other
things I don't have time to go over with
you
now and what would the better system be
well it's kind of obvious although Marx
never spelled it out he made a few Gest
es in that direction he was a Critic of
capitalism that was his project that's
what he devoted himself to and that's
what Marxism is mostly about it's not
about speculations of the future Beyond
those implied by the critique of
capitalism and here's that one we don't
need employers and
employees we can learn from the past of
the human race there were always
thousands of years ago hundreds of years
ago 10 years ago there were always
people who didn't want to who refused to
participate in slavery in feudalism or
in capitalism and one of the ways they
did that was to organize production in a
radically different way no master no
slave no Lord no surf no employer no
employee instead the workplace should be
organized as a democratic
Community the workers together decide
one person one vote what to produce how
to produce where to produce and what to
do with the
output there don't have to be employers
and
employees we are a community that can
assign assign work tasks divide up the
product divide up the income amongst
ourselves true we wouldn't give a few
people people billions whereas the mass
majority are worried about whether they
can get their kid to college or put food
on the table we wouldn't do that that's
why we don't want capitalism because it
does that the alternative whether you
call it a worker Co-op or a collective
or a commune or a Democratic Community
it's all the same gesture we can do
better than capitalism because there are
alternatives they're all always were
Alternatives the human race has
experimented with some of
them and that basic human
quality of enjoying its environment but
also retaining a critical eye that's
what makes technological progress but
that can also make social progress and
that's what Marxism in all of its better
incarnations has always been about you
can learn from this
tradition willfully keeping away from
doing that is imposing on yourself an
ignorance that will not help you or
anybody else if you found what we do in
these presentations interesting please
understand that part of whatever value
we have or that I have comes out of
Having learned and trying to use the
insights I got from that that tradition
which are different
from insights I got from other
Traditions which I
got but closing yourself off from the
marxian tradition is just playing into
the hands of those who don't want the
system to change who are sitting at the
top and whose greatest fear is
precisely that people will understand we
can and we should do
better thank you thank you for your
attention and we'll be back in July with
the next bimonthly installment of global
capitalism
