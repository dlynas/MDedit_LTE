The Nature of Matter in the Work of Christopher Alexander - Michael Mehaffy
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx8TGi2aXSc)

## Transcript:
it's a pleasure to welcome
dr michael mahaffey
michael and i met many years ago
uh in london when he was

the head of the responsible for
education at the prince's
institute
for uh urban design i think but i don't
remember the exact name well it was the
prince's institute for architecture and
then it was his foundation and chris was
involved in that also
he had just moved to
benstead to meadow
meadow lag meadow farm farm okay
um
he then uh finished his phd at delft uh
he worked for many years
in stockholm and the center for future
of places at kth
has worked with
u.n habitat
doing various things
very much involved in including
uh the issue of place in into the
quito

declaration
uh for the first time that that there
was anything written about that in the
in the u.n documents
um as written in extensively with nicos
uh
in a series of articles in
the metropolis magazine and then
recent book or several several years ago
a book designed for a living planet
um
obviously addressing
uh the pattern language as a key
technology
and his most recent book is
a new pattern language for growing
regions
published self-published by sustasis
his organization sustasis foundation
and

he's going to talk to us about the
philosophical foundations
of
alexander's theory
of wholeness and particularly uh
whitehead
plato aristotle's
so michael
floyd's yours um yeah since day since we
started that actually
coming out of the time when i was in
london and
uh working with chris and recognizing
that there were a lot of people
um thinking and working along the lines
that chris had certainly laid out and
other related
thinkers
jane jacobs and others um and that we
really needed to kind of gather some of
those people together so systasis is
is a it's basically the greek word
for system but it's also means a
gathering or a a um
standing together as one coming together
many many people coming together as one
so there's this idea of of wholeness or
of uh part whole relations in the name
which i like and jenny quillian who's
with us today is one of our board
members and ward cunningham is one of
our board members the guy who took a lot
of chris's ideas into the software world
and ended up producing wiki and
wikipedia and a lot of other things so
um
what i'm going to talk about of course
is uh book four
which i think probably many of you have
already been diving into and reading and
and so on and and i'm going to explore
that and unpack some of the ideas in
book 4 in my talk but
i'm going to do it in the context of
again
the antecedents to alexander and also
maybe what are going to be some of the
follow-up um
explorations after alexander now we've
we've lost our great friend who whose
career spanned from the late 1950s he
knew walter gropius at harvard uh right
up to you know
last week and so he's a
person who occupies a very large
uh space in not only architectural
theory but design theory and design
philosophy
the philosophy of technology the
philosophy of culture the philosophy of
nature
his his ideas go very deep as i think we
all
know
and um they are not totally unique i
mean there's this idea some people have
that this guy just came out of left
field and came up with all these wild
ideas um on his own so to speak but
actually i'm going to argue that
you know to coin a phrase his ideas are
structure preserving transformations of
other thinkers ideas or wholeness
extending uh transformations if you will
and particularly on this idea of the
nature of matter
and i'm going to explore some of the
other thinkers the more recent thinkers
like whitehead and some of the other
contemporaries of alexander and then
going back even to you know
aristotle and others and you could there
there's a lot more to this story than
i'm going to discuss but i'm going to
touch on some of those figures as well
um so
the this is the description of the
session today um
that uh
a new conception
uh of the nature of matter which is the
the section the first section of book
four
and i'm going to ask what is that
conception and how does it relate to the
previous thinkers as i said and uh
other work in fields like physics
psychology mathematics that endless
number really of
of topics and um so we're going to
explore that
briefly even though you know i'm going
to try to do a thorough job of it but
it's necessarily going to be brief
and that
argue
that alexander does indeed build on
these other thinkers and extends their
work in very important ways in really
i think
amazing ways in many respects so if you
remember the author's note at the
beginning of book four that's always
something good to look at and see what
is he saying he's trying to do
and what he says is we have a practical
aim
we wish to create living structure in
the built world and to understand this
idea of the nature of the universe
remember the title of the book the
subtitle is an essay on the art of
building and the nature of the universe
and that that's something that's not
just
esoteric you know naval gazing it's
practical
that brings it down to earth and so
because we want to reproduce but the
phenomena that we're interested in we
want to reproduce life and wholeness and
so on so there is a very very practical
aim to all this philosophy
which is ultimately the idea of
philosophy i think and i mentioned this
word mariology which is not a familiar
word but it's a good old-fashioned word
uh the idea of
part whole relations how they relate to
each other do the parts make the whole
does the whole make the parts
how do these things relate to one
another and this
goes way back in philosophy it also goes
back to the beginning of alexander's
career if you look at for example
herbert simon's work
sort of at the dawn of the cybernetic
age when we were suddenly dealing with
all of these massive numbers of
variables and
and bits of data and we were trying to
understand how they were organized and
get our arms around that be able to
systematize that and use it
and he he wrote a classic paper the
architecture of complexity where he
observed that design problems including
the problems of designing computer
software or anything else are
essentially nearly decomposable
hierarchies
they can be you know seen as a series of
nested sets you have
the whole and then the parts and then
the parts of the parts and the parts of
the parts but they're nearly
decomposable you have these sort of
crossover relationships that are very
very important and chris alexander took
that idea much further in notes on the
synthesis of form his first book where
he said these nearly decomposable
relationships these overlaps were
actually critical in understanding the
way the natural world is organized the
way parts relate to holes
and that these formed what he called
semi lattices uh and
you could you could work with those you
could work with the clusters that
resulted in the sort of denser
stronger tie regions
and by the way i'll get to that later
that's the genesis of the idea of
patterns
but in notes on the synthesis of form
he's looking
right at the beginning of his career at
this issue of mariology the relation of
the parts of a problem to its whole and
to its final form again did the parts
make the hole do the holes make the
parts how does this work in nature how
does it work in human technology in our
own time and is it is it different and
is it perhaps in some way deficient in
some critical sense that we need to get
our arms around if we're going to deal
with our challenges which is certainly
what he found and what i certainly
believe as well and that means new tools
and approaches that
are suggested that are can become very
practical like the pattern languages and
and other ideas that alexander has
developed along the way
um and then the following year he wrote
the great paper a city is not a tree
where he observed how these overlapping
relationships actually work in what he
called natural cities and he gave a
prosaic example of
uh exam from berkeley of a crosswalk and
a street light and a newspaper rack and
he described how they sort of have a
rock paper scissors kind of relationship
to one another there isn't some neat
hierarchical scheme where you can say
this one thing controls the other two
it's an interactive relationship uh that
traffic light the electric impulses the
sidewalk all form a system
um and he noted that that's true in all
kinds of ways in natural cities but not
true in critical ways in what he called
artificial cities or planned cities and
this had enormous consequences for uh
the the way those cities functioned and
the kind of life that they had the
enormity of this restriction is
difficult to grasp it's as though we
couldn't have
make friends within a family unless the
whole family made friends with one whole
other family um and this is not a
less orderly uh uh kind of structure
which is what we thought we thought it
was messy and tangled and we didn't like
that we wanted to sort everything out
and be orderly but this is actually a
thicker tougher more subtle and more
complex view of structure he said uh and
that was a very very powerful idea i
think related in many ways to uh the
work of jane jacobs at the same time um
actually writing just a couple of years
before
talking about
organized complexity in her marvelous
last chapter the kind of problem a city
is of her
most widely known book the death and
life of great american cities and she
said you know the way we probe the world
with our mental methods uh has changed
dramatically uh we've gone from really
understanding simple two-variable
problems to understanding statistical
problems in the early 20th century uh
the two variable problems like the
pressure of a gas and the volume of the
gas something like that or you know the
the kind of problem that you need to
land on the moon that those sorts of
issues or the statistical problems where
you didn't really need to know what's
going on between the variables you just
need to know the the average behavior so
that's great for statistical problems
for understanding for example life
insurance
statistics uh and
actuarial tables and so on and many
other technological issues of the um of
the cybernetic age where you just didn't
need to know much about what's going on
with the variables you need to know how
they're how they're behaving as an
average
polling sampling and things like that um
but what she observed is that
we sort of skipped over this great
middle region as she referred to it
where it's not so much the number of
variables but how they're interacting
as more than two variables in a network
in a in a web relationship uh and this
great middle region
again is is uh maybe uh has more to do
with the number of atoms in a pinch of
salt or even smaller than that uh
and this is the problems of organized
complexity as she described it
um
and
these are the show the essential
features of organization as you put it
um
and then she drew a contrast with the
way we were planning cities much like
alexander did and said we have not
moved forward into this new
understanding this new
understanding of nature really
of the way the world actually works
we're still mired in this perfectly
decomposable
hierarchy instead of the nearly
decomposable hierarchy so alexander took
those ideas
and again this idea of the clusters that
tended to form the strong ties in a
certain area and developed
the idea that you could now manipulate
those you could work with those within a
larger network
or a series of patterns and indeed a
pattern language you could take the
strong links and and cluster them
together as forces and then you could
relate them to the weak links in some
kind of grammatical way a looser way and
you could uh
generate flexibility there you could
generate a language-like ability to to
create new structures
and this is for example
this is of course the essential idea of
a pattern language the book that
actually didn't come out until 1977 but
these ideas were being developed uh much
earlier
and if you think about patterns of
course
here's a
trivial example of a pattern of a door
so you have the elements then they have
some relationship to one another some
forces you have the hinges on one side
the knob on the other side you can't put
the hinges in the knob on the same side
the door won't work you need a
configuration of those forces in order
for the door to work properly and those
are the strong forces but then the
relationship of one door to another door
in in the room those are weak forces
because you can slide those doors around
and they don't really affect each other
however they do affect the room so then
at that scale they become strong forces
again and the rooms once again become
weak forces in relation to one another
they can slide around but then again at
the larger scale
uh the the building itself has strong
forces within it and so on and going
right on up the scale and that's
essentially the idea of the pattern
language that the idea that you can
manipulate these forces and you could
cluster them and that the the strong
ties at one scale become the weak ties
at the upper scale and then those in
turn are related in some way in strong
ties that then are related again in weak
ties overall going up door room
building
uh
neighborhood city
uh planet etc and so you have that
hierarchical relationship
and again you can now combine those in a
language-like way following a sort of
grammatical rules that allows you to to
work with complete holes rather than
just assembling fragmentary bits because
they already have these web-like
relationships built in and of course
they're built in through the hyperlinks
that are built into the pattern
and these are real structures they're
not just abstractions they're they're
real things like rooms and gardens and
towns or ecological things rivers
mountains forests etc and again just as
as uh herbert simon pointed out the the
larger scale is made up of the smaller
scale and the smaller scale is made up
of the smaller scale still and so on so
you have this
network of structured options that is
roughly hierarchical but not rigidly so
that has these interconnections and
overlaps and so on and of course we all
are familiar i think with the general
structure of a pattern you have the
seven part structure in the book of the
title and then the iconic photo that i
think is very important actually because
it conveys a sort of gestalt of the
pattern the way it's connect connected
to its context uh and then the upward
hyperlinks to
larger scale patterns than the problem
statement then the analysis and then the
diagrammatic conclusion of some kind
that says therefore you're going to do
things in this way you're going to put
the hinges on one side and the handle on
the other side not on the same side
right um and then the downward
hyperlinks to the smaller scale patterns
so that is the
uh the mariological scheme if you will
the hylomorphic scheme i'll get to
whitehead or aristotle later but
the the scheme of part whole relations
that's built into the pattern language
um and that it has this language-like uh
aspect to it that the idea of a language
was really important to alexander
studying linguistics and very influenced
by chomsky and others
and this idea that language itself is a
pattern like structure and reality is a
pattern like structure i once asked
chris
what would you say is your biggest
takeaway from your work with patterns in
pattern languages and i thought he might
say oh well i don't know what one thing
is but he answered it right away he said
i thought i was inventing something but
i later realized i was discovering
something i was discovering something
about the way the world is put together
and i think that's true of all of his
work
now again this is not an entirely new
way of looking at the world it's
certainly innovative and important and
breathtaking in its usefulness in many
ways but it does go back to uh
at least to aristotle um you know plato
had a scheme of understanding the world
that was the world of forms or ideos and
the world of matter and those were two
different things matter was simply an
instance of the forms and aristotle
really took that idea and turned it on
its head it said no no no the world is
form and matter are embedded in the
world and the form at one scale
the matter at one scale becomes the form
at the next scale which again becomes
the matter at the next scale which again
becomes the form at the next scale and
you can hear an echo here of alexander
or alexander echoing aristotle um and
this is his idea of hylomorphism the
idea that um
form and matter have this inseparable
relationship to one another that is
constantly evolving and transforming
well change is a material transformation
matter undergoes a change of form a lump
of bronze is shaped into a statue
and
of course what is at one scale uh uh a
brick let's say then becomes a house and
then the house can become
part of the the matter that becomes part
of the form of the neighborhood and the
neighborhood becomes the matter that
becomes the form of the city and so on
and right on up the scale so there is a
close relationship as you can see here
to aristotle but there's also some very
important additions as you can see
certainly the whole idea of overlap and
ambiguity the idea that we can
embed this into our language and into a
language like tools and so again we see
eternal ideas being reapplied to novel
conditions and discoveries being
transformed and articulated and made
more useful for our own time
and that's true looking for example at
quantum physics and at cybernetics
and other examples that i'll get to
later but there was something that chris
observed about a pattern language that
uh he recognized was very very
incomplete and needed further work and
first of all there wasn't enough ability
to customize the the patterns people
were not really doing that partly a
victim of its own success it was this
bible-like volume as we all know
it was hard to interface with
conventional systems and methods that
was a problem that he took on much later
and really described in his last book
battle
and there was not enough information
about the form and the geometry and this
sort of hylomorphic transformation that
we've been talking about um and
this was what he brought him to the
project of the nature of order to deal
with these shortcomings how do you
take this forward into an uh
more complete understanding of how
geometry is generated through
the use of the patterns or the use of
the elements that we're working with and
how does that happen in nature how does
it happen in human nature and how can we
apply that to a new approach a new way
of of shaping our world so here's what
chris had to say about it when he and i
had some discussions in 2008.
uh you know what i'm sorry i'm going to
stop that for a second because i realize
i need to make sure yeah i've got it
uh that i have the op to share
so what is the nature of order all about
took
25 years to write
four big fat books or big thick books
unfortunately a little expensive about
sixty dollars a book
thousands of lovely colored pictures
anyway what's it all about
um
when i finished the pattern language
i thought that i had come close
to solving the problem
of
making good human environments
and that if people went to work and and
used all those patterns
um
something very uh beautiful and good
would follow
in the hands of ordinary people and just
from the use of that
language that pattern language
that turned out to be not true
the
early experiments that i made after the
book came out
the pattern language book came out i
made it over a period of years i made
experiments
to see what happened when people
actually used this
and
yes certainly things
i think people did things that were very
very helpful to them
and some of them are
are quite lovely in a
just in the sense of being informal and
being about that person or this person
or that place and so forth
but
the buildings
and the groups of buildings and so forth
were not really
beautiful to put it quite simply
they weren't
luckily i was at that time
still
relatively early in my professional life
and so i had time to think about this
and
um what the nature of order is about
is
what does it take
to make the the things beautiful
um
really and truly beautiful in the
old-fashioned meaning of the word
um

so that it touches you in your heart
and what these books attempt to do
is to describe
what is involved in thinking about that
what's involved in
doing it
what's
from involved
practical point of view in terms of
construction contracting and so forth
what's involved from a spiritual point
of view
so that
you
as the maker whoever that is are
in a sufficiently harmonious state to be
able to make a beautiful thing so
it's really the gamut of all of that
is what these books are about
and
i certainly got closer
in
those books
than i did in the pattern language a lot
closer
so let's dive a little bit into the
nature of order and the ideas in it uh
and in relation to what we were talking
about before and as i mentioned the
first section talks about our changing
uh scientific picture of the universe
again jane jacobs talked about that as
well
um and i i showed you this example too
that we have a practical aim to create
living structure in the built world
and that's just something that we are
taking as a given as human beings who
are embodied in the world we want to
enjoy our lives we want to be well we
want to be healthy we want to be alive
and so this is a given
and we want to ask what are the things
we can do in our environment in our
building our world to enhance that and
not to detract from that not only in
this moment but into the future you know
sustainably
and so on
and looking at the the physical world
the nature of the physical world he
points out that quantum mechanics also
might not have been a useful field if it
hadn't been something that we could
actually apply to our physical world to
in fact the computers that we're using
right now in the electronics systems and
so on and once we got into quantum
mechanics we began to recognize that
there are these very very important
phenomena going on involving wholeness
involving
the inseparable nature of different
parts of space that we can't simply see
space as this empty vessel with atomic
bits in it anymore we have to understand
it as an interactive field that has
these these
interrelated phenomena going on within
it and that is very much an idea that
alexander took forward
that he talks about how many other
people uh schrodinger bum uh john bell
ignore other penrose took that forward
and then also more recently people like
brian goodwin uh stuart kaufman maywanho
uh taking these ideas forward into
the biological realm and into an
understanding of our own uh health and
well-being our own bodies and how they
work and how our our our wellness and
our well-being is promoted and not
promoted uh by understanding how these
structures are actually behaving um
and he points out that this is a
weakness in our present world picture
that we really have not reconciled
the two views the sort of what whitehead
referred to as uh nature lifeless
and uh what white had contrasted that
with nature alive
and he said we really need to unite the
these two pictures of the world the
world of our own experience in life and
the world of what seems to be mechanism
but actually is it's just our abstract
ways of understanding through
mechanistic models
what's going on in the world as we see
in quantum mechanics
and he
came to the conclusion it came to the
hypothesis that all value depends upon a
structure in which each center the life
of each center is related to the larger
centers around it and related ultimately
to ourselves and to the entire cosmos as
a sort of ground of personality that
begins to approach this idea of god or
the divine or whatever you want to call
it
and i'm going to touch on that later
because it became very important to him
as well and it's i think it's important
that we understand what he was what he
was talking about
but this is what he means by our
changing scientific picture here he is
in a famous 1982 lecture at harvard
i've come to the conclusion that in
order to set our ideas about
architecture straight
and in order really
to establish a clear picture
of what we're doing when we build
it's necessary to make changes
in our
conception
of how the physical universe is put
together
that actually the order of space is
prior to the issue of function
that is in other words although
functional issues are overwhelmingly
important
the root matter
has to do with order in space
and that there are ways
of getting hold of that issue
which are so deep that they cover the
functional issues but they turn out to
be more fundamental and in fact they
have the ornamental stuff and the formal
stuff as by-products of them
but that structure by the way this
structure that i want to talk about is
not very obscure i mean i can easily put
a name on it i can call it wholeness if
you want
we can call it many things
and i'm going to show some examples of
physical things that have this a deep
kind of wholeness in them and then we'll
just talk a little bit about what sort
of structure they have
can we say anything about what these
structures are
can we be explicit about it at all
i
after thinking carefully about this for
a number of years
been able to identify somewhere around
about a dozen
something between a dozen of 15
different structural properties
that repeatedly exist
of course it remains to be discussed and
argued whether these deep structures are
important or not

do

so

when one discovers 12 15 properties of a
certain sort which are structural
properties that appear to characterize a
class of structures then you say to
yourself well what is going on what are
these properties
i mean where do they come from what's
the meaning of them
and quite simply
the conclusion that i've come to i don't
know if it's the right way to explain it
is that they are
essentially the different ways in which
space can be glued together
to become whole

if it's true that space has the capacity
to be more whole or less whole and there
are real structural properties that have
the capacity to glue it together more or
less
both in a functional sense and in a deep
sense
and then of course in some way one would
start to confront
a kind of moral imperative that that is
what we're supposed to be doing when we
make something
to glue space together like that
of course another very important
question that you ask is well how do you
produce something which has this unity
of space or this kind of wholeness or
this glued together quality
how do you actually go about making
something like that
so
that is of course the question that he
asked himself and he pursued in his own
work and in the work of the center uh
center for environmental design um that
uh center for environmental structure um
that
you know pursued a number of projects
and a number of modes of working uh
taking on that problem and that is
another whole subject for uh another
talk i suppose but um you can see the
the philosophical questions that he's
asking
how do we achieve the order that we see
all around us the beauty
nature
how does nature do it nature doesn't
make little blueprints instead it makes
something more like codes or recipes
that generate form that grow form and
these are complex forms that are
emergent from the process
and there are lessons for us that we can
learn from these processes and
incorporate them and of course we've
done so in the past and we still do do
do that today
but we in many ways it's suppressed and
it's it's
degraded by other processes that have
become if you will viral and are
preventing us from achieving what we
could be achieving
by the way i wanted to make a couple of
remarks one is that
that 1982 talk you can see that he was
really early in his thinking about
some of the ideas of the nature of order
he didn't actually publish the first
volume until
2003
21 years later
and
i also think it's interesting that the
the bach piece that you heard does
incorporate many of the 15 properties i
don't know if you notice that but you
know alternating repetition deep
interlock uh strong centers of the void
and so on and of course when you look at
any beautiful
structure
whether it's a natural structure or a
human structure a beautiful carpet or
building
it's going to incorporate a lot of those
properties and he's of course singling
out one dominant one for you to look at
in those images but i think that's a an
important lesson that these are often
combined in very rich ways and the
question of how we go about doing that
in our work is a big topic that remains
i think one that we all need to be
continuing to work on
so you saw some of the key ideas and i'm
just going to touch on them here again
to go over this idea of centers that
space is already a place where there are
latent centers and this is the structure
of the of the universe really that it's
even from the moment of the big bang it
began to create centers and sub-centers
and some centers breaking the symmetries
as
uh as it were and that you can
understand these centers and how they
are nested together but also how they
have overlaps overlapping relationships
that enrich the uh the complexity of the
structures and and make them more
beautiful and more useful um because
those are inseparable
sides of the same coin so these are
particular sets he says which appear
within the larger hole as distinct parts
and they can be separated out from their
surroundings but they're integrated into
their surroundings in in their actual
structure
and you can increase or decrease the
life of one structure according to the
position and intensity of other nearby
centers
and they become most intense when they
help each other in this kind of
reinforcing pattern so i'll give you an
example of that
of a human face you know we all
recognize the beauty of a human face
this is penelope cruz the actress uh
whose face as you can see as can be
understood as a system of centers the
parts of the eyebrow the iris the
eyelashes and many of these patterns
that we were just talking about
alternating repetition and strong
standards and so on um and that that of
course is the the structure that we
recognize as beautiful and also the
structure that is very functional where
we can see as human beings we can uh
move we can uh react to our environment
we can do all the complex things that we
do as organisms but if you begin to
strip those centers away notice what
happens it's quite disturbing you get
this sort of doll-like image it's very
dead looking uh
and quite frightening i think uh
a figure this this very mechanical uh uh
automaton-like structure as opposed to
what you have when all the sinners are
brought back into this this wholeness
this harmony uh and not only the eyes of
course but the nose the mouth uh the the
hair all the other parts of the human
body which is of course one of the
structures that we recognize uh most
easily as a beautiful structure a
structure with all of these all these
characteristics
and so the structure preserving
transformations are going on all the
time he later referred to them as
wholeness enhancing transformations
and gave this example of edgerton's
famous milk drop where uh harold
edgerton took a drop of milk and
shattered it in a plane of milk on a
sheet and instead of getting just a big
mess what resulted was a much more
complex structure more centers
more uh
details in fact the new centers within
with a series of geometric properties
and lo and behold there are many of the
same ones we were just talking about
levels of scale strong centers
boundaries alternating repetition and so
on these are spontaneously forming all
the time in the natural world and
they're spontaneously forming i think
through the hands of good craft people
as well when they recognize these these
properties and work with them in their
in their crafts and you can see this of
course in many human structures i had
shown this in earlier this image
of how these properties are being
created and transformed
and um how they exist in not only the
natural world but in uh in human
creations and they exist not as static
entities but as transformations uh
strengthening centers making positive
states changing levels of scale and so
on and gradually
growing and
articulating as we see in the natural
world and in the most beautiful
structures that we know these sort of
fractal relationships uh that we see
all around us
so um for let's see we have about
i want to
wrap up the talk and have time for some
discussion so i'm going to touch on this
this last topic which is in many ways
one of the most controversial um
where he talks about
about god or he talks about if you will
divinity or
the the divine nature of the cosmos and
i think we also need to recognize uh
what he's talking about there as
something that is not some
overarching
uh you know
deus ex machina or um
god spirit
but something that is structural in the
universe and is structural in relation
to us as human beings
as as beings that have a
sense of personhood
and that sense of personhood is not in a
dead universe it's in a in a universe
that has a primordial sense of
personhood and we can call that god if
we want to we can call that uh the gods
we can call it the spirit we can call it
the divine we can call it the totality
or the greater whole
etc etc but here's what chris had to say
about it
see it's very very difficult
to
deal with the nature of order
properly without talking about god
i i
i lectured on the nature of order for
years
wrote the books
most of that time i myself did not speak
about god i very
very very rarely so much as mentioned
that subject
in the lecture room
i think
there was a certain sense that it was
inappropriate
um
and i'm
embarking now
on a
view of the world
where
the question of what is the nature of
god can be discussed
thought about
considered
critically
one doesn't need to make
exaggerated statements about it
one doesn't need to
um
you know believe in visitations
from the virgin mary
one
does need
to consider
is the nature of wholeness
in the universe
and what are the conditions under which
wholeness grows
what is wholeness
and the answers to that straightforward
question
cannot be
given by
mechanistic
thought modes
the um
so the problem is i mean there is this
thing of how the greater whole works
and as i say um
i'm personally quite convinced
that it cannot be
subjected to
analysis by primitive mechanism
on the other hand i'm also convinced
that it can be
approached through rational
even mathematical
thought
it deals with real phenomena
and some
and as i say these phenomena gradually
um
what should i say they gradually sort of
go in transition
towards
touching such questions as the nature of
god
um
and and you may say well but what if god
doesn't exist what if this is all huha
well
the point is
that
there are are these phenomena
of wholeness which is the most important
of all of them
if you rule out
forms of explanation
even
observations of certain kind of
phenomena
and do not allow yourself
to tell
as far as you can the exact truth about
what is going on in these cases
um
but only allow those things to be said
which
which can be
handled in a mechanistic framework
at this point you're simply doing bad
science
i mean it's not you can't do
science has to do with knowing knowledge
and
um

so there's this huge gray area
and it's which which doesn't so much
have to do with spooks and poltergeists
it has to do with
very
fascinating things
about how the whole acts
and how
and and and at the moment
for instance there's been a
belief in the last decade or so
that you can understand how the whole
behaves
as a result of complex interactions
between
many many particles or in us
if you
want to view some complex system as a
cellular automaton that by
by
in effect programming the the way that
the different cells interact in that
cellular automaton one can hope to
realize
the behavior of something
in a holistic fashion
now there's a severe limitation on that
it is true that some apparently holistic
phenomena can be simulated like that and
can be reached like that
but there are other far greater issues
where
the whole is acting
where
at the moment there is absolutely no
possib no probability in sight of being
able to explain them
um
in that simple-minded way
and yet
if we're dealing
with such topics as
you were raising a little while ago
about
people's well-being
and and so forth
the wholeness
that
is
necessary
to to make a human being
deeply grounded
and
at one with the world around
that is not within the reach of
mechanistic explanations it but it is
not only a subtle but also a very
important problem
which needs to be tackled head on
by whatever means it takes
to come to terms with it
and in the nature of order going back to
that book for a moment
i laid some of the first steps
of a path that goes in that direction
and as i said i'm i'm now embarked on on
a series of new books about seven or
eight of them
which
which will try to complete the journey
and actually make clear how
all this necessarily fits together
wouldn't we like to see those seven or
eight books
unfortunately uh
one's a lifetime is not enough to do all
the things that chris was trying to do
um but i i want to close on this point
though that
i think chris was rather uh defensive in
some ways about
this question of
uh religion and
spirituality and and the divine um
in part because he himself was a
rigorous scientist and he came at it
from that point of view and his
colleagues in that from that point of
view were not particularly comfortable
with it
but
there are many other antecedents uh
including from whitehead
this idea of religion religio re-linking
ourselves to the to the universe the
vision of something that stands beyond
behind and within the passing flux of
immediate things so there is a a
honorable tradition
of
if you will pantheism or um
the theism of for example spinoza who um
certainly was somebody that albert
einstein read very closely and was very
serious about understanding
uh what spinoza was talking about in
terms of the the
order of the world you see in einstein's
thinking and in spinoza thinking that
this divinity this god or whatever you
want to call it
has to do with the structure of the
world and the harmony of the world the
lawful harmony the order of the world
so i think this is something that it
needs more
exploration and more application um and
um maybe understanding from a uh
ecumenical or a a
trans religious
uh trans secular understanding of you
know the metaphoric and the uh
mythological aspects that are very very
important to human culture and human
experience and yet need to be reconciled
with the understanding of the world from
a scientific point of view so this to me
looms large as a very very important uh
remaining project um and the idea that
what we refer to as god or the gods or
or the divine is simply this
mythological picture that we ourselves
are a part of the universe we're part of
the fabric of the universe that is alive
in some
deep sense that our life and our
personhood is not a preconception but
woven into the fabric of the cosmos that
we're part of this greater whole and
furthermore that we can understand it
structurally and we can use these
structural tools that alexander
described
nature alive as whitehead put it um
and uh
alfred north whitehead also said that
that we need to
fuse physical nature and life together
into the composition of really real
things whose interconnections and
individual characters constitute the
universe a very very important idea i
think uh life is a kind of structure
within space that's certainly an idea
that chris leaves us with as we see with
the genome
the structure of the molecules is what
gives rise to the organism to us uh the
proteome uh the structure of the protein
the connectome the structure of the
neurons in the brain that gives rise to
consciousness and even viruses are
behaving in a very sort of
life-like way although they don't have
any of the apparatus of life as we
understand it so they tell us that there
is a
life within the universe within the
structure of the universe within the
structure of space itself and i think
that is one of the most important ideas
of
in alexander's work
the idea that we can understand how
morphogenesis works how is he referred
to cellular automata uh the genome and
the proteome the ways that these
processes work and unfold structures
that are useful and structures that are
beautiful uh the astonishing variety the
astonishing beauty of the beauty of
traditional cultures when they embrace
these sort of unfolding processes these
crafts processes the processes of making
carpets the processes of recognizing
language as a generative
system uh that creates generative
possibilities through its logical
dynamic
this is something i don't think we have
right yet in linguistics or in in our um
our uh epistemology the the fact that
language is a real structure in the
world along with the other structures is
simply able to generate through its
gener generation of symmetries new
structures a symmetric structuralism uh
i would say a new a new structuralism a
new structuralist understanding
