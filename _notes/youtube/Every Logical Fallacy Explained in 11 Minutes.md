(00:30) tends to discredit the opponent's argument by attacking the opponent's own personal behavior and actions as being inconsistent with their argument therefore accusing hypocrisy instead of countering the actual argument slippery slope fallacy in a slippery slope argument a course of action is rejected because with little or no evidence one insists that it will lead to a chain reaction resulting in an undesirable end or ends special pleading fallacy special pleading happens when applying standards principles or rules to other people or
(00:59) circumstances es while making oneself or certain circumstances exempt from the same critical criteria without providing adequate justification loaded question a loaded question is a question that already contains an assumption false dilemma fallacy the false dilemma fallacy also called the black and white fallacy occurs when someone misrepresents an issue by offering only two options when more exist or by presenting the options as mutually exclusive when they are not stamman fallacy a stamman fallacy happens when
(01:29) one rebuts an argument by misconstruing it circular reasoning the circular reasoning fallacy is an argument that assumes the very thing it is trying to prove is true instead of offering evidence it simply repeats the conclusion rendering the argument logically incoherent appeal to Authority fallacy it is a form of argument in which the mere fact that an influential figure holds a certain position is used as evidence that the position itself is correct appeal to Nature fallacy it's an argument in which it is proposed that a
(01:57) thing is good because it is natural or bad because it is unnatural natural it's a fallacy because the unstated primary premise what is natural is good is typically irrelevant and an opinion instead of a fact composition fallacy it arises when one infers that something is true of the whole from the fact that it is true of some part of the whole division fallacy the division fallacy occurs when one reasons that something that is true for a whole must also be true for all or some of its parts affirming the consequent affirming the
(02:25) consequent is the fallacy of taking a true conditional statement such as if the lamp were broken then the room would be dark under certain assumptions like it is nighttime and the windows are closed and invalidly inferring its Converse the room is dark so the lamp must be broken anecdotal fallacy the anecdotal fallacy occurs when people use their limited personal experience to draw sweeping conclusions about a given topic appeal to emotion fallacy it's a technique characterized by the manipulation of the other person's
(02:52) emotions in order to win an argument especially in the absence of factual evidence burden of proof fallacy the burden of proof Li lies with the one who makes a claim not the one who denies it the burden of proof fallacy happens when a person tries to remove their need to provide proof for many reasons no true Scotsman fallacy it's an attempt to defend a generalization of a certain group by excluding any counter examples for not being pure enough Texas Sharpshooter fallacy the Texas Sharpshooter fallacy takes its name from
(03:20) the metaphor of a gunman shooting and then drawing targets Around The Bullet Hole clusters to make it look like he hit the target it illustrates how people first figure out what their conclusion is and then go looking for data that supports it ignoring differences and Randomness suppressed correlative the attempt to redefine one of two mutually exclusive options so that one alternative encompasses the other thus making one alternative impossible something like I need to know if we should stop for lunch or not you are
(03:46) either hungry or not hungry which is it if being hungry means being able to eat I am always hungry personal incredulity fallacy it's committed when the arguer presumes that whatever is true must be easy to understand or to imagine ambiguity fallacy it happens when an unclear phrase with multiple definitions is used within the argument therefore it does not support the conclusion genetic fallacy the genetic fallacy is the act of rejecting or accepting an argument solely on the basis of its origin rather than its content Middle Ground fallacy
(04:16) it's the fallacy that the truth is always in the middle of two opposites affirming a disjunct the affirming a disjunct fallacy occurs when given an either or scenario you wrongly assume that if one statement or outcome is true the other one cannot be true appeal to tradition it happens when we ignore the evidence that we should change because we have been doing something for a long time sunk cost fallacy the sunk cost fallacy is our tendency to continue with something we've invested money effort or time into
(04:44) even if the current costs outweigh the benefits appeal to ignorance it happens when someone asserts that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false or that a proposition is false because it has not yet been proven true Continuum fallacy it's the argument that two states are conditions cannot be considered distinct or do not exist at all because between them there exists a Continuum of States equivocation the equivocation fallacy refers to the use of an ambiguous word or phrase in more
(05:12) than one sense within the same argument faulty analogy a faulty analogy is saying that two things are alike in other ways just because they are alike in one way denying the antecedent denying the anteed infers the inverse from an original statement it's something like if you are a ski instructor then you have a job you are not a ski instructor therefore you have no job false cause a false cause fallacy occurs when someone incorrectly assumes that something causes something else without enough proof usually using just

(06:11) intended meaning context may be omitted intentionally or accidentally false equivalence it's a fallacy in which an equivalence is drawn between two subjects based on flawed or false reasoning historians fallacy the historian's fallacy occurs when one assumes that decision makers in the past viewed events from the same perspective and had the same information as those subsequently analyzing the decision inflation of conflict it's the error of exaggerating the amount of disagreement in a field in order to invalidate claims
(06:39) in that field incomplete comparison it's a misleading argument popular in advertising since the assertion is incomplete it cannot be refuted ludic fallacy it's a term used to describe how people mistake the kind of uncertainty found in games for the kind of uncertainty found in real life for example organized competitive fighting trains the athlete to focus on the game and in order not to dissipate his concentration to ignore the possibility of what is not specifically Allowed by the rules moralistic fallacy making
(07:07) statements about what is on the basis of claims about what ought to be in violation of fact value distinction Nirvana fallacy comparing a realistic solution with an idealized one and discounting or even dismissing the realistic solution as a result of comparing it to a perfect world or impossible standard proof by assertion it's a fallacy in which a proposition is repeatedly restated regardless of contradiction and reputation the proposition can sometimes be repeated until any challenges or opposition cease
(07:35) letting the proponent assert it as fact solely due to a lack of Challengers cherry-picking it's the act of pointing to individual cases or data that seem to confirm a particular position while ignoring a significant portion of related and similar cases or data that may contradict that position psychologists fallacy it's a fallacy that occurs when an observer assumes that his or her subjective experience reflects the true nature of an event reification fallacy it happens when an abstract concept is treated as if it
(08:04) were a concrete real event something like saying that Evolution selects which traits are passed on to Future Generations while evolution is not a conscious entity with Will retrospective determinism it's the thought that because something happened under some circumstances it was therefore bound to happen due to those circumstances thought terminating cliche it's a form of loaded language often passing as Folk wisdom with the function of stopping an argument from proceeding further ending the debate with a cliche rather than a
(08:30) point fallacy of the single cause it occurs when it is assumed that there is a single simple cause of an outcome when in reality it may have been caused by a number of small causes appeal to the stone it happens when a dismissal is made by stating or reiterating that the argument is absurd without providing further argumentation ignoro Eleni ignoro Eleni also called missing the point is the fallacy of presenting an argument that may or may not be logically valid and sound but whose conclusion fails to address the issue in
