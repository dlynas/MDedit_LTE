Transcript:
(00:01) Imagine yourself, but if you had made a slightly different choice at a key juncture in your life. Went to a different school, didn’t break up with that partner, didn’t quit that job or kept smoking. Would it really still be you, or would the radically different sequence of events, born to your alternate choices make you almost unrecognizable to yourself? This incredibly unerving questionis is asked , among others, in the brilliantly written hit series Severance.
(00:31) In it, the main characters go through a particular procedure which renders their work-self – who they are at work – completely severed from their home life self. You go in an elevator and boom, no idea what’s going on at home. You clock out – boom, you have no idea what just happened at work. But, and this is important – your work self, when you clock back in on the next day – remembers everything they had experienced on the previous work day.
(00:56) In a way – the first day you clocked in – the worker self – was born. \ The work environment – a satirical over-simplified version of an office, where their daily task is to press random buttons and chase weird symbols on the screen without knowing why – becomes their world. The only thing they have ever known.
(01:14) Their collegues – the only people they’ll ever meet. So, ok, great sci fi setting, work alienates blabla youtube essay number 67349. Is that what we’re covering here? No. Instead - let’s treat the show’s premise as a real experiment, ok not real, a thought experiment, and dive into a much more interesting dillema.
(01:34) One on human nature vs nurture – or better yet – how much would you change, would your world view change, would your moral compass and identity – change if you had two versions of yourself – cut between two systems, two environments, informed by two differing ideologies. Same person – two systems. The most famous, and arguably most insatiable cringe inducing argument that gets thrown at people who fantastize about a post-Capitalist world is “WHAT ABOUT HUMAN NATURE”.
(02:09) That simple question posits an even simpler view of human consciousness and decision making. It says man is flawed – through his greed, jelaousy an selfishness – and that as such, he would destroy and corrupt any system which doesn’t utilize those very flaws. The way capitalism, for example, does with greed, by throwing us in the gladiatorial arena, or to be more realistic a children’s sand box, of the free market – where the greediest win.
(02:37) The HUMAN NATUR brain kings that probably got that argument off reddit, who got it off 9gag who got it off 4chan who got it from mein kampf probably, see the current way we organize our economies and states, called Capitalism, as the final step of human evolution. They proceed to quote churchil saying “insert quote about churchil’s saying about being young and a communist and being old and a conservative” or use terms my 14 year old niece considers obsolete at this point like “the end of history” – inadvertetly
(03:14) positing that this mega mall of a civilizational blip on our long history is supposed to be… our peak. Their lack of vision would make -ray charles call them blind. It would be absolutely fair to discuss and debate human nature, as it was, thousands of years ago, as we were first crawling up on two legs.
(03:31) A human nature informed almost exclusively by what our genetics, our bodies, hormones and brains told us to do. Many fine thinkers from John Locke to Hobbes and all the way to the most contemporary of philosophers obsessed with this question. But to discuss human nature by analysing the modern human is so brashly unscientific it would rival flat (find better joke) earth theory.
(03:52) Why? Because experiments conducted in an uncontrolled environment aren’t experiments – they’re guesswork. The modern human psiche is informed by thousands if not millions of internal and external factors which inform their sense of identity, normalcy, and for the lack of a better word – nature. In a way there is nothing natural about humans, as they are today, and there hasn’t been from the moment we altered our behavioural patterns to those of animals.
(04:16) Put as simply as possible – we live in a society (drop a joke meme about joke with some crazy tunes playing). But no, seriously, the idea that we can extract what is a “natual instinct” and what is a “consequence of our environment” in modern society would be like looking for a needle in a planet sized haystack.
(04:32) Are you greedy because there’s something rotten at your core, or because the modern sense of acomplishment is tied to the pursuit of wealth? Are you jelaous because it’s coded in us to be, or have thousands of hours of consumed content taught you that there’s tons of people out there whose lifestyle you’ll never achieve? Are you biggoted because it’s natural to fight for your own in-group, or are you just brainwashed by divisive hateful idology? Not knowing the exact answer to those questions is exactly the point.
(04:59) No matter how many hypotheses exist on the tabula rasa, clean slate, pre character creation screen, versions of ourselves they’ll likely remain just that – hypotheses. But ok, you don’t have to trust my word for it. Let’s actually look into quote OOO Real Science TM. THE TWINS Over the last few decades many social experiments were conducted on twins separated at birth, or at least at an incredibly young age.
(05:31) Scientists wanted to determine hundreds of different environmental influences on individuals /w extremely similar genetics. If you raise the same kid in two spots – how much do they differ? Basically to answer the age old question of IF LIFE QUALITY = GENETICS X ENVIRONMENT, how big is one vs the other. The answers, might be a bit more complicated than what we’d expect, but I wouldn’t call them surprising.
(05:57) To quote Segal, an expert on the topic - “Twin studies are a simple, very elegant design,”. Holding the genetics constant allows researchers to study the age-old question of nature versus nurture—what aspects of a person come from their DNA, and which come from their environment? There was a time when scientists tended to think one or the other factor was more important to development, but they have since come to realize how limiting it is to confine our understanding of behavior, health, and identity to this either-or dichotomy.
(06:29) “Nature and nurture work in concert,” Segal says, “affecting every measurable human trait.” In one study, where two sisters, separated at birth between the UK and the US the results were rather self explanatury. When it comes General Inteligence: The twins’ IQ scores of 93 (US) and 82 (UK) were in the average and low average ranges, respectively, yet very different.
(06:54) Overall, the twins’ differences were more frequent than their similarities. Differences were most apparent in general intelligence, Stroop completion times, ideational fluency, psychomotor completion times and medical health. Similarities included mental status, job satisfaction and social support. The personality data yielded mixed findings.
(07:14) The twins approached their relationship with one another from different perspectives, but were pleased to have met. In general, behavioral and physical differences between the twins appear linked to genetic factors and to UK's childhood illness. The way they ended up living their lifes – was arguably radically different.
(07:37) In another case, from 1979, Jim Springer and Jim Lewis, “the Jim twins,” were reunited at age 39 after not knowing the other existed. As described in Segal’s book on the identical Jim twins, Born Together—Reared Apart, both had been adopted and raised by different families in Ohio, just 40 miles apart from each other.
(07:58) Despite their separate upbringings, it turned out that both twins got terrible migraines, bit their nails, smoked Salem cigarettes, drove light blue Chevrolets, did poorly in spelling and math, and had worked at McDonald’s and as part-time deputy sheriffs. But the weirdest part was that one of the Jim twins had named his first son James Alan.
(08:28) The other had named his first son James Allan. Both had named their pet dogs “Toy.” Both had also married women named Linda—then they got divorced, and both married women named Betty. Now, this might sound rather sensationalist – because it is. Even them, two men with the same genetic code, living in a relatively similar environment and having gone through incredibly similar life events had their differences.
(08:59) For starters, one divorced Betty and married a woman named Sandy, which, as Segal jokes, must have caused worry for the other still-married Betty. It gets even more complicated. The reasons why identical twins have differences at all—not just in life outcomes, but temperament, taste, and physical traits—can come down to random chance.
(09:22) But it can also be traced to how each sibling’s (identical) genes are expressed. Basically just having some genes doesn’t mean they’ll influence your life. These microscopic variations in lifestyle can lead to radical differences in a person’s health, personality, and even appearance. The study of how this works is known as epigenetics.
(09:48) For example, one can be influenced by lifestyle and diet. Researchers are also looking at epigenetics to explain exactly why some twins start out with the same characteristics but dramatically diverge as they age; and perhaps why one twin might suffer from an illness while the other is not affected. In a study published in the the National Academy of Sciences, d 80 pairs of identical twins ranging in age from 3 to 74 were studied.
(10:16) They discovered that 35 percent of twins revealed a difference in genes. The study suggests that genes are regulated by epigenetics, and that as twins aged their DNA also changed. Their life basically started modifying their genetic code. That is absollutely wild. Researchers believe that external factors could dramatically change certain expression of genes by causing them to become irregular.
(10:50) While the epigenetic debate of what makes us who we are is still undecided, researchers lean to the idea that all external and internal influences encourage and affect our behavior. And, because of twins, science is taking closer steps in uncovering the truth of human behavior. “No longer is it nature vs. nurture, but nature via nurture,” writes Dr.
(11:17) Matt Ridley in “The Agile Gene: How Nature Turns on Nurture.” “You will have to enter a world were your genes are not puppet master pulling the strings of your behavior but puppets at the mercy of your behavior; a world where instinct is not the opposite of learning, where environmental influences are sometimes less reversible than genetic ones, and where nature is designed for nurture.
(11:49) ” Basically – in normal people language – while using separated, and non separated twins in a search for answering weather Environment or Genetics influence someone’s outcome – financial, health, what we believe – we found out far more about ourselves. While the set of traits we are born with does help set us out on one path or another, while it may influence some of our preferences and traits – the moment we leave our parents’ womb, the moment we start interracting with the outside environment – our genes, our
(12:24) nature, begins to alter and adapt – building up unique individuals who transform the world, while the world, in a very literal and philosophical sense – transforms them. So next time someone says humans are wired to behave a particular way – and use that as a reason as to why the world can’t change – remind them that the world changing would change how we’re wired.
(12:53) Two generations two peoples Did you know that millennials are the least wealthy generation, despite the fact that they currently represent the largest group in the workforce? Business Insider reports that boomers are 10 times wealthier than millennials. The term generational wealth gap describes the difference between the amount of wealth accumulated within one generation, relative to the wealth accumulated within another generation.
(13:26) By wealth we mean savings, investments, and other forms of assets, including real estate. Productivity has literally never been higher yet the buying power of younger workers is nowhere even near to that of Boomers or even Gen X-ers. This sort of rhetoric is usually used as a tool to inspire division amongst generations – implying the boomers owe us something or that millenials are waiting around for a handout.
(13:51) This is baby logic, and saying goo goo gaa gaa would make more sense. The main difference, talking about the western hemisphere here, between generations, between one decade or another, is the economic environment in which those people exist. Economic downturns, global conflicts or internal strife lead to greater toxicity in the market and therefore inhibit people’s ability to save and prosper.
(14:15) Sure that’s true, but these problems are constantly pitched to us as temporary, and yet they are arguably the greatest constant of this system. Put the words Capitalism and stability together and what you’d get is a joke because that doesn’t exist. The continuous unavoidable deterioration of the system due to it’s lack of favorability to the majority, through greater wealth concentration in a tiny minority is no longer able to sufficiently explain it’s own reason for existance to the masses.
(14:45) It has, in quite a literal sense, created radically different environments and thereofre radically different outcomes for the same peoples, In the same lands, with the same cultures and rather similar ideologies. There is no greater proof of the impact of our environments on our social and financial performance throughout our lives – than that of the generational wealth gap.
(15:07) Our parents married earlier, had families earler, bought their houses earlier, and acrued a hilariously lower amount of debt than we do. Why? Because marriage cost less, having a kid cost less, houses cost 30 bloody billion times less. Billy Junior unavoidably has quite a bit of Billy Seniors’s nature in him.
(15:27) But that never did, nor does it now, mean he’ll end up achieving what senior did before him. The Environment breeds success, and therefore the environment must be altered to allow for success. And yes, some do make It even in the harshest places, but this exception to the rule, in it’s infinitely tiny proportion, is the proof of the definition.
(15:50) The passing of time has altered what we define as normal human behaviour. What we define as ethical and moral. What is defined as human nature. Claiming human nature can’t change and yet being vastly different to your parents – is some true true clown shit. Conclusion Now, let’s bring back the alegorry with the characters from Severance we mentioned in the beginning.
(16:24) Same people, totally different environments =equals= significantly different people. Sure character a,b,c and d are different genders, ages, ethnicities, come from different parents, and that, to an extent does slightly influence them and their behaviour, call that their human nature, their inherent drives, but it’s the environment, and people in said environment that end up actually molding them into totally unique people as contrasted to their out-of-work selves.
(16:47) We touched on how our genetics react to the environment. We touched on how the functionality of the environment influences our financial outcomes, but, we left the most important aspect for last. What we spend the majority of our waking hours doing – work – and how work, just like in good old severance – can completely change our sense of self, normalcy, and drive.
(17:11) And who better to talk about work – than Marx, to quote: A spider conducts operations that resemble those of a weaver, and a bee puts to shame many an architect in the construction of her cells. But what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is this, that the architect raises his structure in imagination before he erects it in reality.
(17:34) At the end of every labour-process, we get a result that already existed in the imagination of the labourer at its commencement. He not only effects a change of form in the material on which he works, but he also realises a purpose of his own that gives the law to his modus operandi, and to which he must subordinate his will.
(17:55) And this subordination is no mere momentary act.(23) Only because of that is his activity free activity. Estranged labour reverses the relationship so that man, just because he is a conscious being, makes his life activity, his essential being, a mere means for his existence.(21) In rather crude normal people terms he posits an incredible observation – that man, when it comes to his labour, his work, is different to animals because of why and how he performs it.
(18:25) He can only remain true to his nature when he is allowed to express that labour by choice, and not out of alienated necessity, like an animal To quote: In fact, the realm of freedom actually begins only where labor which is determined by necessity and mundane considerations ceases; thus in the very nature of things it lies beyond the sphere of actual material production.
(18:49) Just as the savage must wrestle with Nature to satisfy his wants, to maintain and reproduce life, so must civilized man, and he must do so in all social formations and under all possible modes of production. In a funny twist of irony – the system which we presumably cannot change because of our nature – is a system which drives us furthest away from said nature.
(19:13) When labour feels purposless, because we are one in a billion cogs of a machine of unimaginable scale. When labour feels stolen – because we get cents on the dollar for what we create. When the world our parents praise no longer welcomes us – it doesn’t matter even if we disregard what the economists, geneticists or philosophers from this video think about Human Nature – because we, just like an animal struggling in it’s current environment – must either evolve or lay down in a grave of our own making.
(19:44) Human nature as an excuse for inaction is not only unscientific – but also pathetic.
