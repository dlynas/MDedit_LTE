Transcript:
(00:01) where we get our values from I do not understand our values by the way speaking of American values aren't we about doe to start bombing some small country that only has a marginally effective Air Force seems to me like we're weeks overdue to drop High explosives on helpless civilians people who have no argument with us whatsoever I think we ought to be out there doing what we do best gang making large holes in other people's countries I hate to be repetitious but we are a warlike lot we can't stand it not to be
(00:30) with somebody we couldn't wait for that cold war to be over could we couldn't wait for the Cold War to be over so we can go and play with our toys in the sand go and play with our toys in the sand and when we're not invading some Sovereign Nation or setting it on fire from the air which is more fun for our Nintendo Pilots then then we're usually declaring war on something here at home did you ever notice that about us we love to declare war on things here in America anything we don't like about
(00:57) ourselves we declare war on it we don't do anything about it we just declare war on it it's the only metaphor the only metaphor we have in our public discourse for solving problems declaring war we have to declare a war on everything we have a war on crime the war on poverty the war on litter the war on cancer the War on Drugs but you ever notice we got no war on homelessness no war in homelessness you know why there's no money in that problem no money to be made off of the homeless if you could
(01:24) find a solution if you could find a solution to homelessness where the corporate swine and the politicians could steal a couple of million dollars each you see the streets of America begin to clear up pretty goddamn quick I'll guarantee you that I will guarantee you that I got an idea about homelessness know what they ought to do change the name of it change the name of it it's not homelessness it's houselessness it's houses these people need a home is an abstract idea a home is a setting it's a
(01:57) state of mind these people need houses physical tangible structures they need lowcost housing but where you going to put it well that's fine but where you going to put it where you going to put it nobody wants you to build lowcost housing near their house people don't want it near them we got something in this country you've heard of it's called nimi n MB not in my backyard people don't want anything any kind of social help located anywhere near them you try to open up a halfway house try to open up a drug rehab or an
(02:26) alcohol rehab center try to do a homeless shelter somewhere try to open up a little home for some people who want to work their way into the community people say not in my backyard people don't want anything near them especially if it might help somebody else part of that great American Spirit of generosity we hear about great generous American Spirit you can ask an Indian about that ask an Indian about if you can find one you got to locate an Indian first we've made them just a little difficult to find or
(02:57) if you need current data select a black family at random and ask them how generous America has been to them people don't want anything near them even if it's something they believe in something they think Society needs like prisons everybody wants more prisons right everybody wants more prisons people say build more prisons but not here but why not what's wrong what's the problem what's wrong with having a prison in your neighborhood seem to me like I would make it a pretty crime-free area don't you think you think a lot of
(03:25) crackheads and pimps and hookers and thieves are going to be hanging around in front of a prison they ain't coming anywhere near it what's wrong with these people all the criminals are locked up behind the walls and if a couple of them do break out what do you think they're going to do hang around check real estate Trends they're gone that's the whole idea of breaking out of prison is to get the as far away as you possibly can not in my backyard people don't want anything near
(03:55) them except military bases they don't mind that do they they like give him an army base give him a navy base makes him happy why jobs jobs self-interest even if the base is loaded with nuclear weapons they don't give a they say well I'll take a little radiation if I can get a job working people have been over so long in this country those are the kind of decisions they're left to make I've got just a place for lowcost housing I have solved this problem I know where we can build
(04:24) housing for the homeless golf courses perfect go courses just what we need just what we need plenty of good land in nice neighborhoods land that is currently being wasted on a meaningless mindless activity engaged in engaged in primarily by white well-to-do male businessmen who use the game to get together to make deals to carve this country up a little finer among themselves I am getting tired really getting tired of these golfing in their green pants and their yellow pants and their orange pants and their precious little hats and
(05:12) their cute little golf carts it is time to reclaim the golf courses from the wealthy and turn them over to the homeless golf is an arrogant elitist game and it takes up entirely too much room in this country too much room in this country it is an arrogant game on its very design alone just the design of the game speaks of arrogance think of how big a golf course is the ball is that big what do these pinheaded Pricks need with all that land there are over 177,000 golf courses in America they average from 150 to 200 Acres a piece
(05:55) that's 3 million plus acres 4,820 sare miles you could build two Road islands and the Delaware for the homeless on the land currently being wasted on this meaningless mindless arrogant elitist racist there's another thing the only blacks you'll find in country clubs are carrying trays and a boring game boring game for boring people you ever watch golf on television it's like watching flies and a Mindless game mindless think of the intellect it must take to draw pleasure from this activity hitting a
(06:29) ball with a crooked stick and then walking after it and then hitting it again I say pick it up you're lucky you found the thing put it in your pocket and go the home you're a winner you're a winner you found it no never happened no no chance of that happening Doro in the Plaid knickers is going to hit it again and walk some more let these rich suckers play Miniature Golf let them with a windmill for an hour and a half or so see if there's really any skill among these people now
(07:12) I know there are some people who play golf who don't consider themselves Rich them and shame on them for engaging in an arrogant elitist Pastime hey here's another place we could put some lowcost housing cemeteries there's another idea whose time has passed saving all the dead people for one part of town what the hell kind of a medieval superstitious religious idea is that plow these up plow them into the streams and rivers of America we need that phosphorus for farming if we're going to recycle Let's
(07:49) Get Serious thank you thank you I appreciate it I'd like to talk a little bit about the war in the Persian Gulf B doings in the Persian Gulf you know my favorite part of that war it's the first war we ever had that was on every channel plus cable and the war got good ratings too didn't it got good ratings well we like War we like War we're a warlike people we like War because we're good at it you know why we're good at it cuz we get a lot of practice this country is only 200 years old and
(08:33) already we've had 10 major Wars we average a major war every 20 years in this country so we're good at it and it's a good thing we are we're not very good at anything else anymore huh can't build a decent car can't make a TV set or a VCR worth the got no steel industry left can't educate our young people can't get health care to our old people but we can bomb the out of your country all right huh we can bomb the out of your country all right especially if your country is full
(09:09) of brown people oh we like that don't we that's our hobby that's our new job in the world bombing brown people Iraq Panama Grenada Libya you got some brown people in your country tell them to watch the out or we'll goddamn bomb them when's the last white people you can remember that we bombed can you remember the last white can you remember any white people we've ever bombed the Germans those are the only ones and that's only because they were trying to cut in on our action they wanted to dominate the world
(09:44) that's our job that's our *Applause* job now we only bomb brown people not because trying to cut in on our action just because they're brown now you probably noticed I don't feel about that war the way we were told we were supposed to feel about that war the way we were ordered and instructed by the United States government to feel about that war you see I tell you my mind doesn't work that way I got this real thing I do it's called thinking and I'm not a very good
(10:27) American because I like to form my own opinion opinions I don't just roll over when I'm told to sad to say most Americans just roll over on command not me I have certain rules I live by my first rule I don't believe anything the government tells me nothing zero NOP and I don't take very seriously the media or the press in this country who in the case of the Persian Gulf War were nothing more than unpaid employees of the Department of Defense and who most of the time most of the time function is
(11:07) kind of an unofficial public relations Agency for the United States government so I don't listen to them I don't really believe in my country and I got to tell you folks I don't get all choked up about yellow ribbons and American flags I consider them I consider them to be symbols and I leave symbols to the symbol minded me I look at War War a little bit differently to me war is a lot of prick waving okay simple thing that's all it is war is a whole lot of men standing out in a field waving their Pricks at
(11:39) one another men are insecure about the size of their dicks and so they have to kill one another over the idea that's what all that jock is all about that's what all that adolescent Macho male posturing and strutting in bars and locker rooms is all about it's called Dick fear men are terrified that their Pricks are inadequate and so they have to compete with one another to feel better about themselves and since war is the ultimate competition basically men are killing each other in order to improve
(12:17) their self-esteem you don't have to be a historian or a political scientist to see the bigger dick foreign policy Theory at work it sounds like this what they have bigger dicks bomb them and of course the bombs and the rockets and the bullets are all shaped like dicks it's a subconscious need to project the penis into other people's Affairs it's called with people so as far as I'm concerned that whole thing in the Persian Gulf was nothing more than a big prick waving dick fight in this particular case Saddam Hussein had
(13:09) questioned the size of George Bush's Dick and George Bush had been called a wimp for so long wimp rhymes with limp George has been called a wimp for so long that he has to act out his manhood fantasies by sending other people's children to die even the name bush even the name bush is related to the genitals without being the genitals a bush is a sort of passive secondary sex characteristic now if this man's name had been George boner well he might have felt a little bit better about himself and we wouldn't
(13:50) had any trouble over there in the first place this whole country has a manhood problem big manhood problem in the USA you can tell from the language we use Lang always gives you way what did we do wrong in Vietnam we pulled out ah not a very manly thing to do is it when you're people you got to stay in there and them good them all the way them till the end them to death them to death them to death stay in there and keep them until they're all dead we left a few women and children
(14:28) alive in Vietnam and we haven't felt good about ourselves since that's why in the Persian Gulf George Bush had to say this will not be another Vietnam he actually used these words he said this time we're going all the way imagine an American president using the sexual slang of a 13-year-old to describe his foreign policy if you want to know what happened in the Persian Gulf just remember the names of the two men who were running that war Dick Cheney and colon Powell somebody got in the *Music*
(15:10) ass thank you thank you thank you very now something a little more positive for you don't want you to think the whole show is just negativity this is about a festival this is my idea for one of those big outdoor summer festivals this is called slugfest and this is for men only here's what you do you get about a h 100,000 of these men you know the ones I mean these Macho yeah these strutting pining posturing hairy sweaty alpha male Jack offs the muscle you take about a 100,000 of these disgusting
(15:51) Pricks you throw them in a big dirt Arena big 25 acre dirt Arena and you just let them beat the out of each other for 24 hours non-stop no food no water just whiskey and PCP and you just let him punch and pound and kick the out of each other until only one guy is left standing then you take that guy and you put him on a pedestal and you shoot him in the head yeah yeah then you put the whole thing on TV Budweiser would jump at that in half a minute and guys would volunteer guys would line up all you got to do is
(16:31) promise them a small appliance of some kind men will do anything just give them something that plugs in the wall makes a woring noise and here's another male cliche these guys who cut the sleeves off of their t-shirts so the rest of us can have an even more compelling experience of smelling their armpits I say hey Bruno shut it down would you please you smell like an anchovy's okay bad not good not good not good Bruno not and definitely not for sharing okay this the same kind of guy that has that barbed
(17:14) wire tattoo that goes all the way around the bicep you seen that I yeah that's just what I need some guy who hasn't been laid since the bicentennial wants me to think he's a bad because he's got a picture oh haha a painting of some barbed wire on his eyes hey Junior come around when you have the real thing on there i' squeeze that on good and tight for you okay no kidding no kidding this the same kind of guy if you smashed him in the face eight or nine times with a big chunk of concrete and then beat
(17:46) him over the head with a steel rod for an hour and a half you know what he dropped like a rock Like a Rock here's another guy thing that sucks these t-shirts that say Le follower get out of the way you ever see that this is more of that stupid Marine Corps obsolete male impulses from a 100,000 years ago lead follower get out of the way you know what I do when I see that shirt I obstruct I stand right in the guy's path force him to walk around he gets a little past me I spin him around kick
(18:20) him on the nuts rip off the shirt wipe it on my ass and shove it down as throat that's what I do when I see that shirt yeah Hey listen that's all these marines are looking for a good time and speaking of tough guys I'm getting a little tired of hearing that after six policemen get arrested for shoving a floor lamp up some black guy's ass and ripping his intestines out the police department announces they're going to have sensitivity training I say hey if you need special training to be told not to jam a large
(18:55) cumbersome object up someone else's maybe you're too up to be on the police force in the first place huh maybe maybe not maybe not I don't know listen yeah that's right you know what they ought to do they ought to have two new requirements for being on the police intelligence and decency you never can tell it might just work it certainly hasn't been tried yet no one should ever have any object placed inside their that is larger than a fist and less loving than a dildo okay
(19:33) now now this next thing is about our president this about our President Bill Jeff Bill Jeff Bill Jeff Clinton I don't call him Clinton I call him Clinton CIT TI n apostrophe hey old Bill he loved JFK didn't he that's his hero John Fitzgerald Kennedy always wanted to be like JFK well JFK Administration was called Camelot although it really should have been called Camelot cuz that's what he did he came a lot so Clinton's looking for a legacy that's what he should call well maybe come a little would be better for him
(20:12) cuz he came a little you know little on the dress little on the desk not a whole lot really hey he was no match for Kennedy in the Department Kennedy aimed High Marilyn Monroe Clinton showed his dick to a government clerk there's a drop off here there's a drop off all right now listen I got a few more items of things that are pissing me off and this one comes in the form of a question haven't we had about enough of this cigar smoking in this country huh huh Jesus W when is this going to end when is this

(24:53) by now all businessmen completely full of just the worst kind of low criminal suckers you could ever want to run into a piece of business man and the proof of it is the proof of it is they don't even trust each other they don't trust one another when a businessman sits down to negotiate a deal the first thing he does is to automatically assume that the other guy is a complete lying prick who's trying to him out of his money so he's got to do everything he can to the other guy a little bit
(25:21) faster and a little bit harder and he's got to do it with a big smile on his face you know that big businessman smile and if you're a customer whoa that's when you get the really big smile customer always gets that really big smile as the businessman carefully positions himself directly behind the customer and unzips his pants and proceeds to service the account I'm servicing this account this customer needs service now you know what they mean now you know what they mean when they say please specialize in customer
(26:02) service whoever coined the phrase Let the buyer beware was probably bleeding from the but that's business that's business why is it that most of the people who are against abortion are people you wouldn't want to in the first place h boy these conservatives are really something aren't they they're all in favor of The Unborn they will do anything for The Unborn but once you're born you're on your *Music* own prolife conservatives are obsessed with the fetus from conception to 9
(26:50) months after that they don't want to know about you they don't want to hear from you no nothing no neonatal care no daycare no Head Start no school lunch no food Stamps no welfare no nothing if you're pre-born you're fine if you're prechool you're you're conservatives don't give a about you until you reach military age then they think you are just fine just what they've been looking for conservatives want live babies so they can raise them to be dead soldiers Pro life prol life These people
(27:32) aren't pro-life they're killing doctors what kind of pro- lifee is that what they'll do anything they can to save a fetus but if it grows up to be a doctor they just might have to kill it they're not pro life you know what they are they're anti-woman simple as it gets anti-woman they don't like them they don't like women they believe a woman's primary role is to function as a broodmare for the state prolife you don't see many of these white anti-abortion women volunteering to have any black fetuses
(28:07) transplanted into their uteruses do you no you don't see them adopting a whole lot of crack babies do you no that might be something Christ would do and you won't see you won't see a lot of these pro-life people dousing themselves in kerosene and lighting themselves on fire you know morally committed relig religious people in South Vietnam knew how to Stage a goddamn demonstration didn't they huh hey they knew how to put on a protest light yourself on fire come on you moral Crusaders let's
(28:47) see a little smoke to match that fire in your belly here's another question I have how come when it's us it's an abortion and when it's a chicken it's an omelet *Applause* wait wait are we so much better than chickens all of a sudden when did this happen that we pass chickens in goodness name six ways we're better than chickens see nobody can do it you know why cuz chickens are decent people you don't see chickens hanging around in drug gangs do you H you don't see a chicken strapping some guy to a
(29:37) chair and hooking up his nuts to a car battery do you when's the last chicken you heard about came home from work and beat the out of his hand huh doesn't happen cuz chickens are decent people but let's get back to this abortion now is a fetus a human human being this seems to be the central question well if a fetus is a human being how come the census doesn't count them if a fetus is a human being how come when there's a miscarriage they don't have a funeral if the fetus is a
(30:10) human being how come people say we have two children and one on the way instead of saying we have three children people say life begins a conception I say life began about a billion years ago and it's a continuous process continuous just keeps rolling along rolling rolling rolling along I said you know something listen you can go back further than that what about the carbon atoms huh human life could not exist without carbon so is it just possible that maybe we shouldn't be burning all this coal just looking for a little
(30:48) consistency here in these anti-abortion arguments see the really hardcore people will tell you life begins at fertilization fertilization when the sperm fertilizes the egg which is usually a few moments after the man says gee honey I was going to pull out but the phone rang and it startled *Applause* me fertilization but even after the egg is fertilized it's still six or seven days before it reaches the uterus and pregnancy begins and not every egg makes it that far 80% of a woman's fertilized eggs are rinsed and flushed out of her
(31:25) body once a month during those delightful few days she has they wind up on sanitary napkins and yet they are fertilized eggs so basically what these anti-abortion people are telling us is that any woman who's had more than one period is a serial killer consistency consistency hey hey if they really want to get serious what about all the sperm that are wasted when the state executes a condemned man in one of these pro-life guys who's watching in his pants huh here's a guy standing over there with
(32:00) his jockey shorts full of Little Vinnies and Debbies and nobody saying a word to that guy not every ejaculation deserves a name now speaking of consistency Catholics which I was until I reached the Age of Reason Catholics Catholics and other Christians are against abortions and they're against homosexuals well who has less abortions and homosexuals leave these people alone for Christ sakes there is an entire class of people guaranteed never to have an abortion and the Catholics and Christians you're just tossing them a
(32:51) sign you'd think they'd make natural allies go look for consistency in religion and speaking to my friends the Catholics when John Cardinal ' Conor of New York and some of these other Cardinals and Bishops have experienced their first pregnancies and their first labor pains and they've raised a couple of children on minimum wage then I'll be glad to hear what they have to say about abortion I'm sure it'll be interesting en lightening too but but in the meantime what they ought to be doing is telling these priests who
(33:27) took a vow of Chastity to keep their hands off the Altar Boys Keep Your Hands to Yourself father you know when Jesus said suffer the little children come unto me that's not what he was talking about so you know what I tell these anti-abortion people I say hey hey if you think a fetus is more important than a woman try getting a fetus to wash the stains out of your under it for no pay and no pension I tell them think of an abortion is term limits that's all it is biological term limits but you know the
(34:11) longer you listen to this abortion debate the more you hear this phrase sanctity of Life you've heard that sanctity of life you believe in it personally I think it's a bunch of well I mean life is sacred who said so God hey if you read history you realize that God God is one of the leading causes of death has been for thousands of years Hindus Muslims Jews Christians all taking turns killing each other cuz God told them it was a good idea the sword of God the blood of the Lamb vengeance is mine millions of dead
(34:47) millions of dead all because they gave the wrong answer to the god question you believe in God no dead you believe in God yes you believe in my God no dead my God has a bigger dick than your God thousands of years thousands of years and all the best Wars too the bloodiest most brutal wars fought all based on religious hatred which is fine with me hey anytime a bunch of holy people want to kill each other I'm a happy guy but don't be giving me all this about the sanctity of life I mean even
(35:31) if there were such a thing I don't think it's something you can blame on God now you know where the sanctity of Life came from we made it up you know why cuz we're alive self-interest living people have a strong interest in promoting the idea that somehow life is sacred you don't see Abbott and costell running around talking about this do you we're not hearing a whole lot from musolini on the subject what's the latest from JFK not a goddamn thing cuz JFK molini and abberton Costello are 
(36:03) dead they're dead and dead people give less than a about the sanctity of Life only living people care about it so the whole thing grows out of a completely biased point of view it's a self-serving man-made story it's one of these things we tell ourselves so we'll feel Noble life is sacred makes you feel Noble but let me ask you this if everything that ever lived is dead and everything alive is going to die where does the sacred part come in I'm having trouble with that cuz
(36:36) I mean even with this stuff we preach about the sanctity of life we don't practice it we don't practice it look at what we kill mosquitoes and flies cuz they're pests lions and tigers cuz it's fun chickens and pigs cuz we're hungry pheasants and quailes cuz it's fun and we're hungry and people we kill people cuz they're pests and it's *Applause* fun and you might have noticed something else the sanctity of life doesn't seem to apply to cancer cells does it you rarely see a bumper sticker that says
(37:21) save the tumors or I break for advanced melanoma now ah viruses mold mildew maggots fungus weeds eoli bacteria the crabs nothing sacred about those things so at best the sanctity of life is kind of a selective thing we get to choose which forms of life we feel are sacred and we get to kill the rest pretty neat deal huh you know how we got it we made the whole thing up made it up the same way thank you the same way we made up the death penalty we made them both up sanctity of life and the death penalty aren't we
(38:09) versatile and you know in this country now there are a lot of people who want to expand the death penalty to include drug dealers this is really stupid drug dealers aren't afraid to die they're already killing each other every day on the streets by the hundreds drive-bys gang shootings they're not afraid to die death penalty doesn't mean anything unless you use it on people who are afraid to die like the bankers who launder the drug money the bankers who launder the drug money forget the dealers you want to
(38:45) slow down that drug traffic you got to start executing a few of these Bankers white middle class Republican bankers and I'm not talking about soft American executions like lethal injection I'm talking about crucifixion folks let's bring back crucifixions a form of capital punishment that Christians and Jews of America can really appreciate here's one more item for you the last in our Civics book rights boy everyone in this country is always running around yammering about their rights I have a right you have
(39:20) no right we have a right they don't have a right folks I hate to spoil your fun but there's no such thing as rights okay they're imaginary we made them up like the boogeyman The Three Little Pigs Pinocchio Mother Goose like that rights are an idea they're just imaginary they're cute idea cute but that's all cute and fictional but if you think you do have rights let me ask you this where do they come from people say well they come from God they're god-given rights oh here we go
(39:47) again here we go again the god excuse the last Refuge of a man with no answers and no argument it came from God anything we can't describe must have come from God personally folks I believe that if your rights came from God he would have given you the right to some food every day and he would have given you the right to a roof over your head God would have been looking out for you God would have been looking out for you you know that he wouldn't have been worried about making sure you have a gun so you can
(40:18) get drunk on Sunday night and kill your girlfriend's parents but let's say it's true let's say God gave us these rights why would he give us a certain number of rights the Bill of Rights in this country has 10 stipulations okay 10 rights and apparently God was doing sloppy work that week because we've had to amend the Bill of Rights an additional 17 times so God forgot a couple of things like slavery just slipped his mind but let's say let's say God gave us the original 10 he gave the British 13
(40:55) the British Bill of Rights has 13 stipulations the Germans have 29 the belgians have 25 the Swedish have only six and some people in the world have no rights at all what kind of a goddamn god-given deal is that no rights at all why would God give different people in different countries different numbers of different rights boredom Amusement bad arithmetic do we find out at long last after all this time that God is weak in math skills doesn't sound like Divine planning to me sounds more like human planning sounds more like one group
(41:36) trying to control another group in other words business as usual in America now if you think you do have rights one last assignment for you next time you're at the computer get on the internet go to Wikipedia when you get to Wikipedia in the search field for Wikipedia I want you to type in Japanese Americans 1942 and you'll find out all about your pre his rights okay all right you know about it you know about it yeah in 1942 there were 110,000 Japanese American citizens in good standing law-abiding people who
(42:15) were thrown into internment camps simply because their parents were born in the wrong country that's all they did wrong they had no right to a lawyer no right to a fair trial no right to a jury of their peers no right to doe process of any kind the only right they had right this way into the interment camps just when these American citizens needed their rights the most their government took them away and rights aren't rights if someone can take them away they're privileges that's all we've ever had in
(42:48) this country is a bill of temporary Privileges and if you read the news even badly you know that every year the list get shorter and shorter and shorter is it all soon or later yeah sooner or later the people in this country are going to realize the government does not give a about them government doesn't care about you or your children or your rights or your welfare or your safety it simply doesn't give a about you it's interested in its own power that's the only thing keeping it and expanding it wherever
(43:24) possible personally when it comes to rights I think one of of two things is true I think either we have unlimited rights or we have no rights at all personally I lean toward unlimited rights I feel for instance I have the right to do anything I please but if I do something you don't like I think you have the right to kill me so where are you going to find a fairer deal than that so the next time some says to you I have a right to my opinion you say oh yeah well I have a right to my opinion and my opinion is you have no right to
(43:58) your opinion then shoot the and walk away thank you I think about stuff like that it's interesting to me like I said suicide is interesting life is filled with interesting things that's why I could never commit suicide I'm having too much fun keeping an eye on you folks watching what you do human behavior that's what I like humans do some really interesting things like besides killing ourselves we also kill each other murder and we're the only ones who do that by the way we're the only species on Earth that
(44:32) deliberately kills members of our own species for personal gain or pleasure sometimes it's just fun we're also the only species that deliberately kills members of another species for personal gain or pleasure that's what Hunters do they kill for pleasure that's us human beings interesting folks murderers here's an interesting form of murder we come up with assassination you know what's interesting about assassination well not only does it change those popularity polls in a big hurry but it's also interesting to
(45:04) notice who it is we assassinate you ever noticed who it is stop to think of who it is we kill it's always people who've told us to live together in harmony and try to love one another Jesus Gandhi Lincoln John Kennedy Bobby Kennedy Martin Luther King Med gever Malcolm X John lenon they all said try to live together peacefully bam right in the head apparently we're not ready for that yeah that's difficult behavior for us we're too busy sitting around trying to think of ways to kill each other
(45:42) here's one we came up with it's efficient too genocide you know killing large numbers of people simply because they don't look like you they don't talk like you and they don't have the same kind of hats you do you ever noticed that anytime you see two groups of people who really hate each other chances are good they're wearing different kind of hats keep an eye on that it might be important but anytime there's genocide there are always Mass graves right every time we kill some dictator and go
(46:10) marching through his country we always find mass Graves thousands of thousands of dead bodies of people that dictator killed and everybody over here gets horrified W mask gra mask gra who well what's a guy supposed to do with a couple thousand people you just killed dig separate holes that it's labor intensive get real the whole idea of killing a large number of people at one time in one place is convenience efficiency throw them in the hole look at it this way at least the dictator had the
(46:40) decency to throw a little dirt on them give the guy some credit dictator is a busy man got a lot on his mind like trying to figure out who's planning to kill him so I can pick them up put them in prison and torture them torture there's another one of our heartwarming human activities we picked up along the way torturing each other you want to hear a really cool torture that the Romans invented they also use it as a form of capital punishment it's really creative they would take the guy in question stuff him
(47:12) in the burlap sack seal a sack up real tight and throw it in the river but and here's the creative part inside the sack with the guy they would put a dog a monkey and a snake Okay a dog a monkey and a snake that's creative imagine being inside a burlap sack underwater in the dark sitting next to a drowning monkey think he'd be moving around a little bit the dog would be gone ape we know that and the snake well he'd probably be getting curious about what all the activity was inside the
(47:45) sack he might do anything but whatever he did it would probably involve Venom and his teeth you know what you'd be doing you'd be praying to God that the snake bit the monkey and the dog ate the snake praying yeah then then it would be just you and the dog man and his best friend drowning together maybe before you died you could teach him a few tricks roll over and play dead wouldn't be too difficult would it just a thought just a playful thought by the way assume you're noticing that all these activities I'm mentioning
(48:21) murder torture genocide these are all things human beings do not animals those creatures we feel Superior to This Is Us here's another one of our spiritually uplifting activities we don't do this one much anymore but it used to be really big Human Sacrifice I missed that the Aztecs loved human sacrifice and they were good at it well they got a lot of practice for instance right around the year 1500 the Aztecs sacrificed 880,000 people in one ceremony okay 880,000 people one ceremony you know what the occasion was
(49:01) they were opening a new Temple nothing like religion for little entertainment huh especially that old time religion know how the Aztecs went about their sacrificing here's how they did it they would do it right out in public right in front of everybody Big Town beautiful city Square 20 30,000 people looking on they would take the guy lay him on an altar cut his chest open pull his heart out and hold it up in the air while it was still beating got that cut his chest open pull his heart out and hold it up in the air while it was still
(49:30) beating you know what you call that theater that is theater and although the procedure may have been a little too crude to be considered the first bypass surgery it could easily be seen as an early form of organ donor program the Aztec human beings just like us not too long ago 500 years Columbus had already landed this is just south of here Mexico and by the way those hearts didn't go to waste did not go waste because right after the ceremonies the royal family naturally would enjoy another one of our
(50:02) amusing activities cannibalism imagine that chowing down on another human being you got to be all out of beef jerky man you got to be really hungry but it happens doesn't it still happens to this day bunch of people stranded in the wilderness run out of poptarts got to eat something might as well be Steve and how do you decide who to eat first how do you decide who first on the barbecue rack do you pick on the little guy cuz he's skinny and he can't fight back or do you all gang up on the
(50:32) bodybuilder cuz he got a lot of Steaks and Chops on him these are things human beings have to consider one more of these Charming diversions of ours necrofilia huh now there's a hobby for you a corpse takes a special kind of guy don't you think but it happens it happens more than you might think it happens among humans animals don't do that animals don't their dead a rat will do a lot of gross things but he will not a dead rat it wouldn't even occur to him only a human being would think to
(51:20) someone who just died we got to be the most interesting Critters on the planet and then we wonder buy a UFO doesn't just land and say hello you know the best thing about necrofilia you don't have to bring flowers yeah usually they're already there isn't that nice it's nice it's convenient human beings will do anything anything I am convinced that's why when all those beheadings started in Iraq didn't bother me I took it right in stride a lot of people here were horrified ah beheadings
(52:07) beheadings what are you surprised just one more form of extreme human behavior besides who cares about some mercenary civilian contractor from Oklahoma who gets his head cut off him him hey Jack you don't want to get your head cut off stay the Oklahoma stay the Oklahoma they ain't cutting off heads in Oklahoma far as I know but I do know this you strap on a gun and go strutting around some other men's country you better be ready for some action Jack you better be ready for
(52:47) some action people are touchy about that sort of thing let me ask you this while I have you good clean Americans here this is a a moral question not rhetorical I'm looking for the answer what is the moral difference between cutting off one guy's head or two or three or five or 10 and dropping a big bomb on the hospital and killing a whole bunch of sick kids has anyone in Authority explained this to you I have not heard a word didn't get an email didn't get a postcard didn't get an instant message not a thing now
(53:16) case you're wondering why I have a certain interest in Fascination let's call it with torture and genocide and Human Sacrifice necrofilia it's because all of these things go to show me once again but over and over and over what beasts we human beings really are you know when you get right down to it when you get right down to it human beings are nothing more than ordinary jungle beasts Savages no different from the chromagnon people who lived 25,000 years ago in the P toine Forest eating grubs off of rotten logs no different our DNA
(53:51) hasn't changed substantially in 100,000 years we're still operating out of the lower brain The Reptilian Brain train fight or flight kill or be killed now we like to think we've evolved and advanced because we can build a computer fly an airplane travel underwater we can write a sonnet paint a painting compose an opera but you know something we're barely out of the jungle on this planet barely out of the jungle what we are is semi civilized beasts with baseball caps and automatic weapons and this civilization of ours
(54:23) that we're so proud of this civilization with its so-call civilized Behavior you ever stop and realize how fragile all this is how easily it could all just break right down just break right down wouldn't take much probably happened in less than two years wouldn't take much all to throw us right back into barbaric times all you'd have to do would be eliminate electricity that's all but completely eliminate electricity so no electricity no lights you're back to candles and lanterns campfires and
(54:54) bonfires batteries couldn't be recharged generators couldn't be refueled because fuel is pumped electrically so it's water by the way so no lights no fuel no water no computers and computers run everything and among the many things computers run that operate on electricity are security systems in all of our jails and prisons and nouses so suddenly without electricity all across America the gates and cell doors of penitentiaries and mental institutions would fly open and and out would come all of our old
(55:30) friends the ones who've been away at camp serial killers Mass murderers felony rapists armed robbers carjackers home Invaders thieves burglars kidnappers sadist pedophiles sexual predators pimps pushers pornographers speed freaks crackheads sick junkies all the ethnic street gangs black Spanish and Asian gangs Japanese Yakuza Russian mafia neo-nazis white supremist Sicilian Hitmen Italian Mobsters Jamaican and Colombian drug gangs and those are just the ones we caught let's not forget their counterparts still on the outside right
(56:09) now waiting to hook up with their prison buddies so they can start a new organization the American Federation of sociopaths just what the country needs another special interest group 8 to 10 million of them there'd be counting all the Parolees and all the probation and the ones who've never been caught 8 to 10 million bitter angry violent sexually hyperactive alpha males with nothing to do no Hobbies no medications no Scruples just a bunch of bad guys looking for a good time maybe dropping by your house hi hope we're not
(56:51) intruding got any beer oh good well I got about 1,400 really thirsty guys here how about women got any women oh just your wife huh well I think we can make that work now boys there's a lady here so I want you to mind your manners and wait your turn police wouldn't help you they'd be gone at the first sign of trouble they'd be home protecting their own families so with the Army and the National Guard you'd be alone you'd be on your own you'd be S so and jwf out of luck and Jolly well
(57:28) out of luck and jolly well after a couple of years of living like that beheadings would be the least of your problems people would be lining up to be beheaded so let's get back to Suicide which now seems like a reasonable alternative the system is beginning to collapse and everything is slowly breaking down I enjoy chaos and disorder not just because they helped me professionally they're also my hobby you see I'm an entropy fan I'm an entropy fan when I first heard of entropy in
(58:09) high school science I was attracted to it immediately when they told me that in nature all systems are breaking down I thought what a good thing what a good thing perhaps I can make some small contribution in this area myself and of course it's not just in nature in this country the the whole social structure just beginning to collapse you watch just beginning now to come apart at the edges in the seams well I think it is certainly apparent by now that one of the things I enjoy in life is excess I like things that are excessive
(58:46) I like excessive Behavior excessive language excessive violence it's fun it's interesting it's exciting I like it when Nature is excessive that's why like natural disasters all these natural disasters have been going on I love them I can't get enough of them oh when Nature's going crazy throwing things around scaring people and destroying property I'm a happy guy I'm a happy guy I look at it this way for centuries now man has done everything he can to destroy defile and
(59:22) interfere with nature clear cutting Forest strip mining mountains poisoning the atmosphere over fishing the oceans polluting rivers and lakes destroying wetlands and aquifers so when Nature strikes back and smacks man in the head and kicks him in the nuts I enjoy that I have absolutely no sympathy for human beings whatsoever none and no matter what kind of problem humans are facing whether it's natural or man-made I always hope it gets worse don't you don't you don't you have a part of you a part of you that
(59:59) secretly hopes everything gets worse when you see a big fire on TV don't you hope it spreads don't you hope it gets completely out of control and burns down six counties you don't root for the fireman do you I mean I don't want him to get hurt or nothing but I don't want him putting out my fire that's my fire that's nature showing off and having one I like fires you know something else I like those spring floods in the midwest aren't they great like clockwork spring floods in the midwest but I'm starting to notice
(1:00:38) I'm starting to catch on that every year it's the same story another flood in the same place with the same people on the same river same people and these people do not move they will not move they they they they repaint put down new carpeting and wallpaper and they move right back into the same house on the flood plane next to the river and then they wonder why Grandma's floating Downstream with the parakeet on her head fourth time again fourth time there's no learning curve with
(1:01:10) these people it's very hard to feel sorry for them every year same people same rowboats out there paddling around rescuing a chicken what the kind of a life is that well our kids love it here oh really what do they got gills and while they're showing all that on the screen the announcer is saying to me it's been raining steadily for 3 months now the ground can't hold any more water the river is cresting higher than it has in two centuries the levies have washed away and I just hope
(1:01:45) it keeps raining and raining and raining and raining and raining and raining and raining and raining and raining and raining and raining and raining and raining and it rains steadily for 5 years and then after that for 10 years it's cloudy with occasional showers and the river never returns to its natural Banks it becomes a completely new River and the borders of three states have to be changed and all the maps and atlases have to be redrawn and reprinted and no one's couch ever completely dries out for years and years every time they sit
(1:02:25) down this old is a little squish Dan Linda come on in you guys have a seat squish squish I like that people just refuse to be realistic they don't like to be realistic people would rather stroke themselves you know all they like to stroke themselves don't they stroke themselves they stroke each other they get stroke they stroke the boss the boss strokes and everybody Strokes everybody it's nothing about a big stroke job in this country the government Strokes every day of your life religion never stops stroking you big business gives
(1:02:58) you a good stroke and it's one big transcontinental cross country red white and blue stroke job do you *Applause* know yeah you know what the national emblem of this country ought to be forget the bald eagle the national emblem of this country ought to be Uncle Sam standing naked at attention saluting and seated on a chair next to him the Statue of Liberty jerking him off *Applause* that would be a perfect symbol for the United Strokes of America it's all folks that's what you have to remember as you go
(1:03:40) through life in this country it's all and it's bad for you cuz you do know folks you do know living in this country you know that every time you're exposed to advertising you realize once again that America's leading industry America's most profitable business is still the manufacture packaging distribution and marketing of high quality grade a prim cut pure American and the sad part is most people seem indoctrinated to believe that only comes from certain places certain
(1:04:17) sources advertising politics salesman not true is everywhere is rampant parents are full of teachers are full of Clerk lergy men are full of and law enforcement people are full of this entire country this entire country is completely full of and always has been from the Declaration of Independence to the Constitution to the star spangle Banner it's really nothing more than one big Steam and pile of red white and blue All-American because think of how we started think of
(1:04:49) that this country was founded by a group of slave owners who told us all men are created equal oh yeah all men except for Indians and and women right always like to use that authentic American language this was a small group of unelected white male landholding slave owners who also suggested their class be the only one allowed to vote now that is what's known as being stunningly and embarrassingly full of and I think I think Americans really show their ignorance when they say they want their politicians to be
(1:05:25) honest what are these cretans talking about if honesty were suddenly introduced into American Life the whole system would collapse no one would know what to do honesty would this country up and I think deep down Americans know that that's why they elected and reelected Bill Clinton you bet you you bet you yeah because the American people like their right out front where they can get get a good strong whiff of it Clinton might be full of but at least he lets you know it doesn't he
(1:06:03) Dole tried to hide it didn't he Dole kept saying I'm a plain and honest man people don't believe that what did Clinton say he said hi folks I'm completely full of and how do you like that and the people said you know something at least he's honest at least he's honest about being completely full of tell the truth don't be bullshitting people like I say there's enough as it is in fact there's just enough did you know that there's just enough in this
(1:06:36) country to hold things together is the glue that binds us as a nation where would we be without our safe familiar American Land of the Free Home of the Brave the American Dream all men are equal justice is blind the press is free business is honest the good guys win your vote counts the police are on your side God is watching you your standard of living will always improve and everything is going to be just fine the official national story I call it the American oky dooke everyone every one of those items is
(1:07:19) provably untrue at one level or another but we believe them because they're pounded into our heads from the time we're children that's what they do with that kind of thing pounding into the heads of kids because they know the children are much too young to be able to muster an intellectual defense against a sophisticated idea like that and they know that up to a certain age children believe everything their parents tell them and as a result they never learn to question things nobody questions things in this country anymore
(1:07:43) nobody questions anything everybody's too fat and happy everybody's got a cell phone that'll make pancakes and rub their balls now you know way too prosperous for our own good way too Pro Americans have been Bor of and silenced by toys and gizmos and no one learns to question things you remember oh yeah like I say no one questions things you remember Barbara Bush I call her the silver douchebag you remember her Barbara Bush she is the mother of Governor George Bush I call him Governor
(1:08:21) Bush because that's the only elected office he ever held legally in our country okay George Bush the I don't care where they hang his portrait I don't care how big his library is he'll always be Governor Bush I don't even capitalize his name when I type it anymore so she's the mother of Governor George Bush he's also the wife of his father George HW Bush who did become president in the normal legal traditional Manner and when he did she came along for the ride as first lady and that's been the tradition up till
(1:08:59) now a man has been elected and the woman has come along for the ride as the first lady and usually as in American life in general the woman is condescended to patronized given something to do to keep her busy a lot of times they give her a charity or a cause something she can Champion Betty Ford was told to drink remember that yeah remember that that's right Betty Ford was told you drink Betty Betty you drink and get really up okay just get totally fallen down up drunk face then blow
(1:09:29) your liver out blow your liver out honey then we'll hose you down and we'll put you in a place and get you well there and put your name on the place and Liza Manelli can get well and everything's going to be okay mean so that was her assignment that was her assignment Barbara Bush's assignment was getting children to read remember that getting children to read they figured she had had so much success with Je George that she would be a natural to get children to read which misses the point completely not important to get
(1:10:15) children to read children who want to read are going to read kids who want to learn to read are going to learn to read much more important to teach children to question what they read children should be taught to question everything to question everything they read everything they hear children should be taught to question authority parents never teach their children to question authority because parents are authority figures themselves and they don't want to undermine their own inside the household so they stroke the kid and the
(1:10:41) kid Strokes them and they all stroke each other and they all grow up all up and they come to shows like *Applause* this children have to be told there's coming down the road they have to be warned that life is about detecting the and fending it off as best you can no one told me a thing like that I was never warned about any of this had to find all of it out for myself and there are still as with you probably a lot of things that you're expected to believe and accept in America that uh I personally have a
(1:11:16) problem with and I question a lot of these things give you an example I saw a slogan on the guy's car said proud to be an American and I thought well what the does that mean proud to be an American you see I've never understood national pride I've never understood ethnic Pride because uh I'm Irish and I'm all four of my grandparents were born in Ireland so I'm fully Irish and when I was a kid I would go to the St Patrick's Day parade and I noticed that they sold a button that
(1:11:41) said proud to be Irish and I can never understand that because I knew that on Columbus Day they sold a different button that said proud to be Italian then came black pride and Puerto Rican pride and I could never understand ethnic or national pride cuz to me Pride should be reserved for something you achieve or attain on your own not something that happens by accident of birth being *Music* *Applause* Irish being Irish isn't a skill it's a genetic accident you wouldn't say I'm proud to be
(1:12:20) 511 I'm proud to have a predisposition for colon cancer so why the would you be proud to be Irish or proud to be Italian or American or anything if hey if you're happy with it that's fine do that put that on your car happy to be an American be happy don't be proud too much pride as it is pride goeth before a fall never forget Proverbs okay now but say what you want about America land of the free home of the brave we got some dumbass floating around this country dumb ass you know
(1:12:53) yeah now obviously that doesn't include the audience I understand that you seem intelligent and perceptive but the rest of them holy jumping balls dumber than a second coat of paint and this ain't just ranting and Raven this ain't just blowing off steam I got a little evidence to support my claim it just seems to me seems to me that only a really low IQ population could have taken this beautiful continent This Magnificent American landscape that we We inherited well actually we stole it from
(1:13:28) the Mexicans and the Indians but hey it was nice when we stole it it looked pretty good it was pristine Paradise have you seen it lately have you taken a good look at it lately it's embarrassing only a nation of unenlightened half wits could have taken this beautiful place and turned it into what it is today a shopping mall a big shopping Mall you know that that's all you got that's all you've got here folks mile after mile of mall after Mall many many malls major malls and mini malls they put the mini
(1:14:08) malls in between the major malls and in between the mini malls they put the mini Mars and in between the mini Mars you got the car lots gas stations muffler shops laundromats cheap hotels fast food joints strip clubs and dirty book stores America the beautiful one big transcontinental commercial Cesspool and had it a people feel about all this how do the people feel about living in a coast to coast shopping mall well they think it's just Dandy they think it is cool as can be because Americans love the mall they
(1:14:38) love the mall that's where they get to satisfy their two most prominent addictions at the same time shopping and eating millions of semiconscious Americans day after to day shuffling through the malls shopping and eating especially eating Americans love to eat they are fatally attracted to the slow death of fast food hot dogs corn dogs triple bacon cheeseburgers deep fried butter dipped in pork fat and cheese whz mayonnaise soaked barbecued mozzarella Patty melts Americans will eat anything anything if you were selling sauted
(1:15:10) raccoons on a stick Americans would buy them and eat them especially if you di them in butter and put a little salsa on them don't forget the mayonnaise and peanut butter this country is Big Time Pig time forget the bald eagle you know what the national emblem of this country ought to be a big bowl of macaroni and cheese a big bowl cuz everything in this country is king size king size extra large and super jumbo especially the people have you seen some of the people in this country have you taken a good
(1:15:44) look at some of these big fat walking around big fat oh my God huge piles of redundant protoplasm lumbering through the malls like a fleet of Interstate buses the people in this country are immense massive bellies monstrous thighs and big fat asses and if you stand there for a minute and you look at one of them you look at one of them you you begin to wonder how does this woman take a how does she and even more frightening how does she wipe her ass can she even locate her she must require
(1:16:31) assistance her paramedics trained in this field and standing right next to her of course with a plate full of nachos and a mouthful of Pie as her clueless husband Joe sixpack with his monstrous swollen beer belly hanging dangerously out over his belt buckled like a 90 lb tumor this guy hasn't seen his dick since the Nixon Administration and if you stand there and you look at the two of them you begin to Wonder to yourself do these people is this man actually capable of this woman it doesn't seem
(1:17:05) structurally possible that these two people could achieve penetration maybe they're in that ciru solay or something I'm telling you every other person in this country is 50 lbs overweight they are gangu in and in the summertime God help us in the summer time they all want to wear short pants Jesus Lord protector of all that is good and holy deliver me from fat people and short pants they all got short pants big bellies fat thighs and dumb kids short pants big bellies fat thighs and dumb kids every one of
(1:17:41) them's got two dumbass kids with them and the whole family is wearing t-shirts and every one of them's got the same t-shirt I'm with stupid apparently in this country the stupids are an extended family and besides wearing them t-shirts everyone in the family's got on a a backpack they got a backpack strapped to their back so they can carry around lots of stupid and the reason they got to carry their stupid strapped to their backs is because their hands must remain free at all times to hold
(1:18:07) food and to get that food up to the mouth where it gets shoveled in with all the rest of the disgusting they ate that day and another reason for the backpacks is these people are going to buy even more stupid they ain't got enough stupid at home they just had a stupid set they going to buy more they're going to go out in the parking lot and stuff this stuff into the big fat ugly oversized SUV that's got plenty of room in it plenty of room in it for stupid and lots of room left over for
(1:18:37) these big fat ugly to get them home stopping of course for jelly roll and fried dough these people these people are efficient professional compulsive consumers that's their civic duty consumption it's the new National Pastime baseball it's consumption the the only true lasting American value that's left buying things buying things people spending money they don't have on things they don't need money they don't have on things they don't need so they can max out their credit cards and spend
(1:19:08) the rest of their lives paying 18% interest on something that cost 1250 and they didn't like it when they got it home anyway not too bright folks not too bright but if you talk to one of them about this if you isolate one of them you sit them down rationally you talk to them about the low IQs and the dumb Behavior and the bad decisions right away they start talking about education that's the big answer to everything education they said we need more money for Education we need more more books more teachers more classrooms
(1:19:33) more schools we need more testing for the kids you say to them well you know we've tried all of that and the kids still can't pass the test ah don't you worry about that we're going to lower the passing grades and that's what they do in a lot of these schools now they lower the passing grades so more kids can pass more kids pass the school looks good everybody's happy the IQ of the country slips another two or three points and pretty soon all you'll need to get into college is a 
(1:19:56) pencil got a pencil get the in there it's physics then everyone wonders why 17 other countries graduate more scientists than we do education politicians know that word they use it on you politicians have traditionally hidden behind three things the flag the Bible and children No Child Left Behind No Child Left Behind oh really well it wasn't long ago you were talking about giving kids a Head Start Head Start left behind someone's losing ground here but there's a reason there's a reason
(1:20:27) there's a reason for this there's a reason education sucks and it's the same reason that it will never ever ever be fixed it's never going to get any better don't look for it be happy with what you got because the owners of this country don't want that I'm talking about the real owners now the big wealthy business interest that control things and make all the important decisions forget the politicians politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice you you don't you have no
(1:20:56) choice you have owners they own you they own everything they own all the important land they own and control the corporations they've long since bought and paid for the Senate the Congress the state houses the City Halls they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear they got you by the balls they they spend billions of dollars every year lobbying lobbying to get what they want well we know what
(1:21:26) they want they want more for themselves and less for everybody else but I'll tell you what they don't want they don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking they don't want well-informed well-educated people capable of critical thinking they're not interested in that that doesn't help them that's against their interest that's right you know something they don't want people who are smart enough to sit around the kitchen table and figure out how badly they're
(1:21:49) getting by a system that threw them overboard 30 years ago they don't want that you know what they want they want want obedient workers obedient workers people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay the longer hours the reduce benefits the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it and now they're coming for your Social Security
(1:22:16) money they want your retirement money they want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street and you know something they'll get it they'll get it all from you sooner or later because they own this place it's a big club and you ain't in it you and I are not in the big club by the way it's the same big Club they used to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe all day long beating you over the head in their media telling you what to
(1:22:43) believe what to think and what to buy the table is tilted folks the game is rigged and nobody seems to notice nobody seems to care good honest hardworking people white blue color doesn't matter what color shirt you have on good honest hardworking people continue these are people of modest means continue to elect these rich who don't give a about them they don't give a about you they don't give a about you they don't care about you at all at all at all man you know and nobody seems to notice nobody
(1:23:19) seems to care that's what the owners count on the fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red white and blue dick that's being jammed up their every day because the owners of this country know the truth it's called The American Dream cuz you have to be asleep to believe it here's another slogan here's another slogan you run into all the time God Bless America once again respectfully I say to myself what the does that mean God Bless America is that a request
(1:23:52) is that a demand is that a suggestion politicians say it at the end of every speech as if it were some sort of verbal tick that they can't get rid of God bless you and God bless America God bless you and God bless America I guess they figure if they leave it out someone's going to think they're bad Americans let me tell you a little secret about God folks God does not give a flying about America okay he doesn't care he never cared about this country he never has he never will he doesn't care about this country any more
(1:24:22) than he cares about Mongolia Transylvania Pittsburgh the Suez Canal of the North Pole he simply doesn't care okay he doesn't care listen hey there are 200 countries in the world now do these people honestly think that God is sitting around picking out his favorites why would he do that why would God have a favorite country and why would it be America out of all the countries because we have the most money because he likes our national anthem maybe it's because he heard we have 18 delicious flavors of
(1:24:54) class reron it's delusional thinking it's delusional thinking and Americans are not alone with these sort of delusions military cemeteries around the world are packed with brainwashed dead soldiers who were convinced God was on their side America prays for God to destroy our enemies our enemies pray for God to destroy us somebody's going to be disappointed somebody's wasting their time could it be everyone now *Applause* now if people want to say God Bless America that's their business I don't
(1:25:38) care but here's what I don't understand if they say God Bless America presumably they believe in God and if they do they must have heard God loved everyone that's what he said he loved everyone and he loved them equally so why would these people ask God to do something that went against his own teachings you know what these God Bless America people ought to do they ought to check what that Jesus fell that's so crazy about they're always talking about what would Jesus do what would Jesus do they don't
(1:26:01) want to know so they can do it they just want to know so they can tell other people to do it well I'll tell you what Jesus would have *Applause* done I'll tell you what Jesus would have done he would have got up on the top of the Empire State Building and said God bless everyone around the world forever and ever till the end of time that's what Jesus would have done and that's what these people should do or else they should admit that God Bless America is really just some sort of an empty slogan
(1:26:27) with no real meaning except for something vague like Good Luck Good Luck America you're on your own which is a little bit closer to the truth here's one more item for you the last in our Civics book rights boy everyone in this country is always running around yammering about their rights I have a right you have no right we have a right they don't have a right folks I hate to spoil your fun but there's no such thing as rights okay they're imaginary we made them up like The Boogeyman
(1:26:55) The Three Little Pigs Pinocchio Mother Goose like that rights are an idea they're just imaginary they're a cute idea cute but that's all cute and fictional but if you think you do have rights let me ask you this where do they come from people say well they come from God they're god-given rights oh here we go again here we go again the god excuse the last Refuge of a man with no answers and no argument it came from God anything we can't describe must have come from God personally folks I believe that if your
(1:27:27) rights came from God he would have given you the right to some food every day and he would have given you the right to a roof over your head God would have been looking out for you God would have been looking out for you you know that he wouldn't have been worried about making sure you have a gun so you get drunk on Sunday night and kill your girlfriend's parents but let's say it's true let's say God gave us these rights why would he give us a certain number of Rights the Bill of Rights in this
(1:27:55) country has 10 stipulations okay 10 rights and apparently God was doing sloppy work that week because we've had to amend the Bill of Rights an additional 17 times so God forgot a couple of things like slavery just slipped his mind but let's say let's say God gave us the original 10 he gave the British 13 the British Bill of Rights has 13 stipulations the German have 29 the belgians have 25 the Swedish have only six and some people in the world have no rights at all what kind of a goddamn god-given deal is that no rights
(1:28:37) at all why would God give different people in different countries different numbers of different rights boredom Amusement bad arithmetic do we find out at long last after all this time that God is weak in math skills doesn't sound like Divine planning to me sounds more like human planning sounds more like one group trying to control another group in other words business as usual in America now if you think you do have rights one last assignment for you next time you're at the computer get on the internet go to Wikipedia when you
(1:29:14) get to Wikipedia in the search field for Wikipedia I want you to type in Japanese Americans 1942 and you'll find out all about your precious rights okay all right you know about it you know about it yeah in 1942 there were 110,000 Japanese American citizens in good standing law-abiding people who were thrown into internment camps simply because their parents were born in the wrong country that's all they did wrong they had no right to a lawyer no right to a fair trial no right to a jury of their peers no right to due process of
(1:29:55) any kind the only right they had right this way into the interment camps just when these American citizens needed their rights the most their government took them away and rights aren't rights if someone can take them away they're privileges that's all we've ever had in this country is a bill of temporary Privileges and if you read the news even badly you know that every year the list get shorter and shorter and shorter you it all soon *Music* later yeah sooner or later the people in this country are going to realize the
(1:30:36) government does not give a about them government doesn't care about you or your children or your rights or your welfare or your safety it simply doesn't give a about you it's interested in its own power that's the only thing keeping it and expanding it wherever possible personally when it comes to rights I think one of two things is true I think either we have unlimited rights or we have no rights at all personally I lean toward unlimited rights I feel for instance I have the right to do anything
(1:31:05) I please but if I do something you don't like I think you have the right to kill me so where you going to find a fairer deal than that so the next time some says do you I have a right to my opinion you say oh yeah well I have a right to my opinion and my opinion is you have no right to your opinion opinion then shoot the and walk away thank *Applause* you you know I've been out here all this time and I haven't been complaining about anything yet I think it's time we moved right into the complaint
(1:31:59) department you know because listen this is just a series of things that are pissing me off all right because I don't have pet peeves I have major psychotic hatreds all right I'll tell you this it makes the world a lot easier to sort out first thing on my list tonight airport security tired of this this too much of it there's too much security at the airports I'm tired of some guy with a double- digit IQ and a triple- digigit income rooting around inside of my bag for no reason and never finding anything
(1:32:37) haven't found anything yet in anybody's bag haven't found one bomb in one bag and don't tell me Well the terrorists know their bags are going to be searched so now they're leaving their bombs at home there are no bombs the whole thing is pointless and it's completely without logic there's no logic at all they'll take away a gun but let you keep a knife what the is that in fact there's a whole list of lethal objects they will allow you to take on board theoretically you could
(1:33:08) take a knife an ice pick a hatchet a straight raiser a pair of scissors a chainsaw six knitting needles and a broken whiskey bottle and the only thing they're going to say to you is that bag has to fit all the way under the seat in front of you and and if you didn't bring a weapon on board relax after you've been flying for about an hour they're going to bring you a knife and fork they actually give you a knife it's only a table knife but you could kill a pilot with a table knife might take you a couple of minutes
(1:33:41) you know yeah especially if he's Hefty huh yeah but you can get the job done if you're really want to kill a prick there's a lot of things you could use to kill a guy with you could probably beat a guy to death with the Sunday New York Times couldn't you or suppose you just had really big hands couldn't you strangle a flight attendant you could probably strangle two of them one with each hand you know if you were lucky enough to catch him in that little kitchen area before they break out the 
(1:34:13) peanuts you know but you could get the job done if you really cared enough so why is it they allow a guy with big powerful hands to get on board an airplane I'll tell you why they know he's not a security risk because he's already answered the three big questions question number one did you pack your bags yourself no Carrot Top packed my bags he he and Martha Stewart and Florence Henderson came over to the house last night fix me a lovely Lobster Newberg gave me a full body massage with sacred oils from India performed a four-way
(1:35:01) around the world and then they packed my bags next question have your bags been in your possession the whole time no usually the night before I travel just as the Moon is rising I play my suitcases out on the street corner and leave them there unattended for several hours just for good luck next question has any unknown person asked you to take anything on board H well what exactly is an unknown person surely everyone is known to someone in fact just this morning Kareem and Yousef Ali Ben Gaba seem to know each other quite well they
(1:35:57) kept joking about which one of my suitcases was the heaviest and that's another thing they don't like at the airport jokes you know yeah you can't joke about a bomb well why is it just jokes what about a riddle how about a limr how about a bomb anecdote you know no punchline just a really cute story or suppose you intended the remark not as a joke but as an ironic musing are they prepared to make that distinction why I think not and besides who's to say what's funny airport security is a stupid idea
(1:36:38) it's a waste of money and it's only there for one reason to make white people feel safe that's all the illusion the feeling and illusion of safety to Plate the middle class cuz the authorities know they can't make an air claim completely safe too many people have access you'll notice the drug smugglers don't seem to have a lot of trouble getting their little packages on board do they no and God bless them too yes oh and by the way an airplane flight shouldn't be completely safe you need a
(1:37:16) little danger in your life take a chance once in a while will you what are you going to do play with your prick for another 30 years is what are you going to read People magazine and eat at Wendy's till the end of time take a chance besides even if they made all the airplanes completely safe the terrorists would simply start bombing other places that are crowded porn shops crack houses titty bars and gang bangs you know entertainment venues the odds of you being killed by a terrorist are practically zero so I say
(1:37:52) relax and enjoy the show you have to be a realist you have to be realistic about terrorism certain groups of people certain groups Muslim fundamentalists Christian fundamentalists Jewish fundamentalists and just plain guys from Montana are going to continue to make life in this country very interesting for a long long time that's the reality angry men in combat fatigues talking to God on a two-way radio and muttering incoherent slogans about Freedom are eventually going to provide us with a great deal of
(1:38:25) entertainment especially after your stupid economy collapses all around you and the terrorists come out of the woodwork you'll have Anthrax in the water supply and siren gas in your air conditioners there'll be chemical and biological suitcase bombs in every city and I say enjoy it relax enjoy the show take a chance put a little fun in your life to me terrorism is exciting it's exciting I think the very idea that you can set off a bomb in a Marketplace and kill several hundred people is exciting and stimulating and I
(1:38:54) see it as a form of entertainment entertainment that's all it is yeah but but I also know that most Americans are soft and frightened and unimaginative and they don't realize there's such a thing as dangerous fun and they certainly don't recognize a good show when they see one I have always been willing to put myself at Great personal risk for the sake of entertainment and I've always been willing to put you at great personal risk for the same reason as far as I'm concerned all of this airport security
(1:39:29) all the searches the screenings the cameras the questions it's just one more way of reducing your Liberty and reminding you that they can with you anytime they want as long as you put up with it as long as you put up with it which means of course anytime they want cuz that's what Americans do now they're always willing to trade away a little of their freedom in exchange for the feeling the illusion of of security what we have now is a completely neurotic population obsessed with security and
(1:40:00) safety and crime and drugs and cleanliness and hygiene and germs there's another thing germs where did this sudden fear of germs come from in this country have you noticed this the media constantly running stories about all the latest infections salmonella ecoli antivirus bird flu and Americans Panic easily so now everybody's running around scrubbing this and spraying that and overcooking their food and repeatedly washing their hands trying to avoid all contact with germs it's ridiculous and it goes to ridiculous
(1:40:30) lengths in prisons before they give you a lethal injection they swab your arm with alcohol it's true it's true it's true well well they don't want you to get an infection and you can see their point wouldn't want some guy to go to hell and can be sick it would take a lot of the sportsmanship out of the whole execution fear of germs why these you can't even get a decent hamburger anymore they cook their out of everything now cuz everybody's afraid of food poisoning Hey where's
(1:41:12) your sense of adventure take a chance will you you know how many people die from food poisoning every year in this country 9,000 that's all it's a minor risk take a chance bunch of goddamn besides what do you think you have an immune system for it's for killing germs but it needs practice it needs germs to practice on so so listen so listen if you kill all the germs around you and live a completely sterile life then when germs do come along you're not going to be prepared and never mind or
(1:41:53) ordinary germs what are you going to do when some super virus comes along that turns your vital organs into liquid I'll tell you what you're going to do you're going to get sick you're going to die and you're going to deserve it cuz you're weak and you got a weak immune system now all right God damn it hey all right I want to tell you a true story about immunization when I was a little boy in New York City in the 1940s we swam in the Hudson River and it was filled with raw sewage okay we swam in
(1:42:29) raw sewage you know to cool off and at that time the big fear was polio thousands of kids died from polio every year but you know something in my neighborhood no one ever got polio no one ever you know why cuz we swam in raw sewage it strengthened our immune systems the polio never had a prayer we were tempered in raw so personally I never take any special precautions against germs I don't shy away from people who sneeze and cough I don't wipe off the telephone I don't cover the toilet seat and if I drop food
(1:43:07) on the floor I pick it up and eat it I eat it yes I do even if I'm at a Sidewalk Cafe in Kolkata the poor section a new New Year's morning during a soccer Riot and you know something in spite of all that so-called risky Behavior I never get infections I don't get them I don't get coals I don't get flu I don't get food poisoning and I don't get headaches or upset stomachs you know why because I got a good strong immune system and it gets a lot of practice my immune system is equipped with the
(1:43:43) biological equivalent of fully automatic military assault rifles with night vision and laser scopes and we have recently acquired phosphorous grenades cluster bombs and anti-personnel fragmentation Minds so when my white blood cells are on patrol reconing my bloodstream seeking out strangers and other undesir if they see any any suspicious looking germs of any kind they don't around they whip out the weapons they wax the and deposit the Unlucky fellow directly into my colon There's No Nonsense there's no
(1:44:15) Miranda warning there's none of that three strikes in your out First Defense bam into the colon you go yeah sure yeah hey all right oh and speaking of my colon I want you to know I don't automatically wash my hands every time I go to the bathroom okay can you deal with that sometimes I do sometimes I don't you know when I wash my hands when I on them that's the only time that's the and you know how often that happens tops tops two three times a week tops tops maybe a little more frequently
(1:45:02) over the holidays you know what I mean and I'll tell you something else my well scrubbed friends you don't always need a shower every day did you know that it's Overkill unless you work out or work Outdoors or for some reason come in Intimate contact with huge amounts of Filth and garbage every day you don't always need a shower all you really need to do is to was the four key areas armpits crotching teeth got that armpits crotch and teeth in fact you can save yourself a whole lot of time if you simply use the
(1:45:38) same brush on all four areas thank you I think we're part of a greater wisdom than we will ever understand a higher order call it what you want know what I call call it the big electron the big electron wo wo whoa it doesn't punish it doesn't reward it doesn't judge at all it just is and so are we for a little while thanks for being here with me for a little while tonight thank you thank you very much thank you take care of yourself take care of yourself and take care of somebody else thank you good

(1:50:06) keep the pedal to the metal and the rubber on the road I party hoty and lunchtime is crunch time I'm hanging in there ain't no doubt and I'm hanging tough over and out thank you thank you here's a here's a Civic custom that I don't understand maybe you can help me taking off your hat when a flag passes by or with some jack off at the Ballpark start singing the National Anthem they tell you to take off your hat what the does a hat have to do with being patriotic what possible relationship exists between the
(1:50:41) uncovered head and a feeling that ought to live in your heart suppose you have a red white and blue hat suppose you have a hat made out of a flag why would you take it off to honor the flag wouldn't you leave it on and pointed toward the flag and and what's so bad about hats that you have to take them off why not take off your pants or your shoes they tell you out at the airport they say take off your shoes they tell you it's a national security so taking off your shoes could be patriotic too I start to question all
(1:51:18) this stupid hat when I was a kid when I was a kid I was a Catholic uh at least until I reach the Age of Reason okay so I was a Catholic I was a Catholic for about two two and a half years something like that and during that time one of the things they told us was that if a boy or a man went into a church he had to remove his hat in order to honor the presence of God but they had already told me that God was everywhere so I used to wonder well if God is everywhere why would you even own a hat why not show your respect don't even
(1:51:54) buy a hat and just to confuse things further they told the women exactly the opposite Catholic women and girls had to cover their heads when they went into church uh same as in certain temples Jewish men have to cover their their heads in those temples in those same temples Jewish women not allowed to cover their heads so try to figure this out Catholic men and Jewish women no hats Catholic women and Jewish men hats somebody's got the whole thing totally backwards don't you think and you
(1:52:34) know and what is this religious fascination with head gear every religion's got a different hat did you ever noticed that the Hindus have a turban the siks have a tall white turban Jews have a yamaka the Muslims had the cafia bishop has a point he had on one day and a around had on another day Cardinal has a red hat Pope as a why everybody's got a hat one group takes them off the other group puts them on personally I would never want to be a member of any group where you either have to wear a hat or you can't wear a
(1:53:05) hat *Applause* think I think all religions should have one rule and one rule only hats optional that's all you need to run a really good religion here's another one of these Civic Customs swearing on the Bible you understand that they tell you to raise your right hand place your left hand on the Bible does this stuff really matter which hand does God really give a about details like this suppose you put your right hand in the Bible you raise your left hand would that count or
(1:53:47) would God say sorry wrong hand try again and why does one hand have to be raised what is the Magic in this gesture this seems like some sort of a primitive Voodoo Mojo stick why not put your left hand on the bible let your right hand hang down by your side it's more natural or put it in your pocket remember what your mother used to say don't put your hands in your pockets does she know something we don't know is this hand really important but let's get back to the Bible America's favorite National
(1:54:20) theatrical prop suppose the Bible they hand you to swear on is upside down or backward or both and you swear to tell the truth on an upside down backward Bible would that count suppose the Bible will hand you as an old Bible and half the pages are missing suppose all they have is a Chinese Bible in an American court or a braille Bible and you're not blind suppose they hand you an upside down backward Chinese Braille Bible with half the pages *Applause* *Music* messing at what point does all of this stuff just break down and become just a
(1:55:07) lot of stupid that somebody made up they made it up folks it's make believe it's make believe now all right *Applause* okay let's leave leave the Bible aside we'll get back to the science fiction reading later the more important question is what is the big deal about swearing to God in the first place why does swearing to God mean you're going to tell the truth wouldn't affect me if they said to me you swear to tell the truth the whole truth the nothing but the truth to help you God I'd say
(1:55:46) yeah I'll tell you about as much truth as the people who wrote that Bible how do you like that h *Applause* swearing on the Bible doesn't mean anything it's it's kid swearing to God is kid stuff did you you remember when you were a kid if you if you told another kid something he didn't quite believe he'd say you swear to God I would always say yeah I swear to God even if I was lying why not what's going to happen if I lie nothing nothing happens if you lie unless you get caught and that's a whole
(1:56:22) different story sometimes a kid would think he was being slick with me and he'd say you swear on your mother's grave I say yeah why not first of all my mother was alive she didn't even have a grave second of all even if she was dead what she going to do rise from the grave and come and haunt me come and haunt me all because I told a lie to an 8-year-old get real will you sometimes I would say I swear on my mother's tits kids are impressed with things like that I mean I don't care about my
(1:57:05) mother's tits either I didn't care if they fell off not my problem they're your tits Ma you keep an eye on them swearing to God doesn't mean anything swearing on the Bible doesn't mean anything you know why because Bible or no Bible God or no God if it suits their purposes people are going to lie in court the police do it all the time all the time yes they do it's part of their job to protect to serve and to commit perjury whenever it supports the state's case swearing on the Bible is just one
(1:57:41) more way of controlling people and keeping them in line and it's one of these superstitious things that holds us back as a species something else I'm getting tired of is all this stupid we have to listen to all the time about children it's all you hear in this country children help the children what about the children save the children you know what I say the children them they're getting entirely too much attention and I know what you're thinking you say Jesus he's not going to
(1:58:13) attack children is he yes he is he's going to attack children and remember this is Mr conduct talking I know what I'm talking about I know what I'm talking about and I also know all you single dads and soccer moms who think you're such Heroes aren't going to like this but somebody's got to tell you for your own good your children are overrated and overvalued you've turned them into little cult objects you have a child fetish and it's not healthy and don't give me that weak well I love
(1:58:50) my children you everybody loves their children doesn't make you special John Wayne gasy loved his children kept them all right out in the yard near the garage that's not what I'm talking about what I'm talking about is this constant mindless yammering in the media this neurotic fixation that says somehow everything everything has to revolve around children it's completely out of balance listen there are a couple of things about kids you have to remember first of all they're not all cute okay
(1:59:25) yeah in fact if you look at them closely some of them are rather unpleasant looking and a lot of them don't smell very good either all right some of the really little ones seem to have kind of a sour milk and urine combination going on so like stay with me on this the sooner you face it the better off you're going to be second premise not all children are smart and clever got that kids are like any other group of people a few winners a whole lot of losers there are a lot of loser kids out there who simply aren't going anywhere
(1:59:57) and you can't save them all you can't save them all you got to let them go you got to cut them loose you got to stop overprotecting them cuz you're making them too soft today's kids are way too soft for one thing there's too much emphasis on safety childproof medicine bottles fireproof pajamas child restraints car seat and helmets baseball bicycle skateboard helmets kids have to wear helmets now for everything but jerking off grown-ups have taken all the fun out of being a kid just to save a few thousand
(2:00:29) lives it's pathetic it's pathetic what's happening is all right what's happening you know what it is these baby boomers these soft fruity baby boomers are raising an entire generation of soft fruity kids who aren't even allowed to have hazardous toys for Christ's sakes hazardous toys what if it happened a natural selection survival of the fittest the kid who swallows too many marbles doesn't grow up to have kids of his own simple as that simple Nature Nature Nature knows best we're saving
(2:01:06) entirely too many lives in this country of all ages nature should be allowed to do its job of killing off the weak and sickly and ignorant people without interference from air bags and batting helmets just think of it as passive eugenics now here's another example of overprotection did you ever notice on the TV news every time some guy with an AK-47 strolls onto a schoolyard and kills three or four kids and a couple of teachers the next day the next day the school is overrun with counselors and psychiatrists and grief counselors and
(2:01:43) Trauma therapists trying to help the children Co when I was in school someone came to our school and killed three or four of us we went right on with our arithmetic 35 classmates minus 4 equals 31 we were tough we were tough I say if kids can handle the violence at home they ought to be able to handle the violence in school I'm not worried about guns in school you know what I'm waiting for guns in church that's going to be a lot of fun and it'll happen you watch some nut will go ape in the church and
(2:02:21) they'll refer to him as a disgruntled worshipper here here's another bunch of ignorant school uniforms bad Theory the idea that if kids wear uniforms to school it helps keep order don't these schools do enough damage making all these kids think alike now they're going to get them to look alike too and it's not a new idea I first saw it an old newsreels from the 1930s but it was hard to understand cuz the narration was in German all right one more thank you thank you one more item about children and
(2:03:04) that is this superstitious nonsense that blames tobacco companies for kids who smoke listen kids don't smoke because a camel in sunglasses tells them to they smoke for the same reasons adults do because it relieves anxiety and depression and you'd be anxious and depressed too if you had to put up with these pathetic insecure striving anal yepy parents who enroll you in college before you're old enough to know which side of the play pen smells the worst and then they fill you full of riddling and drag you all over town in
(2:03:37) search of meaningless structure Little League Cub Scout swimming soccer karate piano bag pipes watercolors witchcraft glass blowing and dildo practice they even they even have play dates for Christ sakes playing is now done by appointment whatever happened to you show me your we we and I'll show you mine hey no wonder kids smoke it helps not as much as weed but hey you can't have everything you know it's true parents are burning these kids out on structure I think every day all children should have 3 hours of
(2:04:18) daydreaming just daydreaming that you could use a little of it Yourself by the way just sit at the window stare at the clouds it's good for you if you want to know how you can help your children leave them the alone it's all folks it's all and it's bad for you now speaking of parents and speaking of uh two ideas which aren't always mutually exclusive by the way I'd like to mention a special kind of that has taken hold in this country in the last 30 to 40 years it's
(2:04:52) a form of that really only can be called child worship it's child worship it's this excessive Devotion to Children I'm talking about today's professional parents these obsessive diaper sniffers who are overscheduling and over managing their children and robbing them of their childhoods even the simple Act of *Applause* playing *Music* even the simple Act of playing has been taken away from children and put on mommy schedule in the form of play dates something that should be spontaneous and free is now
(2:05:38) being rigidly planned when does a kid ever get to sit in the yard with a stick anymore you know just sit there with a stick do today's kids even know what a stick is you know you sit in the yard with a stick and you dig a hole you know and you look at the hole and you look at the stick and you have a little fun but kids don't have sticks anymore I don't think there are any sticks left I think they've all been recalled because of lead paint who would have thought that one day the manufacturing of sticks would be
(2:06:33) outsourced to China but you know something the kid shouldn't be wasting his time with a stick anyway if he's four years old he should be home studying for his kindergarten entrance exams do you know about that oh they Happ now yeah yeah there are places that have kindergarten entrance exams the poor little the poor little he can barely locate his dick you know and and already he's being pressured to succeed pressured to succeed for the sake of the parents isn't this really just a sophisticated
(2:07:11) form of child abuse and speaking of that speaking of child abuse speaking of child abuse next upop grade school grade school where he won't be allowed to play tag because it encourages victimization and he won't be allowed to play dodgeball because it's exclusionary and it promotes aggression standing around is still okay standing around is still permitted but it won't be for long because sooner or later some kid is going to be standing around and his foot will fall asleep and his parents will sue the school and it'll be
(2:07:49) good by standing around *Applause* now now fortunately all is not lost all is not lost because at least we know that when he does get to play whatever games he is allowed to play the child will never lose we know he'll never lose because in today's America no child ever loses there are no losers anymore everyone's a winner no matter what the game or sport or competition everybody wins everybody wins everybody gets a trophy no one is a loser no child these days ever gets to hear those all important character building words you
(2:08:32) lost Bobby you lost you're a loser Bobby they miss out on that you know what they tell a kid who lost these days you were the last winner a lot of these kids never get to hear the truth about themselves until they're in their 20s when their boss calls them in and says Bobby clean the out of your desk and get the out of here you're a loser get the out of *Applause* here of course Bobby's parents can't understand why he can't hold a job in school he was always on the honor roll
(2:09:16) well what they don't understand of course is that in today's schools everyone is on the honor roll everyone is on the honor roll because in order to be on the honor roll all you really need to do is to maintain a body temperature somewhere roughly in the 90s we shouldn't be worried about how he's doing in school let's not worry about that because come summertime he'll be off to Camp yes he'll be off to camp but not to swim and hike and play softball no no no no no today's child
(2:09:43) will be sent away to lose weight he'll be sent to fat camp or computer camp or violin camp or Ceramics camp or leadership camp whatever the that is leadership camp isn't that where Hitler went specialized structured summer camps got to keep the little busy you know got to keep the little busy wouldn't want him to sneak in a little unstructured time in the woods that wouldn't be any good God knows he might start jacking off especially these young boys these adolescent males and a lot of them you
(2:10:28) know a lot of them they kill themselves when they're jerking off they don't mean to it just happens you know about that yeah some of you know I can tell yeah a lot of people don't know about a lot of people never heard of that you know it's just one of those things Americans can't handle we can't handle that we don't talk about that it's not on Larry King live it ain't on Barbara Walters you ain't go see it in People magazine but it's out there folks it's out there and it's
(2:10:54) extremely common you just ask any teenage boy you know who trusts you ask him what he knows or what he's heard about cutting off your Air Supply just at the moment you're about to have a sexual release he' tell you an interesting story story or two the kids call it scarfing CU some of them use scarves to do it or screw the kid just get on the internet do it yourself Google in the words autoerotic as fixure autoerotic as fixure it's the practice of cutting off the oxygen to the brain at the last moment during masturbation
(2:11:24) in order to heighten the orgasm and and when I say common a thousand kids a year die this way okay a thousand of them die so think how many of them are trying to pull this off if you pardon the little pun that I throw in there just just to lighten the moon but here's the way it works apparently I never tried it it sounded risky to me well jerking off is all I need you know what I mean folks I ain't trying to double my money that yeah I just jerk off wipe off my chest get up and go to work you know that's
(2:12:03) it nothing fancy nothing fancy at our house we're simple folk but here's the way it's supposed to work and this is why it's such a big attraction in the first place apparently it is true medically physiologically speaking that if you can cut off your air supply the oxygen to your brain just at the moment you're about to have an orgasm the orgasm is about I don't know let's say 500 times better something like that it's incredibly intense so what you got to do is stand up on a chair or a bucket or some kind of thing
(2:12:37) you put a rope around your neck and you start jerking *Applause* off and while you're pulling your PUD while you're pulling your PUD you have to arrange to almost strangle yourself just before you have an orgasm and by the way while all this activity is going on you got to maintain a hard on which ain't easy cuz you might just be getting ready to buy the farm so you better be fantasizing about someone you really like or something you really like I don't know what it might be maybe getting in the ass by a game
(2:13:18) warden who knows huh hey hey I'm not here to judge we're we're all different to each his own so let's recap stand on a chair rope around your neck Peter in your hand now you have to time it just right so that just before you come you almost die and sometimes you miscalculate you don't know if you're coming or going you don't know there's no way to know no way to know I know and the parents of these kids are too embarrassed to tell the police so they put the kid' dick away and say he
(2:14:03) had poor grades his girlfriend left him oh well no wonder lady look at his Hobbies then they blame it on heavy metal you know I know if you remember that but from that Old incident there some years back a Judas Priest one of the headbanging band some played a song and after that and they kill themselves and so they blame suicide on uh heavy metal if it's murder they tend to blame rap these days but it's never the parents do you ever notice this parents apparently play no part in the development and outcomes of these kids
(2:14:38) parents you know they can raise a kid apparently 11 12 13 14 15 years if he turns out up boy they had nothing to do with that must be those kids at the parking lot he hangs around with parents got to be among the most full of people in the world well they always have been top to bottom front to back listen It Come In fairness it comes with the job if you want to be a parent you got to be full of at least half the time look at it this way they have it both ways if the kid turns out to be
(2:15:04) a loser they had nothing to do with that but boy if he's a winner got a scholarship or something like that man they the first ones out there raising their hands trying to take a little credit it's a nice state of mind if you can talk yourself into beli it here's another pack of lowgrade morons who ought to be locked into portable toilets and set on fire these people with bumper stickers that say we are the proud parents of an honored student at the Franklin School you know or the mid Vil Academy or whatever
(2:15:38) other innocent sounding name has been assigned to the indoctrination Center where their child has been sent to be stripped of his individuality and turned into an obedient Soul dead conformist member of the American consumer culture proud parents what kind of empty people need to validate themselves through the achievements of their children how you like to have to live with a couple of these Misfits how's that science project coming along Justin you Dad you simple-minded prick mind your own business and pass
(2:16:15) the Cheerios here's a bumper sticker I'd like to see we are the proud parents of a child whose self-esteem is sufficient that he doesn't need us promoting his minor Scholastic achievements on the back of our car that was really still good or or we are the proud parents of a child who has resisted his teachers attempts to break his spirit and bend him to the will of his corporate Masters just be a nice little for change you know here's something realistic we have a daughter in public school who hasn't
(2:16:49) been knocked up yet we have a son in public school who hasn't shot any of his classmates yet but he does sell drugs to your honor student plus he knocked up your daughter then there are the people who aren't too proud of their children we are the embarrassed parents of a crosseyed little nitwit who at the age of 10 not only continues to wet the bed but also shits on the School Bus something like that on the back of the car might give the child a little more incentive you know get him to try a little harder next
(2:17:31) semester now all of this stupid that children have been so crippled by has grown out of something called the selfesteem movement the self-esteem movement began in 1970 and I'm happy to say it has been a complete failure because Studies have repeatedly shown that having high self-esteem does not improve grades does not improve career achievement it does not even lower the use of alcohol and most certainly does not reduce the incidence of violence of any sort because as it turns out extremely aggressive violent
(2:18:07) people think very highly of themselves imagine that sociopaths have high self-esteem who would a th huh I love when this kind of thing happens I love when these politically correct ideas Crash and Burn and wind up in the house here's another one that bit the dust this practice of playing Mozart during pregnancy so the fetus can hear it it was supposed to increase intelligence didn't work didn't work all it did was sell a lot of CDs and piss off a whole lot of fetuses here's another platitude they
(2:18:50) Jam down your throat children are our future children are not our future and I can prove it with my usual Flawless logic children can't be our future because by the time the future arrives they won't be children anymore so blow me yes as you may have noticed I always like to present a carefully reasoned argument the self-esteem movement revolved around a single notion the idea the single idea that every child is special boy they said it over and over and over as if to convince themselves every child is special and I kept saying
(2:19:49) you every child is clearly not special did you ever look at one of them you ever take a good close look at one of these kids they're goofy they're goofy looking they're too small they're way too small they're Mala portion their heads don't fit their bodies their arms are too weird and everything they can't walk across the room in a straight line and when they talk they talk like I got a mouth full of they're incomplete incomplete unfinished work I
(2:20:29) never give credit for incomplete work now PT Barnum might think they're special but not me I have standards but let's say it's true let's Grant this I'm in a generous mood let's Grant this proposition let's say it's true as somehow every child is special what about every adult isn't every adult special too and if not then at what age do you go from being special to being not so special and if every adult is special then that means we're all special and the whole idea loses all its 
(2:21:10) meaning and a similar mystery to me motivation books motivation seminars why would anyone need to be motivated by someone else I say if you lack motivation a seminar isn't going to help you what you really need is to be smashed in the head 30 or 40 times with a golf club that'll motivate you or else at least get you up and moving around the room you know locate your socks like that get the day rolling motivation is if you ask me this country could use a little less motivation the people who are
(2:21:43) motivated are the ones who were causing all the trouble stock swindlers serial killers child molesters Christian conservatives these people are highly motivated highly motivated and anyway I think motivation is overrated you show me some lazy prick who's lying around all day watching game shows and stroking his penis and I'll show you someone's not causing any trouble okay he all right here's another horrifying aspect of American culture the pussification the continued pussification of the
(2:22:25) American male in the form yeah all right in the form of Harley Davidson theme restaurants what the is going on here Harley-Davidson used to mean something it stood for biker attitude grimy Outlaws and their sweaty mom full of beer and crank rolling around on Harley's looking for a good time destroying property raping teenagers and killing policemen all very necessary activities by the way but now theme restaurants and this soft obviously didn't come from Hardcore bikers it came from these
(2:23:12) weekend motorcyclists these fraudulent two-day a week who have their bikes trucked into stures South Dakota for the big and then ride around like they just come in off the road dentists and bureaucrats and boy software designers getting up on a Harley cuz they think it makes them cool well hey skx you ain't cool you're chilly and Chile ain't never been cool and here long as we're talking about theme restaurants I got a proposition for you I think if white people are going to burn down black
(2:23:48) churches then black people ought to burn down the House of Blues huh what a disgrace that place is the House of Blues they ought to call it the house of lame white inauthentic low frequency singled digigit lame white especially these male movie stars who think they're blues artists you ever see these guys don't you just want to puke in your soup with one of these fat balding overweight overaged out of shape middle-aged male movie stars with sunglasses jumps on stage starts blowing
(2:24:21) into a harmonica it's a sacrilege in the first place white people got no business play in the Blues ever at all under any circumstances ever ever ever what the do white people have to be blue about Banana Republic ran out of khakis HH the espresso machine is jammed Hy and the Blowfish are breaking up white people ought to understand their job is to give people the blues not to get them and certainly not to sing or play them tell you a little secret about the blues it's not enough to know which notes to play you got to
(2:25:09) know why they need to be played and another thing I don't think white people should be trying to dance like blacks stop that stick to your poers and waltzes and that repulsive country line dancing that you do and be yourself be proud be white be lame and get the off the dance floor now I thank you now listen long as we're discussing minorities want to mention something about language in this country there are a couple of terms that are used in connection with minorities usually by guilty white liberals first one is
(2:25:58) happens to be he happens to be black I have a friend who happens to be black like it's a accident you know happens to be black yes he happens to be black ah yes yes yes yes yes he had two black parents oh yes that's right two black parents yes and they Oh indeed they did yes so where does the surprise part come in I should think it would be more unusual if he just happened to be Scandinavian and the other term is openly openly gay they'll say he's openly gay but this is the only minority
(2:26:38) they use that for you know you wouldn't say someone was openly black well maybe James Brown or Louis faran Louis faran is openly black colon Powell is not openly black colon Powell is openly white he just happens to be black thank you thank you yeah oh thank you thank you and while we're at it when did the word Urban become Anonymous with the word black did I fall asleep for eight or nine years Urban Trends Urban Style Urban Music I was not consulted on this at all didn't get a fax didn't get an
(2:27:24) email didn't get a postcard fine that's all right and I don't think white women should be calling each other girlfriend okay stop pretending to be black and no matter what color you are you go girl should probably go right along right along with you the man hey you the man oh yeah well you the honky here's another bunch of puss headed telephone cretans these self-important techno dicks who walk around with these handsfree telephone headsets and ear pieces Mr self-important doesn't want to
(2:28:09) be too far from the phone in case Henry Kissinger calls he's got the doll llama online too I say hey Spaceman long as your hands are for free reach over here and fondle my balls would you *Applause* please there are some more people ought to be strapped into chairs and beaten with hammers people who wear visors let me ask you something what the is the point in wearing half a hat either get a hat or don't no one's interested in the top of your head go back to the store and tell them to give you the rest of the Hat they cheated you

(2:29:45) but with no last name you can't find out where they live to throw a bomb through their window it's frust okay here is another pack of Jack offs ought to be strangled in front of their children people who pay for inexpensive items with a credit card you know folks take my word for this raisinets is not a major purchase get some cash together no one should be paying a bank 18% interest on Tic taacs and holding up the line too some dorky looking prick with a fanny pack waiting to be
(2:30:25) approved for a bag of cheese Doodles I need this like I need an infected scrotum get some money next guy ahead of me online pays for news week with a credit card is getting stabbed in the eyes and just to wind up this little group of complaints finally this is a a group of social criminals these people in the space program nassh I call them in case you haven't heard the latest disaster for the rest of the universe is that the United States is going to go to Mars okay oh yeah we're going to go to Mars and then of course
(2:31:09) we're going to colonize deep space with our microwave hot dogs and plastic vomit fake dog and cinnamon dental floss and lemon scented toilet paper and sneakers with light in the heels and all these other impressive things we've done down here but let me ask you this let me ask you this what are we going to tell the intergalactic Council of ministers the first time one of our teenage mothers throws her newborn baby into a dumpster huh how are we going to explain that to the space people how we going to let them know
(2:31:42) that our ambassador was only late for the meeting because his breakfast was cold and he had to spend half an hour punching his wife around the kitchen now what are they going to think when they find it's just a local custom that over 80 million women in the third world have had their clitorises forcibly removed in order to reduce their sexual pleasure so they won't cheat on their husbands can't you just sense how eager the rest of the universe is for us to show up can't you see him out *Applause*
(2:32:11) there thank you thank you I appreciate that suicide is an interesting topic to me because it's an inherently interesting decision to decide voluntarily not to exist anymore it's profound you know what it is it's the ultimate makeover that's why I think it belongs on television in this in this depraved culture we live in with all these reality shows suicide and television will be a natural I'll bet you could have an all suicide channel on cable TV I'll bet you they got all golf what
(2:32:48) the huh God damn jesz you ever watch golf you ever watch golf it's like watching flies if you can get a bunch of brainless that sits down and waste a Sunday afternoon on that kind of you know you can get some people to watch some suicides all day long 24 hours a day nothing but suicides Must Die TV you'd get a lot of people watching that you'd get a lot of people volunteering to be on there too just so their friends can see them on TV people are goofy you'd get a lot of volunteers you
(2:33:20) get all them leftover from Let's Make a Deal they'd be lined up around the block pushing each other out of the way pushing on funny capes and caps and H hats and make up and call themselves Captain suicide guys will be competing for most unusual method people will be jumping off of silos lighting themselves on fire putting rat poison on a Taco drinking mopping glows sticking moth balls up their ass you'd probably have some weird show up and figured out how to kill himself with dental
(2:33:44) floss and a stinger missile people are goofy I bet you could find you a married couple in this country I bet you you could find a married couple in one of them trailer parks or something who'd be perfectly willing to sit in a love seat and blow each other's heads off with shotguns while a love song is playing people are nuts this country is full of nitwits and do you ever noticed that oh my goodness yes oh my goodness right yeah nitwits up scumbags jerk offs and
(2:34:23) and they all vote they all vote yeah in fact sometimes you get the impression they're the only ones who vote you can usually tell who's been doing the voting by looking at the election returns man it sure ain't me out there wasting my time with a meaningless activity like that you know those people on the Jerry Springer Show those are the average Americans oh yeah believe me below average can't get on the show can't get on below average sitting home watching that on TV getting ready to go out and
(2:34:55) vote filling out their sample ballot people are dumb you can say what you want about this country and I love this place I love the freedoms we used to have I love it I love that you know uhhuh I love it when it didn't take a catastrophe to get us to care for one another I love the fact that we're on camera all the time from all angles but you know what you can say what you want about American and I say I love this place I wouldn't have it any other way wouldn't live in any other time in history in any other place I'm
(2:35:30) an interesting guy I always hope that no matter how small the original problem is it's going to grow into bigger and bigger proportions that get completely out of control and I'll give you a concrete example let's say a water man breaks in downtown Los Angeles and it floods an electrical substation knocking out all the traffic lights and tying up the entire city and emergency vehicles can't get through and at the same time one of those month-long global warming heat waves comes along but there's no
(2:35:54) air conditioning there's no water for sanitation so Cola small poox and diser break out and thousands of people start dying in the streets but before they die parasites eat their brains and they go completely crazy and they storm the hospital but the hospital can't handle all the casualties so these people rape all the nurses and set the hospital on fire and the Flames drive them even crazier so they start stabbing social workers and garbage men and a big wind comes along and the entire city Goes Up in Flames and the people who are
(2:36:20) still healthy they get mad at the sick people and they start crucifying them nailing them to crosses trying on their underwear like that then everybody smokes crack in PCP and they march on City Hall where they burn the mayor at the Stak strangle his wife and take turns sodomizing the statue of Larry Flint and at this point at this point it looks like pretty soon things are going to start to get out of control so everybody panics and tries to leave the city at the same time and and they trample each other to death in the
(2:36:48) streets by the thousands and Wild dogs eat their corpses and the wild dogs chase the rest of the people down the highway and one by one the dogs pick off the old and the slow people cuz they're in the fast lane where they don't belong get the out of the Fast Lane if you're an old if you're a slow get over on the right get over on the right and then and the lucky ones the lucky people who managed to make it all the way outside of town they discover when they get there that big Sparks from the city
(2:37:12) have Li the suburbs on fire and the suburbs burn uncontrollably and thousands of identical homes have identical fires with identical smoke killing all the identical soccer moms and their identical kids named Jason and Jennifer and now now the fire spreads to the farmlands and the farmlands burn intensely at 425° creating millions of baked potatoes and as the farmlands burn as the farmlands burn thousands of Barns and farmhouses begin to explode from all the hidden methamphetamine labs and the meth chemicals run downhill into the
(2:37:42) rivers and streams where wild animals drink the water and get completely geeked on speed so bears and wolves amped up on crank. roam in the country looking for people to eat even though they're not really hungry and the fire spreads to the forest and the forest burn furiously and hundreds of elves and trolls and fairies come running out of the wood screaming Bambi is dead Bambi is dead and he is he is finally that little Bambi is dead dead now now hundreds of regional fires come together into one huge Interstate
(2:38:16) Inferno and all 12 of the western United States are burning out of control except Utah where the Mormons don't allow fires and and the fire spreads across the Great Plains toasting the wheat cooking the cattle and producing hamburgers actually then it leaps to Mississippi and races through the South blowing up Stills interrupting lynchings and killing millions of inbred people and then it turns Northeast and it heads for Washington DC where George Bush can't decide if it's an emergency or not I can't decide this he doesn't know it's
(2:38:47) hard oh it's hard work you know no yeah he he can't decide because Dick Cheney is in prison so instead he takes a nap he takes a nap he puts his empty brainless head down on the little pillow his mother gave him at Christmas time and he takes a nap so the fire moves to Philadelphia but it's a weekend and Philadelphia's Clos on the weekend so the fire moves to New York City and the people in New York tell the fire to go yourself go yourself yeah and it does yeah and it does so instead it burns
(2:39:25) down Long Island in Connecticut killing all the rich white and completely destroying their evil golf courses and while all this is going on Canada Burns to the ground but nobody notices and now the entire North American continent is on fire producing a huge thermal updraft and creating an incendiary cyclonic macro system that forms a hemispheric storm breaking down the molecular structure of the atmosphere and actually changing the laws of nature Fire and Water combined burning clouds of flaming rain fall
(2:39:57) upward gamma rays and solar winds ignite the ionosphere creating huge clouds of ionized plasma bolts of lightning 20 million miles long begin shooting out of the North Pole and the sky fills up with green and then suddenly the entire fabric of SpaceTime splits into a huge crack in the universe opens and all the dead people from the past begin falling through Babe Ruth Groucho Marx Davey Crockett Tiny Tim Porky Pig Hitler Janice Joplin Allan Len my Uncle Dave your Uncle Dave everybody's Uncle Dave an endless stream of dead uncle Daves
(2:40:31) falling through the crack and all the dead uncle Daves gather around a Heavenly kitchen table they light up cigarettes and they begin to talk they talk about how they never got a break how their parents didn't love them and their children were ungrateful they talk about how the government screwed them out of money and they just missed out on a big job they say that Jews own everything and the blacks get special treatment and all the hatred and bitterness drips out of these people and forms a big pool of liquid hate and the
(2:40:58) pool of liquid hate begins to spin round and round it spins faster and faster and the faster it spins the bigger it gets faster and faster bigger and bigger until the whirling pool of hate is bigger than the entire universe and then suddenly it explodes into trillions of tiny stars and every Star has a trillion planets and every planet has a trillion Uncle Daves and all the uncle Daves have good jobs perfect eyesight and shoes that fit they have great sex lives and free health care they understand the internet their kids think they're cool
(2:41:28) and they all love their neighbors and every week without fail Uncle Dave wins the lottery forever and ever till the end of time every single Uncle Dave has a winning ticket and Uncle Dave is finally happy now do you see why I like it when Nature gets even with humans thanks for coming in here tonight w
