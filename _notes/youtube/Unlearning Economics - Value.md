(00:00) Economic value! What the  hell is  it? Where does it come from? Where am I? Who took my false teeth? These are the types of  questions we'll be answering in this video, so   strap yourself in and let's get into one of the  most central debates in economics. When we talk   about value we are curious about the nature  of capitalism.
(00:19) How is there more stuff than   before? How do companies make profit over and  above their costs? Where do prices come from   and do they reflect value? Things can get pretty  confusing. I'm here to provide the facts about   value in a frank and straightforward manner. And now here's: Fuzzy Bunny's guide to you   know what. This is Fuzzy Bunny.
(00:41) A few hundred  years ago he noticed that his economy was   changing. He had terrible social dislocation. And he had value where there was no value   before. He also noticed theories of value. Boooriinnng. Am I making myself clear? I'm not. Let's start again.   In 2009 Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs,  claimed: For those of you who are unaware, this was during the biggest financial   crisis since the 1930s.
(01:17) That crisis was in large  part caused by the behavior of banks like Goldman   Sachs. They were bailed out by the U.S Government  to the tune of 125 billion dollars. Goldman Sachs   laid off 3,000 employees between 2007 and 2009.  Their profits fell and they were fined 550   million dollars for irresponsible behaviour. Yet  Blankfein could still claim that his employees   were productive.
(01:39) Why? The idea of what counts  as productive and what counts as unproductive   has shifted over time. Economists separate the  two with the so-called "production boundary". The   first to do this was the economist William Petty. Petty created the first ever National Accounts in   the 17th Century. He realised - crucially - that one  person's expenditure is another person's income.  
(01:56) He used this insight to calculate the total  income of England using the spending   of the population. But Petty didn't count every  expenditure - only food clothing housing and other   "necessaries". Unnecessary expenses like luxuries  were left out.
(02:13) For the first time, Petty raised The   crucial question of where to place the production  boundary. Our views on this have changed over the   centuries. Finance has been brought from outside  the production boundary to inside the production   boundary. It was long thought that finance just  moved value around rather than adding it. That   perception has changed, which is reflected in how  we measure the financial sector.
(02:32) It didn't used to   be included in the economic growth numbers but its contribution has slowly been inflated. This entails   some flexible interpretations of what counts as  "adding value". These days, the interest paid on bank   deposits is counted as adding value. The interest  paid on loans is also counted as adding value.  
(02:49) Higher risk usually means higher interest rates  so the more banks take on risks the higher GDP.   Even when that risk results in a financial  crisis. I want to make an important caveat:   just because something doesn't "add value"  doesn't mean that it's bad or unnecessary.   You can think of finance as necessary to the  functioning of the economy, but just not think   it should be counted in GDP.
(03:14) It's hard to pinpoint  exactly where finance ads value because nothing   concrete is produced. When a company makes an  iPhone you can see pretty clearly that the   end product is more valuable and more useful  than the component parts. They have 'added value' -   for about two years, at which point new software  makes the phone obsolete.
(03:31) Now, it's easy to mock   silly definitions of value creation like Blankfein's unself-aware celebration of Goldman Sachs,   but coming up with a coherent theory of value is  far more difficult. You see, theories of value have   always been caught up in this complicated space. On the one hand, they seem like scientific theories.  
(03:47) They propose to predict and explain what happens  under capitalism. They are sometimes mathematically   deduced and tested against statistical evidence,  as we'll see. On the other hand, they carry clear   ethical commitments and moral implications.  You can predict which theory of value someone   subscribes to pretty well from their political  position.
(04:06) This makes the whole debate around   value ideologically charged to say the least.  With all these complications, it's tempting to   Define value the same way Ted Lasso defines the  offside rule:   If someone creates a life-saving vaccine then we can say with some certainty that   they're adding value.
(04:32) If someone takes charge  of a corporation and runs it into the ground   while rewarding themselves, we can say they're  destroying value. But things aren't always this   clear-cut. We want more from our economic analysis than we can get from reading a newspaper. In her book The Value of Everything, Mariana Mazzucato defines value in the following way: Does producing this video  create wealth? Well, it definitely causes money to flow around. I get paid monthly by my beloved  
(05:47) patrons, ostensibly to create videos like  this. I got paid by a sponsor directly for them to   feature in this video. When people buy that product,  the sponsor makes money in-turn. I am a wealth   creator! (Please lower my taxes). But in my earlier  videos none of this was true.
(06:04) I didn't have Patreo;n   I didn't have a sponsor; I've never monetized my  videos through YouTube. My highest view count is   the response to Philosophy Tube, which made no  money for me or for a sponsor. Was that video   less valuable? Only in the sense of monetisation. Certainly not in the YouTube currency of views.  
(06:21) My first video was about how GDP fails to value  certain things which are outside the market. But   that video didn't count in actual GDP, while this  one - which is kind of about the same thing - will   count in GDP. My head hurts.
(06:38) Fortunately, there is a  long and illustrious history of theories of value   which will help us to answer the all-important  question of whether this video is worthless.   In the 17th Century, a group of economists known as the physiocrats argued that all value ultimately   came from this: the soil. An economist called  Francois Quesnay argued that humans depend on nature   for nourishment. Nature was the source of things  like food, minerals, land, and wood.
(07:05) Acorns grew into   great oaks thanks to the natural functioning of  nature. Humans could not create value in the same   way that nature could; we could only transform it. Chopping up wood; smelting together iron and coal   to make steel.
(07:21) (Mate how long are you gonna hold that soil up for?) Yeah I really wish I'd thought   this through. Quesnay concluded that landlords are not productive, which led to some serious cope from the   landed gentry at the time. How times change. Quesnay argued that what we now call the primary   sector - agriculture fishing forestry - was the only  sector that was productive.
(07:38) Those who transformed   the raw materials - manufacturers, artisans - were not productive, even if they were useful in some sense.   The third sector was the unproductive 'sterile  class' such as landlords, nobility, and clergy.   They simply sucked value out of the rest of the  economy and gave it to themselves. How times change.
(07:57) William Petty did not have a theory of value when  he classed clothes, housing, and food as productive   and everything else as unproductive. Quesnay's  approach was more systematic and allowed him   to build the first ever model of the economy.
(08:12) The  Tableau Economique allowed him to explore how wealth   was generated and who it went to. But today we  don't think of agriculture and mining as the only   value-creating sectors. In the 18th Century, the  main challenge to the physiocrats came from the   classical economists. Adam Smith argued that all  value came from labour.
(08:29) You could labour on a farm   and grow food or you could labour in a factory and  make clothes. Both would add value in proportion   to the time labourers spent on production. Like  Quesnay before him, Smith drew a distinction between   productive and unproductive sectors of the economy.
(08:48) He stated that labor is only productive when it is   'realised' in a permanent object. This is a common  intuition: people often complain that "we don't   make things anymore". Making something you can 'drop on your foot' is seen as more real than entering   numbers into a spreadsheet.
(09:04) Smith also thought  of governments as unproductive, an interpretation   which continues to this day. Unproductive workers  like those in services and in government only   consumed value. This led to Smith's theory of value. If the unproductive labourers were not to starve,   the productive ones must sustain them.
(09:22) Therefore  the productive workers needed to create a surplus   over and above what they consumed. The surplus  would be shared with the unproductive workers.   This led to Smith's call for the investment  of surplus into productive labor only, where   possible. Both Smith and Quesnay were a great deal more sophisticated than the theories that preceded   them.
(09:45) For example, much earlier Mercantilists  thought that value only came from this:   gold. (Obviously I don't own any gold so I can't  actually hold any up). But this didn't make much   sense - Spain had accrued masses of gold from its  colonies but the Spanish didn't seem to be getting   any more productive. How times change.
(10:03) There was still an arbitrary and political feel to these   theories of value. Quesnay could never explain why  turning wood into a beautiful chair didn't add   value. Smith could never explain why labouring as  a service worker like a cleaner didn't add value.   Any answer you give to these questions is kind of  arbitrary: for all you Ben Shapiro fans out there,   logically you are often guilty of 'begging the  question'.
(10:26) Assuming only certain sectors of the   economy create value then concluding that those  sectors are the most important politically. Both   Smith and Quesnay had it in for the idle classes  such as landlords and nobility. Quesnay's taxonomy   was used to defend the old agrarian order.  Smith's was used in defense of the up and   coming industrial class.
(10:48) The political context  of theories of value is going to be a bit of a   theme in this video. But can we place our theory  of value on surer footing? There was one   economist who really dedicated himself to figuring  out a theory of value. I am of course, talking about...   David Ricardo. Ricardo felt that Smith couldn't  explain how value was distributed between classes.  
(11:05) This was a massively important question for any  theory of value. We can't just look at production   and how much wealth is created in total; we need  to understand who the wealth goes to and why.   Ricardo was meticulous in building up his theory. In line with Adam Smith, value was proportional   to labour time in production.
(11:30) In line with Francois  Quesnay, Ricardo thought agriculture was especially   important. In Ricardo's Theory, workers were  paid as much as they needed to eat and no more.   The more productive agriculture, the lower the  price of food. This meant lower wages to pay   for the cheap food, which implied higher profits  for capitalists since wages were a cost for them.   Higher profits meant more investment and higher  economic growth.
(11:54) But Ricardo wasn't optimistic   about this growth. Growth and investment would  mean a bigger population. A bigger population would   mean more land came into use. This would bring in  'marginal land', which was less productive, increasing   food prices and therefore increasing wages.
(12:14) Rising  wages would squeeze the industrial sector and   therefore investment. But the real villains  for Ricardo were, of course, landlords. While   wages would rise this would only pay for workers'  food. Workers weren't getting rich; landlords were.   The landlords who own the highest quality land  would get more for every pound they invested.   With food prices high, they would be able to  extract more profit from the economy.
(12:38) This is   what Ricardo called "rent", an idea which is still  used in economics today. "Rent-seeking" is trying to   gain unearned income which results from monopoly power. In this case, monopoly power over land.   In agreement with Smith, Ricardo pitted the  evil landlords against the hero industrialists.  
(12:59) Despite its many merits, Ricardo's model has  a number of obvious problems. Agricultural   productivity has not stagnated as he  thought it would. Workers' wages have   risen above subsistence level. Economic  growth continued for a long time after   he thought it would stagnate.
(13:18) But Ricardo was  the first to attempt to build a systematic   scientific framework from his theory  of value. And he wouldn't be the last. Until now, this was the only way to get juice  from an orange. You mean there's a better way? (UE attempting to make orange juice) Does squeezing this orange against my eye create  value? Every theory of value we've considered so   far would answer this question subjectively. (Uh, hey everyone.
(13:58) So when I said subjectively here I   actually meant objectively. The theories of value  we've considered so far are objective theories   of value. That's a pretty crucial distinction  for me to get wrong). The physiocrats would say   that I'm just transforming the value created by  nature when It produced the orange.
(14:13) Adam Smith   would say that I'm creating the juice, which is  tangible, so I am creating value. Ricardo would   say that I'm not rent seeking because I don't  have a monopoly over orange juice production.   (Yet).
(14:30) But by the end of the 19th Century there were  a whole group of people who said "look, none of this   makes any sense! I mean sure, you're doing a good  job of producing the orange juice in the most   efficient way possible, but what if you spend all  that time making it but nobody wants it?" Classical   thinkers highlighted the production boundary: what  separates productive from unproductive activity? A   group of economists called the marginalists or  sometimes the neoclassicals thought value was   subjective. Instead of determining objectively what  was classified as productive and what wasn't, they  
(14:58) went in reverse. Anything that fetched a  price on the market was productive simply   because somebody wanted it. This made the whole debate easier and ironically, less subjective. Things   which were not sold were outside the production  boundary. This included government, which had   to extract revenue from the market economy to  function.
(15:19) Things which were sold were inside the   production boundary. This included: sponsorships!  Hey, imagine if you only got your economic news   from the physiocrats. Every time they reported  something they'd be like "...and of course, this all   relates back to the soil".
(15:35) While this would make  sense for something like the War in Ukraine -  which is actually related to Ukraine's role in  providing wheat for Europe and the rest of the   world - it wouldn't make as much sense for the  train strikes or vaccine patents. Today's video   is sponsored by Ground News.
(15:52) This website Compares how different news stories are being covered by   outlets around the world and across the political  Spectrum. Ground News filter stories according to   whether they're coming from the left, the right,  or the center. For example, Canada's Prime Minister   Justin Trudeau recently said that the Ukraine  war was accelerating the end of fossil fuels.
(16:08) He   says that we've realised being reliant on energy  imports from Russia may not be the best approach.   This raises some points worth discussing for the  left but was only reported by the right. Ground   News puts all the world's media in one place.
(16:24) I've  found it really useful for getting a balanced   view of the news and identifying my blind spots. I  love making these videos and sponsors like Ground   News allow me to keep the channel going. You can  sign up for Ground News for free by clicking the   link in the bio or the top comment.
(16:40) You can also  subscribe for additional features and to support   a small independent company trying to help people  navigate our increasingly complex media landscape.   Subjective Value Theory showed that value was a  reward for creating something that people found   useful. This also functioned conveniently as a  theory of distribution.
(16:59) If commodities were bought   and sold for what they were worth, it wasn't a  stretch to suggest that this applied to labour   too. A hairdresser will be paid more if their  haircuts are super cool, like mine. This line of   thinking is related to what's called 'marginal  productivity theory': the pay of every 'factor of   production' depends on the amount it contributes to that production.
(17:21) This applies not only to labour but   to capital too. Each were rewarded justly in line  with their productivity. Profit was just the reward   for capital and wages were the reward for labour.  So there was no need to kick up a fuss about the   distribution of income. As the originator of the  theory John Bates Clark put it: Clark was a little bit wrong about his own theory   so we're gonna have to learn a bit more about it.
(18:14)   You didn't think you'd get away from an Unlearning   Economics video without a dense technical section  now, did you? The theory of marginal productivity   works like this. Imagine we have some land and we  want to employ workers to produce wheat. One worker   on the land is able to produce 10 kilograms  of wheat in a season. Two are able to produce   18 kilograms. Three are able to produce 24. These  are all in the 'total product' column of our table.  
(18:41) If we divide the total product by the number  of workers, we will of course get the average   product per worker. If one worker produces  10kg then the average is obviously 10. If   two workers produce 18kg then the average  is 9. If three workers produce 24kg then   the average is 8. Yet marginal productivity  theory is not concerned with these averages.
(19:05) The   'marginal product' is the increase in output from  adding one more worker, shown in the fourth column.   Adding the first worker again increases output  from zero to ten kilograms, a 10kg increase. But adding the second only increases it by 8kg, up to  18 in total.
(19:25) Adding the third increases it by six   so 24 in total. According to marginal productivity  theory, workers are paid their marginal product,   not their average. If the farmer employs all  three workers, they will be paid the marginal   productivity of the third worker: 6 kilograms of  wheat or whatever that sells for. Hardly fair, since   the first worker contributes 10 kilograms  in marginal product but gets paid only six.  
(19:52) So this is a far cry from John Bates Clarks "he  receives all that he creates". But wait how do we   even order the workers in our example. In a team,  who counts as number one and who counts as number   three? Suppose me and Sam from We're in Hell and  James from Chill Goblin are all working on a field   one day - and we probably will be when the climate  crisis really hits and YouTube inevitably dies.
(20:16) If   I arrive first one day is my marginal productivity  10 kilograms of wheat, but when I arrive the next   day and Sam and James are already at work, is  my marginal productivity now six kilograms?   Yesterday I was the first worker but today I'm the  third? There are even more complications.
(20:33) Marginal   productivity theory makes some sense when you're  talking about adding workers to a field. It makes   less sense when production is done in teams. Imagine two people moving a heavy box. What   are their individual marginal productivities? if  they're the first worker then zero because they   can't lift the box by themselves.
(20:53) If they're  the second worker then a hundred percent   because the workers can now lift the box. They  go from not moving the box at all to moving it   successfully with the addition of the second  worker. Yet you can't pay both workers either   zero percent or a hundred percent of the value  of moving the box. You can broaden this argument.   Especially in a modern complex economy, there  are lots of intersecting roles and it's   difficult to disentangle their individual marginal  productivities.
(21:20) What is, for instance, the marginal   productivity of an accountant? A given company  will need everything from accountants to cleaners   to managers and trying to figure out what their  individual productivities are is difficult, if not   impossible.
(21:38) The product is a property of the whole  company or maybe even of the whole economy, because   everything's so intertwined. Now, if your first name  is Mike and your second name is Roeconomist, you   might be typing something furiously along the  lines of: This is true of scientific theories. But the core of marginal productivity theory is untestable - or circular reasoning for all you   Jordan Peterson fans out there - as Joan Robinson  remarked: Numerous areas of economics use marginal productivity theory  
(23:01) and some of these yield testable predictions.  It's nice to be able to test a theory of value   scientifically! But these areas of economics  can be inconsistent with each other. Models which predict that the minimum wage will  increase unemployment and those which predict   that it will actually reduce unemployment both  rest on marginal productivity theory in some way.  
(23:21) The nub of the theory is difficult, if not  impossible, to falsify - you have to beef It up   with extra assumptions to make it testable. This  doesn't matter if people are just using it as a   helpful device to understand the labor market, as  many economists do, but as you should have realised   by now, theories of value rarely serve this purely  scientific neutral purpose when Lloyd Blankfein   said that Goldman Sachs employees are the most  productive in the world he was operating under   a bastardised version of marginal productivity  theory. The full quote is actually:
(24:08) Employees of Goldman Sachs are paid a lot, therefore they must be   worth a lot. If they weren't then Goldman Sachs  wouldn't pay them that much, right? As Robinson said,   this argument is completely circular. We have no  measure of value other than the pay of the Goldman   Sachs employees.
(24:29) John Bates Clark actually came up  with marginal productivity theory during a time   of labour unrest. It was a direct rebuke to unions  who said they weren't being paid their worth. Yet   we've seen that it's not possible to go from the  technical theory to a moral theory of who deserves   what. Even assuming a highly simplified world, the  order of the workers is arbitrary.
(24:48) You can't say   that one marginal productivity applies to all of  them. Clark interpreted his own theory incorrectly   for ideological reasons. Look, let's put all of  my previous critiques aside. I could believe in   marginal productivity theory - you know, if I wanted  to be wrong - and still be an anti-capitalist.
(25:07) All   I'd have to say is that although capital is  productive, the workers should own it or maybe   the state. Then it would be irrelevant the capital  and labour are both productive. The wealth produced   by capital would still go to the people who owned  it; they just wouldn't be capitalists anymore.
(25:23) This   point has been made by economists who are left  leaning but who still use marginal productivity   theory. As Paul Krugman said: The theory of marginal productivity has virtually nothing to say about how the economy is organised in the first place. Speaking of which...   The eagle-eyed among you may have noticed a  teeny tiny little gap in my history of theories   of value. I haven't mentioned...Thomas Malthus. No  no no no. Enough, enough. Let's talk about Marx.  
(26:02) Karl Heinrich Marx. I can't start the section  like that people are just gonna want to punch me   in the face. Marx set out to answer the central  questions that we posed at the start of this   video. Chief among them was: how does capitalism  produce a surplus? Capitalists individually make   profit and output as a whole also grows.
(26:28) This  was historically unique, so what explained it?   According to Marx, we can think of the problem  like this. Capitalists employ both labour and   capital in the production process. Marx called  capital itself constant capital, denoted by C.   Constant capital cannot add more value in  production than it is paid. If a capitalist buys a   machine for ten thousand pounds then the machine  adds ten thousand pounds of value in production   over the course of its lifetime. Marx called  labour variable capital, denoted by V.
(26:58) Variable   capital can add more value in production than  it is paid. This is what is unique about labour   in a capitalist economy: it produces surplus value  for capitalists. Workers may be paid ten thousand   pounds a year but create twenty thousand pounds.  which means ten thousand pounds in surplus value.   Workers are exploited under capitalism  to create surplus value for capitalists.  
(27:23) The rate of exploitation can be expressed as  surplus value s over variable capital V. The extra   value produced by labourers for capitalists,  divided by the total value they produce.   In our example, there is an exploitation rate  of 10,000 pounds divided by 10,000 pounds,   which is one - or 100%.
(27:47) The workers  create twice as much value as they are paid so   their exploitation rate is 100%. The labour theory of value is the default lens   through which left YouTubers view capitalism.  Unlike marginal productivity theory, there is   no risk of concluding capital deserves what  it gets. The labour theory of value is also a   theory of where profits come from, how capitalism  grows, and why it faces intermittent crises.
(28:11) Here   is something. Over half of all lefty content  creators - I'm confident in this - and I'm not   saying fans I'm saying the actual people you  watch - cannot explain to you like the labour   value theory they wouldn't be able to do it. And  if they can if they can stumble through like   s
(28:31) ome haphazard explanation of what LVT is, they're  not going to comprehend it. Destiny...has a point (UE dying) Sorry, the words got stuck in my throat. There isn't  enough critical thinking about the labour theory   of value on left YouTube. Here is the channel  NonCompete, describing the labour theory of value.   Now there are basically just two major classes:  the capitalists who own the means of production,   the factories and farms and other businesses  of the world, and the workers who perform the   labour that keeps the wheels of the economy turning.  Capitalists not only own the means of production  
(28:58) but they also get to keep a significant cut  of whatever the worker earns or produces in   the form of profit. Basically, capitalist bosses  steal labour value from workers and transfer that   wealth to themselves. In order for capitalist  institutions to survive, they have to turn a   profit for the capitalists who own them, otherwise  they'll be forced out of business by more ruthless   competitors.
(29:21) They sometimes go through the ins and  outs of the theory but they never really evaluate   it critically. Here is the prominent YouTuber  Tiffany Ferguson doing something pretty similar.   The labor of workers produces value. Essentially,  the capitalist owns the means of production   and the workers are exploited because because  the bosses have all the power. When the LTV is   introduced it's often presented as some kind of  secret truth: "Hey, didn't you hear? Labour creates   value. Therefore capitalism is bad!" Well, we can see a revived industrial antagonism. Workers saying:  
(29:51) "we're workers and we don't want a surplus value  to be extracted from our labour". Is it fair for   me to critique these non-economics YouTubers for  brief comments in their otherwise enjoyable videos? No I want to encourage you to think of the  labour theory of value as a model, just like   marginal productivity theory.
(30:15) Assuming labour  creates all value and building up a theory from   that is just one way of looking at the world.  We can examine the different assumptions and   implications of the theory. One old interpretation  is that labor value determines price. Smith and   Ricardo were more wedded to this idea than  Marx was. But counter examples to this abound.   As many tedious memes communicate, spending  time labouring on something doesn't guarantee   that it will fetch a higher price on the market.
(30:42)   I spent three hours drawing this picture of me   and Hobbie making this video, but I doubt  it would fetch as much on the market as if... Banksy drew it? (I don't know anything about art).  There are several answers to this conundrum. Marx   thought something only had a price or an exchange  value if it had a use value: people wanted it. Even   if we take something people want, like this picture,  the fact that it would take me longer than Banksy   to produce it does not falsify the labour theory  of value. For Marx, labour value is determined not  
(31:13) by the time an individual spends labouring but  by something called 'socially necessary labour time'. This is a kind of societal average of the labor time  needed to produce a given commodity. But hold on a   cotton picking minute.
(31:50) We are coming back to the  same problem we had with marginal productivity   theory. We have no measure of the exchange  value other than the market: do people pay for it,   and if so how much? We also have no measure of the  value of socially necessary labor time other than   wages. We're back to the circularity of theories  which attempt to explain prices via prices.
(32:11) For   all you Stephen Crowder fans out there, it's more  than just circular logic; it's a tautology. The idea   that socially necessary labor time equals value is  a definition, according to Marx. For Marx, exchange value is just the expression of labour under capitalism. I'm going to ask what I hope is a disarmingly simple question:   why does only labor create value? This is an  assumption which is treated as an irrefutable   truth. But if constant Capital C if you remember  create Surplus Value then the whole theory falls  
(33:05) apart. I was recently a London Grammar gig in  Crystal Palace. There were massive speakers   which multiplied the volume of the band probably  by like 10 decibels or something. (I don't know   anything about music). You've got to give me a good  reason these speakers did not generate surplus   value. Without them, the gig would have been pretty  quiet and nobody would have gone.
(33:27) The same is true   of the band of course but why is labour special?  Marx's theory of exploitation assumes that labor   values underlie capitalism. The fact that labor  is not paid its true value underlies the charge   of exploitation of workers.
(34:04) As David Ellerman  puts it, this appeal to value can feel kind of mystical: You can easily do this with any commodity. Ellerman uses   the example of apples. Suppose that the true  value of 10 apples is equal to one bushel of   corn, yet in reality the person selling has to pay  15 apples for one bushel of corn. As with the labour   theory of value, the actual amount paid differs  from the underlying value.
(34:27) Ellerman continues in   what I can only assume is a slightly irritable tone: This example is obviously ridiculous, but its basic  setup is no different from Marx's theories. What is  
(35:47) going on here again is a mix-up between ideology  and science. Labour occupies a special status in the   minds of many leftists for political reasons ones  I tend to agree with. We can all appreciate the   contrast between the hard-working warehouse staff  and the supervisor who just stands there trying to   look important. I've know you for 10 years and I have never  seen you organise a party.
(36:12) Bollox! What about my   birthday party last year? Your mum organised  that. Yeah! Under my supervision! Some Marxists   insist there is no such judgment embedded in the  label of exploitation. I think this is , the   same as when mainstream economists say a policy  will enhance welfare but somehow aren't making   a prescriptive recommendation.
(36:33) We all know what  people, including the ones presenting the analysis,   are going to take away from it. But that's just  my opinion. For now, let's take the labour theory   of value as an assumption and see where it leads  us. As with most economic theories, this creates a   w
(37:01) hole mess of crap that requires advanced training  in mathematics to solve. So...let's get to it!   There are two avenues we can go down if we  want to treat the labour theory of value as   a scientific theory. The first is to try and use  it to explain where prices come from. Even if we   can't always predict every individual price, we  may be able to get an important tendencies. But   getting from values to prices and back again is  far from easy.
(37:23) If they're able to trick you into   thinking- if you ask them a basic question like  "oh well like um, what do you think about like   the transformation problem?" they'll just give  you like a dead stare. Trans-for-may-shon prob-lem?   Alright, let's help Destiny out here.  What is the transformation problem? Well,   value itself is not an observable phenomenon.
(37:45)   When we work out the maths of the labor theory   of value, we get answers in terms of value rather  than in terms of observables like prices, profit,   or output. But if we're going to test the theory in  the real world, we're going to need things we can   actually measure. Transforming immeasurable values  into measurable prices is the problem we face.  
(38:05) The transformation problem. Let's learn a little  bit more about this. I'm going to use the simplest   example I could find which actually came from  Wikipedia. If you don't fully get it, then don't   worry too much - just move on to the next section.
(38:22)   The idea is more about the mismatch between   prices and values than it is about the specific  mathematical example. Imagine an economy of hunters   where workers can hunt either deer or beavers.  The amount of labour required to hunt a deer is   two hours and the amount required to hunt a beaver  is one hour.
(38:40) In this case, it's clear that one deer   will exchange for two beavers. One deer takes two  hours to hunt. Two hours of hunting could instead   get you two beavers. If the price of a deer were  put up to three beavers, it would effectively cost   three hours of labour. The buyer could just switch  to hunting deer and put in two hours to get one.  
(38:57) This holds for any values of the labour  time required to hunt deer and beavers.   Generally the price of a deer will be Ld over Lb,  where Ld is the labor required to hunt deer and   Lb is the labour required to hunt beavers. Prices  are determined solely by the labor embodied in   the two foods. So the labour theory of value seems  to predict prices in this simple example.
(39:21) Suppose   that to catch deer or beavers you also need arrows.  Now the cost of catching a deer is given by Pd,   which is equal to this nasty looking expression.  The first part on the right shows Ld - again, the   labour required for hunting deers, multiplied by  W, the wage paid to labour.
(39:41) The next part concerns   the arrows. Ad is the number of arrows required  multiplied by Pa, the price of each arrow, multiplied   further by (1+r) which accounts for the  return r paid to the arrow owner, a capitalist   of sorts. Arrows are also produced by labour, which  takes La hours multiplied by the same wage w.   If we put this expression for the price of arrows  into the one for the price of deer we get this.  
(40:06) The one for beavers would look similar,  just with all the d's replaced with b's. We have the competitive market price  of deer and of beavers. Competitive   market prices are just equal to costs, but  let's return to the labour theory of value.   What is the labour time embodied in each food?  We can call this Ed.
(40:29) Well for deer it is simple:   the labor put into hunting the deer Ld plus the  labor from the arrows times the number of arrows.   If you've not followed so far, just note this.  Clearly, this embodied labour time is not the same   expression as the one for price. Ed and Pd will be  equal only in special cases, like the one earlier.  
(40:49) The relative price ratio of deer and beavers  is Pd over Pb - again, this is very different   to the ratios of embodied labour time Ed over  Eb. Labour value doesn't map onto prices in a   capitalist economy. There is a wedge between the  two which is, ironically, introduced by capital   itself. Ironic because Marx was specifically  concerned with understanding capitalism.
(41:17) This disparity is at the heart of  the transformation problem. As you   may be aware, things can get a lot more  complicated than this simple example. But   Marx's preferred method of expressing  everything in labour values always leads   to complications and inconsistencies.
(41:37) In his  famous book Marx After Sraffa, Ian Steedman   states the problem forthrightly. This is a  long quote so I'm gonna take a quick break. Underlying values mean nothing to capitalists,  workers, and consumers. They care about how much  
(43:39) actual money they have. Capitalists take their  decisions in terms of nominal prices - as in the   ones you can see when you go to the shop. They care about the nominal rate of profit  - as in the one they report to their shareholders.  This inconsistency between values and nominal   magnitudes creates a system that's mathematically  unsolvable.
(44:01) You cannot transform values into   prices in this way. What you can do, is model the  economy successfully without appealing to value.   This is why I don't like appealing to underlying  metaphysical concepts. Steedman shows that we can   have an economy as a representation of physical  inputs and outputs.
(44:20) With modern mathematics, we   can add much more than we saw in our simple  example. From this physical representation, we   can calculate prices, profits, and output. There  is no need to transform things into values. It   leads to complications and inconsistencies, kind  of like...um Game of Thrones series 8? (I don't know   anything about television). Okay so that's a lot  of theory.
(44:46) The next time someone tells you to   'read theory' you can safely say that you've done  it. But what about the empirical evidence for the   labour theory of value? If there's good empirical  evidence then surely there's something to the   theory, even if we haven't fully ironed out all  the kinks.
(45:03) Paul Cockshott has produced graphs like   this to try and prove the labour theory of value  predicts prices in a given economic sector. On   the x-axis, we have labour time measured by millions  of full-time equivalent employees in a sector. Time   spent labouring should be highly correlated with  the value of labour on the y-axis.
(45:21) We have value   added in production in billions of dollars. Value  added is dependent on sales and therefore prices.   This seems to show a large correlation between  the time spent in labour and the value produced.   All hail the labour theory of value.
(45:39) The problem is  that a correlation at the level of sectors of the   economy does not guarantee values are correlated  at the individual level. This is known as the   ecological fallacy. If you've watched my previous  video on Jordan Peterson and gender discrimination,   you'll know that I went over it in excruciating  detail. Please don't make me do it again...  
(45:59) Fine, let's do it again! Cockshott's error is actually  pretty simple. Bichler and Nitzan argue that the   correlation can appear just because both the labour  value and output are correlated with the size of   a given sector. Here we have a spreadsheet  they use to illustrate the problem.
(46:17) There are   20 sectors and each produces a different level  of output. The level of output is higher as you   go down the spreadsheet. Each sector also has a  price for its type of output and this is randomly   generated between 1 and 10.
(46:36) Each sector also has a  socially necessary value of labour that's required   to produce its output. Again, randomly generated  between 1 and 10. but in this example the prices   and the labour values are generated independently  so they are not correlated and you can see this   clearly in graph one, which plots them against each  other and finds no relationship.
(46:54) Now what Cockshott  does is compares the total output of a sector to  the total value of that output, which he measures   in labour time. But both of these are obtained by  multiplying price or value by output Q, so in this   column we have Q times P, which is the total output  in money terms.
(47:19) And in this column we have Q times   V, which is the total output in value terms. Now  what this does, multiplying by a common factor,   is that it induces a spurious correlation. You have  total price versus total value in graph three and   you can see that there is indeed a correlation.
(47:38)   You can also regenerate the prices and values -   again completely independently of each other - and  you find that for any values you will actually get   a correlation. This is despite the fact that there  is, by design, no relationship between labour value   and price in this example. Cockshott has replied to  this but I think he misses the key takeaway here.  
(47:57) It's easy to get a correlation between labour time  and value added using examples that do not feature   the labour theory of value. There are a variety  of historical factors which explain the value   added in industries.
(48:13) These factors are likely to  be correlated with the various measures of labour   value used by people like Cockshott. For all you  fans of...um I've run out of charlatans. Steven   Pinker? Didn't he write a new book called  rationality?  sake For all you Steven Pinker fans out there, remember the tautology of  assuming that prices represent values? It's back,   in statistical form.
(48:47) As The Economist Blair Fix  puts it: Fix himself produces the correlation using something called  the egalitarian heuristic which I won't go into   here, but you should check out his post on  the matter if you want to learn more. Getting   p
(49:04) rices from values turns out to be something of  a dead end, a bit like when they tried to...remake   Point Break? (I don't know anything about films  either). I think that's actually two overlapping   repetition jokes now both of them about 5 out  of 10 in quality. Look, we have to forget about   predicting prices. The transformation problem  shows that predicting prices from values is   just not possible. Empirical attempts to do so are  doomed to fail.
(49:26) Aggregate prices can be correlated   with aggregate labour time for all sorts of reasons  that have nothing to do with the LTV. Marxists like   Andrew Kliman have agreed on the redundancy  of this so-called labour theory of price. They   emphasise instead another important prediction  which emerges out of the labour theory of value.   If we can't understand prices, then maybe we  can understand profits.
(49:54) Profit is at the core of value   creation: it's what separates capitalism from other  historical systems. One of Marx's key predictions   concerned how sustainable capitalist profits would  be. If we assume that only labour creates value and   make the further assumption that capitalists will  tend to invest in labour-saving technology then the   volume of capital used in production will increase  relative to the volume of labour.
(50:18) Capitalists will   choose machines over labour to produce output more  easily and efficiently. This means less surplus   value because, remember, capital can't produce  surplus value. According to Marx, less surplus   value means less profit. The rate of profit in a  capitalist economy will therefore decline over   time. This means capitalism's ability to produce a  surplus will wane, causing intermittent crises.
(50:43) Note   that this is not the case if we derive prices and  profits physically, as in the previous section, nor   is it the case if capital creates surplus value, as  I noted in the section before that. One clue as to   which framework is correct is to investigate the  Tendency of the Rate of Profit to Fall empirically.  
(51:00) The TRPF is the theme of a video by another  left YouTuber Hakim. He gives a good overview   of where the theory comes from. Unfortunately, his  evidence section has an argument by citation style   over critical engagement with the evidence. The  video is 9 minutes and 42 seconds long and only   33 seconds of this are devoted to the evidence  that he cites. I will play them in full.
(51:25) Now what   of the empirical evidence? Well entire libraries  have been written on this topic but I'll mention   a few in passing that you can check out yourself  in the further reading section of the pined comment.   Minqi Li, an economist and world systems scholar has  researched this globally.
(51:38) Basu and Manolakos have   found supporting evidence within the US economy.  Several articles looking at the relevant data   have found similar trends in the US and UK economy.  Similarly, Michael Roberts too has found supporting   evidence in the UK economy and globally.
(51:52) Finally,  Cockshott and Cottrell too have contributed immensely   to this discussion. And Cockshott himself  has a fantastic video regarding the fall rate   of profit here. Oh well if there are six STUDIES. Try this rejuvenating lotion. It contains over 60   ingredients> I'm going to have to read these aren't I? For  sake Hakim.
(52:10) Oh  you're gonna   make me read. Many of these papers show the rate  of profit falling in graphs like this, from Michael   Roberts. This just shows the rate of profit over  time, in this case calculated for the UK. The rate   of profit is surplus value divided by variable  capital plus constant capital.
(52:28) In other words,   profit over total cost. There are two different  measures here - one in solid black and the other   dashed - but they broadly show the same thing. Other  papers show it for specific countries or groups of   countries or even the whole world. It usually  looks similar, decreasing over a long period.   How does Robert arrive at this measure? In a 2011  paper, he makes clear that the rate of profit is   a 'whole economy' thing. A we've seen, Marx's theory  doesn't work at the level of individual prices or  
(52:58) even industries. We can only see if profits across  an entire economy fall over time: I decided to investigate this myself  using the most readily available data set: Fred.   There are a few different ways of calculating  things like profit, capital costs and labour costs.   In this graph I followed Robert's suggestion of  doing total GDP minus wages as a measure of profit,   then dividing that by wages plus capital costs. You  can see that there is no noticeable decline in the  
(54:09) rate of profit from 1960 until today in the USA.  You can mess around with these measures: this one   tries corporate profits instead of GDP minus wages.  This may make more sense because it excludes the   government and residential sectors, something  advocated by some Marxist authors. Either way   there is no decline.
(54:33) This one doesn't include  wages and costs - again something advocated by   some authors - again, no decline. Admittedly, this  is just a casual investigation you know me at   home on a mad one with Fred. But it does speak to  the fact that the TRPF is not an obvious feature   of contemporary capitalism which jumps out at  you no matter which data set you use. Unlike, for   example, the gender pay gap.
(54:58) Now, Marx knew that the  rate of profit wouldn't always fall: he identified   'countervailing tendencies': growing populations,  increased exploitation of labour, cheap imports. All   could increase the rate of profit, at least in the  short term. My concern is that these 'countervailing   tendencies' can render the theory unfalsifiable. If  you're not convinced then consider this argument.  
(55:18) Suppose I stated that there was a tendency  for the rate of profit to rise. If you check   the graphs from before some of them do kind  of show it rising. You could then point to   some data showing that it has fallen or  stayed the same, at least in certain time   periods. But then I could say "ah well those are  countervailing tendencies".
(55:40) What would you think?   What, then, would be the use of my theory of  the tendency of the rate of profit to rise?   The best paper cited by Hakim is one by Basu  and Manolakos, which partially addresses this   very question. They go beyond eyeballing simple  graphs of the falling rate of profit by using   modern statistical techniques. One thing they do is  control for so-called countervailing tendencies.  
(56:04) Basu and Manolakos comment that their test is  actually the only way to test the TRPF. Without   controlling for countervailing tendencies, they say  any test is invalid. This is a big claim because   it invalidates every other paper cited by Hakim,  something he doesn't seem to note.
(56:22) They find that   the rate of profit in the U.S economy has declined  by 0.2 percent a year, so all the fancy statistical   tests seem to confirm the Tendency of the Rate  of Profit to Fall. But this is a very gradual   decline and even the authors call the finding  "weak" in their abstract. Again, not noted by Hakim.  
(56:41) Long-term declines after controlling for a lot of  important things in the economy just may not be   that interesting. And this is just one paper, we  need consistent replication to be sure. Another   slightly different interpretation of the TRPF is  mentioned on another paper in the list. In this   instance, it isn't a vague long-term trend but a  recurring phenomenon that leads to crises before   profitability is restored. Once more, the cumulative  pressure from the falling rate of profit affects  
(57:10) capitalists' behaviour. They experience a crisis of  profitability and crackdown on labour; speculate   on pictures of monkeys; capture the state and so  on. These responses to the decline of the rate of   profit are evidence of its importance.
(57:28) If true,  they're also a pretty solid argument for why   capitalism is doomed to fail. Yet even if this is  observed, I'm not convinced that it is evidence for   the labour theory of value. According to the Marxist  David Harvey, a falling rate of profit can be   explained in many different ways: Many graphs of the rate of profit are  
(58:41) dominated by the exact historical episode  referenced by Harvey. Here is the British rate   of profit in the latter half of the 19th Century,  which clearly does not decline. Here is the British   rate of profit with the 20th Century included. Look  how big the decline is after World War II compared   to anything else going on.
(59:05) This could easily be  the outcome of a specific historical episode   rather than a general tendency. The question  is more "what the hell happened here?" than "what   mystical underlying force can we attribute this to?"  Whether or not the tendency for the rate of profit   to fall is true, we'll want to take a historical  perspective to understand each case.
(59:22) Harvey has   similarly stated that crisis theory doesn't  benefit much from invoking the TRPF: The TRPF becomes more like a lens through which  Marxists view the world. It's unfalsifiable,   something acknowledged explicitly by some  authors. Whatever happens to the rate of profit is   interpreted through Marx's categories of surplus  labor and exploitation and the 'organic composition   of capital'. But like Cockshott's correlation between  labour time and value-added it's quite easy to come  
(1:00:33) up with a story that produces the falling rate  of profit. Look I'm not outright dismissing the   enterprise of investigating the labour theory  of value empirically. A lot of economics has   suffered from a lack of data for a long time.  Only relatively recently has the mainstream of   the discipline progressed beyond silly theories.
(1:00:56)   But investigating this can feel like a Sisyphean   task. Every time I have one critique of the theory  or evidence there's another interpretation which   I'm told has finally solved the problem once and  for all. The labour theory of value has failed   to explain the dynamics of individual prices or  industries.
(1:01:13) Its adherents have therefore resorted   to doing macroeconomics, the worst of all the  economicses. Sparse data across long time periods   doesn't really lend itself to robust empirical  testing. You have small sample sizes, poor data,   and what are sometimes called 'regime shifts' in the  economy.
(1:01:33) Can we really lump together today and the   19th Century as part of the same statistical  test? Are the data even comparable? There are   interesting developments in Marxist economics  that I will be sure to keep an eye on, but right   now the empirical findings are just too weak to  provide convincing evidence of the LTV. I've never been able to escape the nagging feeling  that theories of value are just a reflection of   the time period.
(1:02:04) The Mercantilists were around at  a time when imperialism was rife and countries   were stealing a lot of gold. They concluded that  precious metals were the source of value. The   physiocrats were around at a time when agriculture  dominated the economy. They concluded that the soil   was the source of value.
(1:02:21) The classicals were around  at a time when industry began to take over the   economy. They concluded that industrial labor was  the source of value. Marx came up with a version of   the same theory that addressed the misery caused  by industrial capitalism. The neoclassicals or   marginalists have emerged during a period of time  when consumption has become more important.
(1:02:38) Their   theory of value centers around subjective utility  from consumption. I know what you're all thinking...   ...we're due a new theory of value. Who knows  what great ideas will come up in the future? Hey, maybe Elon Musk could solve the problem of how  not to be a little .
(1:02:56) If his theory of value's   true then that'll probably double his wealth. I've  always liked the idea of going back to William   Petty's theory of value based on needs. The notion  of essential workers was immediately understood   by everybody at the start of the pandemic. Then  quickly dropped.
(1:03:13) One thing is for sure: theories   of value are called upon to do more work than they  are capable of doing. They purport to serve both   ideological and scientific purposes, yet they seem  to fail at both. Believing in marginal productivity   theory doesn't mean you have to be pro-capitalist,  even though John Bates Clark confused this point   for everybody for a hundred years.
(1:03:34) Believing in the  labour theory of value doesn't mean you have to be   anti-capitalist - Smith and Ricardo certainly  weren't. Ad being anti-capitalist certainly   doesn't mean you have to believe in the labour  theory of value. Having an eye for the fact that   labour has less bargaining power; that there are  monopolies and those things are bad; that crises   happen and that there is an environmental crisis -  none of these things require you to buy into the   labour theory of value.
(1:04:21) As Joan Robinson put it: So should we abandon this so far fruitless  search for a comprehensive theory of value?   Well, no. Theories of value are the best attempts  we have at understanding this goddamn economic   system. Just because we haven't nailed it  yet it doesn't mean the journey hasn't   been worthwhile.
(1:04:55) Again Joan Robinson - who is  actually Munecat - put it best: Think back over this video. Wasn't it fun and  interesting, all that stuff what we talked   about? Discussions of value help us understand how  capitalists make profits, how capitalism expands   output, and how prices are determined.
(1:05:12) In my opinion,  nobody has come up with a satisfactory answer to   the question 'what creates value?' But that doesn't  mean we shouldn't keep asking> See you next time. Hey everyone, thanks for watching this, I'm  recording a little bit after we recorded   the main video.
(1:05:34) Obviously, doing it on camera  was substantially more difficult than just   doing a voice over but I hope it was worth  it. Um yeah I think um the the kitchen audio.   I- me and Hobbie probably notice it more than you  more than you will because obviously it's our   creation so we're uh pretty, we're like pretty  fastidious about it.
(1:05:57) But yeah the kitchen audio   was really really grating me so I won't be  recording for long in that kitchen again. It's   just so echoey but you know it was worth it for-  to be able to squeeze an orange against my face.   Anyway thank you so much uh to my patrons who are  scrolling by the screen as you watch this, thank   you so much to my producer Hobbie um and thank  you to everybody who did who did quotes for me   and yeah I think uh I've said everything that  needs to be said about theories of value in the   video to be honest there's no point in going over  it anymore, but uh it's such an interesting area  
(1:06:29) I- I really I really do love it, even though I also  think that uh most most people who who uh promote   one or the other are basically full of . So  anyway I'll see you all soon and you know I feel   like I say this at the end of every video my next  video I'm gonna I'm actually just gonna do a short   video like it's going to be short.
(1:06:54) I'm not saying  my next video that I'm planning will actually be   short and then just pre- like because I want it to  be. I'm saying I'm designing a video to be short   that's about something that's much more narrow  than like value so I'll see you all then. Bye!
