Transcript:
(00:00) why do you refuse to condemn Hamas when in fact you know it's actually so easy to do that and there are there are repercussions for not playing that game I'm not passing judgment on Hamas because Hamas For Better or For Worse ended up being the only resistance organization that expressed this Duty not right but duty of the people of Gaza of the people of Palestine generally to bring down the wall I want ask you about um the European left intelligencia give me Donald Trump anytime give me a fascist seriously you know I want to see
(00:40) the enemy uh to look who stares at me and says you know you shouldn't have the right to exist I'm going to wipe you out that that that you know I can handle that I cannot handle comrades who are um out of spinelessness they they crave the appreciation of the people who are complicit in the genocide of Palestinians and that is worse for me is a worse failure moral failure than being his Hest hello everyone I'm ran cic and this is dispatches as the genocide in Gaza accelerates it's clear that the depths
(01:21) of Israeli and US depravity know no bounds no matter what Israel does whether intentionally killing Aid workers or summarily executing doctors at hospitals in Gaza the media covers it up with pared claims about a Hamas presence while us spokespeople harp on the tired talking point about the need to protect Israel's security Above All Else and the Europeans either applaud their us Masters or shrug as if totally powerless to stop their settler vassel State joining me to discuss this and more is jannis veracis Economist
(01:59) political leader for for Greek Finance Minister and the author of many books including his latest techn feudalism what killed capitalism he's also co-founder of the international Grassroots movement dm25 and a professor of Economics at the University of Athens but before we jump into it this is just part of this episode the full interview is available to breakthrough news members only you can become a member at patreon.

(03:00) in Gaza and the killing of those seven Aid workers with the world Central Kitchen in Gaza by the Israelis we're going to talk about some other tangentially related things but just you know very briefly what are your thoughts on these latest atrocities because it does feel like every day you think it can't get worse and Israel does something worse indeed uh the the greatest worry I have with every such atrocity beyond the fact that I can't sleep at night the thought that all these crimes against humanity are being perpetrated in my
(03:35) name uh in the name of um citizens of Europe in the name of the West to which for better of awar I supposedly belong uh my greatest worry is the process of desensitizing public opinion uh because with the escalation of the death doll of the kill rate by the F uh it's really very hard to keep up the pace of one's outrage uh in conjunction prata with the actual outrage and so it's so very easy for people say oh well so how many people were killed today in in what hospital only 50 oh okay well yesterday
(04:22) 60 were killed so this process of desensitizing public opinion uh I have no doubt that it's um it's an intricate part of the strategy of um the Israeli warmongers of the ones who are actually planning those atrocities these atrocities are not accidents they are not the result of some Rogue Israeli kernel um making decisions on the ground this is a strategy and uh in conjunction with the toxic hypocrisy coming from Washington from Berlin from London from Athens uh it I I I suffocate I I personally feel I'm
(05:06) suffocating I that's a really good way to put it and I like the idea the word toxic hypocrisy um it really is just completely stunning and you know Yannis one thing that I want to to ask you about specifically is you know after just a few days I think after October 7th you did something I really appreciated and that is in an interview you refus to play the game of condemning Hamas and you have continued to refuse to play play that game um you even said and I'm quoting you the criminals here are not Hamas the criminals are
(05:35) Europeans and the reason that I appreciated this uh so much is because across the political Spectrum in the global North right after October 7th uh everybody was full of condemnation for Hamas condemnation for oober S you know even in some cases if they have expressed sympathy for uh with Palestinians so I'm curious you know nearly six months into this why do you refuse to condemn Hamas when in fact you know it's actually so easy to do that and there are there are repercussions for not playing that game because I've been to Gaza I've been
(06:13) to rala I have seen the infrastructure of aparte I've seen the long cues of Palestinians being ritually humiliated I have seen the uh the open prison camp concentration camp that is Gaza and therefore I know in my bones that any people who have been placed under such conditions for such a very long time have a duty to themselves to bring down the wall to quote Roger Waters and Pink Floyd you know to bring down the bloody wall uh in war as part of the Geneva conven ion it's a recogn recognized duty of prisoners of War to escape what about 2
(07:06) million people who have been encased behind bed wire whose children were malnourished before the 7th of October 60% of kids according to the United Nations were malnourished before the the 7th of October who have no right to travel who have no right to dream they their airport was tore up by the Israeli Army there is no Port uh it Netanyahu himself himself made a point that we will keep them hungry but not to the level of famine he was saying that for years before the 7th of October uh the people who find themselves in
(07:46) that situation would not be human if they didn't try to bring down that wall now I'm not passing judgment on Hamas because Hamas For Better or For Worse ended up being the only resistance organization that expressed this Duty not right but duty of the people of Gaza of the people of Palestine generally to bring down the wall do I agree with Hamas it doesn't matter it is irrelevant because you see the there is this truth reversal here uh allow me to share with you a shocking conversation I had last
(08:26) Thursday with a German uh quite wellknown politician I'm not at Liberty to to mention his name because there was private conversation but he's somebody high up in the esad The Social Democratic party in the German government uh who had the audacity uh he went beyond accusing me of being a Hamas sympathizer he he he effectively um referred to me as somebody who was sympathizing with the Nazis that's a that's a Social Democrat in the German government and his argument was this he said look he said I'm German now why are
(09:03) you as a Greek kicking and screaming about tens of thousands of Palestinian children being killed and at that point my boil my blood started boiling and he said I'm German I condone the fact that hundreds of thousands of children in Germany were killed by the Allies in the context of defeating Hitler so you see what happens here here's a German condoning The Killing tens of hundreds of thousands of German children and by that justifying the tens of thousands of Palestinian children who are being killed by making the association Nazis
(09:44) Gaza which is the most monstrous truth reversal in the history of the last 300 years because essentially the victims who are the Palestinians of ethnic cleansing of um a racial racialized Teran nullius project of treating them as nonhuman before they were ethnically cleansed beginning with a NABA in 1948 the victims are being presented as the Nazis so the condemnation of Hamas is part of this truth reversal because when I said to him you know I was trying to keep my cool right and I said to him at some point you you're part of a
(10:31) government that believes in the two-state solution yes yes well you are aiding and abetting the Prime Minister Mr Netanyahu and the whole cabal everybody who is in that government and every and you know many guns who will replace him if somebody replaces him uh who do not believe in the two-state solution who reson the whole point of their existence they came to this world to kill the two- State Solution that's what they did after the Palestinians mistakenly as it turns out went through the oso Accords and you know the
(11:04) Palestinian Authority and the PLO recognized Israel Israel never recognized pal Palestine they recognized the pillow uh what did Ariel shiron and then bamin Netanyahu set out to do to kill off any chances of a two-state solution and you supporting H and why why is Hamas a topic of discussion because Netanyahu succeeded in killing off the two-state solution yeah in 1992 Hamas was irrelevant so the direction of causality the the relation between cause and effect is Netanyahu and his cabal killed off the two- State solution and that
(11:49) gave rise to Hamas and here is the German government saying that because there is Hamas there can be no two-state solution you see you have truth reversal after truth truth rever reveral and who was the the author the guru of Truth reversal Joseph gibles he very proud of them yes and his uh I guess his uh the people who are like him today are like Matt Miller and these spokes people at the state department watching them drives me crazy but you know I think this goes into another point that I've often seen you make Giannis which is uh
(12:29) it's about the timeline this truth reversal you're talking about it's also when began like what began when right um it's not just that it didn't start on October 7th but Israel's supporters are excellent at starting the timeline whenever it's most convenient to their narrative and it's something the US does very well too they have to you know they have to take land for their security to prevent another October 7th from happening but they'll just pretend it wasn't you know all a result of the fact
(12:57) that they've been stealing This Land since even before 1948 and then you know they do the same thing with Lebanon as well they'll say oh like his B is in Lebanon so the fact that it exists is why they have to bomb Lebanon but they bombed Lebanon before hisb existed and that's actually why hisb exists umed it's such a convenient narrative and I I I'm I guess I'm just adding to what you're saying but I like the idea of calling it truth reversal another thing I'm curious if I can get your your
(13:26) comment on here is it's always portrayed in this this um and this like discussion about Israel security right Israel security and American and Western interests we're you know what I'm beginning to not beginning to understand what I've always understood is that the Middle East is not safe it's not secure with the existence of a settler Colony here like that's the problem and it just comes to the idea of like how come the security of Palestinians and the people in this region don't matter it's always
(13:58) about Israel's security well that's the the result of the manner in which Israel was put together uh and you know speaking of when did the whole thing begin well it began with anti-Semitism in Europe uh we Europeans carried out pogram after pogam against the Jews it wasn't in Israel or Palestine it wasn't just in Jerusalem um the Jews living Jerusalem next to Palestinians lived in Perfect Harmony compared to the life of Jews in Odessa in uh uh Berlin in in Spain from where the Catholics um chucked them out and
(14:45) they ended up where where did they have besides Jerusalem where did the Jews find some Sanctuary it was in Thessaloniki gree's Second City and in Constantinople in Istanbul hello hello hello in the otoman Empire that's where the Jews had uh you know the the greatest amount of security it was in Eastern Europe in Britain in Central Europe in southern Europe in my country I at some point my grandmother when I was you know 10 11 12 she was telling me the stories about how in her Village they would burn the Jew not an effuge of
(15:21) the Jew but anti-Semitism was rampant throughout Europe so that's where it began uh and you know we went from pogram to pog them to the Holocaust that had nothing to do with the Palestinians with the Lebanese with the Arabs absolutely zero to do with that H and then what started as the white supremacist ideology of the British Empire because remember and I was in Australia two or three weeks ago and uh I had the opportunity of addressing the national press club with all the press in cber in the capital of the uh the
(15:58) federal capital of of Australia I said to them folks remember how it all started here in Australia when Captain Cook representing the British Empire came to botony Bay and proclaimed Australia to be tanus an an empty land essentially he looked at all the abor and he said these are not humans it's an empty land uh what how did Zionism set foot in uh in in Palestine under the slogan the vile slogan land without a people for a people without the land now where did they where did they get this from they didn't conjure it up from thin
(16:36) air it's the British Empire Teran logic which they they practice in Kenya they practiced in South Africa okay the natives are not humans therefore we can shoot them okay remember in Australia um the natives acquired uh um Civic rights in 1967 1967 so there's a long tradition of white settler suprem supremacism and Zionism simply copied that and with the help of the British the balur Declaration initially and then of course the United States they created a state which is the equivalent of white supremacism and it's saying it's a land
(17:18) without the people and we will take your land nakba so the moment you say that these are other people that's the beginning of genocide Teran nus is the commencement of genocide and people who actually um commit genocide know that they're doing it it's not an accident like the bombs that killed the humanitarian workers now in Gaza they were intentional and anybody who kills people and throws them of their land feels insecure because immediately he thinks and usually he if I have done this to them their descendants will want to do
(17:56) it to me so when they talk about Israeli security they talking about their insecurity from the fact that they understand that they have committed war crimes and they've committed ethnic cleansing so it is impossible to have in Israeli State security Israel as a Jewish state for it to be secure without completing the genocide of the Palestinians so anybody who talks about the need to preserve the Israeli security talks about completing the genocide of Palestinians let's be clear about that and I wish they were clear
(18:31) about that because you know I recognize a villain who is honest yeah you got to at least appreciate the honesty to some degree I want to ask you about um the European left intelligencia um has has the European left intelligencia taken a good position a bad position I mean we I know that with Russia NATO Ukraine uh it hasn't been the greatest um has that been the same with Gaza and I'm sure it's you know different across country so I don't want to you know put make a blanket statement about the
(19:06) entire European left but what has been your perception of the position people have been taking on Gaza as an indication of my view on this let me tell you that uh in in a few weeks short weeks in at the beginning of June we have the European Parliament election and I will be a candidate amongst other members of my movement across Europe uh I'm telling you now that if I get elected I will refuse to belong to the European left grouping in Brussels they have disgraced themselves uh my CS former CS in Berlin delink the local left party uh they have
(19:50) a long tradition and I'm I've been friends with them and comrades for as long as I remember um there is the Rosa Luxembourg Center in uh the center of former East Berlin which is a great Foundation they've done remarkable work over the decades uh immediately after the 7th of October they bound the Palestinian author from um uh addressing an audience on the basis that she's Palestinian and that and this is not a good time to have a Palestinian in the Rosa I mean poor Rosa Luxemburg she must be spinning at
(20:23) 5,000 revs in her grave that they should be doing this uh and generally you know you mentioned that before first they condemn Hamas then they talk about the right the importance of providing Israeli security then they say but at the same time Palestinians matter as well uh which is um you know give me Donald Trump anytime give me a fascist seriously you know I want to see the enemy uh to look who stares at me and says you know you shouldn't have the right to exist I'm going to wipe you out that that that you know I can handle
(21:01) that I cannot handle comrades who are um out of spinelessness because they're not bad people they're just they're just too scared that you know de spigel or Lemont or um you know Z taon is going to write about them what they write about me that I a Jew hating crazy who's destroyed Grace and whatever you know they they crave the appreciation of the people who are complicit in the genocide of Palestinians and that is worse for me is a worse failure moral failure than being a Zionist you know if you want to be a
(21:42) Zionist being Zionist let's then we can have an interesting conversation and a clash but don't pretend to be on the side of the good and be a humanist Lefty when you're doing that and but then you know allow me to express my very great disappointment over my own kind the left uh because there is the other side as well there are leftists who tragically Veer towards anti-Semitism to say oh what do you expect from the Jews the moment I hear that you know my hair stands on end because that is racist
(22:13) that's anti-semite that's Nazi there's no such thing as the Jews any sentence beginning the Jews are like that is fascist uh it's you know it's like saying the Palestinians are there's so much difference of opinion among Palestinians you can say the Palestinians are being uh victims of genocide but you can't say that the the Palestinians think this way because I you know I I have five Palestinian friends they have 20 different opinions amongst themselves uh so and also on the on on the front of Ukraine because I
(22:44) personally think that that Vladimir Putin is a very vile character I mean I was with Jeremy Corbin my comrade in England we demonstrated in 2001 2001 When Vladimir Putin was the the the favorite son of the West in Moscow Moscow and they supported him to the hilt uh we was demonstrating over the murder of 250,000 chin in gry right so no love lost for Vladimir Putin my I have friends who are in prison in Russia for not for resisting Putin so Putin is a is is a criminal I have no doubt about that but at the same time NATO have
(23:27) created him he's a creation of the United States of America they crushed the Russian people after 1991 they reduced life expectancy amongst men from 78 to 54 years of age there's never been such a reduction in life expectancy in any country even at War and that was a policy of the United States uh to completely squeeze destroy financially the the people of Russia and and then to squeeze to keep breaking their promises to to go to Y and so on keep pushing NATO towards Moscow until that the combination of the humiliation of the
(24:05) Russian people and the milit the NATO expansion created Putin this is how if you humiliate the people and and you squeeze them and that's how Hitler was born it was a result of the humiliation of the German people by the Allies after the first world war and they're squeezing so this is what they've done so I would have liked the left to say neither Puttin or NATO to say we want peace and they this war in Ukraine will have no winners except you know hundreds of thousands of dead people and lots of starving people
(24:40) in Africa and Asia because of the effect the indirect effect of this war on fertilizer prices on wheat prices on corn prices and all that and the left what what they do the left has in Europe been divided 90% of it is NATO is a a Liberation movement which is absurd and the other 10% are prop Putin and some of us are say who are saying neither neither why do I have to take sides between two criminal organizations yeah we are we've been squeezed a tiny tiny minority of leftists yeah I know it's really it's
(25:22) really unfortunate that that's the uh parameters of the of the debate I guess I would put it um um I wanted to ask you in particular there's not even a debate oh no not even a debate not even a debate that's just the parameters of what exists um it sounds actually uh worse than the US in the US I think there's um a bit more maybe not in the mainstream media but in general speaking on the left there's much more Nuance around the issue of NATO but I I think we're also separated from all of that by
(25:53) geography so Russia can't be uh portrayed as the same kind of you know monstrous threat the way it is uh in the European context um but I wanted to ask you specifically about Germany uh because Germany seems like its own its own monster um I first I want to I want to show a clip that I'm sure you've seen But just to remind you and the audience I'm sure you saw this yanis this is a German journalist asking a question to Franchesca albanes the uh un special repor on the occupied Palestinian territories who recently wrote a report
(26:33) uh laying out the case uh uh that Israel is in fact carrying out a genocide in Gaza and I I want to show his question and you're quoting U the president of Israel the Prime Minister the defense minister and uh some uh top militaries um but these are only quotes uh given in speeches or in other circumstances I would like i' like to ask you do you have a written document by the government which with a clear intent to commit genocide do you think that in Rwanda and in Bosnia heroina any government officials wrote wrote a document saying
(27:22) I want to commit genocide have you seen anything like that Al I'll answer this for you no it doesn't work like that there is those okay so I'm going to stop it there but I do encourage people to go see the rest of that video but I thought that was important to play just to kind of segue into Germany because what's wrong with that guy why are just why are Germans like this what's going on in Germany um you know I don't think even Hitler you can correct me if I'm wrong I don't even
(27:52) think Hitler ever you know like maybe he did did he write down in a document I am committing genoci side against the Jews and then all of these other groups um so yeah can you please lay out for our audience from your understanding what is wrong with Germany why are they like this when it comes to Israel well I think that at least 1,000 phds in Psychology are going to be written about this in the next 100 years uh you know the academic uh departments in universi specializing psychology are going to have their work cut out for
(28:33) them so allow me my own non psychologist psychological theory um what happened in Germany is that there's been a combination of a justifiable Collective guilt over the the Holocaust if I were ger I mean I feel that guilt as a Greek because it's it's wrong to put it all on the Germans M because let's not forget that we we had Greek Nazis we had cro Nazis we had sub Nazis sometimes you know the the Greek and the croat Nazis were nastier to the Jews than the German Nazis were their reports of German Nazis uh pulling
(29:13) their hair out at the cruelty towards Jews by the cro Nazis so it's not just Germans right but the Germans understandably and justifiably have a deep-seated uh sense of guilt over the Holocaust at the same time I don't believe that Germany ever properly densified they claim they have densified they have banned Nazi symbols they have banned any party that I mean all the other day the football national team banned the number 44 on the back of the vests because the the fours look like very much like s's you know so 44 looks
(29:53) like SS so they they've done all that but they never had a proper convers ation about you know how was it that such a civilized cultured well educated population managed to you know be trapped in Nazism and to commit those uh uh monstrous crimes in the 1940s before that 1930s and 40s and they never had this conversation properly the result of the collective guilt the formal disavowal of everything that they had done in the 1930s and and and and 40s with the fact that they never had a proper conversation about what led to
(30:35) Nazism and what was naism really it wasn't just some cult that took off and you it wasn't some weed that they smoked and then they all went crazy for 10 years and then they recovered there was there were other things happening for a very long time there uh so this combination the incomplete dentification with the incomplete discussion and the collective guilt has led the vast majority of Germans to uh swap their racist nationalism for Ultra Ultra Zionism so the Germans today are uh they are anti-nationalist they are more
(31:18) pro-european than the French than the Italians because they want to lose themselves in Europe they want to forget that they're German and lose themselves in Europe because they want to go away from this nationalism but something has to take over and replace as a bond between them the nationalism that they are giving away and that's Zionism so ALR Zionism as well so when Angela Mel got up and said the reson the rationale of Germany is the support and the security of the state of Israel I think that's what she was doing
(31:52) she say that well we cannot talk about German nationalism not even patriotism you know progressives in German don't want to talk about patriotism because that reminds him of Hitler uh but it's easy to replace one nationalism for another so in the same way very stupid but I think quite comical allegory when Thatcher privatized British electricity you know she sold it to a French nationalized company so the their own Nation um privatized British electricity similarly in the case of Germany they are taking somebody else's
(32:30) white supremacist ideology Zionism and they replace it for their own at least that's that's my theory by the way that's a good one let me your your your um kindness to plug for meta 25 meta 25 is a political party here in Greece but it is also a political party in Germany we are the only party that has a Greek party and a German party and an Italian party and we're going to run in the election in June under Mera 25 on a platform of turning around the German poity from Zionism towards supporting
(33:10) Palestinian rights and towards supporting a disentanglement of Germany from NATO wow I actually think there there's a huge base that would really really support that uh across Europe they just don't have any representation anywhere so I really look forward to seeing that I was going to ask you since you brought it up um that's a huge platform I mean that's like a huge part of the party's platform but what else does it stand for oh um firstly we we we we we do believe that uh re-energizing the anti-war
(33:43) movement is essential not just against War but also against the militarization of our economies very recently the president of the European Union Council suggested that Europe must try to reindustrialize through developing its own milit Industrial complex which is just remarkable uh just remarkable the second thing is uh uh for the purposes of spreading dignity across Europe uh we believe that the European Central Bank should fund a basic income for all Europeans uh not through taxation but directly through the European Central
(34:15) Bank this sounds a bit like a technical issue but let me put it this way um in the last um 8 years the European Central Bank has printed 11 trillion EUR on behalf of the financiers what we're saying is that it should print five trillion EUR um in order to support the people who deserve uh to live in some dignity in the richest continent in the world and the third that the the costs of the EUR of the of the climate crisis of the climate emergency of the climate catastrophe must not be borne by the poor these are the three planks with
(34:50) which we're running across Europe well that sounds wonderful and I look forward to seeing the results of that and then since we're on the topic of your political party um what do you think I mean is are those are those points lacking in your in the former party you were involved in in Greece uh CA which I believe now has you can correct me if I'm wrong the leader of this party is a is a banker connected to the US is that correct can I enhance your uh apoplexy by that not only she I mean I don't mind people
(35:26) being connected to the US I could be n chumsky right I mean n chsky Wasing happy now the problem is that this particular gentleman and his CV has two words that should make well I don't have any he to stand on end but you do Goldman Sach he he an alumnus of Goldman Sachs need I add more no I mean a hot bed of leftist of leftist radicalization but you see what this shows is this the the party that I joined in 2015 with which I ran was elected Member of Parliament then I became Finance Minister of that first government for
(36:10) six months or so uh that party was a wonderful party I mean our if you look at the platform everything I said to you before was part of that platform and more it connected to the movements it was a party that grew up from the Grassroots initially we were at 4% and we were shot up to 40% as a result of the innan handling of the terrible Greek and European financial crisis by the financiers and by the oligarchs uh and we succeeded it was one of those few very rare occasions when a Grassroots party uh gets elected and gets elected
(36:46) with against the grain of the interest of the oligarchs of the bankers of the of NATO off off off we even had the platform for getting out of NATO right so if you did the text and they were they were they were part and parcel of the DNA of the people who supported us the people who supported us were brilliant and prop Palestinian and so on and so forth and but that is a very good case study in how the rot starts from the head and goes towards the bottom to the tail because once the Prime Minister my dear friend and comrade at the time
(37:25) uh essentially surrendered during that Clash we had with uh the representatives the troa as we call them the representatives of of the worst of the finances around the world and you know the Berlin government and so on he surrendered and he surrendered right at the moment when remember it was a party that started 4% we had gone up to 36 40% and then six months later during this clash with the tra uh we had a referendum and we we won 62% so the people of Greece went came you know sort of came to the party they they they they
(38:02) embraced us they supported us heroically even though you know think about it they had shut down their at ATMs our ATMs had been shut down by the bars that be in Frankfurt in order to uh blackmail the Greek people not support us and they support us with 62% on that night of the referendum it was 5th of July 2015 I would never I would go to my grave with that uh date etched in my heart um he surrendered and I he I spent three hours in his office after midnight trying to convince him to disuade him I failed then I resigned and then what
(38:40) happens is this just this is a great lesson for me the moment you surrender on the big things then you surrender on the small things or the smaller things very soon after that you know the electricity system grid was split up and given away to oligarchs within six months he was hugging Netanyahu and signing deals for oil Dr Drilling and gas drilling and pipelines connecting Israel to Cyprus to Greece thankfully none of that happened but the the deal was there and now Greece is a great supporter of the apide State uh
(39:22) which you can't blame it on the current government which is a very rightwing government but it was our government the one that I just resigned from that initiated it and then from that moment onward everything everything breaks down and you know as I said the rot sets in and that's why some of us had to create another party yeah it's a horrible cycle that just continues and that I want to bring into it um some ideas from your from your latest book on techn feudalism the end of capitalism um and that title
(39:51) you know it kind of gives the impression at least to socialists like me that yay it's the end of capitalism um but don't get excited guys because actually what you're arguing is that it's morphed into something even worse where we're all in service to these you know feudal Tech Lords um so can you explain to to our audience what you mean by techn feudalism and then and it's not because I want to make everything about Gaza it's just I think that this actually plays into it a bit um I'm just curious
(40:20) if after explaining the idea behind techn feudalism um if you could bring it back to Gaza in the sense that that you know these Tech overlords are in fact in charge of the social media mechanisms that we all are getting our information from right now and we were watching a live stream genocide happen on their platforms where they have the capability of really cating and even censoring uh content on Israel's behalf yes well to begin with I I'll I'll take as my Q what you said that techn feudalism is not
(40:54) something to celebrate it's something worse than capitalis much worse than capital that's that that's not entirely my idea um I mentioned Rosa Luxenberg before but I will do it again was it not Rosa who said from her cell from her prison cell that the world is facing a dilemma Socialism or barbarism not capitalism if we don't succeed in creating socialism out of capitalism we are going to end up with barbarism well that's where we are if you enjoyed this episode and want to hear the rest you can access it by
