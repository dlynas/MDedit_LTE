Transcript:
(00:00) oh my God Sam Cedar what a nightmare here he is ladies and gentlemen uh the real Unk the real Uncle Uncle Sam my real Uncle he's here with us on this joyous occasion well not necessarily a joyous occasion but it's a joyous occasion when you're on um but uh you know the things that we will be talking about excited the things that we're going to be talking about are not so joyous uh overall so Sam for those of you who don't know it has a show called The majority report I love the majority report with Sam and Emma and everyone
(00:32) else great show uh watch it all the time uh big fan and I wanted to I wanted to have Uncle Sam on because uh people were people were saying he was a he's a Zionist I thought was very funny but that's not the real reason why I'm having you on it's been a while since I've had you on and I wanted to just like you know check in see how you guys are doing over there um you know it's a  show uh right now it's really uh um I mean we're we're all doing fine on our show but uh
(01:06) it's it's a really ugly time and to have to watch this uh you know every day it's just uh it's it's painful to see this type of of suffering that is um you know that we with our tax dollars with our government are um enabling in many respects um and so that's uh difficult um but you know all things considered um uh we're doing okay yeah um couple things I wanted to get started on uh you so given your your background as um as a Jewish man who is an anti-zionist himself uh I wanted to I
(01:57) wanted to ask you a couple things because I feel like you can speak to this issue as far as like the reception from the audience in a way that I cannot given my background as uh someone who is Muslim like I feel like there are a lot of people who are uh going to be more receptive uh considering your your uh track record in the space for how many years you've uh been engaging in commentary and also being a professional speaker um I I think that uh I just wanted to touch base on your perspective on on some of the issues uh starting off
(02:32) with Jonathan Glazer's uh Speech did you watch zone of Interest I did yeah um he he uh won uh I think best foreign film yeah I think best International best International I mean I don't watch the Oscars as a rule but I did see his speech obviously the you know was clipped and um I mean I certainly you know the big part of his statement which was was um I think by some people misconstrued in other instances like purposefully misconstrued was that he had said and I'm sort of paraphrasing uh but he said uh we stand
(03:15) here now of course the guy you know he's uh just done I I I think it was like a seven eighty year long project for him don't eventure could even been 10 about uh uh Rudolph hess's based upon a novel about Rudolph hes who was the commant of of the death camp owitz and his family live right next door to owitz and um the the film is really like a commentary on of the banality of evil to use Hana rent's title when she wrote about ikan um but about like you know the living next there and how that's how
(04:00) they just sort of live their lives yeah you know without and so so the guy is you know is he's steeped in this and um he said we stand up here I think he was talking for his producers um and refute our jewishness and the Holocaust and that's where like apparently um some reporting put a period The Hollywood Reporter uh I think or no variet did that which is insane like this is a premier uh establishment journalistic outlet for all things Hollywood the fact that they would flub this quote I I don't think it's a
(04:44) mistake I I just like I can't chalk this up as like a simple mistake I think that they wanted to they wanted to draw that out like this is a trade publication that is what they wanted to draw out of that speech I I mean it it whether it was just like incredible incompetence or uh nefarious um regardless people ran with that and the actual statement was we stand up here and refute our Judaism and the Holocaust being used as a shield or justification for um you know uh the onslaught I I don't know how he phrased
(05:27) it um in Gaza and and so the idea and and and that's a sentiment I mean um I think that frankly a lot of Jews uh in this country and around the world feel I mean you hear a lot of the the protesters yelling not our name uh that's what they're talking about is that they're the idea of of of killing civilians and um uh and and what Israel is doing is is really fundamentally contrary to I think a lot of people's perceived uh ideas of Judaism yeah aside um and certainly to see the Holocaust and you know which is
(06:18) you know I I went to Hebrew school three times a week uh as a kid but it was Hebrew was about like number three or four on what we learned we learned about the Holocaust we learn about Israel then he and then cultural things about Judaism and when I went to you know Hebrew school it was only 30 years out from the Holocaust I mean I was 10 in 1975 and um and so you know I had teachers Hebrew school teachers you know with uh uh a number tattoo to their arm and um and the message of the Holocaust at least that we were taught was never
(07:01) again but it wasn't just about Jews it was supposed to be you know never this type of wholesale Slaughter um and so to use the to to see these things invoked as a defense or justification for um this uh genocide uh in Gaza is um beyond the just sort of I think the you don't need to Jewish or religious or anything to to find what's going on there abor but it's one more sort of indignity yeah uh I wanted to show you another thing from variety I'm going to share my screen with you right now so
(07:43) you can uh you can see it uh you can see what I'm uh seeing at least here it is on let's put you back up top um this is the same variety trade publication that uh claimed Ida's artistic director apologize after protest crash opening night with ban Banner calling for destruction of Israel now the banner that was calling for the destruction of Israel of course read and I and this is back from uh November 10th uh was of course from The River To The Sea Palestine will be free now obviously discourse has changed from back then but
(08:16) if you recall this was around the same time when rashidi was censured but uh as a as a trade publication there still uh they still went along with this uh with this narrative that like saying from The River To The Sea Palestine will be free is actually calling for the death and destruction of of Israel at a time when this was the hot button issue so um just some ways in which I think uh even areas that you would not expect being political while using neutral language and objective reporting from a trade publication that like is supposed to
(08:51) cover Hollywood still making uh an assessment making a statement and and showing bias in my opinion oh yeah I mean without a doubt and I mean you don't need it to see it just in the context of Hollywood I think particularly you know there may have been there may be a slight change in tone in some of the news media I think as of late uh but certainly at the beginning and it's there's always been this sort of difference uh to Israel and you know um as someone who is steeped in this as a kid it it it took a long time
(09:32) I think for me to um you know to be fully conscious of that of just how uh you know steeped it is I mean I always knew there was a bias but I think like uh you're really seeing in this conflict because everybody seems to be weighing in I mean you know uh uh you mentioned I've been doing this for a while it's it's actually going to be the 20th anniversary of the majority report in like two or three weeks wow and when we started it on radio um Janine Garo and I uh co-hosted the show and we I think we were one of the
(10:17) few I mean certainly even on the network without a doubt but anywhere on Commercial media I think we were one of the few Outlets where we would regularly criticize Israel um it was not necessarily in um in Vogue it definitely wasn't in Vogue but my critique I think has gotten more sophisticated over the years but um but we were we got a call the day after we said anything negative about Israel from the Israeli Embassy and uh they wanted to send the um the the Ambassador on to the show guy named I think it was pinkis
(10:59) and I think he ultimately did come on to the show and listen to our critique I mean I um uh I I was I was very critical of Chiron and um uh at that time and the occupation broadly speaking but I don't know that I had as uh much Clarity on the history I mean I had a good friend who did a a documentary about um to be fair to be fair I will say this what you're talking about is a time that literally predates the new historian era of Israeli history I feel like or it was like right around the time when the that happened around
(11:45) in the 80s and 90s but I wasn't you know at that age 80s and 90s you know I'm still in my teens uh early 20s and I wasn't but it was there I had a friend uh guy named Benny Bruner and you can see his documentary he did he was a Israeli uh I want to say Dutch and he did the documentary that is available um or he's done many but one which really struck me was um called the Great Book robbery and it's a documentary about um trying to establish that there was in fact the Palestinian the land was not empty there
(12:28) was no there there was a Palestinian culture there was a Palestinian civilization they had um and he and he he makes that case through all the books Palestinian books that were stolen and are actually stored in a Subterranean level in um in the Israeli National Library that you really can't go in and see um and it's it was it was very uh enlightening to me and um uh being aware of like you know because as a kid you're taught like the land was empty etc etc for for a uh what is it for a land without for a
(13:10) people without land for a land without people a land without people for people without land exactly yeah exactly um and so you know my critique has has evolved over the time like I didn't I I don't you know I mean I you saw this exchange I had the other day on my show I I've never really I never labeled myself a Zionist although I think you know maybe I don't know that I was ever a Zionist you know um different people had maybe draw the uh distinctions at at different points uh but I never labeled myself an
(13:52) anti-zionist um because I I I I don't feel like I have to participate in in the the you know in this concept you know I believe incy and I believe in human rights and I believe that if you're occupying uh you know land is legal it's illegal and uh I believe in the concept of of settler colonialism and uh you can make an assessment I think to the extent that I've been called an anti Zionist it's more by people who call themselves Zionist but um I don't I I don't have a problem with it being called an
(14:38) anti-zionist but it's not something that you know I I spend time identifying myself with because frankly rhetorically I don't find it um particularly effective and if it's not effective in me helping change people's minds then I don't I don't employ that type of stuff but but um uh it it's been a very clarifying time where people stand and surprising in some instances too to be honest with you so um would you do you mind elaborating on your own personal Journey I've talked about mine as far as like
(15:17) overcoming National mythology and nationalistic myths that you learn from an early age as uh someone who's Turkish who grew up in Turkey who was a product of both the private and and and public education system in Turkey like uh I have talked about my understanding of the Armenian Genocide and what was taught to me and how I was um how my opinion on it uh uh evolved from an early age despite the uh attempts of indoctrination and I was wondering if you uh because I think there's a very good parallel there with respect to the
(15:54) nakba and also uh Israel's ongoing occupation as an apartheid regime uh and the way that uh the way that this has evolved into full-blown fascism in my opinion in the words not just of mine but also of friend of both of our shows Dr ofer kasif um I I think that it's uh it's it could be uh Illuminating for people who are on their own journey of of self-reflection and education for those who are maybe on like the precipice of understanding uh despite indoctrination from their schooling sure yeah um you know like I
(16:35) said I uh I'm I'm 57 so I um it doesn't show when I well thank you I appreciate that but when I um when I was in elementary school I mean I went for Hebrew education three days a week after uh you know uh regular you know public school um um and until probably I think I was like age I think I went through most of high school even um and uh reformed Jew um and uh you know the people 30 years out I mean were still very much um steeped in the uh the Holocaust and the the idea of Israel that I was taught was a you know
(17:34) Plucky um sort of like a David uh and Goliath story and Israel surrounded on all sides by its enemies and uh how much uh the Arabs hated uh the Israelis and the Jews and it was presented as if this was a sort of like an eternal um uh Str strle of religion and um that the only thing that really saved the Israelis was their sort of like um their their Superior will and they were lucky because their enemies were uh not terribly uh smart like I just remember being taught this story about the Golan Heights about how
(18:22) like the Israelis had spies Who convinced the the syrians to grow trees on the Goan Heights because it would provide shade when they were fighting and so the Israelis knew where to fire their weapons I don't know how that story worked but this is you know you hear it as a child and the idea of questioning like wait how did the Jews get there or like how long how many like it was all just the Holocaust happened the UN said here's Israel and then the Arabs were mad because they don't like Jews there was no sort of material
(19:03) analysis of like hey wait a second how did they you know we were told there was not it was just a desert and they came in and they created irrigation they grew stuff and yeah turned the desert into uh you know a fertile land or whatever exactly and I was uh 15 or 16 and went with my Hebrew class for the summer to Israel which is like a confirmation class program and we traveled up and down the country we worked at a kabut for a period of time and we were in it was in 1982 and um at one point and I feel like it was early on I can't remember exactly
(19:48) but I feel like it was early on in the summer we were up in cesaria and we were in the ruins of this like Coliseum and we saw dozens of Attack Helicopters going low across the Mediterranean North and we're like what's going on I mean it looked like something was going on I mean you know because Israel everybody you know you had soldiers everybody they carry their guns around and you get used to that you know it after a while but like this was something different and within I don't know how much time it was not long maybe
(20:29) we got into the bus or I can't remember um we found out that Israel had I think had attacked uh Beirut and I I just remember I mean I was crying about it I got into an argument with my Rabbi because prior to then it was a preemptive uh uh uh war in ' 67 but we were it was being sold like it was imminent and the Israelis just got to jump the idea was that it's the Israeli Defense Forces they don't they don't start wars of choice that's not what Israel does um and that you know that was my
(21:16) whole sense and I think that was probably the beginning of me becoming you know increasingly uh more skeptical and curious as to like how did this form and you know I went to college and there was really not much um uh you know uh for whatever reason I don't know it it was not I didn't I don't remember studying much about it in college but I was aware I think through the first inata that this was you know I mean things felt like they were changing maybe a little at that time uh and um and then I I just I remember when Chiron
(22:02) went on the Temple Mount and basically lifted uh you know uh uh basically lit a fire um and and became increasingly critical of Israel during that time and I think the Bush Administration was the first Administration where I became aware that they were and probably through interviews I was doing with people on the show that they were um not fulfilling the role role that the US had in the past which was to sort of like pull Israel's worse inclinations back from the brink but we're instead sort of like
(22:39) pushing them you know like giving your you know not just pulling the keys away from your drunk friend but um you know handing them the keys uh despite the fact you bought the car for them in the first place um and uh and for you know uh by you know the Obama era um it was I I would talk about Israel to some extent to some extent uh it was farmed out to uh Michael Brooks who was you know um by the time we got into like the mid the end of the Obama Administration was was hosting the show once a week and he was uh you know had studied foreign
(23:29) policy and was much more I think sort of engaged in it and I think to a certain extent I had just basically given up on Israel and my um my disposition was basically I mean I remember distinctly having um you know arguments about this with you know because among Jews and on like you know email groups I'm on uh this would come up this is times the biggest like political difference I would have with people uh who in many other ways were you know progressives or you know liberals Progressive except Palestine
(24:04) yeah and um I I mean I distinctly remember my the argument I would take with some of these people is like you're you're the one who's endangering Israel the existence of Israel because this this cannot go on the Democratic party you know it was clear like to me like when Tim Kaine you know uh um refus to go see Netanyahu speak in Congress I was like if Tim Kane's doing this you guys have a problem and uh because Israel is going to become increasingly uh isolated and you know 101 15 years from
(24:46) now the you're G to have the Christian Zionist in this country but if a Democrat is in power um they're going to lose their funding and they're going to get increasingly isolated and it's going to be um like a South Africa type of situation except for they won't have they won't take that offramp um Well turns out they they showed you by by being like nope unconditionally in support of Israel actually as the Democratic party I I I don't I I I'm I think that we are now at the um the Apex of that support yeah yes
(25:23) absolutely we will never have a democratic uh Administration that will even come remotely close uh to what the how the Biden Administration is acting um I think you know B Biden um I think is I don't know why but has some unique um I mean you saw that story in the internationalist it's written in this book by Alex um Ward maybe um have you heard the story man yeah that b to um and you know youve probably recounted it but it was you know when when when Bean has to be the one saying to to Joe Biden like hey take
(26:07) it easy we we don't do that uh even though you're saying it's okay for us to kill uh women and children we don't do that when Bean has to be and this is the guy who was participated in the blowing up of the uh Hotel David yeah in uh in 1948 I mean if that guy has to be the voice of reason you know that 's got some particular uh like I don't know blood lust I don't know what it is but um I I think Ryan's assessment on your show was actually pretty interesting where uh Biden is known as a cipher
(26:42) right like he always finds the middle ground on every issue and he's just like a perfect political machine in many ways whether it was uh busing and and segregation desegregation back in the day all the way to you know super Predators crime bill um noticing that like uh learning a lesson from the uh the opposition that he had to Afghanistan and not repeating it with Iraq like all of this stuff um I think all of this stuff uh played a role in him developing his positions but Israel was never really an issue that
(27:17) the Democratic party had even shown a little bit of criticism on with I guess like Obama being uh ironically Obama being considered the except ception almost but like even then Barack Obama obviously on his way out gave $30 billion uh uh in a in a 10year Aid package to Israel for the Iron Dome and and and numerous other instances so like I think he never had like a a reason to develop uh a a middle ofth ground approach so that just kind of stuck with him you know um yeah I me like again that story about um uh
(28:01) ban where you know you get admonished by the leader of the country you be like no we're not going to be that vicious we don't want to associate that there's something else going on there I know Peter Bard came on the program and he had a good explanation he's like if you want to know um you want to sense of like how people where people stand on this you know the 1619 project is a good sort of surrogate um in which to assess like if somebody fundamentally cannot believe that the United States was uh
(28:39) founded as in appreciate the sort of like settler Colonial um origins of the United States and that it's built on uh the genocide of of of the indigenous people here um they will not be able to get it with Israel either um they're just too invested in in the that sort of like uh that myth they can't they can't give it up they're just riding for all settler Colonial genocidal States I mean if you're gonna do for one you might as well do for all he just he loves he loves Australia he loves it all he
(29:18) doesn't care he's like it's great um no yeah it's the best we could do at the time he needs a he needs that NE Neil Gorsuch approach uh and just like be this being the one pet issue that he cares about that is the exact opposite of what you would think from him um yeah but it is interesting because like he he claims to be Irish he claims to be Catholic and these are like currently with the Pope and also with Ireland being historically an ally to the Palestinian plight it is very odd that he would take such a staunch uh Ultra
(29:53) nationalist approach to the matter and the thing is is like it is um I mean I don't think donors explains it I mean I know that he's got some big you know H sain or sibe or whatever that guy that's consistent but but it I I just I think I it's I it's very hard to understand because from a US National Security standpoint there really is not a sense that this is in any way helpful whatsoever oh yeah poy had on the show he like when has Israel ever been helpful uh from a new from a US National
(30:34) Security standpoint uh in in terms of like in practice right it's existence there's an argument maybe there's a beach head there within and uh you know one more opportunity to control uh you know the oil of the neighboring countries um but I mean I don't think he would have paid any type of like political price if in you know November 15 he had said we're calling for a ceasefire I don't think he would have paid a political price um you know we're going to start to pull back on Aid or
(31:06) we're not even going to put an aid package on the table I mean I I it really is um hard to understand uh and it it is um you know just from a Sheely from a political standpoint yeah I mean I think that like the Lloyd Austin in his corner I think are like genuinely warning him of the backlash and the destabilization that Israel's actions are causing um because it is like Israel's uh aggressive ethnic cleansing campaign is no is now far beyond the point of Maintenance and avoidance we've now gotten to an we've now gotten to a
(31:51) point where it's like it's an issue that you have to tackle head on but beyond the the lack of like um Israel's position as an apartheid ethn state is actually helping America with a beach head or a forward operating base with like its own Espionage tools and whatnot um the destabilization it's causing is obviously far outweighing the the benefits that you get from like the Pegasus program or whatever right um but beyond that and this is something that you and I 100% agree on it is horrible domestically it is playing so
(32:27) poor poorly because every single instance where Joseph robinet Brandon goes on stage and says there are red lines but there are actually no red lines like he did on this MSNBC interview the Saturday show with Jonathan capart um when he says that it shows incompetence it looks like he's an old man asleep at the wheel which is why someone like Donald Trump which who also obviously benefits from not being the president while this is going on still is like outperforming Biden by 10 points on the issue of Israel because at
(33:03) least he has consistency in the eyes of those those who are being pulled on the matter where like Trump is consistently bad on Israel but at least he's consistent he's showing strength and support for Israel Biden on the other hand is losing the demographics that he obviously needs for re-election whether it be the Arab vote in key States whether it be the pro Palestinian vote as a younger demographic is clearly overwhelmingly in support of Palestinians now um he's losing out on these key demographics in all states but
(33:38) uh but especially so in places like Michigan obviously and even uh Minnesota and and it is entirely in my opinion due to the fact that he looks weak and and he looks like uh he's asleep at the wheel because what he's saying does not match what people are seeing every time he says oh Israel I've I called him a son of a  or whenever you see a leak in the news about how like he's really going to change Pace on on netanyahu's actions in in Gaza and then uh you see more uh children being slaughtered you see more
(34:13) women and uh children being ruthlessly massacred you see the flower Massacre that occurred um at the humanitarian Aid Convoy uh people are like what the  is this guy doing you're you're losing out on both ends at that point um the the other thing I wanted to say there was another thing I wanted to mention oh benjin nyah's reaction also consistently undermining him makes him look even as a even on the international stage it makes him look like we can't even control our attack dog at this
(34:47) point yeah I I mean I think you know I've been saying for a while that I think like even the age stuff with Biden is a fun fundamentally the subtext there is leadership right like look I if I think somebody can do the job I don't care if they're 110 um it's it's it's a leadership question and so you know he botched this in my estimation with the immigration thing too because he was out there saying like I wanted them you know like I I was willing to do what they wanted to do but I couldn't convince Congress
(35:23) to do it because the guy who's not president is in charge of of them and it's like well wait a second dude all you're saying is if we want action on this hire the leader who has control of Congress yeah and and this whole thing with Netanyahu it plays into that same thing where it's like you say they shouldn't do this they do it and you're just like they shouldn't do it all your you know putting aside all the sort of like you know the the immorality yeah and the concrete aspects of this the subtext is
(35:58) I I have control of this not a leadership position and I think that's that's I would say that from a um General the a general electorate even if they don't care about the Palestinians they're seeing somebody who is somewhat feckless or the news media is seeing someone who's feckless and this basically becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy right like you you that narrative gets established and they start to apply it to everything and then the other thing is you said like you know how it's hurting him electorally I
(36:36) think it's hurting him electorally in that way in terms of that sort of subtext narrative I think it's hurting him and I think it's you know who knows how many actual votes he's losing for this but I do know that in talking to you know sort of like more or less Normy to Progressive Democrats who are in the sort of like organizing space it's depressing them and so like even if you don't lose all of these votes directly the second order issue is that the people you need to go out and inspire people to vote for you
(37:14) are just feeling like my stomach's churning because you know and these are the people who are paying the most attention to what's going on yeah that's why the vote uncommitted campaign is so significant in my opinion which the media is now like no longer covering as much in my opinion after Michigan um which I suspect could be deliberate because it is the exact type of drama that they love uh that that brings in ratings and like shows a little bit of chaos going on um but uh these are not uncommitted voters uncommitted to the
(37:50) Democratic party I mean these are voters who are committed to the Democratic party because the real uncommitted voters just don't even go out and vote in the primaries and there are many of them right that's the average voter that's the reason why the primaries are not uh attended as as broadly as the general election and these are the people who lead the activist base the progressive base of the democratic party who are likely Democratic party voters in my opinion and and regardless of our opinion on this matter that assessment
(38:22) has also clearly been made by the uh by the Biden Administration as well like they I think they are genuinely seeing that and it is definitely causing a little bit more chaos and a little bit more fear even though it seems like Biden personally is like a very vindictive and very stubborn person uh if we're going to get into the palace Intrigue of it all and I think that that is what's motivating him given the New Yorker magazine piece that came out like last week where he openly said well I don't care about the polls because guess
(38:55) what they were wrong in 20 22 which they really weren't um and that they uh and and they were wrong in 2020 so why should I listen to them now um I don't know it's just it is very terrifying that they're banking on people just simply forgetting what is going on in Gaza by the time November comes around yeah I I'm I'm with you 100% on that I mean I think like you know um uh having you know I I I I I know guys like Biden you know in that age bracket may be related to some and there is a quality of like hey you know maybe uh
(39:40) maybe you didn't need to drive at night as far as you're driving or attempting to drive ah it's not a problem for me look the the pro the you know the dent on that car is because they're making parking spots you know smaller they're making them narrower that's the problem not not my driving and there's there's a real quality to uh to Biden about that like the guy is I don't know if he's ever been uh particularly flexible but uh in this instance there is a certain I don't know I I mean there's a certain I
(40:13) think uh delusion maybe you see a little bit of like they feel like they need to pay a little lip service but the amazing thing is too is that like what makes them think this is going to end like they can't have thought in uh November that okay this is going to go until next November and we'll just deal with it like they had to have thought like at one point they were like this is going to wrap up by January this is going to wrap up by March I mean I think there there's reporting that said that that was their belief and it's quite
(40:51) clear that Netanyahu has absolutely zero incentive to do anything of the sort and and here's the thing that really scares me too nyaho also likes Trump like Netanyahu would benefit from a trump uh re-election 100% 100 he's very I think he's open about that too like I think the reason why he keeps saying no two states immediately after Biden says there will be a two-state solution which in and of itself is already like a contested concept at this point because of you know what the two-state solution
(41:24) on in in uh Theory versus is what it looks like in practice is very different um it's just been a continuation of settlement expansion under the guise of like a potential two State um but you know beyond that it's just very obvious that I think Benjamin nyaho comes out and says the things that he said yesterday specifically because he wants to undermine Biden oh I I I mean look I I I I think he he it's a huge twofer for him to um to embarrass Biden in this way huge twofer um and I think he probably
(42:05) calculates um the longer I hang in here the better the better for Trump and then the ultimately the better for me um and I look I'm not convinced that whatever force uh Hamas to make this attack in this timing um you know knew that this was also going to put the United States in a difficult position and put Biden in in a tough position I can't imagine they ever thought that he would be this sort of like Allin but um oh there's no there's doubt about where is on that um and I I it seems like the Biden
(42:50) Administration just had no they did not calculate this and um they didn't even appreciate like you know the situation I I I I think Biden walked back from this red line thing uh my understanding a little bit uh later today or at least the administration did um but I mean he walked back on it in the interview where he says there are red lines and then he goes but there are no red lines for weapons delivery so there are no red lines he said technically he said no red lines for defensive weapon he said like the Iron Dome so I don't
(43:29) know maybe I was parsing that too I think I think that is the the so that is the legal uh that is the legal that they engage in in an effort to say oh we're sending Israel and and you've talked about this before we're sending Israel defensive weapons actually only defensive weapons and not offensive weapons we're just like replenishing their Munitions that are depleted in defense of Israel why are those Munitions being depleted well because they're using those uh weapons in a forward posture in their illegal
(44:02) occupation and further ethnic cleansing in Gaza I think that's like a way to get around there are specific there are specific armaments for Iron Dome yeah right because I'm looking down the line when when somebody in the Senate is going to raise this bill I don't know when it's going to be but they're going to say we're cutting off all weapon sales except for these specific arm interceptors I think there are specifically yeah and and and so you know something to that effect now I do I
(44:33) think that Biden is sincere with this I I doubt it um but the fact that he's having to articulate this stuff and try and put himself in a position where because they must be looking at this going like we've underestimated this on some level and what are we going to do if this is happening in June what are we going to do if this is happening in September like where do we go what is our fallback and um I I but but here's my big fear too is we're GNA put uh within a month or two we're GNA have
(45:11) this um you know temporary Pier build so that us ships can come and offload uh um Aid you know it's unclear clear to me how that Aid's going to get off that temporary pier and get distributed but it seems to me that both Israel and Hamas have great incentive to um to mess with that to involve US military personnel to uh blame the other side um it is like the idea that we are actually you know I remember when Reagan sent peacekeepers into Lebanon and 250 I think it was Marines got uh blown up Reagan could get
(46:07) away with something like that but and leave but Biden he may have to go the other direction like you know the idea that we're even coming even remotely close never mind what we're doing with the hoodies um but the idea that we come even remotely close to getting involved in an armed conflict because of this it's just it's uh it's mindblowing it's mindblowing that there would be this level of risk uh taken on by the United States when the alternate is we cut your weapons send the truck exactly exactly
(46:45) it's just like there is it's taken a long way to to grab your ear with your grab your left ear with your right hand it's just like you're there is no reason to get into all of this and and basically make this process infinitely harder for yourself and and convoluted and potentially really devastating when and this is the fundamental question that really frustrates me when no one asks this question to Biden directly in media which is why is there need for a peer to begin with are there no humanitarian Aid convoys that are
(47:23) waiting why is there even a need for Aid in Palestine let's ask that question is this a natural disaster is this uh you know is this a byproduct of a typhoon did an earthquake happen there or is it actually our Ally engaging in a deliberate calculated ethnic cleansing and ethnic displacement campaign oh  I think my dog groomer is here one second sorry good I mean dog groom he just he just knocked like the cops for a second hold on I'm going to run this video uh and and hear Biden's thoughts real quick
(47:57) you can see it as well and prime minister Netanyahu as Israel defends itself from Hamas terrorists who murder more than 12200 Israelis and still hold more than a 100 hostages what is your red line with prime minister Netanyahu for instance would invasion of Rafa which you have urged him not to do it is a red line but I'm never going to leave Israel the defense of Israel is still critical so there's no red line I'm going to cut off all weapons so they don't have the Iron Dome to protect them other ways to deal
(48:29) to get to to deal with the with with the trauma caused by Hamas but the red line is Rapa Israel prime minister Benjamin yaho joins us live from Jerusalem uh we don't have to give you the news you follow American news as if you're still here Prime Mr Prime Minister his red line is Rafa don't go into Rafa what's your response look the president and I have agreed that we have to destroy Hamas we can't leave a quarter of the Hamas Terror Army in place uh they're there in Rafa this would be equivalent to saying
(49:05) you know after the Allies uh fought back uh gone through Normandy uh went through uh Germany and you'd say well we'll leave a quarter of the Nazi army in place and we won't go into Berlin the last stronghold so I think that if the president means by that that we should first enable the safe uh departure of the civilian population from Rafa before we go in we agree with that we don't need any prompting means let's make sure that they that's not what he said he doesn't want you to you know I think you
(49:35) have to ask him what he said because he agrees he said that he agrees that we have to destroy Hamas as a fighting organization that's what we intend to do look it's either Israel or Hamas there's no middleway I mean we have to uh have that Victory we can't have three4 of a victory we can't have uh 2third of a victory because Hamas will reconstitute itself with the four battalions in Rafa reconquer the Gaza Strip and do the October 7th Massacre over and over and over again and for us in Israel not
(50:05) merely for me Mr Prime Minister for the people of Israel that's a red line we can't let Hamas survive Mr Prime Minister uh we don't we don't want to put you in a difficult position because you know we know that you have to work with the US I know we're still strong allies but there's been multiple comments whether it was a red line from the president of United States or KLA Harris saying that we need a ceasefire now I know there's been conversations in the Press about a fractur relationship can you tell us about
(50:32) what's going on between you and the president because right now what I'm hearing from the IDF and some of my friends that are going out there to battle uh Hamas is that they don't have the support truly of the United States right now and that you guys are being pressured to come off the gas a little bit is that true look uh we have our agreements uh uh on the basic goals but we also have disagreements on to achieve them ultimately it's Israel that has to decide our neck is on the line are they
(51:00) encouraging you to get off the gas and beheaded well I'm telling you that we're not getting off the gas I'm telling you that we have to take care of Israel's Security in our future and that requires eliminating the terrorist Army that's a a prerequisite for victory that Victory is important not only for us it's important for the Civilized world as we're fighting these barbarians and let me tell you something you know I've seen these recent polls where 8 2% of Americans support Israel in its battle
(51:29) against Hamas 82% that's been constant over the last 5 months so they recognize that our battle is your battle and our Victory is your Victory and I'm sure that uh uh deep down everyone in Washington understands that and that's what we're going to do we're going to defeat Kamas we're going to do what is necessary to minimize civilian casualties do the humanitarian Aid uh something that we believe in but we have to destroy this uh terrorist Nazi army otherwise there's no future it's crazy
(51:57) that he they they just have direct line to Benjamin nahu like oh yeah I mean I wouldn't be surprised if he's actually just in an office at Fox but the what's also really telling about this is his analogy as to why they have to keep going into Rafa is um as if uh the United States um you know left one quarter of the German army um you know operating or wouldn't go into Berlin and I hear this quite a bit when people justify like how much destruction Israel has wrought in Gaza you know they they'll site Dresden or
(52:39) they'll sight Nagasaki or roshima and um the idea that um you can justify this Carnage by comparing the threat between Hamas and um Germany and the the Imperial Japan is just absurd it's just absurd and they've got to make that that leap to justify it but it doesn't it doesn't work I'm sorry it just doesn't work it's not the same yeah it's just it's wild for a couple different reasons including something that Biden himself mentioned which is that we wrote rules after you
(53:21) know like he literally said that in an interview if I recall where he was talking about the Dres in comparisons ahead of time like he was getting ahead of that narrative cuz he's heard it so many times probably um that like one we did write rules new rules of engagement after that and two this is one thing that always frustrates me about the comparisons to the to the Holocaust uh which Benjamin nyaho as I'm sure you know is a holocaust revisionist himself so this is something that he likes doing regardless is that if there is a group
(53:52) if there is a militarized state that is like engaging in ethnic cleansing and ethnic Slaughter the comparison Falls not on the hands of a a resistance group that will take it to Violent means built originally by like fundamentalist guys as well for sure it's the other side it's Israel like Israel is infinitely closer to the to the mechanized Slaughter than Hamas is neither of which is I'm I'm saying uh identical obviously to the atrocities of the Holocaust but like one one side is clearly closer to the Nazi regime than
(54:28) the other side power differential you look at the power differential yeah I mean that's that's I mean that's just what it comes down to I mean you just look at the power differential um and who has control of their territory and who does not and who you know uh where the mass starvation is happening and where it's not I mean the power differential is quite obvious this is not uh you know uh a World War this is a um a highly sophisticated um uh country with a far more advanced Weaponry than maybe anyone
(55:05) else around frankly uh in that neighborhood and certainly you know more so than Hamas and again you're not going to uh completely eradicate them and the idea that like that Hamas is some type of sort of like alien or that can be you know you the Israel is almost impossible to imagine that Israel hasn't created five different variants of Hamas in they have done to population it would be astonish yeah isra Hamas itself Hamas itself is an evolution Hamas is tactics itself has become an evolution due to Israel's increased
(55:59) violent actions like um I think uh Zack Foster uh I don't know if you've ever had him on your stream or not but he is a uh he is a Zachary Foster is is a professor he's a PhD at Princeton a historian of Palestine and he has like documented each step in the evolution of Hamas all the way from the all the way from the Islamic charity which it began as as a Muslim Brotherhood cut out uh all the way into like the the uh Old Charter new Charter and how Hamas changed its tactics throughout time as a consequence as a reaction to the Israeli
(56:37) negotiations uh peace process and the the the the uh obvious continuation and the rapid expansion of the settlements and and also Israel's suppression of like religious freedom and whatnot in the West Bank um and and how it became what it is everybody understands this like everyone in Israel understands former shim bet officials understand this reality and Israel itself understood this reality in its outward communication to the Trump Administration one key detail I bring up uh from time and time is it I believe in
(57:12) 2017 Donald Trump no longer was giving any Aid I think due to uh one of his campaign promises uh they were going to completely shut off Aid the Palestinians do you remember this they they they sto sourc they stopped funding unra yeah um they cut off funding to unra yeah and you know who was actually against that at the time the Israeli government the Israeli government itself had petitioned the Trump Administration to not cut funding because they recognize that this would be a national security issue for Israel if the Palestinians were
(57:46) completely starved out that it would become uh the situation on the ground would get worse so the fact that uh the fact that is Israel in 2017 recogniz this reality and yet the the outward communication coming from Benjamin nahu and others within uh uh the the Israeli government including the defense minister is the exact opposite now um genuinely I think shows that that the situation has gotten worse and the and the fascism has completely taken hold if you can um and and and I think if if people can understand the concept
(58:25) of Donald Trump doing whatever he can to get elected president so that he can stay out of jail which I think uh a lot of people can then I think you can start to understand um and and doing whatever he can despite you know what it means for the country the future of the country you know then I think you can begin to understand uh BB Netanyahu because I think for him um the more turmoil um the better for his personal uh sort of lifelong trajectory like I think he knows that the moment there is any type of calm any type of
(59:10) Peace any type of argument that there is um you know no um immediate threat um I think he knows that his chances of going to jail are you know through the roof at that that moment and so I I think he's going to maintain as much belligerence as possible I don't know if Joe Biden can't can't see what just about every Observer of I mean I'm talking not just I'm talking Israeli yeah you know the Israel Israeli press knows this that Netanyahu is hated but they're not going to get rid of him until this you know
(59:48) War is Over yeah and so his he is completely incentivized to make sure that that never happens regardless of whether it's in you know whose best interest it's in I mean it's um it's it's it's it's a disaster for obviously for the Palestinian people but it's gonna um I think it's it's it's a disaster for uh Israel and it's a disaster for the US no absolutely um I think here one last thing before I uh let you go thank you so much for coming on for as long as you have um one
(1:00:30) last thing I wanted to talk about is I guess like liberal Zionism used to be the primary communication to the Western world and I feel like uh post October 7 but even before October 7 like in the last couple of administrations liberal Zionism kind of like went away as far as like a a hbra mechanism and I think it it is that arrogance that was born out of the unconditional support that the Western world has shown Israel uh and and the the nature of like reactionary fascist ideology constantly increasing the pressure points and and squeezing as
(1:01:08) much as uh squeezing the Palestinian population as much as it can in a and and also endlessly propagandizing that in a self-reinforcing uh uh mode of propaganda I feel like this created um an attitude that is also Al playing into Israel's demise because like without Western support obviously key Israeli officials understand without Western support Israel does not exist in the way that it does no way no how whether it be political cover that America offers more importantly than anything else or whether it be the
(1:01:40) direct weapon shipments people will say it's only 5% of the Israeli defense budget doesn't matter it is far more important uh that America is uh is is always providing political cover for is and also offering weapons um and I think that um the liberal Zionist exit ramp here is so clear to me lay the blame almost entirely on Benjamin Netanyahu and bring in Benny Gans which they're kind of doing now they position they're I think they're positioning Benny G as like the new leader because they had
(1:02:16) Benny uh here uh and and talk to him directly right KLA Harris met with him um and and yet it's wild to to me that Biden has not been pushing that exit ramp that has been given to him uh that allows Israel to continue being an apartheid state that um you know allows Israel to continue doing what it's been doing to the West Bank uh which then of course invokes reaction understandably from uh the the Palestinian resistance groups both in the West Bank but uh more importantly in Gaza and and then you know you can go back to business as
(1:02:52) usual but the the blood lust that you're seeing from Benjamin n yahu that and there is one part that he is right on this is he might not be a popular figure but his actions are popular especially amongst the the Israeli Jewish demographic ped consistently on the matter um they want him to be doing ethnic cleansing they think it's not hard enough they think he he should go even harder yeah so 80% of the Israeli population I mean that's the other thing is that like uh I gance is there but like who is
(1:03:28) the what's the Coalition they can put together I mean increasingly Israel's Jewish population that's you know um the it's their demographic terms not ours obviously it is an ethnos state so right um they uh has more and more conservative fasy Authority Arian I mean I think um look I think uh uh you had a huge influx of uh of people who lived under the Soviet uh Union um and were're raised in that system which is you know uh basically a crash course and in being authoritarian and they're brought over into Israel and
(1:04:23) I think that like um I I think that uh you know having a a massive influx of of folks like that um into your body politic will have an impact I think there was you know Tendencies amongst the Israeli population as it were also uh fundamentalists uh who've come you know 15% maybe only from uh America but a very loud and vocal and um intense Dynamic you know religious fanaticism breeds Fanatics and so all of these factors are working there I'm not sure that you know you would see any change of policy whatsoever with Benny
(1:05:12) Gans like I I don't like I don't I I I don't I don't know if that's even an option that exists anymore but um it it seems to me you could have um uh a the the Biden Administration could have definitely been more aggressive with Israel up to this point and not paid a political price I don't know what they I don't know what they think they're doing from here on in it's just it's it's a  show and I don't I can't see how it gets better I don't know if I agree with you on the USSR
(1:05:50) take I I don't I don't know if it was the uh the Soviet migrants that came in considering that there is a massive population of um of of of Mahi and and Safari Jews in Israel that came from like Arab Jews specifically um very they came years and years ago no I know but I I I feel like in the indoctrination especially as far as I've read into it and you're very knowledgeable on this matter uh maybe I'm misunderstanding something but as far as I understand their integration into Israeli Society
(1:06:25) in order to overcome like being second class citizens being regarded as like you know the same barbaric uh Scourge that the rest of the Arab Muslims and Christians are in the eyes of like the fascist mythology that they were uh that they were developing in Israel for it to be an ethnos State I feel like that integration process caused many like the benav uh of the world to be infinitely more reactionary than like some of the older um some of the old older population of like ashkanazi Jews even that may be the case that may be the
(1:06:59) case to some degree there may be like a you know um but I think the inclination of new immigrants you know avador liberman and you got the you know and that whole sort of like um uh influx of settlers right I mean that's that was part of the project of putting boots on the ground I would imagine oh yeah significant portion of those settlers it still contined to this day like the the Russian like passport uh cycle is like still very much in existence it's like a weird like white supremacist in the way that we
(1:07:43) understand white supremacy here in the Western World here in America like it's almost a continuation of similar policies to like make Israel more white seemingly um I think that that definitely a that is definitely like a genuine interest by some in the Israeli government like a deliberate attempt yeah no I I I think so I would like to see someone do a a deeper dive into that I've always been looking around for like how has these shifts in in demographics impacted Israeli politics and and maybe someone in Israel
(1:08:21) has done it but I have never I I haven't come across it um uh in these parts um but dude before I go let me plug this uh GoFundMe would you um the uh A friend of mine has been helping a family in gazin we're starting to see more of this actually um but uh the there're a family that um have a child with Down syndrome and they um uh we helped them raise some money to get them out of the country I'm sure you know people know the dynamic that's associated with with getting out through the Rafa gate can
(1:09:05) you can you put that link in the Discord if you don't mind in the Discord chat so I can present it here yeah I actually um I got a bit.ly of it let's see where do I uh just type it in the chat here see it yep there it is thank thank you um and uh we got them they just like literally just got uh footage of them at uh the Rafa gate and uh almost the um almost the entire family is out they're going into Egypt to you know um they have nothing there's there's a video I have of that like they have six
(1:09:49) bags uh you know and they were in a tent in Rafa um and so it it it's it's a weird dynamic because there's so much pain and suffering there um and to uh Focus attention or help on any individual family it sort of cuts both ways but I don't know it's been uh least gratifying to know that like you can directly help uh some people if you know even a couple of bucks uh help them get settled and um this uh uh and know that you managed to save some of these people and and and and given them an opportunity to sort of
(1:10:33) like normalize and deal with the trauma that they've been going through yeah and just saw some video of of uh their little girl you know and uh it's it really is it's amazing but it's it's it's so horrific but if folks have the opportunity uh please mods are uh pumping the the link in the chat as well well Sam thank you so much for coming on always pleasure having you here great to talk to you and uh keep up the good work man I really really appreciate what you've been doing thank you three years
(1:11:10) now so my my real Uncle sorry you're cutting off can you say that again yeah hopefully I'll get out there soon I want to see your great all right all right have a good one bye that was Sam Cedar everybody my real Uncle Sam Cedar and not my fake impostor Uncle J chunk Wert uh doing the most very reasonable voice uh I always appreciate Sam's commentary and takes on the matter because like um because I I think he has a way uh and he has the background uh of of you know doing this for many many years I think that um you
(1:11:52) know he has a way uh with with his words with his commentary that appeals to a lot of people I think that are maybe already negatively polarized to the things that I have to say so you know great stuff uh I'm glad that he uh you know talked about his own personal journey of moving away from like totally lapping up uh Ultra Zionist Ultra nationalist propaganda all the way to uh questioning it and then arriving at the position that he's arrived at and I think him not wanting to be called no he didn't say he
(1:12:29) doesn't want to be called anti zus he said he never called himself anti-zionist uh and I think that that plays a role in exactly what I was talking about you understand Andrew fer thank you for the 20 Community gifted Subs allowing 20 people to no longer see the ads at the top of the hour by the way um like he's he he he does not care about being called that he's just saying he never called himself that people used to call him that already um I think it's it's more of a testament to that label being like a
(1:13:07) that label immediately shutting you off for a lot of people who are uh positioned against it
