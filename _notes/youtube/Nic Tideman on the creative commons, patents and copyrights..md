## Transcript:
i think we're about ready to start
i see it's two o'clock
okay
hi everybody this is dan sullivan i'm
the
vice president of the council of
georgia's organizations this is our
second session for our
virtual conference rather than our
usual on-site conference um and
we have um
marty rowland is going to introduce nick
tiedemann and
we're going to talk about um
about uh reclaiming the commons and um
marty is
long active he's on the board of the
henry george school of social sciences
in new york city
and um has done
sessions with us before and i'll just
turn it over to marty and
step out of it
so
go ahead marty
well thanks a lot dan appreciate the uh
the intro and introduction uh
i want to

say a few words for uh and introduce
nick tiedemann
a very long history
in the uh
generationally in the georgia's movement
before i get into that i want to say
that
nick is a
professor at the university of virginia
no it's uh virginia tech virginia attack
i'm sorry
so the but the thing that's uh
notable is some of his uh
his um
accomplishment uh in the 70s he was
on the nixon's
council of economic advisors
and i think most notably in my opinion
was the initiative he took to create and
write a
open letter to gorbachev on november 7th
1990
and in addition to that initiative is
getting 29 other prominent economists to
sign on to the letter
um so i think that's somewhat i'd like
to get into that after we talk about his
main topic today
but
next areas of our
research interests
taxation of land which i think you're
probably going to hear some
voting theory and political philosophy
and uh if time allows i'd like to
learn more about the idea of political
philosophy
because it uh forces uh
an accounting of
what society is and the purpose of of
government
so i think with that uh
intro
i i want to say that
nick needs no introduction because of
his uh background of being a fourth
generation georgist but uh nick let's uh
just turn it over to you we can get into
more in the q a
um
so nick let's go ahead i'm talking today
about a georgia's approach to
intellectual property
how best to reward inventors composers
and authors is a puzzle of economics and
jurisprudence
on the one hand we want to ensure that
creators of new ideas and things are
adequately motivated to create because
we all benefit so much for their
innovations
on the other hand the usual way of
rewarding inventors and
creators is the granting of monopolies
and this is arguably unjust for its
restriction on liberty
as well as inherently inefficient
because it results in charges for
actions that have no social cost
producing the inefficiency of non-use
by those who would value the monopolized
actions but not value it enough to pay
the monopoly price
henry george's thinking on the issue of
rewards for innovations evolved in the
initial editions of progress in poverty
in book eight chapter three one finds a
defense of the monopolies entailed in
patents and copyrights
george wrote
there are among us various sorts of
monopolies for instance there are
the temporary monopolies created by the
patent and copyright laws these would be
extremely unjust and unwise attacks
as much as they are but recognitions of
the right of labor to his intangible
productions and constitute a reward held
out to invention and authorship
literature editions amendments adding at
the end of the sentence above a long
footnote that withdraws support for
patents but not for copyrights
in the patent
in the
footnote
george writes
following the habit of confounding
exclusive right granted by a patent and
that granted by a copyright as
recognitions
of the right of labor to its intangible
productions
i in this
fell into error which i subsequently
acknowledged and corrected in the
standard of june 23 1888.
the two things are not alike but
essentially different the copyright is
not a right to the exclusive use of a
fact an idea or a combination which by
the national laws of property all are
free to use but only to the labor
expanded in the thing itself it does not
prevent anyone from using for himself
the facts and knowledge the laws or the
combinations for a similar production
but only from taking the identical form
of the particular book for other
production
the actual labor which has in short been
expended in producing it
it rests therefore upon the natural more
right of each one to enjoy the products
of his own exertion and involves no
interference with the similar right of
anyone else to do likewise
the patent on the other hand prohibits
anyone from doing a similar thing and
involves usually for a specified time
and interference with the equal liberty
on which the right of ownership rests
the copyright is therefore in accordance
with moral law it gives to the man who
has expended the intangible labor
required to write a particular book or
paint a particular
picture
security against the copying of that
identical thing
the patent is defined of this natural
right it prohibits others from doing
what has already been attempted everyone
has a moral right to think what i think
or to perceive what i perceive or to do
what i do no matter whether
he gets the hint for me or independently
of me
discovery can give no right of ownership
for what
for whatever is discovered must have
been already here to be discovered if a
man make a wheelbarrow or a book or a
picture he has a moral right to that
particular wheelbarrow or book or
picture but no right to ask that others
be prevented from making similar things
such a prohibition though given for the
purpose of stimulating discovery and
invention
really in the long run operates as a
check upon them and the footnote
in my opinion george overstates the
difference between patents and
copyrights while there are important
differences between the two
there are also similarities permitting
the application of the same some of the
same principles to both cases
first consider patents
georgia's right that patents interfere
with equal liberty that quote whatever
is discovered must have been already
here to be discovered end quote and that
an inventor has quote no right to ask
that others be prevented from making
similar things end quote this complaint
of the injustice of patents has the form
of a complaint of an enclosure of the
commons
the commons and land is everyone's
common heritage we find it worthwhile to
have parts of the commons enclosed that
is assigned for the exclusive
access of particular individuals
but where exclusive access occurs it
should improve overall efficiency and to
be proper it must entail compensation
for the community from the person with
exclusive access
there is a commons of possible actions
as well as the commons of land there
should be a presumption of a common
right of all
to actions that do not physically invade
the persons or property of others
others can even be harmed by one's
actions without turning the action into
something that should be prohibited or
require compensation
for example i can change barbers without
compensating my current barber even
though this harms my current barber by
reducing his income
so harming others is not the test of
what is prohibited
still we sometimes do restrict liberty
for the sake of the general welfare as
with with restrictions on driving too
fast we should have such restrictions on
liberty only when there are good reasons
for them
george our views that there is not a
good enough reason for the restrictions
on liberty entailed in patents that we
should not prohibit others from copying
without permission of the inventor
what the inventor has shown to be
possible
supporters of patents will say that the
monopolies entailed in patents produced
are worthwhile
because they cause so much in improved
productivity
that the resulting restrictions are
justified as other restriction liberty
that one finds in a civilized society
implicit in this argument for patents is
the assumption that there is no other
way to motivate inventors adequately
in fact there are a couple of
possibilities that might work
first one could declare inventors to be
heroes
heroes do wonderful things without
expecting financial rewards
when jonas slack in the 1950s developed
a polio vaccine that is named for him i
don't recall anyone suggesting that we
should estimate the social value of what
he did and pay him a significant
fraction of that he was a hero
if we had only a few inventors calling
them heroes might work but there are too
many in vintage trying to make them all
into heroes would dilute the concept of
a hero too much
the other alternative patent said is to
provide financial rewards to inventors
without giving them monopolies or
patents such that an idea faces two
challenges
one
where is the money going to come from
and two
how is the amount of money for each
invention going to be decided
even though system patents is
inefficient and arguably unjust
at least it has answers to these
questions and a system of patent
monopolies the money to reward the
inventors comes from the excess above
cost and the prices that inventors
charge for inventions and the amount is
whatever emerges from the combination of
market demand
and monopoly supply
i believe that the better answer is
available without monopolies
since i am approaching the issue from of
compensating inventors from a georgia's
perspective one might expect me to
propose using the revenue from taxing
land that becomes
inventors from my perspective however
there is a difficulty with using land
taxes for this
from the perspective of justice the
revenue that comes from natural
opportunities has a prevent presumptive
disposition the part that is due to
infrastructure should pay for that
infrastructure
the part that is due to private
development of surrounding lands should
go to those whose land who use land in
ways to raise the value of surrounding
land
incidentally theory says that this will
raise land
values by more than it costs the part
due to nature is rightfully the source
of basic income for all it appears that
all the rent from natural opportunities
is just claimants and there's no just
way to use this revenue to reward
inventors
there is a way around the argument just
presented
the share of rent that is due to natural
opportunities varies with circumstances
is what is left after for appropriate
payments for worthwhile infrastructure
and for development
with
developments with net positive
externalities
if the calculation of needed payments
out of rent changes then the calculation
of rent from national opportunities
changes for example if a community
becomes aware that they are subject to
risk of flooding that a sea world would
prevent then the rent from natural
opportunities falls by the cost of
building the sea wall furthermore if the
sea wall is deficient then its cost will
be less of the reduction rent from the
realization of the flood risk
similarly if the community becomes aware
simultaneously that
a
patents constituted unjust restriction
on individual liberty and b
without rewards for inventors the number
of events will fall in incomes and land
values will fall
then if payments to inventors will cause
land values to rise but at least as much
as the payments it is appropriate to
work inventors out of rent for natural
opportunity
this leaves unanswered the question of
how one determines the right size of the
reward fund and how to allocate among
inventors but it is a start
there is also the matter that the
benefit from inventions will be greater
than the effect on rent
as a first approximation one might
expect invention to increase the incomes
from land labor and capital by the same
percentage
thus the share of value of inventions
reflected in land values would equal the
share of rent in national income
by definition national income is gross
national product minus the quote capital
consumption allowance that is
depreciation
estimating the share of labor in u.s
national income as compensation employs
plus half a provider's income
the average share of labor in national
income between 2010 and 2021 was 66.6
percent
call it two-thirds
there any remaining one-third of
national income can be divided between
the category of land and monopolies
which i will call land
and capital
based on the detailed analysis of
economic data i concluded that u.s
income is divided approximately
three-eighths income from land and five
days income from capital
less national income is roughly
two-thirds labor income one-eighth land
income and five twenty-fourths income of
capital
so if inventors were to receive the
increase in land values that results
from their inventions they would receive
about one-eighth of the value of their
inventions for the period of payment
if the period repayment was ten years
then a person who produced invention
with benefits of eight hundred thousand
dollars per year
would get a hundred thousand dollars per
year
from the public land run fund for eight
years
well for ten years excuse me that would
be a nice start but i think that
inventors need more
is there a principled way to see that
they get it
to explore this question we need to go
in two directions there's one answer in
quote ideal theory and another answer in
quote non-ideal theory
in ideal theory one takes no account of
political feasibility one discusses what
is right irrespective of political
feasibility in non-ideal theory when
asked what changes that are politically
imaginable would be desirable
in ideal theory the principle that
people have equal rights and natural
opportunities is the right it recognizes
the law of gravity
no one would think of denying it as a
result there's no possibility of war
with no possibility of war there is no
need for the economies of scale and
defense that are provided by large
nations
and the nations divide into sovereign
entities composed of like-minded persons
roughly the size of current counties
sharing the global rent from natural
opportunities among themselves in
proportion to populations
when sovereign entities are the size of
counties as i see it it would be
consistent with justice for such
entities to have taxes other than land
taxes because anyone who objected could
easily go somewhere else
land taxes are adequate to finance
public activities to provide
approximately equal benefits
and benefit everyone with access
but with benefits to decline with
and with
benefits to decline with distance
however activities that benefit only a
fraction of the population or have
benefits to not vary with distance will
not raise land values by enough to pay
for themselves examples of such
activities are schools
and programs of assistance for the poor
i cannot see how a society could provide
such activities if it taxed only land
without them people could not expect
government help and could only have
children responsibly if they and their
parents were prepared to pay the full
cost of schooling and of insurance
against falling into poverty
i think that most people would prefer to
live in societies that did not constrain
having children to that extent and would
definitely choose to live primarily in
societies that use taxes other than land
taxes to finance schools help for the
poor and other social activities that
did not raise land values by enough to
pay for themselves
the taxes a community used to pay for
such activities could be whatever what
the community choose chose but
economists would probably recommend
broad-based taxes because they generally
cause less economic harm
a community could use land taxes to pay
for these activities and reduce
the basic income but this would tend to
make poor people even poorer therefore
taxes on consumption and on great wealth
seem more likely
in such a world it is easy enough to
imagine the addition of compensation for
inventors
to the list of things for which
communities levied non-land taxes
like providing schools and help for the
poor participating in a global program
for compensating inventors would be one
of the things that responsible
communities did
it would replace the need to enforce
patent restrictions and would entail
unrestricted access for the community to
the use of all patents
it would not be possible to guarantee
that no community would choose to be a
free rider and not contribute but then
he says community would be subject to
shaming and possibly the economic
boycotts
it is hard to know how large the fund
for compensating inventors ought to be i
would suggest aiming to give inventor
something like half the benefits of
their inventions for 10 years while you
do not know how much money this would
entail a number from economic growth
theory is relevant
in models of economic growth there is
what economists call the quote growth
rate of technological
progress this is the growth rate over
time of output from a given combination
of inputs
there is debate over whether it should
be regarded as a constant given by
nature
exogenous or product of policies
endogenous but in either case it
represents output that we get this year
and could not have gotten last year with
the same inputs
so it is an upper limit on the
contribution of invention to this year's
increase in input for the us economy the
growth rate of technological progress
seems to be quite close to one percent
per year
therefore half of one percent of income
is an upper limit on half the
contribution of one year's inventions
and five percent of income is an upper
limit on the half of the contribution to
this year's output of inventions of the
past 10 years
thus five percent of income is an upper
limit on what we would need to pay
inventors to pay them half the benefits
of inventions for 10 years after they
present their inventions
how many dollars would this be
global gdp
is about
excuse me
global gdp
in 2021
was about 95 trillion dollars
from this we need to subtract the cattle
capital consumption allowance to get
global income
in the us the capital consumption
allowance is about 16 of income for the
world as a whole it was probably smaller
since
the world as a whole has a smaller share
of capital
it's hard to know how much smaller so
global income is probably about
80 trillion dollars
five percent of this is four trillion
dollars therefore four trillion dollars
per year is a rough upper limit of what
we would need currently to pay in
ventures if we wanted to pay them half
the global benefits of an instance over
the past 10 years
i suggest that in ideal theory a global
fund for rewarding inventors of up to
four trillion dollars per year
from up to five percent of each
country's income
would readjust and a reasonably
efficient replacement for patents
there might be an upper limit on total
investor gain as a dollar amount and or
as a multiple of research outlets a
global bureaucracy would
evaluate inventions and determine the
amounts of rewards despite all this
complexity i find a global system of
rewards for inventions in exchange for
global free access to all inventions to
be more attractive than the current
system of patent monopolies
now for non-ideal theory
we do not yet have agreement that
natural opportunities are everyone's
common heritage
still we might get agreement that a
system of patent monopolies is at
least inefficient if not unjust
and that therefore it is appropriate to
replace patents for the global system of
rewards for inventors with contributions
for all countries of a specified share
of their incomes
countries that chose not to participate
would be expected to abide by patents
under the current rules countries that
did not participate would obtain
the contributions
from
countries
that did participate would obtain their
contribution from other sources used for
public revenue
even though such taxes entail the
sources that create inefficiencies the
resources from broad-based taxes could
be expected to be less costly than when
monopoly prices entailed in patents and
view the general rule in public finance
equal percentage distortions across an
economy are almost always less efficient
than unequal ones
the conclusion for patents
they're inefficient and arguably
arguably unjust
we should strive to replace them with
the global system of compensation for
inventors with all kinds contributing in
proportion to their incomes
now onto copyrights
george says
the copyright does not prevent anyone
from using for himself to fax the
knowledge the laws or combinations for
similar productions but only from using
the identical form of a particular book
or other production the actual labor
which has in short been expedited and
producing it it rests therefore upon the
natural moral right of each one to enjoy
the products of his own exertions and
involves no interference with the
similar right of anyone else to do
likewise
i would agree with george if your
copyrighted work had the nature of a
purely private good if a comedian
creates a joke and makes a living
telling the joke and the joke is never
discussed beyond the audience that hears
it then it is unjust for another
comedian to pry the first comedian the
audience
for the joke by telling it to audiences
before the first comedian has a chance
to relate it to them
if an author writes a novel and sells it
to readers who enjoy reading it but
never discuss it
then it is unjust
for someone else to sell the same novel
in the private writer of the market for
that book
however
things are different when the work
involved becomes part of public
discourse
consider the happy birthday song
the song has become a cultural icon as a
society we gravitate toward a shared
understanding of how we celebrate
someone's birthday somehow we wound up
using the tune from the song
good morning to all
which was first published in 1893.
the happy birthday words were first
published in 1901 in a poem with no
reference to singing the words
there is printed reference to from 1901
to a song called happy birthday to you
but the first known printing of the
words and music together was in 1911.
in 1935 the publisher of the 1893 good
morning to all published a copyrighted
book
containing a version of the song with a
slight change in the music one held one
note hotel for two beats and said two
separate notes
along with a new second verse
a copyright ogre bought this copyright
in 1998 1988 it demanded that any
restaurant that allowed an employee to
sing the song to customers pay 700 per
performance
use in films tv shows and concerts cost
many thousand dollars dating total
revenues of two million dollars per year
however when the copy was right was
chalice in court in the case that lasted
from 2013 to 2015
there was a settlement the result of the
song being declared in the public domain
with the company that had been claiming
a copyright agreeing to pay 14 million
dollars in various forms of restitution
with slightly different facts the case
could have turned out differently
if everyone involved had included
prescribed kind of copyright copyright
notices
and everything that had been published
there might have been enduring legal
copyright
but this seems wrong
a society we ought to be able to settle
on a culture of practice but without
having to pay a copyright ogre
my general point is that copyrighted
creations are not purely private goods
they've become they can become things to
which one needs access to part fully to
participate fully in ordinary social
interactions
a business needs a way to receive faxes
to interact with other business it would
be unjust if there were monopoly
supplier of patented
patented fax machines whose permission
every business needed to stay in
business
similarly it would be unjust if no one
could be in business without buying
a copyright a copy of the copyrighted
word software to read documents sent by
other businesses would also be unjust if
no one could participate in public
discourse without having read the latest
john grisham novel
and its price was a week's wages
any charge for something that everyone
needs to be a self-respecting productive
member of the community
is an enclosure of the commons
there should be no price of admission
for social connectedness
because the transformation of
congratulate private goods independent
social connectedness is a gradual
process that could happen to any work it
seems to be proper
and just to create
to treat the
proper and just to treat the creativity
of writing like the creativity of
invention and replace copyrights with
the system of awards
the amount of each award would depend on
the length of the work a proxy for the
cost of production and the number of
times it was copied every book every
short story every song every movie every
tv show and every piece of software
would be available to everyone
paid for by taxes rather than a la carte
prices
this is my version of unenclosed commons
of inventions cultural symbols
cultural symbols and ideas thus i
believe that in the end the proper
treatment and invention networks that
are now copyrighted are more similar
than different despite the difference
between finding and creating because
they both involve new things that can
become essential parts of the web of
connections among us all both should be
free available with compensation for the
creators coming from a combination of
the increase in rents that they generate
and taxes
on consumption and wealth
thank you
that was great nick
um
this is marty rowland for those who
knew late
uh i thought it was an excellent uh
presentation about the idea of the
commons
uh i
looked through the chat and the q a i
didn't see any questions but maybe
people are
writing
out so while we wait for the people to
weigh in
uh i thought maybe what i would do is go
through my notes
uh like
listening just now and maybe hope to
clarify some of the things uh i i
honestly think that
people need to
access to the paper and study it for uh
you know maybe a couple weeks or more
and then have a uh
the discussion
thereafter but uh
to get the
uh the first one it seemed though the
the angle that you were making is that
both patents and

well the reality of enclosing the
commons because you're excluding
some people to access to something that
could be socially beneficial
understand rather than just
let people
nearly really just
have access to come up with a global
system
uh
of uh
of payment or reward or what you called
it but i guess my question to you will
be
to
the the difference between a uh an idea
that might be a better
way of uh of course let's say a troll or
maybe a barbie in ken versus something
i'd have life-saving
properties like a new drug
technique or some kind of medical device
could you
the global system
would uh
figure out that price that the the award
would be
well
one of the place
that i've thought about is with respect
to music
it seems to me that uh
there's a sort of
to what music is popular it's popular
for a while and then it disappears and
i'm not sure
that any piece of music is essential for
us uh
and
people
do
get a lot of
joy out of uh being up with the latest
music
uh so
i i'm content to say that the
the value of music is reflected in the
fact that uh people uh
spend a lot of effort making sure that
they haven't and so uh
i i'm willing to
uh
call music
uh one of the things that people can
compensate for creating and get
compensated according to
how many downloads it gets uh that's an
estimate of the social value and we
uh tax everybody to in order to uh
reward the inventors on the other hand
uh i wouldn't mind too much if
uh
songwriters
uh
felt
inadequately compensated and we got less
songwriting as a result i think that we
have enough songwriting uh without uh
overly compensating uh
songwriters but uh
i would
be content to uh be overruled by others
than that is my my opinion shouldn't
count any more than anybody else
else's opinion on the other hand you can
compare that with new drugs uh new drugs
are very expensive to produce i think we
should have a much less expensive
process for approving them
but
it's uh
it's important to get more and more
life-saving drugs and we should expect
to compensate
those who
produce them according to some estimate
of the value
that we get from these drugs and then we
should make them avail to everybody the
idea that it should cost eighty thousand
dollars to treat somebody with
uh
hepatitis c is ridiculous we should just
make the pay
the pills available to everybody for the
marginal cost of producing them and give
a nice big reward to the people who came
up with the drugs
charging by the uh
the cure just
offends me
i think it offends a lot of other people
too but we we need to reward these
people
and so we need to come up with some
sorts of rewards okay well that's great
we do have uh three questions now i
thought rather than me
following up on the last one i'll go to
the uh the questions in the q a and the
first one from jeff
robert
his question is since there is no
monopoly
is there any reason
not to reward creators for their natural
life for 25 years whichever is greater
particularly if rewards
are based on distribution
even those purchased for the price of
zero
such a remedy is possible with a
biometric digital currency
do you want to
respond to that well
uh
i don't know enough about biometric uh
digital currencies uh but i can uh talk
about the issue of how long the period
of reward lasts
uh i am aware that
when people have discussed how long
copyright should last uh one of the
points is brought up is that somebody
might have produced a copyrighted work
and then died and left dependents who
would be uh
needing the income from the patent so
you wouldn't necessarily want to cut it
off immediately when somebody died
uh
i
i think that
there isn't any natural
uh ending point
the lifetime of the
author is one possibility
uh but i would
uh
like to recreate the possibility of the
uh
descendants
who might have been
financially independent getting
something
without it going to infinity and so i
don't think that there's a natural
cutoff point and so
i think we just need to uh settle on
something it seemed to me that ten years
might be enough
uh that
somebody shouldn't be able to live for
the rest of his life on
one uh
wonderful thing
no matter how wonderful it is
but again
i'm just
one person i'd like to have a discussion
of the subject and see if we can get a
consensus on what the right answer is
well before we uh turn to dan i i know
dan's got a question but i wanted to
clarify that i understood you to say
during your presentation
that there is this reward that would be
made
really early in the process and that's
what opens up the
the uh well
unencloses the commons
was that your idea was that there would
be a more definitive reward up front so
that others could thereby
benefit
quickly thereafter
uh actually i was going to have a reward
equal
to the
uh estimated public benefits year by
year
but the person who has that promise can
take it to the bank
or to the market and and sell the right
uh if he wants to have it all at once
okay but
the money officially
would come year by year as the benefits
accrued uh so if uh
circumstances led to it
the change up or down in our estimate of
how much the benefit was there would be
a
corresponding change up or down in the
payment uh we would just make an
estimate every year as to what the
benefit was for that year okay great so
dan why don't you go ahead and ask your
question then i'll get back to the q a
okay yeah a couple things one
was just in passing that
that public schools particularly have a
tremendous impact on residential land
values and that
before everybody listed their houses on
the internet they put out these
magazines there was a little picture of
the house
and all it said was the amount of
property taxes in the name of the school
district so people looking for
residential housing especially if they
have children
look for housing where there's a good
school district so i think there's a
a big correlation to land values
for those public schools whether there
is for a university or
whatever is is a different question
um i i agree that public schools have a
very large effect the quality of a
public school has a very large effect on
land values what i claim although i
haven't studied this subject is based on
economic theory i would expect that the
sum of the effects on land values is
less than the cost of the school
okay
um
the the other thing was i i've been
noticing with movies um
that there's a thing called rotten
tomatoes which tabulates what all the
critics have said
and then there's these um the score of
what the audience has said and the
quite often there are movies that get
an extremely high review with the
critics in an extremely low review with
the audience
and vice versa
and so that makes me think that that the
critics if we were if we were rewarding
people we would have to be very leery of
the critics dominating what gets
rewarded and what doesn't
yes i i think what we mean by the
benefit is a benefit that the population
perceives it and critics count too and
if there's any reason to believe that
the benefits of them are more
we might possibly want to take that into
account but we want to
ask what is the benefit to people
not what it is to critics what about it
not what it is in the estimation of
critics yeah
yeah maybe this would have to be a forum
where there's
like an audience of diverse people that
can uh stand up and boo or throw things
yeah
we would get information about benefit
in whatever ways seemed best and then
getting uh aggregates from rotten
tomatoes of what the audience thought is
an important uh possibility yeah yeah
well um i'm going to go back to the the
question the the first one uh dev preet
jossel
um i think he's just making a critique
of you know if he presented this again
he was saying we need the numbers to
understand this presentation so he's
just saying that as a comment so uh i
guess
maybe the speed of your your message was
faster than some people could grasp
so the next one was
jeff robert again in a georgia's economy
people pay rent to the commons for
exclusive use of land
uh with intellectual property it is the
commons paying rent
for the shared use of labor
do you think that is important uh this
is an important part of the georgist
equation
oh i think that
it's important for georgia's to have
an answer to what we do about uh patents
and copyrights because they are
monopolies
and i'm contributing to what i hope will
be a conversation
other people may have different ideas
but this is my contribution uh and
the id calling it uh
the commons paying rent for shared use
of labor is an interesting possibility i
hadn't thought of it that way
okay well good so we'll look forward to
another opportunity to explore these
ideas uh the next one's uh caitlyn
shepard walrun
i wonder what would be the biggest
obstacle
to the government
uh to even run a pilot program with this
reward concept
i think the idea maybe if there was a
board game or something maybe people
could
learn by doing
i haven't thought about a board game i
have thought about applying it first in
one particular area
and it seems to me that the area of
drugs is the likely candidate
that
i can imagine a government saying that
is
acquiring all the patents by eminent
domain and
paying the
current holders uh
appropriate compensation uh in line with
the fifth amendment
uh
just to see what it's like to take an
area where
uh
monopoly profits are valuable and where
it would be very valuable to have access
to the things without the monopoly
profits and see if we can do it and what
it's like
so i i think that the idea of doing it
experimentally is best thought of
as picking a sector and doing it and and
i can imagine that happening yeah yeah
this just occurred to me uh listening to
the mmt lectures recently that
this could turn into like a
like a guaranteed job
idea where people submitting questions
just so that they wouldn't have to work
doing other things so is there a chance
that
what you're talking about could be
perverted into something that wasn't
originally intended
uh well you would need
careful
uh
behavior by those who set the
awards um
one example of
something like that that
comes to mind is the people who uh click
on ads for a living in order to generate
revenue

that they somehow acquire according to
the number of clicks
now
that reflects a bad estimate of how
valuable the ad is so if we have bad
estimates of the value of
inventions and allow people to uh
claim rewards for things that aren't
valuable uh that's to our detriment and
we have to make sure that that doesn't
happen okay
so uh jeff graybird again
says the benefits to people is exactly
determined by distribution
you agree
well no the benefit to people uh
varies widely i think that i get very
little benefit from modern music
and some people
who
uh
this and modern music wouldn't mind if
it was something entirely different if
they didn't have it they would be
content with something else other people
find the modern music to be very
valuable to them personally
really would find their life less
valuable didn't have access to the
latest variations in music
so
we each have our own private valuations
of these things
and we have to compensate according to
some average and we only want to give a
fraction because these
we know that we're overcharging some
people and under charging others
but it's it's not determined in any way
that we can
know in advance yeah we're kind of
showing our age when we make our
opinions like this
sure
so the next one is james frederickson
how should people who try but fail to
develop
a new drug be compensated
there are two possibilities
one is to compensate for the failures
the other is to come out compensate for
their successes
and not sufficiently
to make it worth trying even if you
might fail
and it's hard to know which of those is
the better way of doing things you don't
want to do both you want to either
compensate for the failures or put an
extra bonus in for the
uh successes to compensate for the
possibility of failure
yeah so it's kind of like
in your uh smart talk with uh ed dodson
you mentioned about alexander graham
bell so would there be a system of uh
rewarding the
guy that came in second
in the telephone uh
yeah well i i think that what we would
do
is we would say
that uh
the reward to an inventor would depend
in part
on how
implausible the the invention was if the
invention was something that anybody
could have
or any
uh appropriately trained engineer could
have come up with if we just asked him
what the question was we say very
interesting and it's valuable but uh
anybody could have done it so you don't
get much of a reward okay
so let's go to uh bill batt's question
since many even most
creative products are due to the
reliance of inventors standing on the
shoulders of those that have come before
how do we discourage the windfall gains
that come accidentally to those
fortuitously fortuitously
placed
bill gates wealth depended on many who
preceded him yet he was the main
beneficiary
well
again what we have to say is
uh
what was the reasonable cost of
production of what bill gates did given
the environment in which he was working
we don't give him as much credit as we
would have given him if he had more of a
blank slate to work with uh i believe
that the first version
of uh ms-dos
was something that he bought from
somebody down the street rather than
something that he actually created
yeah that sounds about right
uh augusta natarini
uh thank you nick for the interesting
presentation i am wondering would this
system also work for inventions in the
digital space thinking of social media
and similar online platforms should the
inventors of these like facebook twitter
be rewarded with
tax revenue and the com and the
comms would uh
ultimately own their uh
platforms
uh
i'm not sure i'm inclined to think that
these companies could operate without
patents and copyrights
that
we can have any number of different
social media organizations without
copyrights looking for customers
and
i i don't think that the system of
copyrights uh would
or or its lack would make much
difference to these companies
uh
i i'm content with a system of uh
trademarks
so that you can't pretend to be somebody
who you aren't i don't think that people
should uh be able to infringe on on
other people's trademarks and i would
distinguish that from
copying their ideas or their words
uh
so
on the other hand if it turned out that
facebook uh
needed
some kind of copyright in order to work
and we felt it was appropriate
to
uh
well
you know i i i
i just don't i i think that
social media would be outside the system
i i don't think that there would be any
compensation for them i don't think
there'd be any copyright or patent
protection toward them okay
um
let's see we got one that goes into
voting and i think that maybe that goes
into your area of expertise but says how
do
uh how about quadratic voting for
categories and distribution within the
category
i would say that question is not
sufficiently
specified for me to address it
there might be some relevance there uh
to how we decide what what the right way
to set the the rewards is but
that's why i was thinking that even
though he didn't ask that i was thinking
that uh maybe the panel that's making
these decisions
are uh subject to some kind of vote
it might be that you would want some
kind of weighted voting
and uh quadratic voting is a version of
weighted voting so it might be relevant
in taking account of this kind of the
views of the different members of of a
panel
but
that is
sufficiently far off that i don't know
how the the
but you know people in new york are
familiar with ranked voting so we know
what that is yes
how does that vary with the quadratic
well
in quadratic voting you express the
intensities of your preferences
rather than the ranking okay okay
well the there's one in the chat and
it's kind of long so let me read it we
we got about eight minutes before the
top of the hour
but would it be possible if some large
percentage of people worldwide
formed a public-private company that
could democratically slash intelligently
purchase all the important copyrights
patents land common resources directly
charge reasonable rents and share the
proceeds with all the people worldwide
equally as a universal basic dividend
how could we begin to form a global
company like this to implement georgia's
policies worldwide
well
i don't think
we can reasonably expect to come up with
the resources with which to do that
it's somewhat like the proposal
to end slavery by buying out
all the slave owners yeah you shouldn't
need to buy them out they should
recognize that what they think is their
property isn't and it just has to be
given up
so i i think that the
path of reform has to be saying
oops
uh we made a mistake
uh we're going to start
doing things differently now it's not
exactly the same
because
we do recognize we do want to recognize
the contribution
that the uh
creators have made
but we we want to say it was wrong to
give you
and a monopoly
but we'll give you something else
instead
whereas i think that with respect to tax
and land we want to say
that uh it was wrong to let you have
land titles untaxed now uh the type of
land goes with paying attacks
okay well since we've got a little bit
of time and i've got a question kind of
relates to what we were talking about
before the program started uh i i was
thinking about what we were talking
about in
alfred econ and the civil aeronautics
board and there's various ramifications
of what happened during the
70s when the
regulatory reform deregulation came on
and what occurred to me was that
whenever you don't have the collection
of resource rents or land rents that are
community owned then you get into this
situation
where you have these uh so social
public wrongs i guess and then once you
start
arguing about well how do you best fix
the public wrongs while the land rent is
not being collected then you go off into
some other
netherworld that uh it's unfortunate
that it's going that way but it's kind
of like the penalty for not doing things
right in the first place
do you want to comment on that
i i i i can't get my hands around what
you you're
it's too complicated
well the reason i brought it up is that
uh i was very critical of the alfred
econ and he was one of the signers of
that gorbachev letter
kind of curious about how we fit in and
my observation was that uh i think there
was an intention by the the government
to
provide air travel to um to the small
cities
and once it uh once the civil
international board was disbanded
and the private uh uh free market
started raining then a lot of the
service was not uh then provided so the
government intervened to provide the the
service to more people but i think what
you were referring to was the um there
was a lack of doing something correctly
which uh led to the civil aeronautics
board
well
uh
in my view
the the difficulty is
that
you can't get service in small places
unless somebody is willing to cover the
losses
and uh you could
make it
the profits that they got elsewhere a
condition
for
you could make uh
the service to smoke
uh communities the condition for being
able to continue to get the big profits
on the other hand it seems to me there's
an issue of fairness that the people who
want to fly the main route should be
allowed to have uh the low prices that
come from competition and the small
communities if they want service should
tax their land and
provide subsidies to the
airlines that then provide the service
yeah okay we did get another one while
we're
we're waiting uh it's from walter horn
and he says do you think that the
changes you are suggesting would have
any effect
on the current problems involving
uh involved with protecting copyrights
and patents would you expect the same
sorts of shenanigans
involving say uploading books or
counterfeiting brands
well i uh would distinguish between the
two
i would
uh
allow
uh google if they want to to establish a
library that has every book on it and
everybody could just go to google every
time they wanted to read a book
that would be fine with me on the other
hand faking brands is
a fraud
and it doesn't give people what they
think they're buying and
should be
prohibited and sanctioned
okay yeah
well let's so and uh
and then i i've gone through all the
questions you have one more heather has
a question
heather okay and where's heather's
in the q a
oh okay yeah i've got to go back to q a
now okay heather remove says
how do you get around the problem of the
determination or predetermination of
worth being made by someone
or some entity other than the ultimate
consumer of the product
additionally where does your concept fit
with the georgist sound bite pay for
what you take not for what you make
well
i think of copyright sort of
in the same
category with public parks
we all pay for public parks whether we
walk in them or not
we we know that
public parks are something that a good
communities spend some of their money on
and that
some people get more than their money's
worth
or their taxes out of the fact that we
have public parks and some people get
less
now if we were collecting all the rent
of land we people who live close to the
parks would be paying more than people
who lived far from the parks and we
don't have that same closeness and
distance relationship when it comes to
copyright
uh so we
have to
just say it's something that we provide
for everybody like weather reports
and

we consult everyone and try to come up
with some
estimate of the value that depends on
what it's worth to everyone and average
them
in in some appropriate way and
recognizing that
we only have an approximation we don't
have the right answer and because we
only have an approximation we don't try
to give the
creator all of the benefit we give the
creator a fraction of the benefit uh
reflecting
our uncertainty
and the fact that we know that the uh
the value of different people is widely
dispersed
okay
yeah i think i'd like to you know in the
program uh thanking uh the council of
georgia's organizations for this
opportunity to to uh
have uh nick and uh having all these
excellent questions i will uh advise uh
invite people to
visit the henry george schools
socialscience.org
was
hgss.org look for the
various programs that are coming up in
courses
but that's all i really have yeah i have
a couple of little comments um when our
next issue and uh i'm gonna make a promo
for
uh a fiercely which is jeff gray bart's
uh
enterprise he's very enthused and i
think this really fit in with what jeff
is all about our next webinar is this
coming tuesday it is recovering the
urban commons it is
the baltimore thrive land value tax
implementation project with uh alanna
hartzog vanessa beck lorenzo
gaston huevo and mike o'mara talking
about their work in baltimore and trying
to put things in reality and next
saturday just so you're aware of um but
harrison will be with us he's going to
talk about recovering the commons around
the world the time has come strategies
for revising georgia islam
as a global movement um
we appreciate your time we also want to
thank our newest sponsor shepard wallen
who is uh nick's publisher he's uh
shepherd wallen is also the publisher of
uh heather ramoff's book and it's also
uh
federer says publisher so we thank their
uh support of our actions and if you
want we can if people would like
uh we can keep the chat open and and
we'll make you all panelists uh we will
stop the basic recording and we can uh
chat if people would like that
well the the they also published uh
brian hodgkinson's a book on the model
from the new economy
okay good we thank you all oh and
everything so
if people would like to i'll just uh
