Transcript:
(00:00) Sam Harris is one of those guys that was apparently this highminded intellectual that's definitely not a conservative it's something different the intellectual dark web just kidding the reality of Sam Harris was that he was one of these new atheists um who Bill Maher would have on all the time who spoke about how religion was very dangerous and Islam in the end you look at the analysis and much of it was about how really it's these Muslim Savages in the Middle East that are the threat to uh polite Western society and not other
(00:37) religions just the ones that we can associate with the war on terror basically and um it doesn't need to be an analysis about us colonialism or Western interference in the region and exploitation and oil and War it can just be about the inherent debauchery the inherent evil of the ISL of Islam and of the Muslim faith and and so he's been kind of a trump critic recently speaking of that IDW split he's been criticizing Trump getting some cache back with liberals but this was from his podcast episode
(01:10) recently a reminder that Sam Harris despite not liking Trump is still one of the most hateful islamophobic bigots and media right now the overwhelming majority of people who are this confused about how to live good lives are Islamic extremists and the worst of these are jihadists now Hamas is a jihadist organization in my view that's all we need to know about it the question of how it got that way is fundamentally uninteresting as is the question of why so many Palestinians have come to support it this is why how how okay I just want
(01:50) to take this peace meal it's why is it uninteresting to you to talk about the origins of Hamas Sam Harris because it would undercut everything you're saying yeah because the context tells you everything you need to know why does the colonial resistance group form why does it resort to terrorism like these things are all actually have been studied even beyond the Israel Palestine experience it's just also just a very anti-materialist take obviously and it's the kind of thing that I think repeals
(02:16) to like you know very middlebrow thinkers who presume themselves to be very intelligent that they would think of course because Islam is something different it's something that exists outside of like uh traditional historical and material uh you know cause and effect it's something that just like makes your brain rot out but like that's completely ridiculous obviously and he would not accept that kind of you know I think that your earlier point about like the distinctions that they don't that they
(02:44) make between Islam and other even abrahamic religions like they would never cast Christians who probably exist in their communities in that with that same light they wouldn't say like it doesn't matter right and and they they've done this before by the way it's kind of an evolution from just traditional racism where um you saw it honestly in the way that black people were talked about in this country where it's like well I mean where are the fathers what's wrong with uh the values that they're teaching as a and and it's
(03:14) just kind of a way to be like black people are inferior now it's not just Muslim people are they're they're not civilized inherently it's well it's what's being taught to them in their ideology well man that's a great Point Emma because like when we saw racism as defined by or at least like vocal racism defined by like just the argument that black people are inherently naturally inferior become unpopular we saw so much more you know so many more like right-wing thinkers like Swift or shift
(03:46) to that uh you know it's Black Culture it's not natural it's black culture and it's something that Black Culture you're not even supposed to examine it in the context of like well what gave rise to Black Culture is it like white supremacist American culture is that a big sort of Bedrock of like black culture in America you know maybe maybe not but it that shouldn't be taken into account when you're talking about like why black people believe the thing that they believe you know why they
(04:13) participate in society they participate in society and you know that's just now being adapted to like Islam as a general term for like I guess Arab culture because they definitely mean Arab people they don't just they don't mean like when they think of Muslims they don't think of like all of the Asian Muslims and parts of the uh Indonesia but they think of you know they think of like Arab people exactly all right that's all we need to know about it the question of how it got that way is fundamentally uninteresting
(04:42) I'm sure as is the question of why so many Palestinians have come to support it it would be like asking in 1941 how the SS became so radicalized and why do so many millions of Germans support it that's an interesting question now yeah pause now that has why would you not want to examine that right why would you not want to examine that that is an interesting question it's actually really important it's also important to like start like trying to figure that stuff out as it's happening you know you know history
(05:16) isn't just something that we do in hindsight to talk about the past like understanding the the Contemporary uh soop political and other factors that led to the rise of Nazism as it's happening concurrently is important because a lot of times once it's over there's a lot of revisionist history that is painted for a lot of these things like a lot of Nazism gets blamed entirely on like lower class Germans for example when we know you know especially from writings at the time that there was a lot of support
(05:44) amongst the more upwardly mobile middle class Germans of the time you know it wasn't simply just like a it wasn't like a totally lower class Rebellion it I mean uh take over the country the petite Bazi was were very involved in it yeah I mean and and it abstracting the Holocaust from history is extremely dangerous we've been saying this as it relates to you know this six months of Israel's genocide for a while now um because Netanyahu has spread conspiracy theories that it was actually the Palestinian Grand muy who gave Hitler
(06:18) the idea to exterminate the Jews um and then you hear Sam Harris saying this exact kind of same thing well keep playing it but saying that Hamas and jihadists generally are worse than the Nazis I mean I think that that is basically a denial of the conditions that led to the Holocaust um because you should be examining that this was a fascist far-right nationalistic political movement that occurred within historical and political context and didn't just come out of like say some random ideology these are all powerful
(06:52) and power structures that led to the rise of Nazis and they're not too far away from the ones that still exist today um I mean not saying that that is exact it's that's going to happen but the point is just like it's less than 100 years old and um it's not like we fundamentally remade Society in a way that we don't have these kind of far-right demagogues anymore um Nazism and farri movements exist throughout the world but abstracting them from history means you don't have to analyze the
(07:26) power uh structures that led to it um and you can make these crazy claims like Sam Harris does here support it that's an interesting question now right now that Nazism has been defeated but in 1941 there was nothing to do but kill Nazis I feel exactly the same way about jihadists in fact jihadists are worse than Nazis in my view they don't have the same power the Nazis had in the 30s and 40s which is a very good thing and we should keep it that way but their ideology is actually worse all right pause it
(08:02) again J I'm sorry wow wow that's that's something else I mean I and just to your point before we listen to more of that Emma that's one of the main purposes of like extricating the Holocaust and World War II and the atrocities committed by the Germans during that time from history from modernity from like any contemporary analysis because then you don't have to examine all of the component characteristics that existed in their society and existed globally that L that gave rise to it that
(08:36) continue to exist to this day you can just pretend like it was an anomaly it wasn't it wasn't an atrocity committed by the Western World and that's why you can say things like oh G Islamic jihadists are actually worse than the Nazis because their culture is giving rise to this hatred but that's not what happened with the you know Nazis in Germany it was something different it wasn't Western culture giving rise to this sort of thing it wasn't the anti-Semitism and the colonialism in the
(09:03) sort of just widespread fascism that existed at the time in one form or another it was just an anomaly which is different than islamicislamic relevant to our condemnation of them as a political movement I mean the whole the whole problem with the Nazis is that they had power it's not we're you know this isn't a some sort of uh you're a bad guy I'm a good guy I'm a civilized smart person you're a dumb brown person analysis I mean this is just for children well this is It's purely
(09:51) ideological we've moved from any sort of material or historical considerations into who has the worst brain and whose brain is doing the worst thing and that is a fundamentally misanthropic and elitist position and that's what Sam Harris is here for and in the end it's racist too I mean cuz why would you why would you be absolving um yeah no it's also up to be like sorry cursing but it's also messed up to say like oh the Nazis are gone that's why we can analyze them critically now and also the Nazis aren't
(10:24) that bad you know who's really bad brown people like that's that's his analysis at the same time he's saying Nazis don't exist he's also saying they're not so bad not as bad as like degenerate Muslims like yeah it's it's it's wild it's analogous to what Douglas Murray said after he watched the you know tape from October 7th like the unedited footage from October 7th that basically he wrote an opet afterwards where he was like even Nazis like drank themselves to sleep to to like forget all of the
(10:55) atrocities that they committed they had they were racked with guilt about what they were doing in the concentration camps somehow in the effort to say how bad Hamas is and how evil Hamas is it's also somehow in some way implicitly obviating or at least slightly absolving what the Nazis did in the Holocaust yeah I mean the jump to just bringing up the Nazis too is is a is a tell there like why even why even bring them up okay why I'll also just make a note like don't give Richard hanania any attention don't quote tweet him leave
(11:29) that little Nazi roach like to die in obscurity people need to not be shocked by the Nazi doing Nazi things on Twitter and quote tweeting it but anyway here we go but their ideology is actually worse jihadism is essentially Nazism plus an expectation of paradise it's Nazism plus religious fanaticism Nazism plus an eagerness to be martyred and to see their children martyred they many differences between Nazism and jihadism of course but they only make the Nazis look comparatively benign God Nazism was a quasi religious
(12:09) phenomenon na apologism these people were not rationalists it was basically racist mysticism anchored to a cult of personality but the Nazis didn't their own women and children as human Shields this is him so that's just basically saying that the the the jihadists want you to kill their children Y and also that the Nazis weren't so bad apparently that's that's what I learned today from Sam Harris's podcast didn't he used to just do like Zen meditation or something I feel like him and Russell
(12:43) Brand they meditated their way towards uh minimizing the Nazis compared to uh Hamas um there's a couple things I want to play here one is this Indian Diplomat here talking with uh oh I forget this guy Karan thar who does really great uh interviews um uh and this is just him talking this is how diplomats talk about this is not like far- leftist this is not you know um some sort of like extremist group this is ambassadors this is how ambassadors talk about terrorism um who aren't like cowed by Israel now
(13:15) yesterday Mr Emma Israel announced what it called an extraordinary listing of lashara as a terrorist organization India has so far not listed Hamas as a terrorist organization but the Israeli Ambassador has made clear to Indian journalists that Israel has formerly asked India to do this if India does take that step perhaps in response to what Israel has taken yesterday how will it be viewed in Riad in Cairo in Abu Dhabi in Aman India has suffered terrorist violence from lashara from 1989 to 1990 that is for nearly 35 years I never heard Israeli
(13:47) say anything in that regard over all these decades and now suddenly opportunistically because they want India to take a tough public posture and declare Hamas as a terrorist organization they have done this with regard to lar I think both actions uh the this Israeli action you know declaring lar as a terrorist organization and our declaring Hamas as a terrorist really meaningless they serve no useful purpose we are not involved we are not engaged we are as far as Hamas is concerned we have had no engagement with them as an organization
(14:14) we have never taken a public position and therefore we've never described to call Hamas at this moment a terrorist organization to my mind would be a travesty Hamas is a political entity and it has participated in elections the reason why you find the Palestine Authority so feeble today is because the Palestine Authority itself LED mm Abbas Israel and the United States are terrified that if you had free and fair elections in the West Bank and Gaza the Hamas would win it would win hands down that is why we have not had elections
(14:38) from 2011 till today and you have Mamu abas in position elected for 5 years now in place for the last 15 or 20 years therefore you have it is also a militant organiz has a militant part it is a resistance movement it is a resistance movement in line with numerous resistance movements that you have found in occupied territories indeed in our own country as well we have therefore as I have said and I'm going to repeat my cliche that terrorism like Duty lies in the in the eyes of the beholder and therefore Academia has moved away we
(15:05) don't use the word terrorism we use the word violent extremism and that is a neutral term terrorism is a term used by governments that are attacked by resistance Fighters and very often we we stigmatize them as terrorists that is neither as far as India is concerned labeling Hamas as a that's it that's um sorry that was a little bit fast that was that's uh half the speed that Matt normally listen to anyway slow down but the point is just obvious to anyone who isn't getting all of their news from
(15:31) basically media organizations that haven't uh uh T wrestle with the fact that Zionism uh and Zionist like and Israel lie about this stuff all the time and use these sort of terms like terrorist as propaganda um if we have time I also have another clip of Sam Harris um this is recently uh maybe I don't know if you can see the date there but probably within the last month or so on the dakot and the gurus podcast um and here it is if you're at like 55 Bradley um and they talk about uh this is a great podcast very I think fair not
(16:05) leftist but they they put this to Sam Harris like what how are you talking about the religious fundamentalism on one side and ignoring it on the other and I think Sam Harris's response is interesting in is really government who had a a poster in the wall of a terrorist and want Netanyahu kind of supporting the increasing settlement movement and cing the far right the religious right so my kind of point there is if you present that conflict as being you know purely about the forces of civilization versus like a religious
(16:37) fanatical cult and don't mention that there is a fanatical religious cult that is in the government of Israel and has made various statements which are similarly talking about the the promised land and and reclaiming it but it seems like you're being selective and it doesn't mean that you have to say they're both equal in that respect you can still completely them Hamas and and all the things you can still argue that Israel has a right to defend itself but it doesn't require serving as their kind
(17:08) of propaganda Wing because lots of Israelis were very unhappy with Netanyahu and his government it is a very rightwing government and the last thing I'll say and I'll give you a chance to respond Sam is like the ex Israeli Prime Minister who was assassinated Rabin he wasn't assassinated by Islamic extremists he was assassinated by a Jewish extremists who derailed the peace negotiations that were going on and the legacy of which was that Netanyahu who was in opposition to reing you know ended up in power so
(17:41) the history over there is very complex in that but I'm arguing isn't there a case that the presentation yourself and Douglas Murray have done kind of whitewashes those concerns which which are legitim I mean I I raised those points um a fair amount it's just just in proportion to the problem on the the Islamic side they're they're quite small I mean it's they're very unhelpful I fully Grant to you that Netanyahu has has been a disaster his support for the settlements has been provocative uh he's to some degree
(18:17) culpable for what happened on October 7th if for no other reason that he you know his attention was split you know and he was he was propping up the settlements in the West Bank and and leaving the border with Gaza you know fairly undefended right so um but yeah all the Mad work the settlers are doing in the West Bank um and the religious extremists who support them um all of that is incredibly unhelpful and I don't support it I said in other context I thought that the settlers should be dragged off contested Land by their
(18:51) beards right I mean that's not a fair it's not a um a u optic a great thing to say in the aftermath of October 7th but you know I'm Jewish and I can say whatever I want on the topic I think those people are religious imbeciles and they're they're creating immense harm right and and and they're they're imagine claims upon why doesn't the state of Israel act like it why does it instead act like actually they're part of the plan here that's a simple question but Sam Harris history
(19:24) only matters when it's time to um say bomb Gaza before October 7 now you get out of we don't need to talk about the ideology of the Israelis or in the settlers we don't need that stuff's irrelevant um because that stuff's only actually relevant to these people when they want to demonize somebody that's getting bombed no that's it all right well that was fun to see him uh a little bit uncomfortable there but that is the solution to the West Bank I'm sorry like not dragged off by the Beards but like
(19:55) there has to be some sort of expulsion that's probably not going to be and I'm not saying by like just violence but the International Community needs to say you need to go yeah these houses belong to the right of return all that stuff it it it there's going to be violent resistance if that ever came to pass by Israelis and they there needs to be defense against actually doing what's right which is to end the occupation full right of return like these actually are things that need to be confronted
(20:22) and it we've left it till this instead of confronting actually this stuff we've left it until the violence continues to spurt out because there's actually no military or like fencing solution even if Netanyahu had the fence of like of Gaza being guarded and wasn't supporting the settlers like that's not really a solution he's totally talking out of both sides of his mouth there by going he literally says back to back oh you know the religious extremists in uh Israel are are very small it's not not
(20:57) that big of a problem but October seventh happened because Netanyahu was distracted by what was going on with the religious right I mean what um Brandon from Kentucky I'd like to see Sam Harris explain how rational and not extremist the Third Temple is in Israel among Jewish extremists of uh Excavating under aloa MOS so it will collapse Netanyahu literally held a press conference under the mosque as a way of bragging about destroying it I did not even know that Sam maris's legit position is that stuff is less important
(21:25) because uh uh Palestinians do uh suicide bombing sometimes and now they're going to sacrifice four red uh hyers he is it heers heers yeah um without any white hair country girl Emma yeah well I thought I'd heard I'd heard heers in relation to like women right of course um but I didn't know if I should say it so I was like which way could I go um all right anyway uh definitely not a country girl um um June from El Paso says shout out to Matt's pinata analogy was fire that's one of my favorites
(22:06) frankly a lot of pinatas out there Mike Mike and Philly said did Sam Harris just call Nazism rational I think you call it pseudo rational but more rational than Hamas I think I think he was saying it's pseudo religious but that it was I mean half of things that he was saying about like uh Nazism and Nazi Germany I was like clearly he doesn't know anything about Nazism in Nazi Germany uh CU pseudo religious is putting it mildly uh but again like he's just like this is just racism you know Arabs are how he's coding
(22:43) Islam he said he said what one of the things he said oh he said something like that stuck out to me it was um that uh you know jihadists are trying to create a paradise for themselves and it's like wait but like it's literally why the Nazis were expelling people from the country like yeah yeah yeah and I mean what is Israel doing they're literally saying we have a we have a right to this land um because of like our the Bible and our you know genes from 2,000 years ago and I want to create this ethnic
(23:14) State Paradise it's all literally taking and how what about Christian Christian evangelicals who are literally are supporting Israel's right to do a genocide because they think that Jewish people need to be in Israel for Jesus Christ to literally come back to earth to like then kill all of them like I don't know like at the AR of the Covenant style like I mean come on I think if anything the people who are most engaged with their material circumstances are uh the Palestinians in this circumstance the rest of them you
(23:47) know Israel as well but evangelicals are just going off pure just religious zealotry for
