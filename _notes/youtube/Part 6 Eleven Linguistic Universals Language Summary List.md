## Transcript:
days like saying laster day instead of
yesterday or elbow leg for me
even when children stick to the rules of
a language they still come up with the
tardis things
for example just a casual look at
parenting blogs yields
all sorts of creative gems one
seven-year-old asked are there more
leaves in the world
or blades of grass and then followed up
with this doozy
are there more bricks in the world or
bird feathers
or this by a six-year-old what is the
name of the space
between the bits that stick out on a
comb
where in the world are these questions
coming from
all you need are rules creativity and a
healthy sense of curiosity
as we'll see in the next lecture this
ability seems to be uniquely human and
perhaps even genetically endowed within
us
no other species on the planet comes
close to this sort of linguistic
creativity
the next three design features are
displacement
cultural transmission and reflexiveness
these three are pretty unique by
themselves but when you package them
together
they highlight the true specialness of
human language

the first of the trio displacement
refers to the fact that language can be
used to communicate about things
not in the here and now think about it
how much of what we say is about things
that are far away and not occurring in
the present moment
we have entire fields of study that
involves
involve things out of plain sight like
physics and astronomy and chemistry
and in the past archaeology history and
geology
or in the future economics climatology
or consider some of the things that
children typically say
not only do they talk about things that
are right around them but they
also talk about things that are quite
displaced
how many days until my birthday i fell
off my bike yesterday
when are we going to grandmother's house
this sort of communication is quite rare
in the animal kingdom
most communication in every other
species is trapped in the here and now
locating the presence of predators or
prey
making or blocking sexual advances
marking one's territory
announcing one's arrival and calling for
help
now there are some well-known exceptions
of animals communicating
outside the here and now for example
bees communicate about the precise
location of food sources in
far-off distances and vervet monkeys
give alarm calls that tell fellow
monkeys
where to hide when a leopard or an eagle
approaches
we'll talk more about these specific
examples in the next lecture

even if non-human communication
occasionally breaks free from the here
and now
the source of things that animals
communicate about
is much much more limited than humans
this is illustrated nicely by our next
design feature
cultural transmission means that human
language is not
directly and completely passed down
through our genes
nobody is born with a brain designed to
speak
portuguese bantu or hawaiian to speak
these languages
we need to learn them first this should
not be taken for granted
because most other species are different
they are born with an innate and fixed
set of communication signals
so there's no no learning required at
all for them
this is not true of all animals for
example songbirds are a notable
exception
but it's true for most animals
even birds are innately constrained by
what they communicate
about when birds sing they share a very
limited amount of information
like marking their territory showing
their dominance and trying to attract
potential mates
that's about it when you hear two birds
tweeting outside your window in the
morning
they're not talking about how well they
slept last night or where they plan to
fly that day
these things are unique to humans we
tweet all sorts of things
i need to emphasize this point because
it's so important
humans are the only species that can and
do
communicate about everything we take
this for granted
but anything can be a topic of talk
so the next time you find yourself in a
tedious conversation about
politics or the good old days or the
rainy weather
pause for a moment to appreciate that
humans are the only ones on the planet
chatting about such things
perhaps the most interesting and unusual
thing that humans talk about
is talk itself this feature is called
reflexiveness human language can be used
to describe or refer to itself
this occurs in all sorts of ways it can
range from the very simple
such as i didn't hear you or how many
times do i have to tell you this or
i don't believe a word you said but it
can be much more sophisticated too
for example the legal profession is
built on the interpretation of words
or consider that almost every at every
level of education
there are curricula dedicated to
teaching people how to read
write or speak better in fact there is
an entire
literary cottage industry about it i
still recall william strunk
and e b white's advice in their classic
book
the elements of style imploring writers
to
omit needless words or use the active
voice
communicating about communication is
what cognitive psychologists call
metacognition and it goes hand in hand
with another unique aspect of the human
mind
humans can think about thinking this is
one of the crown jewels of human
cognition
and later in the course we'll explore
the neural mechanisms that make it
possible
this trio of features displacement
cultural transmission
and reflexiveness illustrates the
remarkable range of human communication
absolutely nothing is off limits for us
in fact language is so open that over
historical time
it's forced humans to create social
norms and laws that regulate what can
and cannot be said this next pair of
features
specialization and prevarication are two
sides of the same coin they both have to
do with the pragmatics of language

a unique feature of all language spoken
inside
is the eighth design feature language is
specialized for one purpose
to deliberately communicate this may
seem self-evident but consider
other behaviors that communicate but are
not specifically designed for it
when a newborn baby cries is it
intentionally making sounds to
communicate discomfort
or are the cries themselves just an
unintentional manifestation of the
discomfort
what about facial expressions when a
baby smiles
is she trying to communicate that she's
feeling good
or is that just what feeling good looks
like
what about adults non-verbal expressions
think back to the last time that you
tasted something truly disgusting
was the face you made intended to
communicate or was it just a byproduct
of the feeling
or what about cursing out in pain after
stubbing a toe
were you trying to communicate something
or is that just a reflex
oh here's a juicing one what about
flirting
when you laugh make eye contact and lean
in
that may signal flirtation but is it
always intentional
these examples fall into murky areas but
language is
crystal clear when you say a word or
produce a sign
you have one purpose in mind to
communicate
not only that you know that other people
know that you're trying to communicate
this sort of mutual understanding of
intentions is at the heart of language
and for that matter human cognition more
generally
this is even true when you use language
with with no one else around
when you make a list of things to
remember your intention is to
communicate with your future self so you
don't forget something
and you expect your future self to
understand that intention
have you ever talked to yourself to my
knowledge
no other species communicates with
itself to solve
problems or consider different
perspectives
this specialized communicative function
of language is also evident when you
accidentally miscommunicate something
if you've ever said that's not what i
meant
you're implicitly acknowledging that
words have intentions even if they are
misunderstood that's why we're so
suspicious when someone says something
offensive and then quickly announces
i didn't mean anything by that even if
that's not an outright lie
it reflects the serious naivete of the
speaker
of course they meant something

this example takes us to the flip side
of specialization
the ninth design feature is
prevarication which means that human
language
allows us to lie and lie well
if you think about it it's quite strange
that humans would deliberately say
one thing while knowing another thing to
be true
and yet we do this we learned to do this
at a pretty young age
certainly by the age of four children
have learned the trick of using language
to concoct
untrue stories i don't know what
happened to the cookies
i did not pull my sister's hair it
wasn't me
the fact that humans lie seems bizarre
if you think about the semantic property
of language
we've put all this effort into creating
precise words for things
so why would we not accurately describe
those things with the right words
the answer comes when we move up to the
pragmatic component of language
pragmatics tells us that words are
driven by intentions
and if line with language helps us
actualize those goals
then truth be damned we often rely on
things
other than language to seek the truth we
pay attention to the way people say
things and not to just what they say in
order to judge someone's true intentions
think back to a time when you didn't
trust what someone was saying
even though you had no proof the person
was lying what gave you that impression
maybe the person had a bad reputation
for lying or maybe there was something
in the eyes or face or hands
that set off alarm bells for you can
other species lie
clearly they can deceive you can see
that easily with the
camouflage of a chameleon or the the
feigned death of a possum
but whether those animals intend to
deceive is a different matter
some birds will feign injury to distract
predators from their nests
but that's not quite the same thing as
line it's more like distracting
but even if humans don't have a lock on
the lying market
we do it more we do it bigger and we do
it better than
any other species on the planet
specialization and prevarication nicely
illustrate
the uniquely social nature of language
this social component has not gotten
nearly the attention it deserves in
traditional approaches to linguistics
but times are changing
and it'll be a point of emphasis in this
course
the final two universals are add-ons to
hockett's original list of design
features
rather than being features of language
per se
these are universal patterns of how
language is organized in the brain
and how it unfolds during development
focusing first on the standard brain
network
there is remarkable similarity in the
neural machinery for
all language users on the planet to
explain this
here's some very basic neuroanatomy the
brain is divided up into two hemispheres
the left and the right
and four lobes frontal 10
