Transcript:
(00:00)  imagine two people are having a disagreement one of them mentions a peer-reviewed study to support their position the other gets angry and responds with something like that's just your opinion and continues to give his perspective without providing any supporting evidence in today's social and political climate this type of argument is all too common discussions devolve into shouting matches because for some reason opinions
(00:30) now seem to hold just as much weight as actual facts in this episode we're going to look at what's causing this problem and whether there's anything we can do to fix it but before we go any further let's define the words fact truth and opinion fact a piece of information presented as having objective reality or the quality of being actual a fact is a bit of information that is objectively and demonstrably accurate regardless of one's feelings on the matter earth is the third planet from the Sun and the
(00:57) fifth largest in the solar system that's a fact the Great Barrier Reef is the largest living structure on earth that's a fact these are verifiable statements that have been shown to be accurate or true truth is defined as the body of real things events and facts or the property of being in accord with fact or reality the word truth hinges on a statement being a verifiable fact an accurate representation of reality so if somebody were to tell you one of the aforementioned facts they would be telling you the truth
(01:25) opinion beliefs stronger than impression and less strong than positive knowledge or a view judgment or appraisal formed in the mind about a particular matter opinions while sometimes based on knowledge of facts are generally unsupported and are the product of one's feelings an example of an opinion would be pineapple pizza is the best so a fact can be proven whereas an opinion cannot because it's an untestable expression of one's feelings these definitions should give us a pretty good understanding of
(01:52) the hierarchy and relationship between facts opinions and truth here's the problem it's somebody's version of the truth not the truth he didn't have a a conversation this truth I don't be to go like no it isn't truth truth isn't truth you're saying it's a falsehood and they're giving Sean Spicer our press secretary gave alternative faxed that's very different from how we just defined these terms and that's intentional most people watching someone say truth isn't truth would say
(02:21) wait yes it is but if they repeat it often enough and loudly enough slowly those in possession of actual facts are left powerless as others begin to say well that's your version of the truth I don't believe that when facts are stripped of their power all that's left is people yelling at each other from one side or the other it becomes a near insurmountable challenge just to get to the baseline where both parties can agree yes these are the facts and go from there there have always been arguments based upon disagreement over
(02:48) what's most accurately reflected in reality but over the last few years things seem to have gotten really bad where did this problem come from I'll give you a hint you're using it right now the Internet as amazing and useful as it can be has given bad ideas that means to spread and multiply and infect people that normally wouldn't be affected by such harmful rhetoric the Internet is impartial and driven by algorithms it doesn't care what information is being distributed nor does it restrict the creation of
(03:15) factually inaccurate content in fact these simple algorithms reward easily digestible viral content think of it like the evolution of a parasite online groups communicate and slowly build a giant straw man of the opposing position the weaker ideas don't catch on and die off and the stronger more inflammatory ones become more common these parasites are shared on Facebook and other social media where suggestible people absorb them and share them again giving these bad ideas access to exponential growth this is all too common leading up to and
(03:44) ever since the 2016 presidential election more misleading or flat-out false news stories have been shared than real news when over 60% of US adults get at least some of their news from social media you can see how this could become a huge problem but what can we do about this trend are we stuck in a post truth society for good it's hard to say for certain but fixing the problem will be a huge challenge it's much easier to fool people than it is to convince them they've been fooled we seem to be creeping inexorably toward an Orwellian
(04:13) future where truth is defined by those in power take for example this quote from Orwell's 1984 the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears it was their final most essential command what you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening on the bright side many people are aware of this alarming trend of conflating opinions and worse lies with facts and the truth after Kellyanne Conway made her remark about alternative facts sales of 1984 went through the roof a large
(04:44) portion of the population is aware of the shift in discourse and we have the means to bring it back to normal each of us has the very human tendency to go out and find information that agrees with how we think it's our responsibility to acknowledge that tendency and do some research to ascertain whether that information is accurate we as a society need to come to an agreement that there is a reality and that there are true and accurate facts and that truth facts and reality should always take precedence over opinion on a
(05:10) personal level we need to separate ourselves from our opinions and not immediately get defensive when we hear something that contradicts one of our beliefs on the contrary we need to be more open to replacing our opinions with those that are more firmly rooted in reality in fact at the end of the day most people either don't have the time or don't care enough to do any research to validate their opinions this is a problem but it's an understandable one maybe the solution is to take a good long look at how the internet functions
(05:36) and see if there's some way to algorithmically detect false information to prevent the spread of these parasites of course any attempt to regulate the flow of information on the internet could be seen as an attack on freedom of expression or worse outright censorship but we have to be willing to entertain potential solutions to this crisis of truth we're currently experiencing it will be a struggle but if each of us can commit to being willing to examine our own beliefs and only agree to have a discussion with others on the basis of
(06:01) verifiable fact and opinions based on those facts I think we can overcome this challenge and become better together speaking of facts and opinions here are a couple more fact I recently built my own website with Wix opinion it was a really easy and enjoyable experience with Wix you can build amazing professional websites for just about any application Wix can handle any project you throw at it whether you want to host videos share your photo gallery book clients sell products or just about anything else you could ever want
