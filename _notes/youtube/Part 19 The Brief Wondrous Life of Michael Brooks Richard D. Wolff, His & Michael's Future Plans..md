## Transcript:

hello and welcome to this week's episode
of the brief wondrous life of michael
brooks it's nice to be back hearing from
michael's colleagues and and friends and
uh professor wolf and i talked a lot
about what him and michael had been
working on and developing and kind of
trying to build behind the scenes
together which was
you know really interesting and exciting
to hear about but also you know
devastating that michael's not here to
continue the project although the
project does continue
um
yeah i'm i'm looking forward to hearing
everyone's thoughts and feedback and
ideas
around uh some of the stuff that
professor wolf and i discuss in today's
conversation
and i hope that a lot of you can join us
for the brooks books group on tuesday
where we're going to be joined by
professor wolf so uh hopefully this
conversation will kind of kick off some
questions and and ideas that that you
want to bring to discuss with him and
then we can um have that kind of nicely
transitioned into this week's uh brooks
books group um so that will be tuesday
the 21st at 7 pm eastern standard time
we're gonna be loosely um
you know basing the conversation around
his book contending economic theories
neoclassical
keysian and marxian but
um really just any conversation
you know questions you have around
professor wolfe and michael's work
together or his work uh you know
individually please please bring all
right i hope you enjoy this conversation
as always uh thank you all for the
support and making this project possible
and uh welcome new patrons thank you so
much for joining here is my conversation
with professor wolf
as best i can remember
the first time
was when

another person that was somehow working
either with michael or in some way
crossed his path
came to me and said
would you be interested
in being on the michael on his show and
i said right away yes i would love to i
had knocked in
and the next thing i knew
and i never understood quite what the
relationship was but i got a call and i
went there
in that
that sort of boarded up area of brooklyn
where the
where the offices were and he had this
kind of apartment i'm sure you know it
that was all redone to be a studio and
he had his two engineers there working
and i sat on a stool next to him
and uh off we went i mean we had he had
given me a couple of
topic areas that he wanted to
to get into
uh he was very welcoming he was very
warm you know offering me a drink right
away when i sat down because i had a
little
if i remember a little fridge in the
corner where they kept their their sodas
or whatever it was cold
um and we went right to it and then we
did that quite a few times after that
um and it was very nice we we had i mean
i do millions of these things i've been
doing it for years now
um
and he is very exceptional
uh in two ways
an immense range of
actually three ways an immense range of
topics
an immense range of styles
he would go from
one kind of interaction with somebody
and then a completely different kind
with the next person so it was
it was an arresting
switch from one style to another
um
and
and he was always very
eager to to give you a chance i never
felt cut off i never felt that i was
required to come up with some 20-second
thing

he wanted me and you know i'm an
academic i admit it i'm a professor i
need to kind of spell it out a little
bit
i don't want to be misunderstood and
he was very
very gracious that's the best way i can
put it very gracious about letting me do
that
uh so i
i just liked it right away and so when
when we did it again um
you know it became a habit he called me
fairly often
um
and then

it graduated into
we both understood
that there was something missing
from this kind of work because i do it
too you know i have a program
not so different from his and i mean
i don't have as much time as he does but
nonetheless
we do similar kinds of work and
we both know its limits
i like that right away about it because
he was right away able and willing to
talk about what he wanted to do
that the program didn't
let him do
and that was the first time
when we had that conversation we made
the arrangement to meet
at a coffee shop he had a favorite
coffee shop
uh right off union square in in
manhattan
forget the name it's still there they
forget the name of it but i lived two
blocks from union square so it was
terribly convenient he liked to go there
i could
walk in literally two to three minutes
from my apartment to this place and we
always met in the same place
i don't think we ever met anywhere else
but there
and that began
what for me was extremely valuable
a kind of discussion
of how we could
make the kind of movement in america
that we wanted
and i
one of the things that drew me to him is
that he wanted that i wanted that and
that was something we shared
and that we don't share with everybody
else even people who say it it's not i
mean you know it's a throwaway line i
would like there to be a left movement
in america
but
i'm serious i want that's what i'm here
for that's what i want to do
if there's any
end result of what i do that's what i
want it to be
and he had that too and that was a that
was a big bond for us yeah
it's uh
yeah i think he was so torn about the
internet's place in it all because i
think it was you know the the media was
how he was getting his message out there
it was such a useful tool and then he
also was
extremely
exhausted anxious frustrated and
discouraged by the
just amount of chaos and distraction and
lack of strategy that also comes out of
the internet
he wanted the programs to be interesting
and to get at material and he drew it
out of people
and i do that too
but that really doesn't
by itself it isn't going to make the
movement it's going to educate people
it's going to excite people it has all
kinds of good consequences but it lacks
that next step of
welding it together it frustrates the
hell out of me and i had always the
sense
that it did that for him too uh this is
kind of in the vein of one of these like
really big questions that michael used
to put out towards you but
i think so many people who are still
connected to the michael brooks legacy
project and who will be tuning into this
conversation and following along are the
people who really want to weld and
really want to shift from from the
online to the to the in live a lot of
them are doing work in in you know
really amazing work in the political
space in the mutual aid space but um do
you have kind of
thoughts or ideas or things that you and
michael were talking about in terms of
of that that you know i like that word
you used welding from the internet to
the real life to make a real left
movement
we went all over the place we didn't
have i mean because of
because his life came to an end
we had planned to have meetings we had
planned to get other people together
he was for example

quite anxious
for me to be an intermediary to get him
together with cornell west
because i work with cornell and i've
known him for a million years and
you know that i can do that and i was i
was in the process of doing that
um
but you know we never got to the
to kind of doing it we were talking
about it we were
discussing how it could be done
uh we got sidetracked for example
i
um i focus mostly
either on the united states or
on the globe
and
i know that that's
in some way a mistake
and one of the things i could not get
over with michael was that in the middle
of his programs he would have an
extended conversation about conditions
in brazil or conditions in this car
and i i remember long conversations with
him saying
i can't get over this is fantastic what
you are doing
because you know if americans don't
understand their own capitalism which
they don't
uh then what they know about the rest of
the world
is i mean right up close to zero
half of what i do and this is really
important you know this
half of what i do is to explain to
people
things they should have learned in
college
and they never did
and
at first it was very frustrating
but i've learned to live with it
and i've learned that it can help me and
and the way it helps me is this
give an example
uh
what's the federal reserve
who cares
what does it do
who cares
okay
now that's the central bank of the
united states it doesn't do anything
that's all that complicated
and you need to know it in the same way
that you need to know like who's the
mayor of your town and kind of what's
going on and what are some of the big
issues
so here's what i do i explain to people
in simple english this is what the
federal reserve is and does
and here comes the interesting part
they're so grateful they've kind of
always wanted to know what is that thing
i read about it in the paper i hear it
in the radio but i don't really

and i and they're grateful and then they
are willing to listen to my political
stuff
and i've learned
this is a way
it's a little bit like having a style
that puts people at ease that makes them
relax so that what you're about to say
isn't already defended against because
they're halfway on your side because in
this case they're grateful you've
explained something so i do
a a boring amount and by the way he and
i used to discuss this all the time but
i admired
that he just did it he didn't worry that
his audience would be interested you
know he would talk about mozambique
or he would talk about the history of
nicaragua i know
that unless his audience is
extraordinary which it may be but in my
experience the majority of the people i
talked they would have no idea what i'm
talking about i'd be afraid to do that
for fear of losing them
he was not afraid and he used to say to
me i don't think i lose him
i think
i think there's a lot much bigger
audience one of the things we discussed
was
him helping me
go in that direction
we had a kind of a deal
i would get cornell for him and he would
share with me
some of the guests he had
who were particularly knowledgeable
about
events in brazil he was very interested
in lula and the whole workers movement
in brazil yeah or other examples like
that i mean you know that better than me
uh
and so we were going to help each other
as well as try to coordinate
in general guests
and we had little fantasies that we
regaled each other with
where we we thought you know this ought
to be all over the we ought to have a a
a syndicate of some sort you know
if one of us finds a live wire a really
good guest who who not only knows
something but knows how to present
herself how to project you know her
voice her style all the things that make
a good visual
well the minute one of us encounters one
of those we should sort of
urge that person well would you mind i'd
like to talk to my friend michael and
see whether you might go on his pro
in in other words to literally help each
other
and then to meet periodically it was
another idea we had to meet periodically
to tell each other
what was going well
in our work
and what was bombing in other words if i
got a topic and man it fell flat it just
didn't
excite people the the number of emails
we got fell
sharply or vice versa something took off
um and so that we would know that we it
would just be kind of an intelligence
exchange that would help all of us
uh kind of do it and those conversations
then evolved
into
both abstract and concrete conversations
about how to build a movement we wanted
to do that and we we thought i still do
although i have no one like him really
to work with at this point
um
we thought we ought to get together that
was going to be one of our first steps
a group of people you know he picks five
people that he knows i pick five that i
know and we get them together in a room
somewhere
and we brainstorm how could we
move these shows that we do
into some kind of organization
that could approach other organizations
um to see about
cross-fertilization or for lack of
another term
how we could build this
out
and we were noticing of course things
like dsa
which were attracting people and which
were growing and so were proof that
there was
that that americans were getting beyond
disinterest
and beyond interest to wanting to do
something about their political and
clear and and you know
lord knows we need to we need to help do
that
you know and of course you know when
when the
the pandemic has closed a lot of that
a lot of that down and you can't get
people together and all the rest of it
um
but he
for me
those conversations were extraordinarily
positive for me both substance and what
they went over the ideas some of which i
have worked on since
um but also his enthusiasm it was
infectious and it was what i needed i'm
pretty enthusiastic myself i think i
gave some of that to him
he gave it to me and you know you need a
little bit of whatever it is
to keep going
um and
he got good reaction to his program as i
do to mine and that's what keeps me
going
um
i have been able to do a couple of
things since then where it literally
crossed my mind that i wished he were
here
because he would have loved this
next step yeah um after you know michael
uh
grew up kind of having like this
i would say love turn to hate
relationship with sort of idolizing a
lot of the like megastar neoliberals of
you know our childhoods and adolescents
and i feel like i learned this phrase i
think in high school or college in some
theater class a teacher said don't
borrow steel when it comes to you know
things that work and art and i when i
when you're talking
ever since michael died i keep just
thinking socialist davos is what michael
is trying to build
and i and i hope if i keep saying it
maybe something like that will come
uh and obviously hopefully everyone
who's listening to this
understands that the propaganda and
horrible behavior that happens at davos
no one wants to emulate on the left i'm
just saying that physically getting
together
talking about what's happening there
there just always seems to be such
fragmentation and it does seem like the
right or the the center or whatever just
seems to have such a
better idea of just like getting in line
i mean someone like tucker carlson he
platforms like really
fringe people and like you know just has
this like big open tent for like all
these people with this like you know
ugly ideology and and you don't it seems
like you and michael were
you know being very tactical and trying
to just
create through line and
it's like you've talked about a lot when
you've been sharing about your work and
the parallels with michael's work but
it's like both this
making things so comprehensive so global
um you know so
multi-dimensional but then also just so
simple and clear
and it seems like you know like you just
you guys meeting at a coffee shop and
just being like what works what do
people respond to like it's so obvious
but people can burn the steps like it's
you know
that's what we did we more than anything
else
um
he would you know a conversation could
start with him saying
some he had a guest and the guest made
him angry because the guest did this or
didn't do this
and then i would chime in i had a i had
a case like that but this it worked a
little different and
yeah it would look that's why we wanted
to get a larger group together because
this was productive
we were we were learning things we were
getting ideas
the big step would have been had we been
able to do it is to pull together people
and to begin to pull together
institutions in a sense his program was
an institution it had
a following it had a reputation
it had people who expected it it had its
guests i mean you start adding it all up
and that's what that's what i have and
there's others and we ought to get them
uh
get them together i
i can't talk about it yet but
i've made an enormous step
through luck nothing to do with me
um
and you know we're going to have another
institution which you will hear about in
a few weeks or a couple of months once
we're ready
um
but things are percolating and one of
the reasons yeah one of the reasons i
can say this is that

we are also beginning to attract
um
how do i describe these people
they're people with money
that's the first thing
they're small businessmen and business
women
who
were radicalized somewhere along the way
in high school or college
um
didn't do much with it
went into the world of business
and
through luck and everything else they
hid it and they hid it enough
that their age 43
and they retired
because they don't want to spend their
life
you know
making software that's not i mean
it's interesting but after a
couple of hours it's very boring and
they don't want to do it anymore
meanwhile
this how do i put it
this delayed politics
which has been percolating just below
the surface of their normal everyday
life
you know it's like
meeting people who who are suddenly
painting in the forest you know
and their pat they just love to paint
they used to be on wall street making
money they made it and now they can do
finally what they love which is to go
out into the countryside
and talk about what color means to them
or what motion or or plant life or
whatever it is
well there are these kinds of people who
do that they're the kinds of people who
quit their job in new york and open up a
b and b
in some beautiful mountain area of
vermont or whatever and then there are
the people who are lefty politicos
who have been sitting
on their hands
doing other things
maybe because they were told they ought
to maybe because they come from a family
where everybody else is running around
making money
maybe because they were they were
expected to take over the family
business i could give you examples from
all of these
uh and but
and they haven't done anything until now
because there hasn't been a left that
they could
see
and by the way
the some of these are the secret people
that
michael reached
yeah no i i i'm glad you're bringing
this up yeah he did because they would
tell me yeah they would say well i watch
your show
and i really love chris hedges and i
watch michael brook
and they've been doing it for years
and it's been very important because
it's kept alive
that other part of them
now they're done with their business
life they don't want that anymore
and
what they have is enthusiasm energy
and money
and they want to connect to the michaels
to the me the others
because they know that we can be helpful
and that's how this next step emerged
this is
made possible by somebody spending a lot
of money
to build another institution
had michael been here you know he would
know everything he would know the
details i can't tell you about because i
would have brought i would have brought
him in much earlier to meet these people
because they already admire him from a
distance it would have brought them in
even more perhaps even sooner
because you know michael had a certain
celebrity status and for them
being close to him
brought them closer to this part of
themselves and that that was very
powerful it would have been very
powerful
yeah i mean that's why i feel
well in the wake of michael's passing i
started to meet a lot of people from
very different um socioeconomic
realities that that his work impacted um
there was actually a very wealthy
classmate of life from from college who
i'd kind of fallen out of touch with he
was like just people i i just never in a
million years even
in a pre-bernie 2016 run would have ever
you know like if i had said something
critical about obama they probably would
have been down my throats like it just
the the whole landscape changed so much
and part of the
idea around um this legacy project
making this documentary rearing all the
shows
is because for this little pocket of
time right now
you know what michael was talking about
three years ago is still very relevant
what michael was talking about last
summer is so relevant and so
he has we have this like uh
thinking of walt disney freezing himself
we have this like you know
michael that is still so alive on the
internet and i think still so compelling
to people a lot of people have found his
work post his passing and so you know
he's kind of on the front lines of the
internet now even though he's gone i
think still impacting people and all and
really connecting with like young
adolescent boys that we see can get rid
of radicalized in either direction like
so many
um young men reached out to me saying
that they were in you know kind of
flirting with alt-right spaces and
libertarian spaces and came across
michael because they were you know
searching something positive about one
of you know the the people mike would
make fun of but you know i know either
sam harris they remember whatever one of
these people and they would find a video
with that in the topic and they think it
was like oh yeah well you know another
fan it'd be michael just kind of
the way uh you might be deconstructing
something about the fiscal system
deconstructing like why this thought has
as there's no um nothing under the
surface
speaking of under the surface the thing
i kind of keep
coming up against and has been like a
big thing that's been like a big
challenge for me over probably just
maybe the past four years kind of
transitioning from like teen 20 kind of
just bright you know just energetic
optimism and just getting more beaten
down
you can't argue empathy i feel like
that's always where i hit a dead wall
when i'm i'm having a conversation with
someone
you know uh that that
on the michael brooks show you once
talked about body count
um you know the body count of capitalism
versus the the body count of you know
communism and you know the these like
very logical uh
metrics can be really helpful sometimes
in swaying people but i feel like i
always just hit a certain point where
i'm arguing something not in like a
moral like oh because it's better but
because of feeling like a deep amount of
compassion or empathy towards like your
fellow mankind not just your
self-interest and that's always where i
just feel like i come to just a brick
wall
and i feel like it was maybe through
humor maybe through i don't know what it
was but i feel like michael was getting
there and this is you know also
something i think why he was so
interested in connecting with um dr
cornell west was the spiritual side of
it the the kind of non-verbal
non-intellectual
energetic uh you know
global
aspect
and um i i really hope that people
are able to kind of take that part of
michael's work as well that like you
know there's people out there that step
up in that space because i think
you know
there's there's only so much you can
logic right i think he was very good at
that let me let me tell you just just my
opinion
i thought and i admired that i tried to
do it
but i could see him doing it i even
learned
you know i stole a few
stylistic things that he did
i thought he did that very well that is
he he wanted the factual
he asked specific questions he drew out
of his guests
you know the logical analysis but then
he would and this was mostly him doing
it himself he would veer around and take
the take a more
empathetic or a more spiritual
and he did it with a kind of smooth
naturalness
that i think went a long way to say to
people without saying it in words
these are different sides of the same
michael this is you know i'm into the
econom i'm into the you know he brings
me on i explain some economic detail
but
you know there's a hundred ways to do
that you can do it in the driest most
boring
spiritually dead way or
you can make it a big excitement a big
feeling like that and i i
i thought he did that really well like
that was a i thought of virtue he had
and he did it seamlessly i mean almost
in mid-sentence he would shift
from the the detail
bit
to the more
open-ended
human solidarity kind of and he didn't
shy away from it and one of the ways he
did it was that he would
and i admired this because i don't do it
uh
under his
breath he would finish
a little thing about whatever it is he
was talking about
and maybe some person and then under his
breath he would say he wouldn't use this
word but imagine him saying you
know yeah
letting his
letting the audi he didn't say ass on he
said some other i mean he might
yeah well usually he he wasn't big on
that kind of thing
uh
but he would choose some word probably
not sociopath or yeah he would let
people know
it's not just this criticism i just made
of him but this is an you know
this is i reject
this whole thing the way that this
person
thinks by the way
that business with body count
i encounter that over and over and over
and more i'm getting more invitations
which i'm accepting i didn't used to but
i'm now accepting
invitations from right-wing
uh interviewers and
i mean you cannot imagine if michael
were here he would just be shaking his
head i have to listen
i have to listen to them explain to me
that marxism
killed a lot of people
in russia and china
isn't it awful
and i look at you know
and i go out i mean i'm not nice
when you for me that's that that is so
nutty
i'm open to a lot of nutty and i'm nice
and i'm welcoming and i argue but there
are some lines and if you cross those
lines like everything else in life
something that one
just uh
and i suspect it's because of my history
um
the how do i say this uh
most
i don't have much family i mean i'm
married i have two children and all that
but beyond my little immediate nuclear
family i don't have much family because
they were killed in concentration camps
and they were gassed to death in
in the various nazi delta my parents
were refugees and came here
i was born in ohio but my p my father
was french my mother was german you know
and i speak those languages because i
learned them as a child
uh but but to start counting bodies and
asserting who killed what they did
i i'm gonna go right back at you and i'm
gonna bite your nose off yeah and the
right wingers you know something they
don't no one has ever done that with
them they have so often spoken to one
another
telling these stories and having the
other one nod in agreement that they
they're completely flat-footed when you
do when you push back
there's i mean
they don't know what to do they just
don't know what to do yeah
you know where it ends up it ends up in
a place i'm happy with
body count is not a very sophisticated
effort to understand hardly anything
if you look closely enough pretty much
everybody has a lot of skeletons in
their proverbial closets you know people
are killed you know
the one i use in this country because
people who do this tend to be religious
is i say to them you know
i'm a student of history
and
across the middle ages
we have the hundred years war the 30
years
we have unending
destruction of human beings and it was
all done in the name of jesus christ
would you therefore argue you know
i'm dropping them and and halfway
through they understand they're being
trapped but they have no answer
they have no they don't know what to do
they start mumbling i have them and but
i had to learn that
i had to learn and then when i get them
i turn around and if i'm really cooking
i will then tell them about my family
yeah and who killed them yeah when no
communists killed them it was no
socialists killed them let me tell you
who killed them right let me tell you
who made the gas let me tell you who
made the guns let me tell you who funded
it
and you know americans are not good when
you confront them with the vastness that
they don't know
and they put someone put some very makes
them i don't think they change their
mind by the way no they don't that's the
but that that problem time yeah yeah i
mean remember this is a lifetime that
got them to this point you're not going
to undo that but you have to remember
every time you com this is really
important michael knew this yeah every
time michael even made that little aside
that was a dart
and those people heard that dart they
could have dismissed it they could have
but it's in there
it's in there and if another another
dart happens and another
then it comes you won't even be there
you'll never know you'll never see
but the effect of having
michael doing what he did
all the time
that's very i know that from my own work
that
that's absolutely true that's why what
he did is so important and that's why
you need more people doing it that's why
your documentary about him if you can
get some of this across
can be very powerful in getting people
feeling better
to know that it had all these effects
you even mentioned a couple of minutes
ago if i if i heard you right that you
you interacted with someone who who
remembered years later something michael
had said or who found it useful or who
those thing i mean my wife's a
psychotherapist if you understand how
the psychology of human beings works
all of our interactions shape us
we may not know it we may not want it
too bad they do
that's why when you have a problem and
you're older in life you go and you sit
on a couch like my wife has for all of
her clients
and you try to reconstruct
particularly when you were a child what
those interactions were that make you
who you are because if there are parts
of things that are troubling you about
yourself you can't have a relationship
or you can't hold a job or you can't
stand going to class or whatever it is
there are reasons of interactions you
had with other people
that produced this in you and if you can
figure them out
it's a therapy it is a way
of crawling out of it yeah
yeah
it's uh
i i think you know everyone has to go
out and speak truth to what's put out
there because if you don't then that
just becomes the narrative
it can be incredibly frustrating and um
you know it can feel i think i think i
you know i'm i i am
much younger and have so much to learn
but from from the way i see the world
it's like a lot of people who i think
are on the left
are on the left because they've
experienced something traumatic or
they've had deprivation or they've gone
through something that's given them a an
understanding that things really aren't
working so well a lot of people are on
the right it's pretty great i mean why
would you want things to change like you
know you and your family are safe and
comfortable and your friends come over
you have a nice time you're still maybe
living in like a little bit more of a
90s reality or on the other end of it
you've been told that all the reasons
your life is so hellish is because of
you know progressives and and the
coastal elite or whatever there's these
these narratives but i think sometimes
the fracturing and the and the thing
that's so hard about banding the left
together is everyone's trauma and pain
makes them like have this very specific
lens in that is just not as unified and
so sometimes i think the thing that
you know i talk with michael about that
can be just
it's so daunting and so hard to get up
every day and face it's like okay
we we're not even all standing together
to just like get in line against like
just very basic truths you know about
what's happening in the world but then
you also have to turn around because
someone behind you might be saying oh
you're a sellout you know you know
all this you know right now it's aoc but
you know that there's been a gajillion
aoc's before and after and
you know it's like that they're really
it's funny because we use the language
solidarity love and solidarity but you
really don't feel that much solidarity
out on the left and i'm hoping this
project that you're uh giving us little
cookie crumbs and morsels about um you
know yields more solidarity because it
definitely is something that bum michael
out and and bums me out a lot
yeah well you know you but
that's the ideological challenge for us
this society america is the united
states is more
successful at this
than any other country i know of i mean
i don't know that many countries but i
really do know western europe pretty
well because i speak french and german
because i've kept
ties there part of my family still lives
there and so on uh
you you really have to see and michael
and i talked about this a lot
this is a culture that is suffused
with an ideology
it's the ideology of capitalism
in western europe sure you have
capitalism and you have that ideology
but you still have lots of leftovers of
the feudal ideology before capitalism
and the feudal ideology we all lived in
little villages right where we really
did
interact and take care of each other not
out of some ideal but because that was
the way life was organized
and
a certain level of solidarity
a certain level of being part of a long
chain of being
is just built in i can see it in in the
little bit of my family that's left in
europe when i visit them and so on
the united states
it was the people who who were misfits
in europe
who couldn't stay there for a variety of
reasons often not their fault but they
were the people who didn't
couldn't make it didn't make it made a
mistake
and they ran away
to start all over again right they
killed all the people they found here
which was extremely important this is a
country born in mass murder yeah uh and
they
they were
they eradicated the local people
and they ran away from what they had
come from
and they built a new
system
and they did it one by one
and the and it it cultivated in them
an individualism
that is pathological
and it it
it attenuated it it killed off
social analysis
let me explain
in my family my mother and father
whenever anything came up
whether it was a personal issue
or something in our little community
world affairs
my mother and father both of them would
give an analysis
of how the society
made this happen
even if it was a per if you know some
little boy hit me on the playground and
took away my truck or
or you know
grabbed my sandwich or whatever yeah
they
i learned without understanding they
didn't understand i learned
that the reasons for individuals
behavior
individual situation is the context the
social context
that shapes their mother their father
their cousin their uncle their
girlfriend their boyfriend whatever
and to think like that americans don't
get that
americans i mean i'm exaggerating
obviously
it's a generalization sure sure but in
my life i you know i've been a teacher
all my life that's what i do i sit and
talk to students you know i don't know
how old you are but i talk to people
usually between the ages of 18 and 28.
that's the people i i teach
in their early 30s maybe um
they have to learn this
they think
they inhabit a universe that's like this
right in which they're all alone in it
and and whatever happens to them is the
result of either something in them or in
that other person and and that's it and
that's where they stop and if they don't
want to blame themselves they blame the
other one right
not a healthy way to make relationships
you know i mean it's just
and i watch it and i feel
sadness
yeah i feel my god they don't have the
vocabulary
they don't have the frame of mind they
can't
exonerate themselves i did an interview
yesterday
with a journalist in brazil
okay
a very charming woman and she's pretty
well known and she's asking me questions
that i'm answering and i used the phrase
self-made man
and i made a joke about it because
i've always i've taught this in my
classes that is one of the most
ridiculous concepts i ever heard of you
know but it's so american oh yeah
nothing more
impeccable english i don't speak
portuguese so she spoke impeccable
english she said to me
that's so funny she said because when
that issue comes up
as in the interview between her and me
and i have to translate it now into
portuguese
there is no portuguese equivalent you
can't
in
in portuguese at least a brazilian
variety
that idea is so friggin weird so off the
chart so absurd that there's no such
term she says it takes me three
sentences
to people who start laughing when they
figure it out that you know because i i
say to people in this country you know
it's biologically impossible you cannot
make yourself you need parents remember
you know and
it's like the phrase lift yourself up by
the way
yeah that's a physics impossibility
right right i am
but people who think americans
unlike any european i've ever met
they believe that
they really believe
that they are responsible
for who and what they are
what an amazing idea uh is there some
sure there's a grain of truth in all of
that
but
you're the least little bit accountable
for what you do
this is the enormity of what shapes you
this is the part you're responsible for
that's not an exotic exoneration
but it is to help you think otherwise
you drive yourself crazy
and i think americans are in the process
that's another thing i at the end of the
last few times um michael and i spoke
we both
we said to follow i don't know if you
had these conversations with him or not
but this might be interesting for you
we both
made the following
i don't remember who made it first him
to me or me to him
the phrase we used and he used it too
it's over
it's over
sentence period two words it apostrophes
over
now
he liked that phrase so did i
it described
the united states in his head and for me
too
and
i'm about to tell you what i meant by it
if you ask me is that what he meant i'm
not sure because we were in the early
stages
for me
it's like this and i think he may have
seen it this way too
that roughly
from 1820 1830 the early years of the
united states up until the 1970s
american capitalism took off
people were richer every decade than
they had been before they were more
comfortable
the workers had to fight but they got
rising wages they really did
the capitalists made a fortune they
became the most powerful big capitalist
country in the world the united states
it was a real and it bred in this
country the feeling that god liked
americans better than he or she whatever
your preference is liked everybody else
and all of that kind of stuff
and then in the 1870s the 1970s this
sort of
calmed down
and now we're on the down
because
it's over
and this culture is lagging this culture
understands
and i'm pretty sure michael agreed to
this part
they the people of this country
understand
somewhere
that that's the case
but they have no way
to understand what's going on
no way to explain it
so if somebody comes along and says q
anon
since they don't have an explanation
themselves well maybe that's right
maybe we need to have a leader who's so
different from the normal boring
republican and democrat that will vote
for donald trump
just because he is a roaring
and these nice reasonable people we have
been electing
have been sitting on
it's over
yeah if you ever go to england if you
ever go to england you can see a
population that's been struggling with
it's over oh yeah
oh yeah yeah and now we're we're
following yeah
yeah and
for me
by the way
i i do a little test when i think i can
get away with it if i'm in a
in a situation where i'm talking to
large numbers of people
i will build up a crescendo
and the punchline will be
it's over yeah
and let me tell you something
you could hear a pin drop
it's as if
i don't i can't think of a metaphor the
the audience the people are looking at
me
there's this moment i don't know if
they'll retain it i don't know what
they'll do with it
but in in
10 seconds
there's a
a communication going on that's magical
i feel with them they feel with me
it's remarkable yeah really
yeah i mean yeah
it definitely does feel like the fall of
rome is back my fiance and i drove um
across country and back this summer and
everywhere we went i was looking around
be like is this bridge gonna crumble
like do these pipes have lettuce like
it's felt like you know there's just so
much you know you you kind of zone out
you listen to your podcast your
audiobooks you listen to music you drive
your party you was just on autopilot and
kind of living in this still you know we
both grew up kind of coming of age in
the 90s and early aughts which now feels
like really a different time um
part of what you that's what this that's
when it goes down that's that's
i can get you novels of other societies
when it goes down people
in all these different ways it touches
them and and it out outcomes
in their personal life or in their work
life or in their home life
uh
it erupts
periodically
yeah you know
there's these stories
i recently had a friend who went across
country
uh
and he
he and his girlfriend
stayed intentionally they didn't camp
which they had thought of doing they
stayed in what he described as
shitty motels
they went from one shitty and they
wanted
they wanted the experience and it was
unsp i mean
the motel room smells like an old
cigarette
that the shower doesn't really work
the i mean
and the people who
are working behind the desk
you know
it's
you need you need a skilled writer to
capture
yeah
but you you're traveling through
decrepitude
it's decrepit
well yeah just you see firsthand you
know i've i've
i've lived in california for close to a
decade now so you know california is
like a microcosm of america because just
the the extreme wealth is that where you
are now yeah yeah so you know you you
you know you you see
people
living on the street in front of you
know huge modern museum like how you
know it's it's uh
more
you know whatever you it's too many
analogies to count but it's just so
extreme but when we were driving around
america
it was
i've been like pretty viscerally upset
by experiencing the extreme heat
and like kind of getting like feeling
kind of sick and dizzy from just how hot
it was we just drove back to the south
in arizona and texas and then just
seeing people living in these like
little metal shacks little rv parks or
something about like the poverty and the
climate crisis like when you're like
literally just like looking at it and
feeling it and then
on the southern border passing these big
warehouse prisons and we would go
through checkpoints with like
20 or 40 cameras just angled all at our
car and you know we're american citizens
we're not
you know we have we know we have no
drugs in the car we have no you know
we're not in any way doing something
that could get us in trouble you know
we're white we have id credit card you
know every box you know where we have
smartphones and still you know you start
to think like oh you know we we went
through one checkpoint and they had
every car stop it was just it was in
uh new mexico near one of the national
parks
and they like asked us if we're citizens
if there's someone else in the car you
know a guy with a giant gun
like it's it's really quite
surreal
but you know these are all
these are all
symptoms
of disintegration you know it's just
and and
again i wish my wife were here she could
explain to you
it's one thing
if you're in if you have a difficult
situation
to navigate
it's another thing
if you deny
that you're in a difficult situation to
navigate it makes the navigation ten
times harder
and this is a country that needs to
pretend
that everything you just told me isn't
happening or if it is happening it's
extremely exceptional you know
when my wife was just starting in her
practice
because she has people come to see her
as a therapist
she discovered that something she didn't
expect that a significant number of the
people who came and she doesn't see
extremely
troubled people she really
sees people who need to talk about life
to get back on track
yeah i understand but she
she discovered that a significant number
of them
once they got into the therapy and they
talked about their childhood had
been
sexually
abused as a kid yeah
all right that's incest
and she grew up like i did i mean i knew
what that was
but in my head that was something
that happened once in a blue moon
in some rural backwater where nobody
you know people live in little isolated
cabins and
and the men get drunk and
that
and
it's a completely it's everywhere and
it's been everywhere throughout our
history but we need
an ideological
help
that this
either doesn't happen or
is a once in a million
aberration of some sick person a blah
blah
the idea that it's rampant
it's
but it is yeah it just is you know yeah
it's it's also has to do with like
superiority like i feel like you know we
grew up
culturally having like pride around
jewish heritage and i feel like it was
like jewish people like there's no
pedophiles in jewish communities like
something my grandmother literally said
to us which is like an insane thing but
probably on some level probably to this
day if i was to take some sort of just
word association test i would think oh
christians that they're the ones with
the pedophile problem you know
we we get this stuff so deeply lodged in
us so i guess kind of where this whole
conversation is built to and and one
thing i'm curious about just the one
thing i wonder about
you know a lot of people look to michael
for entertainment and optimism
and i think people want to engage and
want to be part of a lot of people are
feeling this kind of
you know my life i've kind of had the
inverse which is i personally was like
on food stamps and felt a lot more
insecurity and housing you know
instability in a more prosperous time
when i was young now i personally have
more um stability
and steady income as an adult but the
whole world is you know it's like it's
switched so i feel like i was giving
kind of uneven experience and um went
through deprivation and have a lot of
empty understanding because i i really
lived it
but i i don't know
how to
talk to people who haven't lived it
without being like the bummer or burning
them out and also you know i hope to
have kids and i think you know you
talked about your parents
um kind of contextualizing something in
like a broader society a broader globe
when you were little but then at the
same time you know you don't want your
kid to be like little running
around like
slapping their friend being like oh
they're you know there's forced
deprivation here on the recess you know
jungle gym only one of us can use this
slide you know i i had to fight you for
this resource or whatever you know
what are there any like um
books or schools of thought or things
that you kind of look to when it when
it's like
how do we navigate still just being like
humans still wanting creature comfort
still wanting entertainment still you
know still wanting to be human and still
wanting to be optimistic and have fun
and connect and again that's another
thing with the left like this dower down
you know
doom and gloom and and maybe it's not
even an author maybe it's just life
advice that you have to kind of share
with people a lot of people who tuned
into this project i think are kind of
in in the camp i'm in where it's like do
you get married do you have kids
like what what do you how do you stay
human and move forward in your life in a
way that's not delusional during
you know it's over
times
yeah well
i have two children i will speak very
personally um
i have an extraordinarily close
relationship with my daughter
less so with my son my son is older my
daughter's younger
um
but i would say to you
that
having children which my wife we decided
they were not accidents or anything like
that
um
was one of the best decisions
i ever made
i don't regret it
whatever the opposite of regret is
that's what i feel i'm lucky i have
that kind of an interaction in my life
as intense as that
um
so i i never understood that's also very
american
maybe this will help you
i never understood
growing up in them i was born in ohio as
i told you i
lived here all my in this country i
worked here all my life lived here all
my life
my wife's an american you know blah blah
i was flabbergasted when i began to be
clear to me in college
that left wingers which i was already
wanted to be
as i'll use your words dower
down
dressed
i don't know if in your generation
dressed very shabby um
almost proud
that the jeans were worn
and the jacket looked crappy
and not because he had worn it a lot
because it was crappy when you bought it
new
it was crappy yeah um and that this was
a badge of some sort
i that's not the left in europe
in the left in europe
the whole idea of being a leftist is
that all of the creature comforts the
pleasures
should be for every in other words it's
we all want that we all want to go to
the beach we all want to get together at
the tavern and have a spectacular meal
and really good wine and that that that
that that
and i never ever that's a part of me
that's european that it's like my
language english is the third language i
learned i knew french and german when i
was five years old my parents put me in
the kindergarten and that's when i
learned english right
that
that part of me that's european
is the part that understands what you're
saying but sees it as a
peculiar american
no and it's it's very religious you know
it comes out of the old idea that if you
really love god if you're a good
religious person
then you give away your earthly
possessions
and you become a mendic you know a
beggar you you go around and have people
sustain you
because you bring them
some healing
connection with cars
it's murky in my mind because it's so
foreign to me but it's a notion that if
you're an honest leftist
you can't enjoy a hamburger
what
europe this would never occur to any
really
it's unconscious here and if you tell
europeans about it which i do because i
see them they start laughing yeah
because it helps them understand things
about america they never did
but it also clarifies a distance
between the left here and the left over
there
you do not criticize people in europe
really i mean i'm sure some do but in
general if there's give you an example
you go to a meeting of radicals
and one guy
walks up and he's not very well dressed
and the next guy
uh rides up in a 10 000 motorcycle all
dressed with leather in the whole outfit
people find it interesting and amusing
but the idea that there's something
illegitimate about the guy who clearly
has enough money to come on a motorcycle
and blah blah really doesn't occur it
just yeah and maybe a little personal
envy i wish i had the money to do that
but there isn't
the person
again you know it's this individualism

you're not rich because of you you're
rich because of a whole set of
circumstances that ended up positioning
you in this way at this point in this
country's history and it that same
country positioned that bum over there
in a different situation he got sick he
got divorced he got onto drugs who knows
you know and then you have to examine
why that happened and that has to do
with his childhood and so it's a
different way
of seeing it
i
i'm considered by most people i mean you
may disagree but i'm considered by most
people that's what they tell me as
optimistic
and i am
i think the
the it's over
is
the best chance the left has had in this
country in at least a century
if not longer
i
i was active in the 60s
my coming of age politically was against
the war in vietnam so
this is where we are right now
is a hundred times
better
it's bigger
and it cuts much deeper try to imagine
with me
uh
when we fought against the war in
vietnam we had to convince americans to
give a flying if you pardon my
language about something happening 10
000 miles away and the truth was nobody
did
they didn't know what vietnam was or
where it was or why it mattered they
didn't
if they had a relationship they had they
didn't want to get drafted that was real
but the end no no
nothing
now people are talking about what's
going on here in your job in your life
in your student loan we are talking
about the real issues that people
agonize over that gives us an entree
into their lives and consciousness that
we would have
you know we would have given anything
for in the 1960s
we don't have to convince americans now
that there's poverty most americans have
already figured it out they've seen it
if not on a trip like you took you don't
have to go very far up i'm sitting in
manhattan
yeah i only have to walk two blocks from
where i'm sitting
and i can show you poverty you don't
even want to think about yeah right
listen if you want to talk again let me
know i think this has been of use to you
um absolutely absolutely
i'm looking forward to connecting on
tuesday again and uh yeah we'll uh we'll
do this hopefully in person at some
point for the documentary okay very good
take care

shells fully loaded mansions with empty
shelves your words and actions which
anyone the people could tell broke down
