## Transcript:
ladies and gentlemen welcome to room for 
discussion today it is my honor to welcome  
a guest a historian who's become world 
famous at least here in the netherlands  
but seriously he's been called one of europe's 
most prominent young thinkers and he's been  
called also the dutch vunderkind of new ideas and 
we already had the honor of hosting him here four  
years ago when we talked about this book utopia 
for realists and we talked about revolutions and  
work a shorter work week and also the universal 
basic income but today he's here to talk about  
humankind his book that has been translated 
into 32 languages and that has the dutch title  
the meister mensa dejo which means most people 
are decent so what we're going to do today is  
we're going to see if that's true we'll discuss a 
little bit and we'll also put a theory to the test  
um something that i would like to note is that 
there should be somebody sitting next to me  
today and that's martina burillo she was going 
to be my co-interviewer until she got colbin  
but the questions are as much hers as mine 
so for now please join me in welcoming
please have a seat
filter how are you today i'm very 
well it's great to see you all  
yeah you've been here before right um i think 
four years ago yes yes yes i was invited by  
you guys i think a year ago and to talk about 
basic income and i said well i already did that  
i was like oh sorry we forgot so uh 
we have this one to talk about yes yes  
um four years long time what would you 
say has been the biggest change in your  
life since then huh well i became a father six 
months ago congratulations maybe you can see it
um and apart from that not much you know 
still doing the same thing i think that's a  
pretty big thing um now you also fathered we could 
say this book humankind a hopeful history and um  
so maybe to those in the audience that haven't 
read it if you could give us a quick uh synopsis  
you know what is it about and sure in a nutshell 
sure so the short summary of the book is that  
most people deep down are pretty decent 
um it's it's basically a what is it 400  
500 page argument against what the dutch 
primatologist franz dual calls veneer theory  
this is the notion that our civilization is just a 
thin veneer just a thin layer and that below that  
lies raw human nature that supposedly deep down or 
all these selfish beasts monsters maybe even and  
in the book i i try to provide a lot of evidence 
from psychology sociology anthropology archaeology  
to show that that's actually not the case in 
fact that it may even be the other way around um  
so yeah it's a ridiculously ambitious book 
but just couldn't help myself i guess right so  
the main argument being most people are decent 
we'll be talking about this word a lot decent  
what what is that for you human decency it's 
a very good question um so there's a very new  
interesting theory from evolutionary anthropology 
that i talk about in the book as well um which is  
about the question why have we humans conquered 
the globe you know why us why not the neanderthals  
why not the bona bows or the chimpanzees what 
makes us special as a species and there's one  
evolutionary anthropologist called brian hare who 
is quite the notion of survival of the friendliest  
right that was actually our friendliness our 
ability to work together in large groups um  
that really distinguishes us in fact that even 
for century for millennia it was the friendliest  
among us who had the biggest chance of passing 
on their genes to the next generation because  
they were better at cooperating and surviving in 
a very tough environment like the ice age so i  
guess that's sort of my rough definition of being 
decent is being generally pro-social uh of being  
i don't know um willing to work together with 
other people not only thinking about yourself all  
the time but of course because that's also in your 
self-interest it's one of the arguments that i try  
to make in my book is that all these big debates 
about does genuine altruism actually exist because  
you know when altruism makes you feel good then 
is it actually altruism and my view is that these  
debates are sort of pointless because um wouldn't 
it be horrific to live in a world where altruism  
feels bad right where you know you do something 
nice for someone else and you suddenly feel  
nauseous i mean that would be really a nightmarish 
wall i'd say yeah um so i i think i have maybe  
a low bar for being decent um you could that's 
that's one of the i think the strong criticisms  
of this book is that in fact it sets the bar 
too low so in one sentence what would it be  
decency it's like we need to be pro-social think 
about others and as well about ourselves yeah and  
the the willingness to how do you say that um to 
be part of society to contribute something to this  
to society to not just think about yourself and 
your own good i think that's um that's very much a  
human thing it has been for a very long time right 
so you mentioned altruism and maybe one of the  
most famous philosophers uh in altruism is peter 
singer um maybe you're familiar oh absolutely  
we had him here as well a few years ago and he he 
became famous for the argument of the child in the  
pond so i think you have you walk and and there's 
a pond and there's a kid you see it drowning  
and what would you do you would go you would help 
the kid right you wouldn't want to save that kid  
and now if you imagine you hear on the radio 
there's children drowning in a pond in bangladesh  
and saying you would probably not raise a 
finger i i probably wouldn't raise a finger  
and so the question is you know what 
what should we do about that should we  
give every like we could maybe help these 
kids giving to charity or something like that  
and peter singer says we should give everything 
away to charity as long as we have like a bare  
minimum standard do you think we're indecent if we 
don't do that well i think it's very important to  
recognize the limits of human empathy 
it's why i've got one chapter in the book  
about empathy is that a lot of people see empathy 
as the solution to all the world's problems but  
in fact as the psychologist paul bloom has argued 
empathy is very often more like a spotlight like a  
searchlight that focuses on one specific group one 
specific person i mean you can see it happening  
today i mean everyone right now is focused on 
what happens in in ukraine and obviously we all  
want to do something and so you're like okay now 
i'm going to donate money to this or that charity  
but the effective altruist you know peter singer 
is part of the effective altruist movement would  
say well are you really sure that that's the most 
effective use of your dollar because if something  
is in the news right now then there's probably a 
lot of other peoples who people who are gonna be  
donating as well and maybe it's better to i don't 
know to give it to a charity that that hands out  
bad nets because that will be more effective in 
saving lives in say sub-saharan africa um so um  
yeah i think we should resist the temptation to 
say oh the human instincts are are by definition  
good or our empathy is also always something that 
we should follow um in fact in the book i make the  
opposite argument is that quite often we should 
be wary of our empathy because actually the other  
side of the coin is xenophobia there have been 
quite a few studies and many examples throughout  
history is that when we feel enormous amount 
of empathy for one person or a group it's often  
combined with with you know hatred for another 
group and xenophobia yeah let's talk about ukraine  
in a moment um for now so if if we're decent we 
don't maybe need to give everything to charity  
but um we also do indecent things right 
would you say that you're decent well  
it's up to others to judge but i think i'm 
relatively average human person so if we  
set the bar uh not too high then i'm probably 
decent but actually ryan this book has made me  
think a lot about how far you should go i'm very 
fascinated uh at the moment and have been in the  
past couple of months by by the effective altruist 
movement of which which peter singer is one of the  
one of the founders um and what they say is well 
you should actually take it a step further and uh  
and think about for for example your extraordinary 
responsibility if you live in a very atypical  
historical situation like we all do in an 
extremely rich country um you know maybe most of  
you are not yet but at some point you will be part 
of the probably part of the global one percent um  
you only need around what is it 30 to 40 000 
euros in annual income to get that um so we all  
remember the occupy movement that said we are the 
99 well globally actually we're not you know we're  
it's it's we're very unusual moral position um and 
so what does that mean how much of of your income  
should you give to charity um i mean i have that 
with the book you write a bestseller and and then  
you're wondering what do other authors do right 
what does naomi klein do what does noah chomsky  
do what what's your moral responsibility um how 
much should you give away uh how far should you  
take it and it's very very convenient and 
tempting to say well look you know it's just  
i'm good enough the way i am right 
now yeah i did some research i think  
i found your name on the list of people who give 
ten percent of their lifetime income so what make  
when you settle for ten percent or like choose 
ten percent well i became member of a pretty  
fantastic organization that's called giving what 
we can founded i think around 10 years ago and  
the members of that society pledged to give at 
least 10 of their net income to highly effective  
charities now in the netherlands the average 
is around 0.4 percent so 10 percent is i mean  
it doesn't maybe sound like much but actually 
compared to what most other people do it is a law  
um and i think that you you know especially 
when you make more money you have a more  
obligation to go even higher than that sort of 
like progressive taxation works um i think that  
especially as someone who's relatively successful 
in a western country you have that responsibility  
so could we say that but obviously the question 
is where do you stop right so peter singer he he  
he thinks i think he gives it right away around 
50 of his income but he still lives a relatively  
comfortable life right so you could argue that 
he's still being selfish and he should go over 60  
but then i don't know i don't really like those 
debates because i think it's already you know  
super amazing that he goes that far yeah yeah i 
thought it was funny that a few years ago you went  
to davos and you called out the philanthropists 
but now you're also in a way you've become one  
yeah yeah but some people sort of misunderstood 
my position back then i'm not at all against  
philanthropy i think it's pretty wonderful when 
people give away their wealth to highly effective  
charities that's that is absolutely wonderful 
what is what is really depressing is when  
billionaires use their philanthropy to distract us 
from their completely corrupt business practices  
and their tax avoidance and their tax evasion 
yes then we should be very skeptical about  
philanthropy especially when so much of that 
philanthropy is pretty ineffective and it's  
mainly about i don't know spending on the arts 
or something like that right instead of you know  
saving as many lives as possible yeah um so what 
struck me in my research on humankind is that  
you know we i think most of us would want to agree 
that that people are decent but some of us don't  
some people say no humans selfish greedy um do you 
think that maybe they weren't convinced because  
you you use a lot of anecdotal evidence in your 
book well i think i have a uh how do you say that  
a double approach in the book so yes i do use 
a lot of stories um because i think stories are  
very effective when you want to convey a certain 
argument or idea um i often find it funny is that  
people can forget everything um so for example 
in my in my previous book uh which was one of  
the ideas in the book was universal basic income 
and i had one one story in that book about um  
a small experiment that was done in london with 
13 homeless men and they had rece they received  
around 3 000 pounds um and they were free to 
decide for themselves what to spend it on this  
is this really wonderful story of at least seven 
out of 13 of the men had a roof above their heads  
in a year and they used the money very well you 
know actually they were pretty frugal and if they  
spend it they they use you know very spending on 
very sensible things like a dictionary or hearing  
aid or whatever um so this is this one wonderful 
story now if you think about it critically  
it's it's obviously pretty much useless right it's 
an extremely small experiment i mean you all know  
that the what is it the end is is way too small 
you can't say anything about human nature based on  
on that one story but what happened to me multiple 
times in that period is that i would go to  
a birthday party you know and i always loved 
talking to strangers at birthday parties and  
they would say well what do you do and i say well 
you know i i'm a writer what do you write for well  
i write for the correspondent i never heard about 
that uh and so what have you written well this  
that book don't know about it what is it what is 
it about well one of the ideas in there is basic  
income oh that's interesting i should look this 
up there's been a study in london with 13 hours  
man and they would start telling me this happened 
multiple times and and so they forget everything  
they forget your name they actually forgot 
that they read your story and then they start  
uh explaining the whole story to you and 
they don't know that they've actually  
read my article yes but obviously you have 
to go further than that so what i tried to  
keep in mind while i was writing this book is 
will this hold up say five to ten years from now  
and there were quite a few studies that 
um i found it tempting to use them for  
example there was a big study in science 
published a couple of years ago about people  
losing their wallets and that actually a 
huge percentage of most people many countries  
bring those wallets back and i thought well this 
rather nicely fits my argument but i didn't use it  
because it hadn't been replicated that study so um 
i think that and i think in pretty much all of the  
chapters at some point you you you see me talking 
about meta analyses you know studies or studies  
where we where scientists have really tried to 
see does this hold up is it really a pattern  
in the whole literature um and another interesting 
thing is that you start relying more on research  
traditions so for example i've 
got one chapter in the book about  
contact theory which is a really old theory from 
psychology right goes back to the 1950s while the  
sort of the new fancy theories from psychology 
priming for example well it's completely  
even daniel kahneman says it's dead by now but 
a lot of people wanted to believe it and there  
have been a lot pop best sellers about that theory 
right let's uh come back to contact theory um also  
at a later stage um but one one puzzling question 
if we think about human decency is if humans are  
really good then why are there bad things and 
you know you grew up here in the safe netherlands  
far away from any poverty and violence and my 
question is do you think you would have still  
shared this idea that humans are decent if you had 
grown up in extreme poverty or you had experiences  
robberies or rape something like that could 
you would you still have written the same book  
i think my background has probably made 
it much easier for me to write this book  
so yes i had a happy and safe childhood i have 
two wonderful sisters my parents are awesome um  
so yes i completely recognize that but then on the 
other hand this is a book about a genuine shift  
in science and so there are other books like this 
that have been published at the same time the the  
the most important one is uh blueprint written 
by nicholas christakis and you know much more  
famous and how do you say that reputable 
scientist than i am i'm not even a scientist  
um in which he also makes the argument that 
something is happening in psychology and  
anthropology and archaeology that there is a shift 
towards a more hopeful view of human nature that's  
why that's one of the main reasons why i wanted to 
write this book is that i thought someone should  
connect the dots here um and sure i believe 
that my background has made it easier for me  
to see that happening and yes you have to 
be very wary of your own confirmation bias  
but then if i look at the readers of my book 
actually there it's it's pretty diverse and i  
i also get a huge amount of feedback of people who 
didn't have such a privileged background but still  
find the book worthwhile also people from what 
you said were maybe not the one percent or the  
three percent exactly exactly yeah exactly okay 
i mean that is one of the most exciting things i  
i i got a an email a couple of weeks ago from a 
from a teenager in iran and iran doesn't really  
have copyright laws um copyright protection for 
books so there are three editions of my book  
in iran three different translators it just like 
they just start translating it and i didn't you  
don't even hear about it as an author and so this 
this this teenager just read the book and said it  
meant a lot to him uh i mean that's super exciting 
just how to see how contagious ideas can be  
and and can even be picked up in sciences 
that are so radically different from your own  
yeah so all of us sit here today and we're 
all safe and you know it's sunny outside  
life is easy but we saw last week europe's biggest 
country invading europe's second biggest country  
there's war in europe and yeah if humans are 
innately good then how can we explain this this  
bloodshed well people like me are obviously in a 
difficult situation two years ago we had to become  
expert virologists and now i finally am now i have 
to switch to be an expert on russia and ukraine  
that's obviously a little bit so i mean 
obviously we have to take everything i  
say here with a grain of salt and with what 
a lot of other peoples are saying as well um
well what do you want me to say i mean there are 
there are enormous amount of examples that we've  
that we've seen of extraordinary human courage and 
decency i mean if you look at the response in in  
you know border countries like romania 
and poland i mean people are sort of  
all yearning to be part of a solution here uh 
refugees coming in and there are thousands and  
thousands of people waiting there to help them um 
sort of reminded me of the situation here in the  
netherlands in when was it 2014 2015 during the 
so-called refugee crisis which wasn't a crisis  
at all it was sort of well if it was a crisis it 
was an artificial politically created crisis um  
but um at some point my sister called me 
and she said she was a little bit angry  
and she said you know i just want to help 
the refugees and i've i volunteered but  
they turned me down they said they already had 
too many volunteers and later they calculated  
there were two there were two volunteers for 
every refugee uh here in the netherlands um so  
i think this is a this is a very clear case where 
you know the human there are so many more people  
um on the good side of history are actually 
showing standard human decency it's just that  
you know the people doing the bad things they 
have such an extraordinary amount of power  
um i mean i've got one chapter in the 
book about the corruption of power  
and it may be worth while to read it again 
and think about what's happening in putin's  
mind today it's not only putin of course right if 
we look back just at the past 70 years you know  
the holocaust happened and soviet massacres 
happened and stasi germany happened and the  
list goes on right it goes it goes aleppo and 
now it goes kiev and that's just yeah why does  
history keep repeating itself also on such massive 
scales where hundreds of thousands of people start  
killing each other if we're so decent 
so obviously you have to come up with  
an extremely layered explanation right you can't 
just say well human evil exists because of this
one of the things that i try to do in the book 
is to say well our simple explanation that we  
often use um human do evil things because they 
are evil that became pretty popular by the way  
that explanation after the second world war 
i talked about william golding's book that  
became a bestseller in the 1950s and 1960s 
i talk about the social psychology lord of  
the flies yeah i talk about social psychology 
experiments that became hugely famous you know  
stanley milgram the stanford prison experiment 
and i think what what these stories and studies  
wanted to tell us was that um well things 
like genocides and ethnic cleansing and  
all these crimes against humanity they're they're 
not aberrations or anything they're just part of  
human nature that that was what stanley milgram 
for example said it's like well this could happen  
anywhere you could just take an average american 
you could take anyone here from this room and  
easily turn that person into a sadistic torture 
right uh into a camp guard in a concentration  
camp because it just takes you know it's very 
easy and i i i think i i strongly argue against  
that idea in this book i think uh it's a much more 
gradual process in which societies sort of poison  
themselves it takes a long time um and at every 
single step there are opportunities to resist  
so that that's that's one important point another 
important point is that very often people do  
bad things in the name of the good right one 
example in the book is from the german soldiers  
allied psychologists initially thought they 
were mainly motivated by ideological hatred  
then they start interviewing prisoners of war and 
discover that actually most of them are motivated  
by the love for their friends and their 
comrades and they don't want to let their  
comrades down and actually the german 
army command knew this very well  
and they they used it so they 
they literally tried to keep  
uh you know the the soldiers together for as long 
as possible especially if they had been through  
uh hard times together um now this doesn't 
condone anything right it's just an explanation  
uh it i think it makes it easier to understand why 
um sort of normal average human beings can keep on  
fighting because that was allies psychologists 
were perplexed by it in 1944 1945 why were  
these german soldiers still fighting when it was 
completely clear they were going to lose the war  
well one important reason was they 
didn't want to let their friends down  
now i'm not saying that that explanation also 
works for say cam cards in our switch obviously  
not then you need a different kind of explanation 
which i i think i would think focus more on  
selectionary mechanisms right we know that a 
lot of the most horrific guards were probably  
psychopaths right but if you create a whole 
system that selects for psychopathic traits then
anyway library's full of books about it i guess 
that's exactly my point is you can't cannot  
come up with a simplistic explanation like well 
humans do evil things because they are evil right  
that obviously doesn't work you wrote about the 
shameless as you call them that are often at the  
top of of society or of political organizations 
and that we tend to follow them in often into war  
as well so what does it say about us as humans 
that we follow them over and over again these  
these ruthless politicians warmongers bigots 
do you think maybe this could happen to the  
people here us in this room well absolutely i mean 
there's a a lot of historical work has been done  
on intellectuals writers poets artists uh in 
the weeks and years before the first world war  
and many of them were extremely enthusiastic 
about the prospect of war they thought it would  
be liberating they thought it would cleanse 
society from decadence etc so this is not just  
something that people with too little education 
can be excited about to the contrary actually
i've recently wrote an essay that was all 
around about uh something that margaret mead  
the anthropologist supposedly said he probably 
didn't but who cares um so the quote is um  
that we should never underestimate the power of 
a small group of thoughtful committed citizens  
to change the world in fact it's the only thing 
that ever has and i'm obsessed i was especially  
obsessed with the second half of the quote 
you know it's the only thing that i ever asked  
because i think it's very true 
um the vast majority of people  
don't really change the world at all because 
people just desperately want to be liked right  
we just desperately want to be part of a group and 
it's very hard to go against the grain and to do  
things radically different right at the moment 
i've been uh i'm i'm i'm working on a series of  
essays on the history of abolition um and um well 
i've tried this a couple of times but very often  
if you ask people would you have been against 
slavery in the 18th century or in the 17th century  
most people say yeah probably would have been 
yeah i probably will have been an abolitionist  
but you know maybe but chance is very very small 
that you would have been because there were just  
very very few of them and for a long time those 
the abolitionists that were there were really  
ineffective and didn't really change anything so 
i've become obsessed with with this question how  
how do you actually stand on the right side of 
history because it's easy for us to look back  
and look at say slavery or or witch-hunts etc 
and to say well that was horrific these people  
were barbarians but then the historians of 
the future will also look at us and maybe  
they'll look at some of the things we take 
for granted today and say well that is  
that is equally horrific that is maybe just as 
bad as slavery was two or three centuries ago do  
you think can you come up with something that 
we're doing now that maybe in 100 years we'll  
find it terrible oh yes yeah well it's very easy 
of course i think at the top of the list is the  
way we treat animals uh i think that's super 
obvious that i mean just the scale of factory  
farming is so so enormous talking about what is 
it 60 70 80 billion animals slaughtered every  
year and the vast majority of them live 
in absolutely horrific circumstances um  
so yes i think that maybe our grandchildren 
maybe the children of our grandchildren  
will be shocked that most people in this room 
probably you know just eat meat from from  
sentient beings that had an absolutely 
horrific life so if you do that today  
well and you think that you would have been an 
abolitionist in the empty century well maybe not
but there are other examples as well i 
mean the fact that extreme poverty exists  
what is it almost a billion people in this 
world live in in such horrific circumstances  
and um there are there are different 
estimates so there's one charity evaluator  
called givewell that has done super rigorous 
research in which they calculated that with  
around three to four thousand euros you could 
save one person's life with for example the  
distribution of bad nets or the distribution 
of vitamin a supplements um and um well
we probably maybe not now but probably all of us 
at some point in our lives we could start saving  
lives right and um we don't do that well why not 
why why does it why does that still exist maybe  
this range of the future will will be horrified 
by that as well yeah and if we get back to to  
the war that's happening um you wrote in the 
first pages of of humankind maybe i can find it  
you wrote the story of what happened in london 
in 1940 in the blitz in the blitz india and i  
think that you wrote and i quote it's when crisis 
hits when the bombs fall and the flood waters rise  
that we humans become our best selves do you 
think that's what's happening oh absolutely  
i was i was in kiev actually in october at a 
conference uh and i saw zelensky speak i was well  
i don't want to make this about me but it is 
sort of bizarre that i was five meters away  
from him and we i thought it was hilarious that 
this guy who just what is it four years ago was  
a star from a television series a very silly 
television series and that he had now become the  
president and i was talking to it about it with 
different people at the conference and they say  
well yeah this is sort of the ukrainian trump you 
know it's the same process he's just a celebrity  
who thought he would be a good politician and 
now he's here giving the speech at the conference  
and now he's turned out to be 
a pretty awesome war leader
but yes this explosion of cooperation 
this willingness to work together um  
i think it's pretty clear right now in in ukraine 
also i mean if we look at the larger scale the  
the people i mean you mentioned people handing 
out aids do you think that will ultimately  
way stronger than than maybe the atrocities that 
are happening right now that we're not hearing yet  
because the dust hand hasn't settled yet i 
mean usually with lawyer comes war crimes  
and terrible violence yes yes yes well 
look in a way i think you can say that  
and i'm sort of hesitant to comment a little bit 
about it at all because i'm really not an expert  
um but what you can say is that putzin 
has almost already lost the war because  
um i mean you can you can sort of keep on 
bombing embalming that was the theory of the  
of both the allied and the germans is that 
this notion of moral bombing that you could  
sort of break the will of the people with 
with more and more violence and the opposite  
happened um actually people were more resolved 
and and became stronger in their cooperation  
during those moments of crisis and it seems 
to me that the spirit of the ukrainian  
people is pretty much unbreakable at this point 
and that yeah but anyway i'm stealing still  
incredibly worried i'm incredibly worried about 
about nuclear weapons as well um i don't know  
it's weird it's so weird it's it's almost 
like we've stepped into a time machine right  
and now we suddenly remember oh wait a minute 
these absolutely super destructive weapons they  
still exist and they're being threatened as well 
it's it's weird isn't it for for people like us  
we're like this was supposed to be over we 
have these major challenges like climate  
change the extinction of species that's going 
on we cannot afford to go back to the problems  
of the cold war but here we are if we think 
about ourselves here in this room do you think  
what you said there about the best of us coming 
out in the moment of crisis do you think that's  
that we can say that about ourselves 
right now are we here in the room  
now being the best selves i mean the the war in 
ukraine is is a few thousand kilometers away but  
it's in europe because we're in europe well it's 
the question obviously what you can do right so  
we'll probably have a situation like in 
the spanish civil war that some people  
from i mean zelensky has already asked people 
from foreign countries to come over and  
you can get a weapon right i think i would 
probably stand in the way i would probably  
be completely useless to the war effort um
but again from from sort of the effective 
altruist perspective it's also worthwhile  
to to ask yourself what can i really do 
what is the best use of my time resources  
money etc yeah so you don't think we're or maybe 
let me ask you again do you think maybe we're  
here doing the best we can right 
now to to stand up i mean um or  
are we just worrying about our own gas 
prices going up or our stocks falling  
i was actually pretty impressed by the 
response of leaders in the european union  
i think a lot of people wouldn't have 
have expected that that it would be so  
that there would be a consensus 
that was arrived at so quickly  
uh and it's an enormous historic turning point 
historic term point in sweden germany you name it  
i don't know but as i said i feel uncomfortable 
commenting on this because i don't know we're  
in the middle of history in the making and 
uh you say something today and it's it's  
uh it's out of date maybe in the evening 
already i actually saw an op-ed uh in the  
financial times are today that was arguing 
for sanctions that were already implemented  
by the time the opec was published so i don't 
know right then uh let's hope that the war will  
you know not claim too many victims and 
let's talk about something that we're  
more more familiar with here on this room and 
something that's been going on for two years now  
and of course i'm talking about kobit um which 
is also a source of conflict right you have  
the vaxxers versus the anti-vaxxers you have the 
the protesters versus the lockdown supporters  
and the measure supporters and what we saw was 
people insulting each other for having different  
opinions yes right we saw a lot of hate and i'm 
talking about both sides we saw some violence even  
did we forget about decency during the pandemic 
um well sure there are a lot of examples like that  
especially in the case of anti-vaxxers i i agree 
with you that um i recently saw a poll in which  
the researchers tried to measure the 
hatred that people have for anti-vaxxers  
and it's pretty shocking actually there's 
an enormous amount of disdain and dislike  
um that's that is completely counterproductive 
so i don't know um what's your experience but  
i haven't convinced many people in my life by 
insulting them and by saying you're extremely  
stupid and you should adopt my opinion or my 
position generally doesn't really work right um
actually the we we we fastly overestimated the 
the amount of people who are strongly against  
vaccination there was recently a study in the uk 
that i think the number was 0.4 of people who are  
ideologically motivated not to take the vaccine 
the vast majority who did of people who didn't  
take the vaccine you know just didn't have the 
right information didn't have the time um you  
know didn't see the opportunity um they're 
from less privileged backgrounds you know in  
poor neighborhoods etc and people who they 
thought about it and and said no don't want  
to take this risk yeah yeah but it could be 
relatively easily convinced so uh one of my  
sisters she's a doctor here in the netherlands and 
she joined the volunteers initiative of basically  
just standing on a on a square or a market where 
people could approach these doctors in their white  
coats ask questions and she said well did for one 
day convince them people to take their shots um  
so that and that wouldn't happen obviously 
if you're a determined enzyme actually  
yes in general it's just very hard to convince 
people if you're if you want to insult them at  
the same time right and i heard you speak 
in an interview with the new york times  
where you were talking with of people that 
don't want to stand on the wrong side of  
history and i think maybe you could explain 
what you meant with that that a lot of people  
that are truly convinced about 
what they're doing the right thing  
they don't want to be convinced of the 
opposite right maybe you can elaborate on that  
um i don't think i fully understand so i think 
that the thought was that nobody likes to stand  
on the wrong side of history yes people who who 
say no i don't want to vaccinate myself i don't  
think the the covet uh viruses yes there are 
very few people who say look i'm just selfish  
and that's why i don't get my shots that's 
why i eat meat that's why i don't donate to  
charity it's because i'm selfish right that's 
who i am there are very few people like that  
vast majority of people say well look i'm a 
generally good person not an angel but i'm  
you know i'm a decent person and there are 
practical reasons for why i eat meat because well  
everyone does it it's natural it's important 
for my health and it's just just the way it  
is and that's how slavery was condoned for a 
very long time because people said well look  
it's just maybe it's not pretty but look it just 
it's always been with us every society has had  
the institution of slavery um it's impossible 
to get rid of it you know it's been tried but  
you can't do it and if we would if we would try it 
well probably wreck the economy so right so people  
come up with all kinds of justifications and maybe 
some of these justifications are even reasonable  
um but yes and generally in general we like 
to see ourselves in a good light and that's  
maybe that's also something i've realized more and 
more after publishing this book and what partially  
explains the success of this book obviously 
a lot of people want to hear the message that  
deep down were decent right it's a very attractive 
message at some point i saw a reader uh posting on  
on instagram you know in a very relaxed setting um 
on the flylands you know this island in the north  
of the netherlands with a glass of white wine 
saying cheers most people are decent wonderful  
we're having a wonderful holiday and next week 
we're going to bali like oh i created a monster  
it's too late now yeah the genie is out of 
the bottle well let's say maybe we instead of  
thinking about how we can convince these 
people to to do the thing that we think  
is right but they think it's not right the 
qr code is gone now for a few days so maybe  
we can use this moment as a as a turning point 
where we can maybe move closer to each other again  
reconcile repair those broken bonds 
what would you tell to someone who  
has stopped talking to a friend because of 
disagreements on the covet situation perhaps
uh well medium real life that's extra 
incredibly important you know our very  
bodies have evolved obviously for social 
contact that doesn't really work well on a  
on a distance we've all experienced that uh 
you know in these zoom times um i think just  
some of the basic facts about our bodies are so 
fascinating the fact that we are pretty much the  
only animal in the animal kingdom with the ability 
to blush our eyes are unique compared to other  
primates so all the other primates they have dark 
around their uh irises dark sclera as it's called  
uh so i can see that you're looking at me 
right now if you would have been a chimpanzee i  
wouldn't have been really sure because your gaze 
would have been well more hidden um yes in a way  
we've we've evolved for this kind of face to 
face contact right and it's it's much easier to  
establish trust in that way well then the second 
thing is obviously to ask more questions right
i'm not saying that i'm super good at it but 
it's one of the most important life skills  
is to ask genuinely curious questions 
about how other people see the world
just asking the question often already 
does so much in order to establish trust  
even when you don't agree just the fact that 
you show that you're you acknowledge someone  
else's position and that you're yeah you're 
interested in where they're coming from well  
it does so much in uh in in human interactions 
but uh i mean that's that's interesting about  
context theory the what we talked about uh 
this this very old tradition from psychology  
some people could say well this is this is 
total common sense right how do you combat  
racism prejudice etc well you try to bring people 
together and if they meet face to face and they  
you know do some things together they turns out 
well actually people are most people are pretty  
nice wonderful well do you really need like 500 
studies to prove that do we have 500 studies  
oh more than that yes yes no it's one of the 
most established theories in psychology as i said  
yeah and so contact theory also involves this 
thinking in terms of us versus them right and  
if let's say our dna is sort of we're hardwired 
to think in terms of us versus them yeah  
and our brains haven't really changed in 30 
000 years do you think we can evolve to be more  
friendly to the others more forgiving maybe 
more understanding as well um so i'm a little  
bit hesitant to say that we are hardwired to be 
tribal all the time right because especially today  
humans have so many different identities and very 
often these identities are layered or they're even  
in conflict with each other it's i mean we're 
very focused obviously on the situation in the  
u.s i think that often goes wrong in european 
journalism that is that um because we don't  
read german anymore i mean this is the case for 
dutch journalists is that we we can't read german  
newspapers we can't read french newspapers because 
our education was so bad and so we only focus on  
on the debates in in in america and then we assume 
that the same things are happening here but the  
level of polarization there and especially the 
way all these different identities have stacked  
on top of one another so you if i know that you 
like say this kind of sports then i already know  
everything else that that's there to know 
about you if i wear a mask i'm a democrat  
et cetera and that's that's it's that's not 
the case in many other places in the world it  
doesn't have to be like that um and especially 
you know once uh once people have a certain  
amount of diversity in their life i think that's 
the best vaccine against xenophobia um but then  
obviously it has to be genuine travel right if 
it's just tourism going somewhere and you know  
having you having a good time and then going 
away but something like you know living in  
another country for a while i think it's it's an 
extremely valuable thing in your life and it's  
it's it's almost like a sort of a social vaccine 
against xenophobia because you just realize that  
the way you do things in your country it's not 
it's not the only way it's not the natural way  
i mean i'm not much of a traveler myself i live 
in this provincial town called howton and uh  
i i just i don't know i become very nervous 
every time i have to travel so i prefer to stay  
stay there it's it's a very boring place you 
could die on the street and no one would notice  
wonderful um but for me studying history is 
a form of travel um the most important lesson  
of history is that the way things are today is 
not inevitable right everything could radically  
change and that i think that in itself gives 
you a certain humility humility about your views  
because so many people in the past and today 
have thought that they were on the right side of  
history and that their views were correct but yeah 
i mean today there are there are 5 000 religions  
and so many people believe that their religion is 
the correct religion well what are the odds right  
i was born in exactly the right society so um i 
think that's that's great about both traveling the  
world and studying history is that if you do it in 
the right way it makes you much more it gives you  
a lot of humidity yeah and you open your book 
i have it here with a quote from anton chechov  
who said man will become better when you show him 
what he is like so do you really think that maybe  
by reading a book like this by starting to believe 
that we're better we will actually become better  
well you know it's a little bit of a joke actually 
that i use that check of quote because it's so  
often been used by people who are pessimistic 
about human nature i think stephen pinker used it  
as well in his major study on war um and obviously 
i'm very critical of stephen binker's book  
but their argument is that you know men will 
become better if we finally acknowledge that we're  
these violent creatures so i thought that i would 
turn it around because our view of human nature  
can be a self-fulfilling prophecy it's not just 
about the science itself right it's what it's  
what we assume in other people that we bring out 
of each other if we assume that most people deep  
down are just selfish then how are we going to 
organize our universities our companies the way  
we do democracy etc etc well i think we're going 
to build institutions that will bring out a huge  
amount of selfishness and i think this has 
generally been the case in this historical  
era that we call the era of neoliberalism 
and that's maybe now finally coming to an end  
you know for such a long time so many people have 
assumed that people are fundamentally selfish  
and built their institutions around it and 
maybe we can change that right i think this  
is a good moment um to ask if anybody here 
in the audience would like to ask a question  
so i see some hands maybe the 
blonde young man over there
hi first of all thank you for coming has been very 
interesting so far and we just talked about how  
different stories and narratives bring the best of 
us and uh i would say yeah that good people good  
societies spur from good narratives collecting 
narratives that make us see more long-term what is  
good for our society and work toward collective 
goals however we have seen lately that we consume  
very personified uh individualized information 
and a very fragmented information that usually  
creates this um enclave thinking of and seeing 
only the worst in other people do you think that  
there's still place in contemporary society for 
these big narratives which make us work towards  
collective goals and if there's a place for them 
in contemporary society how do we embrace them
you know when i was a a student history student 10 
years ago i had to read all these books about the  
end of the nation state for example and that the 
end of patriotism and blah blah blah and that you  
know we would all go up in one big and a global 
thing um and today we don't really believe that  
anymore i think we i mean if you want to think 
about nation building today in ukraine i mean  
it's extraordinarily powerful stories coming out 
there that will be talked about for decades maybe  
even longer than that zelensky saying i don't 
need a ride i need ammunition or the story of what  
happened on that island and you know the first 
time i i i saw that story i thought well i'm not  
really sure if that really happened in that way 
and i think initially they said that they were all  
killed the 30 men i think now it's maybe they're 
still alive anyway it doesn't really matter  
because the story itself is so incredibly powerful 
at this this moment in history so uh i don't think  
any any of that has changed uh i think we humans 
are fun you we are a storytelling species um so um  
and it's it's also the case with some of the doom 
thinking about modern social media for example  
that everything is fragmented that people don't 
have attention spans anymore et cetera et cetera  
i don't know i don't know i mean you can read 19th 
century social commentators talking about say the  
rise of the the train or the telegraph and having 
these same complaints like people can't focus on  
anything anymore uh you know they there's no 
no stability whatsoever in their lives anymore  
and again studying history isn't is is an antidote 
against overconfident conclusions there because  
many things that we worry about today we used to 
worry about in the past as well and often much  
more much more in general if you say it used to it 
used to be worse you're correct right so that's uh  
gives you some reason to put things in perspective 
there's there's one thing that has changed that  
has become worse maybe that's that we live in our 
smaller echo chambers right oh i don't agree at  
all i mean in in the netherlands in the 1950s in 
this especially in the 1950s we had the so-called  
polarization the virgiling of society and you 
know the bubbles were much more extreme back then  
people were either protestant or catholic or 
socialist or a liberal and you know that you were  
completely separate societies if you if you 
bred goats you wouldn't go to as a catholic  
you wouldn't go to the to the protestant goat uh 
breeding society right but you would have your own  
society to do that so you would for instance 
all consume the same news right so no no you  
had a catholic newspaper you had a socialist 
newspaper at the end of the day you had the  
eight o'clock news and maybe what we'll tell you 
it didn't exist back then let's say in the 60s 70s  
or just in the generations just before ours 
yeah and now we we see you know people that  
consume completely different 
news as well yeah i think it's a  
that's more the case for the u.s i 
think it's much this phenomenon is lost  
much less pronounced in europe so for example 
a couple of years ago there was a study done by
a government think tank we don't even have 
really have ideological think tanks but just  
sort of the government think take this the social 
and cultural planning bureau about the effects of  
asylum centers on the local crime rate and so 
all the dutch media were writing about the report  
the you know the telegraph which is a right-wing 
newspaper and also the correspondent where i write  
for it which is much more left-wing progressive um 
and obviously they drew different conclusions from  
that same report you know i wrote a piece about it 
and said see this is what i've always been saying  
there's no impact on crime you know don't have to 
worry about that at all let all the refugees come  
etc and then the right-wing journalists were 
obviously saying well we read the report and  
see this is a huge problem crime has gone up and 
therefore closed the borders and a lot of people  
were concluding that oh such a problem that we 
can't even agree on the facts but i saw it very  
differently i mean we were reading the same report 
you know and then we could have a debate about  
those facts in in in the us for example everyone 
has its own report and its own think tank and its  
own scientists so um yes i'm a little bit wary 
of importing all these anxieties from the uk and  
the us and automatically assuming that the same 
thing is happening in in other countries because i  
think that very often that's not the case i mean 
what we have imported from them is algorithms  
the biggest social media companies are american 
right yes we use here as well and so it can  
happen that you live your entire social media 
life and you think oh everybody's like me  
everybody agrees with me on this issue yes and 
there's hardly anyone who thinks differently maybe  
those couple of people but that's always 
been the case and i think that actually  
we're we're more open to diverse viewpoints 
than probably we were in many other  
points in our history this is one of the ironies 
of history is that the moment when people start  
worrying about something it's also the moment 
when things are actually already improving  
so i mean i've said quite some things about 
tax evasion and sex avoidance and certain  
billionaires and how hypocritical they are and 
some people have assumed that therefore i'm very  
pessimistic about the fight against tax evasion 
and tax avoidance but the opposite is true i'm  
extremely optimistic there's been an enormous 
amount of progress in the last 10 years if you  
take for example bank secrecy in switzerland well 
it's pretty much been destroyed by the american  
government if you take what the oecd you know 
the organization of rich countries has been doing  
it's actually also the status of the 
netherlands which is still a major tax paradise  
but you know we we are receiving a lot 
of or we're under a lot of pressure now  
to to make significant changes and i've already 
made some um ten years ago that wasn't the case  
at all because no one was talking about it and the 
biggest injustices are happening in silence when  
no one's talking about it so i can imagine some 
period in the future where we'll all be worried  
about animal suffering you know and that will 
be the main outrage and people will be like well  
it's worse than it's ever been but then 
it's actually already improving because  
we're finally angry about it and because there's 
finally a large effective movement right i think  
uh we have one more we have time for one more 
question um maybe the girl sitting there already  
somebody coming yeah i can hold 
it myself i feel more confident  
thanks yeah so nice to see you here i got 
your book as a gift and yeah it's like an  
example of someone being kind to me and it really 
inspires me to dig some history in my home city  
i'm from chongqing where it was bombed by japan 
during the uh world war ii so i also saw some  
photos and uh which resonates uh with this book 
and my question may be like less at the level of  
the like uh like the larger scale but 
more like down to like daily life and  
interpersonal relationships because i remember 
in this book there is a chapter called um  
have a cup of tea or drink with a terrorist 
so this really makes me think of like  
so you're promoting certain values here which are 
very extremely difficult or challenging to achieve  
being kind to the person who may hurt you the most 
or who you may hate um and while in that situation  
you still need to love them or to have like a sort 
of conversation to learn something from them so in  
that case i would like to know like um then what 
what how could i extend that example to something  
more simple not to have a conversation with a 
terrorist but to have a conversation maybe with  
someone you don't talk to so often anymore like 
your ex who may be a jerk to you in the past or um  
or like someone who laughed at you at school at 
school who bullied you um yeah like those kind of  
situations yeah i wonder if you have any uh ideas 
yeah well maybe we can even take it a step further  
i've been thinking a lot about what my next book 
should be about and a lot of people have said that  
to me that reading humankind has been like a warm 
hug right sort of restores your faith in humanity  
and which which is really nice 
when you're being bombarded by  
you know a lot of news that makes you extremely 
pessimistic um so maybe the next book should be  
an antidote against humankind and of should not 
be a warm hog but more like a how do you say that  
kicking the balls a cold shower something like 
that something very painful and uncomfortable um  
because the question is how difficult 
do we want to make it for ourselves  
um there are thousands and thousands of 
self-help books that will teach you how to live  
an easier life how to get rich quick how to make 
friends how to be successful how to be popular  
blah blah blah blah blah and some of those books 
are great and most of them are worthless um but  
there are very few self-help books out there that 
will teach you how to live a more difficult life  
right that will sort of that you almost wish 
you didn't read it because now you have to  
actually do it and now you know all these 
things and so you you gotta try harder um  
so maybe this is one of those things uh it is 
indeed incredibly difficult sometimes to see  
the good and people who are so far away from you 
or or who have committed horrible things i mean  
believing that your friends or people in this room 
are relatively decent you know that's pretty easy  
but now let's talk about criminals who've done 
absolutely horrific things then it becomes much  
more difficult um i there was a documentary made 
about parents who lost a child in the breivik  
massacre you know in norway when was it 2011 2011. 
um and um there was one extraordinarily powerful  
moment when the father was asked you know don't 
you don't you want to kill him don't you want  
you surely you want the death 
penalty for breivik and you could see  
um the difficulty he had in answering that 
question but he said look um i don't wanna sing  
to that level um i i want to stand above that and 
no i don't feel any need for vengeance whatsoever  
but it was very difficult for him to say that and 
i thought that was an extraordinarily powerful  
moment um it no it's not easy in a way it goes 
against human nature itself to recognize the  
good or at least the fundamental human decency 
or at least the worthiness of people who've  
done terrible things or so different from your 
own but maybe that's what we got to try and do  
so i guess there's another book in the works 
um and so yeah as we're drawing to a close here  
this was the second time you joined us here on our 
stage at room for discussion you know what they  
say third time's a charm right so um let's let's 
imagine you're invited back here okay and it's one  
generation down the line we're in the year 2050 
now you sit there and there will be a student here  
and you're a grandpa maybe you have a big white 
beard and the student who sits here will ask you  
two questions the first question will be now that 
we're here in 2050 what are the biggest challenges  
we as humankind are currently facing what are 
the things that really keep us up at night
that's a good question um because my answer will 
probably be completely false that's that's so  
that's so interesting that's okay right that if 
you learn any one thing about history is that  
all these predictions are um well obviously a 
lot depends on how effectively we respond to  
the climate crisis a lot depends on that um would 
be at zero that's zero 2050 that's the goal right  
yeah hopefully but i think people still radically 
underestimate just how difficult that is  
i mean a lot of people are saying now 
let's cut off from russian gas well  
we're so so dependent uh still on gas and it's 
renewables are not going to cut it anytime soon  
um we give still such an extremely fossil fuel 
driven society in almost every single way you  
know how we the the the sort of the pillars of 
modern society and plastic ammonia steel cement  
you know you all need fossil fuels for it um so 
uh i i i'm one of those progressives who still  
feels that people underestimate the challenge even 
people on my side of the political spectrum and  
look one of the biggest tensions i think in 
my political thinking today that i cannot  
really resolve is on the one hand um my 
enthusiasm for participatory democracy  
from moving towards a genuine democracy without 
career politicians but where basically everyone  
gets to have a say and almost everyone has the 
opportunity to become some form of politician  
during his or her lifetime but then on the other 
hand the need for speed right there's a famous  
saying from oscar wilde who said the whole problem 
with socialism is that it takes too many evenings  
i think you can see see that clearly with 
for example the energy transition today  
in the netherlands where yes you know on a 
general level we're all like yes let's move to  
zero emissions in 2050 but then when it becomes a 
local issue and you you know you get a windmill in  
your backyard then suddenly you know it becomes 
an outrageous injustice and you start fighting  
strongly against it we and halton are very good 
at that by the way um but it's it's happening  
everywhere it's not in my backyard phenomenal um 
so i i cannot fully resolve those let's let's go  
to the second question that the students sitting 
here i haven't given you answering anything  
but that's that's okay i mean uh yeah 
climate change will still be an issue  
i don't know i i just don't know i have no clue 
whatsoever and i don't think that's even my  
job to do any predictions okay let's do another 
prediction even though it's not your job yeah um  
so you look back from then 2015. you look back 
to that ancient history year 2022 yeah yeah  
yeah back over that generation those 30 years 
what achievements will humankind be most proud  
well that question in itself 
assumes that there will be progress  
and that there will be moral progress 
scientific progress technological progress  
i'm fairly confident about you know technological 
and scientific progress i'm not confident about  
moral progress uh you know we've we've maybe 
become adjusted to the idea that things always  
get better that for example the number of 
democracies in the world goes up that poverty goes  
down etc and that even though there's still a lot 
to do the general trend of history is good or you  
know the martin luther king quote the the the bend 
of the what is it moral universe it bends towards  
justice but i think that's a really it's a fallacy 
there's there's there's no such thing as the will  
of history history doesn't judge anyone history is 
just history it's just a bunch of facts it's just  
one damn thing happening after another as they say 
it's people that that make progress right and um  
there's nothing in avid about that yes 
hopefully we'll look back in 2050 or 2100 on the  
extraordinary accomplishments you know that we've 
stopped factory farming that we've eradicated  
poverty that we've done so many other awesome 
things but there's nothing nothing inevitable  
about about it if there's one main thing that i 
try to convey in all of my books it's it is that  
nothing is enabled about the way our society is 
structured today and we can all change that but  
it doesn't happen automatically it just starts 
with with this margaret me talked about it  
small groups of thoughtful committed citizens who 
wake up and realize well if not me then who else  
why not let's try and do something yep your book 
is subtitled and this will be my last question  
a hopeful history so you seem to be a man of 
hope yes yes are you hopeful let's say for that  
i'm always hopeful and there's an important 
distinction between hope and optimism right  
optimism is almost like a form of determinism 
where you feel like oh things will turn out to  
be all right right optimism is i think a form 
of complacency um or a way of ignoring also  
injustices this would be one of my criticisms of 
you know these the work of the big optimists today  
maybe someone like stephen pinker is 
that yes you can you can talk a lot about  
you know the decline in poverty etc but we 
still have an enormous responsibility to do  
to do much more than we do today and 
that's what hope is all about hope  
recognizes the possibility of change the 
possibility that we can do things differently  
but there's nothing inevitable about it i think 
on that note we can thank you for joining us today  
and i would like to ask you uh in the name 
of martina who can't be here she would have  
sat here asked half the questions i have a pen
