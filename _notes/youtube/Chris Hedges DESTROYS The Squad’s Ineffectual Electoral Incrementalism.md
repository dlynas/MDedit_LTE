Chris Hedges DESTROYS The Squadâ€™s Ineffectual Electoral Incrementalism
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt6Ioi2OXV0)

## Transcript:
uh the other day when i was just
chilling in my living room i was
watching this
uh lecture series i guess uh and it was
a conversation between cornell west and
chris hedges that the new school put on
and i think i've listened to it a while
ago but i put it on again because it was
about regarding chris hensch's book
wages of rebellion
uh which everybody should check out our
book club series that's available the
first uh two episodes are out now
uh but i was listening to the
conversation and this is from a
conversation i believe in 2016. it was
during the
presidential uh election cycle of 2016.
uh there's a joke in there about hillary
clinton i believe but
uh during this um conversation i uh
chris hedges shows his tremendous
prescience uh
and and the reason why he you know
didn't campaign for bernie sanders and
the reason he hasn't you know gotten
enthusiastically
behind the squad and that's because in
this clip he utterly destroys
and debunks their uh theory of change to
uh you know it just reduces it to rubble
and and i just thought it was really
powerful that this came before any of it
any of this happened he was able to see
uh exactly what was going to go down
and predict it and you know he gives uh
not only a diet a section of
uh what has occurred but a solution to
how we should move forward so anyway
see so you talk about black lives matter
uh the anti-fracking movement
uh the struggle to raise uh minimum
that's
where hope comes from um it's not gonna
come from
the political vaudeville of elections um
as emma goldman said if elections were
that effective they'd be illegal
um it's going to it's got
going to come as it always comes from
the bottom up we forget that that's
zinn's great contribution
howard howard in the people's history
united states he understood
the system was designed to shut us out
slave holding white aristocratic
oligarchs who openly
embraced genocide against native
americans on behalf of
land speculators timber merchants
railroad companies
gold mining concerns uh
who shut out women uh
nate americans african-americans men
without property
created a senate where everybody was
appointed created the electoral college
because they were terrified of popular
democracy that's how gore
wins half a million more votes than
george w bush and george w bush is
president it had nothing to do with
nader by the way
and uh and gore's refusal to fight and
his refusal to fight
and so is zinn's in that the beauty of
that book
is that all of the openings in american
democracy were created by movements that
often paid
for it in blood we had the bloodiest
labor wars of any industrialized world
hundreds of american workers
were murdered thousands tens of
thousands were blacklisted
uh and uh the liberty party
the abolitionists uh the suffragists
none of these movements achieved power
but they created pressure on the centers
of power
so that power had to respond and that
gets to karl popper
who in the first volume of the open
society its enemies says
the question is not how do you get good
people to rule that's the wrong question
the question is how do you make the
power elite frightened of you
most people attracted to power
proper rights are at best mediocre or
vino
and that's what we've forgotten that it
those of us who hold fast and just it's
not our job to
take power it's our job to make
power frightened of us that's what
created the new deal
and roosevelt's quite open about it in
his letters roosevelt says
he even says in a 1930 letter if we
don't
uh create social reforms we're going to
have a revolution he says to his fellow
oligarchs
you better give up some of your money
now
or you might lose all your money and
that's how we got 15 million jobs the
public works program social security
even those are concessions
they were all concessions and roosevelt
says significant concession but he says
his greatest achievement was that he
saved capitalism
and we have to recover those movements
and i see that
in black lives matter in the
anti-fracking movement and all of these
groups are not getting any kind of media
coverage i just
and the bds movement we are going to
bring down israeli apartheid
college by college church by church
institution
by institution that's how it's going to
come

but yeah i think that that right there
what he says is that we need to
focus on making those in power afraid of
us it's not about getting the right
people
in power that is that is a fool's errand
right those people will be corrupted by
the waters of
the swamp waters that they steep in like
we say constantly on this show
what we need to do is make the powerful
afraid that's how we got
the new deal that's how we'll get the
green new deal that's how we'll get
you know justice for black lives
defunding the police that's how we'll
get medicare for all that's how we'll
get you know bds that's how we'll get
all of these things it is not through
electoral pressure
it is through bodies in the streets and
mass movements such a great impression
clip especially given the conversation
we've had
as a left movement over the last couple
years or so
um debating the squad's effectiveness
for example or the effectiveness of
these
progressives or so-called socialist
lawmakers in dc
i've long said that i i you know i think
that if
these people were going to really be
useful the one way they really could be
useful
was as organizers you know bernie
sanders always talked about he how he
wanted to be the organizer in chief
uh were he to get in the white house and
that was always one of my favorite
things he said i really
thought that was powerful and there's no
reason why the squad members couldn't
also be
organizers in chief with their
respective power you know
popularity twitter followings that
they've you know
all but squandered essentially at this
point so you know if they're not gonna
do that
then chris is absolutely right what the
is the point you know what is the
good in doing this there really is not
it's kind of a wasted effort
um so you know if they're not going to
act like that if they're not going to
organize protests and call out the
powerful
you know really speak truth to power and
their own leadership they could
absolutely use their position to
organize like that
but they don't and there's nothing wrong
with doing some electoral politics i
think that
especially on a local level things like
city council i think we absolutely
cannot abandon electoral politics
um but i also think that there's a lot
of truth in what chris is saying that
um we need to build a real movement
that's capable
of shocking the government capable of
really scaring them it reminds me of
that
v for vendetta quote um the government
should be afraid of the people the
people should not be afraid of the
government
and you know maybe that's a little bit
cheesy but i think it's damn true
yeah absolutely and i think that you
know uh you know
gavin and i are prone to coming down
pretty hard on the squad because i think
that we all put a lot of stock
in the squad we all put a lot of
resources energy belief
heart soul whatever the you want to
call it uh a lot of people were really
invested in that esp
from from 2016 into uh you know 2020
and to see the level of capitulation to
see that there was no organized efforts
there was
you know to hear them say like oh we all
vote alone
okay then why are you calling yourself
the squad you have done nothing
to organize
you've done nothing to uh uh cement any
kind of power you've created no unity
you've gone there and done the exact
opposite of what
you told us you were going to do uh and
people will sim for them and be like oh
well all politicians lie well not
they told us that they were going to go
in there and be authentic true moral
actors
and if they're going to lie to
us then clearly that's not what they're
doing
and and i think at this point you know
all the dollars and cents that we're
spending on these congressional
races uh a lot oftentimes for people who
aren't even in our district
uh i think it's for the birds i think
it's a waste of time and i think
all of it would be better served as
uh community action because when you're
talking to people about community
actions when you're talking to people
about their on the ground needs
when you're talking to people about how
yeah it's up that there's mice
and cockroaches and mold
in their apartment and how they
yeah it's it's a damn crime
that this place is still getting tax
abatements and hud money and all this
kinds of
doing that kind of work that those
people know who the to vote for
those people know because you're making
real human uh relationships with them
you are talking about actual political
issues uh
all of that kind of you don't even
need to go
door knocking at that point you're
building real and i'm not
knocking door knocking i i guess you can
do it if you really dedicated to
it you think
you have the uh you know uh
white knight that's gonna solve american
politics go for it i'm just saying i'm
done with that
yeah i totally feel you and i think that
the biggest problem with the squads
approach
is they seemingly don't understand that
the government does have to be afraid of
the people that the democratic party
should be afraid of its electorate
and the squad seemingly has no idea
of how to kind of harness that against
the establishment
they just want to join the establishment
they just want to be friends with these
people they want to be amicable and try
to get things done behind the scenes
uh you know everyone's singing kumbaya
that's never going to be effective
uh you know as chris hedges said the new
deal wasn't passed by some
you know behind the scenes maneuvering
it was passed because there was a
movement of goddamn people that were
going to revolt
if it didn't get passed
