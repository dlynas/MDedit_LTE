## Transcript:
hello everyone inhuman form here i've
got a special announcement that relates
to this video at the very end so stick
around for that and remember to like
this video
on november 3rd 1986 after an
information leak in iran a little-known
lebanese newspaper received an
interesting piece of information that
would shock the entire world
the leak claimed that the united states
had engaged in a secret arms deal with
iran in an effort to free american
hostages being held captive in lebanon
these allegations were serious because
the united states was barred from
dealing weapons to iran due to an
international arms embargo
the magazine immediately published an
article releasing the information to the
public and 10 days later president
ronald reagan would have to address the
nation from the oval office about the
growing scandal that faced him and his
administration
a scandal that would become known as the
iran contra affair

as will rogers once said rumor travels
faster but it don't stay put as long as
truth so let's get to the facts
the iran-contra scandal had two
dimensions in two areas that seemingly
had no connection
one in nicaragua
one in the middle east
during the 1980s lebanon was ravaged by
a brutal civil war between factions who
were vying for control over the country
during this time the kidnapping of ford
nationals was common especially with
hezbollah an iranian-sponsored islamist
organization
which caused the u.s to engage in an
arms embargo against iran called
operation staunch
meanwhile iran was waging its own bloody
eight-year war against iraq a beneficial
ally of the united states at the time
but they urgently needed modern
equipment to continue the fight
the soviet union had just made a massive
arms deal with iraq and was pouring
large quantities of the most modern
equipment into iraq
it already had an arms arrangement with
syria
in some way
these forces had to be counterbalanced
despite the embargo
iran made a secret request to purchase
weapons from the united states
national security adviser robert
mcfarlane sought reagan's approval of
the illegal sale of anti-tank and
anti-aircraft missiles to iran claiming
that the sale would not only bolster the
united states influence on iran but
might improve relations with lebanon
increasing the united states presence
within the middle east

but reagan was under the spell of an
obsession that was too powerful to
resist
he had become fixated on his failure to
secure the release of seven american
hostages that were being held in lebanon
by hezbollah
reagan often met with families of the
american hostages who were kidnapped but
publicly refused to bargain with
terrorists or to aid iran in its war
against iraq the united states gives
terrorists no rewards and no guarantees
we make no concessions we make no deals
but when the opportunity to release the
hostages had come to light he began to
convince himself that he was not
negotiating with terrorists
u.s secretary of defense kaspar
weinberger wrote in his notes that
president reagan said he could answer to
charges of lawlessness but he couldn't
answer to charges that big strong
president reagan passed up a chance to
free american hostages
13 days after reagan denounced
negotiations with iran macfarlane
visited him in the hospital while the
president was recovering from surgery to
remove a cancerous growth in his colon
reagan had endured a deal of
psychological trauma from this
life-threatening cancer which many claim
along with the anesthesia from surgery
could have impaired his judgment during
the meeting

nevertheless mcfarland continued
outlining their recently planned arms
for hostages deal with iran
iran would receive anti-tank missiles
through israel in exchange for an
undetermined number of american hostages
and renewed communications with iran
to this day no one is exactly sure of
what took place and what was agreed upon
during this meeting
but in a complex series of events and a
number of private loans the illegal sale
of arms to iran through israel began
less than a month later
mcfarland brought on a key figure into
this operation
lieutenant colonel oliver north who was
tasked with managing the logistics in
the interests of the united states in
the highly secretive arms deal
oliver north would play a major role in
what would soon take place
for many years even before his
presidency
reagan had a deep-seated hatred for
communism and anything related to the
soviet union
it had become an obsession for him and
that was made very clear by his foreign
policy decisions
reagan had vowed to wipe out communism
and put an end to the cold war
and he would do this by any means
necessary
far from iran on the other side of the
world the reagan administration with the
help of the cia were involved in covert
actions against the leftist sandinista
regime in nicaragua
one of the biggest questions that arises
when covering the iran-contra scandal is
why the united states were so concerned
with a tiny country that in no way pose
a threat to their safety
in 1979 nicaraguan leftists the
sandinistas overthrew a long-time u.s
ally the ruling samosa family and formed
their own government which created some
of the most effective social reforms in
the hemisphere at the time
that were praised by organizations like
the world bank and oxfam as an
outstanding example of participatory
democracy
despite the country's lack of abundance
and resources reforms in the early 80s
provided a steadily increasing quality
of life for its people
the award-winning nicaraguan literacy
campaign introduced in 1980 dropped
public illiteracy in nicaragua almost
entirely reducing it from 50.3 percent
to 12.9 percent
the sandinistas were also able to
provide nicaragua with a national health
care system that reached the majority of
its citizens reducing mortality by
approximately half despite an ongoing
war
this posed a unique threat to the reagan
administration
the threat of a good example
if a poorer and weaker country could
provide a better life for its population
than a country with more money and more
resources
people would start asking questions
when people start asking questions it's
not good for business
on the reports of what went on in
cambodia can you give an example yes
your article
in his book what uncle sam really wants
world-renowned scholar and leading
critic of u.s foreign policy noam
chomsky states
as far as american business is concerned
nicaragua could disappear and nobody
would notice
if you want a global system that's
subordinated to the needs of u.s
investors you can't let pieces of it
wander off
in addition to this reality their
involvement with the soviet union in
cuba and their support for socialist
reforms sounded alarms for reagan to
take action against the sandinistas
he saw them as a communist puppet state
under the control of the soviet union
in a classic example of unchecked abuse
of presidential power
the reagan administration and the cia
began funding the contras a disparate
group of counter-revolutionaries who
opposed the sandinistas
but much like the arms embargo against
iran congress had prohibited the funding
of the contras with the boland amendment
a series of acts that were passed as a
means of preventing reagan's aggressive
attempts at interfering with the state
affairs of nicaragua
the reagan administration went as far as
the use of propaganda to influence
public and congressional opinion prior
to the decision of whether or not the
u.s should be funding the contras but
the attempt failed
but by the time congress had passed the
bolan amendment the reagan
administration had already committed
itself to fully supporting the contras
unconditionally at any cost
mr president why don't we openly support
those 7 000 guerrillas that are in
rebellion against it rather than giving
aid to uh culvert activity
why because we want to keep on obeying
the laws of our country which we are
obeying
doesn't the united states want that
government replaced no because that
would be violating the law but mr
president what is the american public to
think
you're having an action a good example
of totalitarianism that is to ensure
that you that the first one has stopped
your monopoly on misinformation
the idea that i have a monopoly of
misinformation the american press is a
little ridiculous let me rebu really i
control the american press uh the uh let
me repeat the let's go back to the facts
now if we had the slightest concern with
democracy which we do not in our foreign
affairs and never have we would turn to
countries where we have influence like
el salvador now in el salvador they
don't call the
archbishop bad names what they do is
murder him they do not
repres they do not censor the press they
wiped the press out they sent the army
in to blow up the church radio station
the editor of the independent news favor
was found in a ditch mutilated and cut
the pieces with machetes may i continue
i did not end up don't you ever want to
put any time on anything you say
covert defiance had now become the
executive branch's modus operandi
they began supplying the contras with
arms equipment and money putting faith
in the belief that illegal covert
activities would put an end to the
regime
a strategy that had proven time and
again to only raise tensions in body
count much like vietnam during the 60s
and the 70s if in fact they have been
trying to circumvent the will of
congress
and provide aid notwithstanding that
that seems to me to be a very serious
infraction it's a it's a constitutional
violation it's an infringement
on the stated law of this country if you
will
while the reagan administration and
fellow conservatives celebrated them the
contras were routinely condemned by
human rights groups for indiscriminately
killing civilians
washington would send money and
equipment and the cia would coordinate
training programs deliver intelligence
and provide target lists for the contras
who were made up of national guardsmen
ex-sandinista soldiers and farmers who
oppose the new sandinista regime
they proved to be an extremely violent
group murdering civilians and sandinista
officials as well as nurses doctors and
judges in a brutal manner
a manual provided by the cia instructed
the contrast to incite shame ridicule
and humiliate the sandinista officials
to reduce their influence
and incite mob violence in health
clinics schools and other public areas
the war crimes of the contras were some
of the worst in united states history
and were noted by multiple human rights
groups
after congress prohibited reagan from
providing the contracts with federal
funding through the boland amendment the
americans sought out alternative ways to
fund the contras by raising money
through foreign allies and private
funding
when private funding in third party
governments did not provide as much
support as oliver north wanted for the
contras
he came upon the idea of overcharging
the iranians for the weapons that they
sold them and using the surplus to fund
the contras
north wrote a memo to reagan stating
that 12 million of the profit made from
the illegal arms deal with iran would
quote be used to purchase critically
needed supplies for the nicaraguan
democratic resistance forces
this controversial scheme would once
again reveal the machiavellian nature of
reagan and his cronies
three months later reagan was forced to
admit that his administration
had in fact sold weapons to free the
hostages
he claimed that he did not personally
allow any of these things but he had to
take full responsibility as president
investigations and allegations ensued
oliver north appeared before congress to
testify his role in the scandal in a
dramatized display of political theater
he likened the iran-contra hearings to a
baseball game in which congress was both
a player and a referee
i did do it i am not as i said in my
statement at all ashamed of any of the
things that i did i was given a mission
and i tried to carry it out but part of
that mission
was to shield
the others who are giving you the orders
that is the part of any subordinate
i never called myself a hero those words
were used by other people to describe me
i am grateful for those words but i've
never called myself
colonel
five and a half years in the white house
hasn't destroyed those values not at all
nor has this investigation destroyed
those values not in the least
north claimed that his superiors
approved his actions and reagan had
personally approved the diversion of
profit from the iran arms sales to the
contras
in a paranoid fashion he believed his
actions were justified by his and the
administration's desire to eradicate
their greatest fear
the looming specter of communism
a fear that had already been the
justification for multiple wars
a jury found north guilty of obstruction
of congressional inquiries destroying
nsc documents and receiving illegal
gratuity
north received two years probation 150
000 in fines and 1200 hours community
service for his war crimes but was
eventually pardoned by george bush
senior
other members of the reagan
administration similarly avoided
punishment
john poindexter north superior was
convicted on several charges but his
conviction was overturned due to his
immunized testimony secretary of defense
weinberger had been accused of perjury
and obstruction of justice but also
received a pardon from george bush
reagan's popularity was temporarily
affected but his raiding recovered after
he left office due to a post-presidency
propaganda campaign that has
successfully altered the public's
perception of him and has deified him as
a champion of conservatism among the
american right wing
prosecutors and congressional bodies
have spent years researching the facts
but much of the evidence has been
destroyed
in the end only one participant former
cia agent thomas kleins served time in
prison the others were all acquitted or
pardoned by george bush for technical
reasons
in many ways we still live with the
consequences of iran contra
it is an interesting event to examine
with the aim of getting a better look
inside the corridors of power and to
better understand the psychology behind
political corruption
thanks for watching remember to hit
