well the issue of insularity
i think is a really good jumping off
point because um
i think the discourse that many people
who
identify as leftists attach themselves
to
actually is counterproductive in
building
solidarity and thus you know buttresses
a certain kind of
insularity i mean i when i think about
this question
that andrew posed um i think about
i don't know again the kind of
terminology that people attach
themselves to the concepts
that people are left to attach
themselves to and i i think if we
want to have in keeping with harvey's
point that any
you know real left politics requires
some focus
maybe a central focus on labor i would
be a happy man if i could go the rest of
my life
without ever hearing the phrase slavery
was our original
sin or racism as our original sin and
and you know that's assuming i live
another 40 years
right i don't want to die five minutes
from now and never hear that phrase
again that
that would not make me happy but if i
live another 40 years
if i were to live another 40 40 years
without hearing that phrase again i'd
be a happy man i would you know be
pretty happy to not hear white
privilege again um i would be pretty
happy of structural
racism we're retired as well and there's
a longer list
than that but i'll just the center on
those three
and what bothers me about those three in
the ubiquity
of them is i think you know everyone
who uses those those frameworks has the
best of intentions
i don't think there's any doubt about
that and i think everyone who uses those
those three
frameworks and others i would like to
retire uh imagines
themselves being committed to living a
better world but
the problem with each of them
is that they're counter-soliduristic and
in at least one case i don't know
they're kind of racist um and the one
that i'm thinking
that's kind of racist but i you know i'd
make the case
that it might not be just one of those
three
um would be slavery is the original sin
right a racism is our original sin and
one of the reasons that that one bothers
me so much
is that i went to catholic school for
eight years and while it made me
agnostic like it was supposed to
i mean i think that's what my dad would
attest to so
mission accomplished there thank you
very much i remember
a lot about my religious
um training in catholic school because i
wasn't really that
interested to be honest but
i know what original sin is right and
an original sin you're stuck with
forever um
and and of course then that framework
say racism is our original saying
well i mean that's that's actually
racist
in so far is it rejects the
idea but by its very nature that
race is a social construct and racism is
you know
an expression of one's attachments to
ideologies and
and the ideology of race right
um and instead treats racism and race as
if they're ontological forces that can
never really
be exercised and i think that does
all of us disservice but frankly as a
black person
i think it does black people a
disservice there's no way to win
uh from that one and of course it's
i think a cousin of of ideological
frameworks that conservatives embrace
uh even as i know the people who attach
themselves to
racism is the nation's original center
whatever understand themselves to not be
conservative
i i think that it is a profoundly
conservative framework because it
imputes the qualities
of it imputes qualities to race that a
social construct can't have
uh it treats it as natural white
privilege
i think kind of ends up you know
falling into much the same trap uh it
equates whiteness with privilege
and by extension blackness with
uh disadvantage and of course one of the
things that that does
is it encourages um people to imagine
well-meaning people that all black
people have the same interests that
black
people are necessarily progressive uh
let's say
because we we're all disadvantaged and
what i like to fall back on
is that that was it some of you might
know the date um
it's 2013 or 2014. there's a major
controversy where
oprah was still in switzerland or
someplace was trying to buy a 38
thousand dollar handbag
in at some point in obama's second term
and it was one of those fancy stores
uh that that the clerk has to size you
up before they buzz you in and the clerk
sized up oprah didn't recognize oprah
just saw a black woman didn't let oprah
in the store and this was an outrageous
expression of racism
and it was certainly an outrageous it
was certainly an expression of racism
but at the time one of the things that i
was really dismayed
um by with this exchange because this
became evidence
that racism is with is still with us
like i didn't know that
was that the average median income
or the median household income for a
black family of four
at the time i think was just a few
thousand dollars more than oprah's
handbag
i think it was like you know forty one
forty two thousand dollars
a year compared with third with oprah's
38 000
handbag and to be honest the first
thought that i had when i saw this was
not
what an outrage it was that oprah
couldn't buy this
handbag because this person was racist i
mean that sucks
but i'm familiar with how oprah made her
money in the 80s and 90s
and she did sell herself in that period
as the black person that white people
could confide in
right the black person wasn't really the
black person
wrong apparently since you couldn't get
that handbag
but i already knew that i already knew
that right i knew that was coming
um but i thought to myself
that what's outrageous is that somebody
has so much money
that they can spend 38 thousand dollars
on a handbag
that's the first thing that i thought
was outrageous and the second thing i
thought was outrageous is
that i'm supposed to give a damn right
that oprah couldn't buy a 38
000 handbag i didn't care i just didn't
care
the last thing you know on my short list
but i
this is my abridged list of course
structural racism
uh again i know this is another one that
people who attach themselves to
uh you know make clear that they want to
live in a more just society but
the funny thing about it is just like
like racism
is the nation's original sin i think
structural racism
has the tendency to uncouple racial
inequality
from the political economic forces that
generated i know people are going to
hear this as class reductions
but i want to remind them if you do i
just said
that in my reflections on oprah i never
bought
for a minute that oprah class you know
wealth her way out of blackness
right i also alluded to the fact that in
the 80s and 90s when i was
a teen and in my my early 20s when oprah
was a different kind of talk show host
um i found
oprah's persona as the black person
who made white people feel comfortable
who wasn't really black noxious and
offensive
and i still find it offensive and i
found i found that offensive about
obama's post-racialism
too so i'm not someone who denies the
existence
of racism racism real uh and i've had my
own personal experiences with it as well
as witnessing
people's experiences with it but um to
acknowledge that racism isn't real
or to acknowledge that racism is real
right even if race isn't
uh to acknowledge that racism is real
isn't to uncouple
is not to uncouple it from the world of
human contrivance
and i think structural racism as a
construct tends to do that just to
amplify this point people have been
talking about structural racism for a
long time i mean the phrase itself
is i think probably new at least new to
most
but the moynihan report for what it's
worth
uh you know and and the johnson
administration's
approach to the war on poverty presumed
that something that we would call
structural racism
was responsible for a major contributor
to the racial disparities of the 1960s
right
so you know that's this is not new uh
even if the phrase is
new even as if the concept is new to
people
uh who didn't take history courses in
college
but um and you know it's not my fault if
you didn't take history courses in
college
a lot of the stuff that's recently been
discovered like redlining
let's say which people seem to imagine
that historians
have ignored you know until 2014 i
learned about when i was in college
you know in the 80s in the late 80s
early 90s right
frankly i learned about in high school
but my dad's a professor so that doesn't
count
but i absolutely learned about that
stuff in his three classes
and political science and sociology
classes as an undergraduate between the
late 80s and early 90s
but again just because it's new to you
doesn't mean that it's new
and the problem is that with this
particular
notion of inequality which one more time
uncouples
from place uh and time
but also racial inequality more
specifically from the
material world that we occupy is that it
just hasn't
lent itself to solutions uh and
in fact i think if you if one were to
reflect on
let's say put them all together
structural racism
white privilege and um slavery racism as
our nation's original sin
and just reflect on the summer
that was our great awokening and how
little material change
took place then or now
right but how much symbolic change took
place
then you can get a sense of what irks me
about these frameworks because they're
frameworks that lend themselves to
bringing down monuments which should you
know
people committed high treason in defense
of the undemocratic institution of
slavery should
never have had monuments to them but
again you lend themselves to bring down
monuments it
lends itself to taking out jemima off
the box
right and lends themselves to rich
people donating
you know billions of dollars to
social justice as rich people define it
you know i think that's called charity
though it doesn't lend itself to the
kind of
oh and it lends itself to discourse that
creates more openings for black and
brown ceos
uh and entrepreneurs but what it doesn't
do
is lend itself to uplifting those people
who are at the bottom
right it doesn't lend itself this
discourse does not lend itself
to doing right by the people that
michael brooks was interested
in uh just to bring this full circle but
doing right
by working class people poor people and
even
more and more people who identify as
middle class are obviously struggling
and that's who i think left this to
bring us back to harvey's point
about the centrality of labor that's
what left us need to be concerned about
