## Transcript:
keep thinking about this cosmopolitan
socialist idea which i wrote about
and against the web what's interesting
in that
was i i think that that model
is definitely the one we need i really
do think that it's the answer
to the reactionary forces
that defend various historically
contingent hierarchies
i think it's an answer a dynamic answer
to the resurgence of things like
nationalism
which has obviously been very prevalent
right now there's a breakdown in the
global system and there's a breakdown of
world views
that is facilitating a lot of moves on
the right and it's also facilitating
some moves on the
actual left and some moves in the more
sort of
neoliberal discursive lane and
um and and all of the toxicities and
excesses that go along with things like
white fragility book and this type of
stuff
and all i was doing with this
cosmopolitan socialist idea
was really to just try to say there is
kind of a couple a couple of basic
blocks of how to look at the world
and one is that and it's funny because
you could they flip it either way the
traditional chauvinist bigoted
imperial settler colonialist way is to
say that there is a western tradition
west is best west has given us all of
the good things
and other cultures either have to catch
up or they can't
it's all some version of racism and
paternalism built out of imperial and
colonialist narratives
now there's this kind of countervailing
force actually which sort of
you know goes beyond the correct
historical
understanding of uh european imperialism
u.s hegemony
and all these structures arising from
capital and labor and race
uh to just saying like no actually like
the west is intrinsically evil
and all of this you know instead of it's
the best it's the worst
and the cosmopolitan model what it
really does
is it says oh and then the second model
is is really to say like
all cultures are distinct and different
and never
shall they really meet they're on
different trajectories what's
interesting is that there's right and
left versions
of all of these arguments or i should
say some people on the
i think ultimately either chauvinism or
essentialism of any culture
or complete um saying that there isn't
uh global and cosmopolitan overlap i
think those are all fundamentally
reactionary arguments but sometimes
you'll see them manifest
in different guises what the
cosmopolitanism argument says in a
really simple and basic way you could
see this from all of the greats
whether we're talking about you know a
martya san or cornell west is that
basically that like there is shared
human desires there is
shared universal traits most all human
beings really
want the same things there's a shared
global human experience
but then there's also a variety of
different contexts and ways of
discoursing about those experiences and
how to get there so human rights are
universal
uh which is a rejection of both the
nationalistic
and culturally particular views every
human being wants some sets of basic
protections
uh and economic abundance and speech and
assembly and so on
but then how that manifests looks very
different and there's
uh different traditions that have
discoursed on rights in different ways
there's a great book by martia sen
called the argumentative indian where he
talks about how
as an example the indian tradition has
multiple flowing
sources for arguments in favor of
democratic and open
and economically just societies and so i
think that this
cosmopolitanism with a ground in
materialist politics and marxist
analysis of the economic base
is where it is where the best way to go
about things we're in a global society
we're in a deeply interconnected one
we have to overcome all sorts of
legacies
of division abuse and depression but we
also have to create cohesion
integration and actually build models
for things that are better
and part of how we do that is by really
genuinely recognizing
the global interconnectedness of
everybody and really
deeply reading from and going in between
different traditions
and synthesizing them looking for
synthesis looking for points of
reference
i think amil car cabral has more to
teach
us about 2020 in the united states
than almost anybody who's writing about
2020 in the united states
so this is my perspective and the reason
i want to bring in
integral theory or some of the ideas
around something called meta-modernism
and i would check out
jeremy johnson and brent cooper and
michelle ballins with peer to peer
foundation
and this is like where you know it gets
trickier i've been kind of saying like
look i
you know spiritual for lack of a better
word
element to this to get to this
cosmopolitan
socialist vantage point and to really
develop
this sort of empathy the patience the
capacity and synthesis
and also complexity and nuance this is
not another moralistic story we have
competing
social media driven just
versions of mega stupidity right now
that preach pure
you know black or white binary
narratives that don't have
any room for human complexity
historical complexity and rigor you read
adolf reading class notes that's the
adolf reed reference he
really identified that the delusion and
moralism in the left that is only
accelerated with woke culture
this is a model that is about like what
does it actually mean to be truly global
to the extent we can local national and
international simultaneously east west
north south
but from a place of actual growth and
empathy and this is where again this
questions of consciousness come in the
questions of cultivating empathy
cultivating compassion cultivating
awareness the complete antithesis
of social media modes
long-term thinking compassion seeing
complexity
comfort with oneself solitude
the opposite of instant gratification
the attempt to constantly
humanize and not dehumanize your fellow
humans
these are all completely countervailing
forces
to the market technologic that subsumes
all of us today
integral theory which is something that
a lot of
you know it covers a lot of uh people
sri aurobindo was a great
indian integral theorist william irwin
thompson
was a fascinating public intellectual
the most well-known guy is probably a
guy named ken wilbur who i'll tell you
uh
in my opinion has some you know he's
when it comes to things like politics
policy history the guy this is not the
guy's i'll be
it's very diplomatic just not his strong
suit he's not
uh informed or up on that stuff then it
affects his analysis
but this model has
definitely created some brilliant maps
of integrating world views
which we really need to do
we need to have a much greater
understanding of both how
other people are seeing experiencing and
then enacting in the world
this is a necessity it's a necessity
with all of the extraordinary splits in
the united states and the kind of
serious analysis we need to figure out
even the different types of ruling class
right now in this society and it also is
going to be
very necessary as the united states
declines
relatively speaking that's one of the
things you know that shows up in the
china coverage on the show
of course we need to talk about the
crisis dealing uh you know and the
horrific repression of the eugers as an
example and i care
quite a bit about the tibetan uh
oppression as well but we also need to
understand literally the chinese
worldview
to the extent we can we need to
understand these things not in
and in a bipartisan way well beyond that
boring word in the united states not in
that
milktoa centrist we all just figured out
meet in some crappy middle but literally
that we need to humanize
as many as possible and then try to
create cohesion
to enact real systems change because
right now you see so much of these
velocity of serious social action in the
united states i mean
they still were we're still
hugely behind there isn't the
countervailing force of labor to capital
these uprisings are extraordinary where
are they going
in some good directions but also the new
boon and the
toxic horrifying grotesque hr
industry the diversity consulting scam
which is often just companies covering
their asses from discrimination lawsuits
they should face
with very little empirical basis in the
research and then of course a renewal
and another cycle of the horrifying
toxicity of online culture
so we need to get of humanization
understanding and synthesis and
ultimately my frame is that cosmopolitan
socialist frame that's what i was
excited about but the integral frame
what it does
is it has among other things a quadrant
model
which i think is fascinating i'll just
explain it to that this is the book
it's uh it's not a great i mean it's a
good book it's got some good theory it's
very dated in other ways but it's got
some
good outlines here it's called the
theory of everything by ken wilbur the
quadrants
map different views of the world
what you have on the right side is
objective systems and on the left side
subjective systems and then you have at
the base uh
social and at the top individual i could
be actually mixing those up
so in other words let's take it you know
really clearly
you're an individual you're dealing with
something like depression
which familiar with
there could be subjective and objective
components of it
maybe you're you know maybe there's
something happening with you
physiologically you address it that way
but then there's also deep questions of
your life and meaning
and how you feel and how you treat
others and how you're treated
and those are the subjective realms they
both matter social systems
there's objective systems there's
objective systems that this is the way
we
remove currency this is how technology
works this is how economy works
but then there's always cultural stories
that correlate with them
right this is again we go back
historically we look at the rise
of the taxonomy of european racism and
white supremacy
it correlates there's the expansion of
your of colonialism and imperialism
and then those cultures manifest
taxonomies of other human beings and
stories and narratives religious and
quote unquote scientific
to justify racism so those things
are working in the objective and
subjective realms
and inc and so what he does is he kind
of shows you that a lot of different
world views
they all can have validity but they're
usually coming from one of these
different viewpoints a lot of people
will say like okay the main source of
the action
is individual subjectivity right the
main source of the action is individual
objectivity the main source the action
is social materiality
or the main source of the action is a
cultural stories and myths and the
answer from wilbur and the answer
actually if you read gramsci in a
certain way is integral and then
it's all it's all of the above
and then we start to have this
perspective of wanting to have some
flexibility in how we look at things and
and and a deep tolerance like the
tolerance that someone like
pepe mojica talks about not a kind of
you know yeah well you just got to
tolerate everybody it's it's
it's deeper because like also ultimately
you do it's another
dynamic
tolerate everything you have battles in
politics but you
you you want to understand the engine of
different world views
and in that mix he's including
and matter of modernism in certain ways
points to this and certainly you know
jeremy johnson the contemplative work
and at its best some connection to a
spiritual
practice or any type of conscientious
cultivation of empathy
now we're all trying and we're all
failing that's the point that also
cultivates the self-compassion is going
to give us some of the capacity
to have some of the sort of flexibility
of mind and emotions
move in between world views pivot in
between them
and start to create some of that
synthesis
that sort of real range of empathy and
intellect
so i hope this made some sense guys i'm
using these things
to you know
formulate the stuff that i'm really
thinking about for like future books and
just stuff that i care about
and want to share something that uh
is is is important to me i'm not you
know i'm not into the whole
quackery whatever i mean i i have plenty
plenty of criticisms of wilbur but
but that's actually exactly what i'm
talking about even just that like that
you can
that work cannot just be reduced to like
the online quack library or whatever
we got to figure out how to think
through things
in a much more nuanced way and see human
beings particularly an individual level
in a much more nuanced way
acceptance doesn't mean that you're not
making distinctions i'll wrap this up
and i will wish each and every one of
you all my very best
please treat yourselves well treat each
other better
treat each other well treat yourself
better
um and log off if you can
much love to all of you stay safe
stay strong be well much love people
