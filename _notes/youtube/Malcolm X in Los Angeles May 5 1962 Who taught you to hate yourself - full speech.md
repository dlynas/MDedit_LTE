Transcript:
(00:12) in the name of Allah the beneficent the merciful to whom all praise is due whom we forever thank for giving us the Honorable Elijah Muhammad is our leader teacher and guide and I specifically ladies and gentlemen and brothers and sisters open up like that because I am a representative of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad and were it not for him you and I wouldn't be here today in order for you and me to devise some kind of method or strategy to offset some of the events or er repetition of the events that have taken place here in
(00:57) Los Angeles recently we have to go to the roof we have to go to the cause dealing with the condition itself is not enough we have to get to the cause of it all or the root of it all and it is because of our effort toward getting straight to the root that people oftentimes think we are dealing in hate but first I would like to congratulate and give praise to the Negro so-called Negro leaders and so-called Negro organizations and excuse me if I say so-called it's hard for me to just outright say Negro when I know what that
(01:38) word Negro really means the person whom you have come to know as Ronald Stokes we know him as brother round one of the most religious persons who displayed the highest form of morals of any black person anywhere on this earth and as one of the previous speakers pointed out who knew him everyone who knew him had to give him credit for being a good man a clean man an intelligent man on and an innocent man when he was murdered the negro so-called Negro organizations and and leaders should be given great credit for
(02:35) their failure or refusal to let the white man divide them and use them one against the other during this crisis as Reverend Welford wilson pointed out I think it was eight years ago today that the Supreme Court handed down the desegregation decision and despite the fact that eight years have gone past that decision hasn't been implemented yet I don't have that much space I don't have that much confidence I don't have that much patience and I don't have that much ignorance if the Supreme Court which is the
(03:45) highest law making body in the country can Tacitus it can't get even 8% compliance within eight years because it's for black people then my patience has run out when black people who are being oppressed become impatient they say that's emotional please when black people who are being deprived of their citizenship not only of their civil rights but there are human rights become impatient become fed up don't want to wait any longer then they say that emotion the Negro also called Negro leaders and
(04:46) organizations should be praised they should be congratulated they should be complimented because out of all of them combined the white man has not yet found one who will play the role of Uncle Tom but yet he has found no time no puppet no parrot who is still dumb enough in 1962 to represent the in justices that he's conflicted against our people we don't care what your religion is we don't care what organization you belong to we don't care how far in school you went or didn't go we don't care what
(05:37) kind of job you have we have to give you credit for shopping the white man by not letting him divide you and use your one against the other in the past the greatest weapon the white man has had has been his ability to divide and conquer as Jackie Robinson pointed out beautifully on the television last night four-fifths of the world isn't white isn't that what Jackie said and if if horses of the world is star how is it possible for 1/5 to rule oppressed exploit dominate and brutalize the horse thief who are in the majority
(06:40) but how will they do it divide each um free will right make my hand and slap you you don't even feel it it might sting you because these digits are separated but all I have to do to put you back in your place is bring those digits together this is what the white man has done so you and me he has divided us and used us one against the other but today thanks to Allah you can say thanks to God all thanks to Jesus all thanks to Jehovah whatever you want but as a follower of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad we have been tough to
(07:34) say thanks to Allah and that's what Jesus said Jesus called on Allah he said Allah Allah Allah mahashiv out to me I believe what what's good for TV this is good for us if Allah was good enough for Jesus to call upon I think he should be good enough for you to call the heart since the so-called Negro community has shot the white man by resisting all efforts to divide us I think that you and I should continue to shop him by seeing and working together in unity despite religious political economic or educational or social differences let us
(08:15) remember that we are not brutalized because we're Baptists we're not brutalized because we're a Methodist were not brutalized because we're Muslims were not brutalize because we're Catholics were brutalized because we are black people in America there your mother is being raped and you're not supposed to be emotional no women please your women can't walk the street without some backup putting his hands on if you say this you're fed up if you teach the negro they don't even know
(09:08) their own name right because he took it away from please please twenty million black people don't even know their own language cry because he took it away from people who don't even know the history of their ancestors why because he took it away from trying to tell them how thoroughly and completely they've been robbed he says you're teaching Haiti today coming out of college you're coming out of the leading universities you're trying to fill in a fifth direction but you don't know which direction to go in
(09:54) and if somebody tries to take you right to the root of your problem they say that that man's a hate teacher if I if I ask why should the Senators in Washington and then again if we tell you that Negroes by being hung on the tree or being shot down illegally unjustly and those Negroes should do something to protect themselves you say you're advocating violence the white man is tricking you he's trapping you he doesn't call it violence when he lands troops in South Vietnam he doesn't call it balance when he lives
(10:33) troops in Berlin when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor he didn't say get nonviolent he said praise the Lord but past the ammunition but when someone attacks you when someone comes at you with a club when someone comes at you with a rope when someone comes at you with a gun despite the fact that you've done nothing he tells you suffer peacefully pray for those who use you to spite you belong something and how long can you suffer after suffering for 400 years so I just want to play off that little point right
(11:25) there because these fans that we play on your emotions and when you turn on your television tonight for your radio or read the newspaper they're going to tell you in that paper that I was playing on your emotions imagine you a second-class citizen that's not getting emotional it's getting intelligence and as far as your mayor is concerned I see should say their mayor a man named Jordi who has been slandering their Muslims a professional liar a professional liar who has mastered the art of using
(12:18) half-truths put it in the paper that they break into our religious place of worship and got records that they can use to prove that most of us have criminal records you can't be a Negro in America and not have a criminal record Martin Luther King has been to jail clean James farmer has been to jail while you can't name a black man in this country who were sick and tired of the hell that he's catching who hasn't been to jail charged him with being seditious they put Moses in jail they put Daniel
(13:07) in jail why you haven't got a man of God in the Bible that wasn't put to jail when they started speaking out against exploitation and oppression they charged Jesus with sedition didn't didn't they do that they said he was the gate thief they said he was discriminating because he told his business his disciples go not the way of the Gentiles but rather go to the lost sheep he discriminated don't go there the Gentiles go to the lost sheep go to the oppressed go to the down trap go to the exploited go to the
(13:57) people who don't know who they are who are lost from the knowledge of themselves and who are strangers in a land that is not theirs go to those people go to the slaves go to the second-class citizens go to the ones who are suffering the brunt of Caesars brutality and if Jesus were here in America today he wouldn't be going to the white man the right man is the oppressor he would be going to the old friend he would be going to the humble he would be going to the lowly he would be going to the rejected in the despised
(14:30) he would be going to the so-called American negro to be able to have to have once dinner criminal there's no disgrace to remain a criminal is the disgrace - Lee was a criminal I formerly was in prison I'm not ashamed of that you never can use that over my head and that he's using the wrong stick I don't feel that stick I went to prison because I believed in men like Sam yard I went to prison because I trusted men like Sam yard I went to prison following the philosophy of men like Sam Urie but since I've been
(15:33) following the Honorable Elijah Muhammad I have been reformed and this moral please that's more than spam your tea and chief Parker and all these other white politicians have been able to do with the inmates in the prison's of this state they should give mr. Mohammed credit they should give mr.
(15:50) Mohammed credit for reforming and rehabilitating men whom they have failed to reform and rehabilitation the repairs are they some press report that mr. Mohammed had once been found guilty of contributing to the delinquency of a minor he failed to explain purposely that in 1934 the Honorable Elijah Muhammad refused to send his children to the white schools in Detroit Michigan that were teaching you about little black Esther that's the credits the minor that he contributed to the delinquency of you see this vicious forked tongue white man
(16:39) has been able to take lies and make you turn against those who want to help you and make others turn against you this is the contributing to the delinquency of our minor that this mayor or a man who calls himself mayor is talking about in the same article he said that the Muslims are the same people who rioted in the United Nations someone should pull his coat and let him know that at the present moment there are six million dollars worth of suits leveled against two of New York's leading newspapers for
(17:18) making the mistake of charging the Muslims as being involved in those United Nations riots we were not involved and if this court tongue man who calls himself yet mayor had taken the time to find that out he wouldn't be walking into the trap that he's letting his ignorance lead him into and if you take the thing we'll take the time to read The Washington Post that came out the Sunday after that incident took place The Washington Post pointed out on the front page that the Muslims had nothing to do with the UN riots and they quitted
(18:02) it insane so the the person who was at that time the Commissioner of Police in New York City see it's lies that the white man has spread about the Muslims to try and make you afraid of the Muslims or to try and make you think that the Muslims were a criminal element uncouth element and things that you would not like to be associated with why so they say that they I'm just clearing these things up and then we're going to get into what happened they also say that the Honorable Elijah Muhammad was a
(18:39) draft dodger no he wasn't he just refused to go to the army because he was a man of peace he was a minister of a religion of peace he was teaching peace so he outright refused to go to the army that's not draft Iseman that's intelligence here before the grand jury because the coroner's jury is stacked against Negroes the grand jury is stacked against Negroes the press the radio the television and the newspapers are stacked against Negroes but please the Los Angeles Police Department is stacked
(19:30) against Negroes he is stacked against all Negroes all except those whom he has appointed to high positions the currently controlled press the white press in flames the white public against Negroes the police are able to use it to beat the Negro community there's a criminal element the police are able to use the press to make the right public thing that 90% or 99% of the Negroes in the Negro community are criminals and once the wait public is convinced that most of the Negro community is a criminal element then this automatically
(20:22) paves the way for the police to move into the Negro community exercising Gestapo tactics stopping any black man who was in the Sun on the sidewalk whether he is guilty or whether he is innocent whether he is well-dressed or whether he is poorly dressed whether he is educated or whether he has done whether he's a Christian or whether he is a Muslim as long as he is black and a member of the Negro community the white public thinks that the white police woman is justified in going in there and trampling on that
(20:56) man's civil rights and on that man's human rights once the police have convinced the white public that the so-called Negro community is a criminal element they can go in in question brutalize murder unarmed innocent Negroes in the white public is go enough to back them up this makes the Negro community a police state this makes the Negro neighborhood a police state system it's the most heavily patrolled it has more police in it than any other neighborhood yet it has more crime in it than any other
(21:42) neighborhood how can you have more cops in more crime crime it shows you that the cops must be in cahoots with the criminal the texture of the other here that God pleased that God gave them so much the death would lie on it do you realize now you know brother live will neither hole in stealing you know your head is not who taught you please who taught you to heat the texture of your hair who taught you to heat the color of your skin to such extent that you bleach to get like the white man who taught you to heat the shape of your nose and the
(22:46) shape of your lips who taught you to heat your self from the top of your head to the soles of your feet who taught you to heat your own kind who taught you to hate the race that you belong to so much so that you don't want to be around each other you know before you come asking mr. Mohammed the ztk you should ask who yourself who taught you to hate be what God gave you we teach you to love the hair that God gave hair you way out in the middle of the ocean can't swim and you worried about someone that's in the bathtub and
(23:37) can't swim we don't steal we don't gamble we don't lie and we don't cheat and that also deprives the government of revenue because you can't get him to a whiskey bottle without getting past the government seal you can't want a deck of cards without getting past the government see there's a white man makes the whiskey and then put you in jail for getting drunk he sells you the cards and the dice and put you in jail majestic music so he's against us because we fix it where he can't catch you anymore we take
(24:31) the dice out of your hands and the cards out of your hand and the whiskey out of your head the most disrespected person in America is the black woman the most unprotected when a person in America is the black woman the most neglected person in America is the black woman and as Muslims the Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us to respect our women and to protect our women and then the only time a Muslim really gets real violent is when someone goes to molest his woman we will kill you for our woman I'm making
(25:09) it plain yes we will kill you for our world we believe that if the white man will do whatever is necessary to see that his woman gets respect and protection then you and I will never be recognized as men until we stand up like men and placed the same penalty over the head of anyone who puts his filthy hands out to put in the direction of our women we respect them but we want them to respect us we think that the law should respect the Negro community the law should protect the Negro community the law should approach the Negro community
(26:06) with intelligence if it expects the Negro community to react intelligently so the Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us to always avoid anything that smacks of disrespect for the law and if the police department tells the truth they will have to admit that they have never had any experiences with Muslims that have ever been anything other than honorable unless they themselves Camaro's in a dishonorable way there's no case against the Muslims it has no case against these brothers whom they shot down and because it has no case
(26:49) it's trying to create a case that's trying to manufacture a case and therefore they set up our grand jury hearing of the case so that they could hear it behind closed doors and after hearing what we have to say then build their particular strategy or defense against the actions that they committed on that April the 27th so at the advice of our attorneys we've purposely the victims those who have been indicted or rather those who are have been arrested and are out on bond has purposely refrained and refused from making any
(27:25) statements whatsoever until after the case appears in court and when you hear their story that will be in a public trial we have already been had experience with these private hearings behind closed doors anything that the white man has to do to the Muslim he has to do it in the open he has to do it in public or he has to put every single one of us behind bars for the rest of our lives when Mayor York called for a government investigation of a religious group that has the highest moral standards of any group in the Negro community mayor
(28:21) yardie was giving you an example of what pepper did in Nazi Germany when he began to go on the rampage we feel we have confidence that the white public in the black public if they hear our case if they hear and have access to the investigation we'll never be fooled by this phony setup that's stamped from the top all the way down and if you doubt it when you leave home tonight when you go home tonight look for the press I'll write that this time to call forth these burglars who are under who were arrested the brothers who
(29:07) were arrested come up here behind these chairs they were suspects this wouldn't happen in the white neighborhood white men can walk down the street with packages on his head packages under his arm and packages everywhere else and want anybody question his right to carry those packages but a Negro is suspect because the press makes you suspect yes the white press makes me go suspect whether you got all the information you need officer and the officer made one stay at the rear of the car when the other go to the front of the car and
(30:03) while he was taking the one to the front of the car the polite attitude the humble is the submissive intelligent peaceful spirit that he unexpectedly found in this Negro in fury aided you and he began to people he told a brother what down brother was talking he's not a criminal a man has a right on the sidewalk to talk with his hands put down your hand don't talk with your hands and when the brother continued to gesture with his hands the officer grabbed his hand twisted it around Brown behind his back bring him up against the car and
(30:44) then that's when the hell broke loose that was when the hell broke loose a struggle ensued shots were fired by the police and by a Negro fishing and alarm went out when the alarm went out instead of the police going to the place where the incident occurred the police went one block away to the temple when they arrived there they got out of their cars with their guns smoking you would have thought it was Wyatt what is the writer
(31:48) I'm telling you they came out of those cars and we have enough witnesses to hang them with their guns smoking chief Parker knows this mayor yard he knows this and every police official in the city knows they they didn't fire no warning shots in the air they fired warning shots point-blank at innocent unarmed defenseless Negroes as I say two of the presidents were shot in the bank another was shot in the shoulder another was shot two of them were shot excuse the expression through the penis another was shot in the hip and the
(32:40) bullet came out the other side the other here was shot one quarter of an inch from his heart let me tell you something and I'll tell you why you say we hate white people we don't hate anybody we love our own people so much they think we hate the ones who are inflicting injustice against them and who has been shot to death having passed our quarter of an inch through his heart I'm not gonna let him talk which I think you can understand why you should listen to the conversation of the police officers while it was going on two of
(33:27) the brothers who had been shot who were lying hidden him the officer said they were chaining her death change you read there they were saying allow applause what does that mean means that God is the greatest it means that God is understand this set the weight of the so-called a death chant was a prayer they were praying when they were shut down they were saying I love a flood and it shut the officer up but they haven't heard let people talk any kind of talk with what they talk and two of the brothers who were shot in the back were
(34:14) telling me that there is a delay on the sidewalk they were holding hands they held hands with each other sing along and the blood was seeping out of them where the book police bullets had torn into their inside still Lisbeth Arau and the police came and kicked him in the head um police kicked him in the head telling him to shut up that North Father will leave on the sidewalk in front of our temple kicked him in the head chopped that noise and one of them when he was on his way to the police stations in the ambulance one of the ambulance
(34:54) attendants told the white cop why don't you kill the instead I'll tell him I'll tell him that he tried to get away why don't you kill the why'd you got a chance and I'll swear that he tried to get away if he didn't say this than I need to be put in jail and I'll gladly go one of them who was being taken to jail in a police car as the ambulance sirens were coming to the place one of the policemen said to the other what are the ambulances rushing for nothing but some so he looked in
(35:30) and saw the Muslim brother sitting beside him and he said and he shut up but after he got to the jail the same officer that said this turn to the brother who's dead I hope that you didn't get offended by what I said back there under the heat of emotion because some of my best friends are colored what he said that's his password one of my best friends are colored tonight for one as a Muslim believe that the white man is intelligent enough if he will need to realize how black people really feel and how fat we are without better
(36:16) compromising sweet talk why you're the one that make it hard for yourself the right man believes you when you go to him with that old sweet talk because you've been sweet-talking him ever since he brought you here stop sweet-talking tell him how you see tell him how what time the hell you've been catching and let him know that if he's not ready to clean his house up if he's not ready to clean his house up he shouldn't have a house should catch on fire and burn down Muslims we identify ourselves with the
(37:03) dock work so we're not any minority we're part of the majority and the white man is the menorah you have to know this understand us we don't think in the odds are against us we don't fight a battle like the odds are against us why the holdup well today is in unity gets run if you don't say think so look at the United Nations when the dark world then they both as once they get in the colonial a colonialist out of Africa and out of each telling them to get out they don't have any nuclear weapons but they got a solid
(37:47) united point and their unity alone is sufficient to drive the oppressor and exploiter of their people out of their own country you and I need to learn a lesson from that right there we are in the UN the dark world consists of Buddhists Hindus Jim fast tourists Christians Muslims everything but they together they forget their religious and political differences they think as one they move as one against a common enemy and why however Algeria he's going don't think he's not going he's going they're getting him out of
(38:27) Angola out of Tanganyika out of angle out of our ganda out of Kenya he's going from South Africa to he hasn't got long to be there all over this earth doc people who have been oppressed and exploited by those who are not their own kind strangers are coming together to get the oppressor off their back you and I learn a lesson from that we are all friends we are exploited we are down trapped we are denied not only civil rights but even human rights so the only way we're going to get some of this oppression and exploitation away
(39:07) from us or safe from us is come together against the common when they sat down at the bank on country everyone there had this in common a some of those who were sitting there were socialists some were communists some were capitalists some were Christians some were Buddhists they were everything but all of them and they looked at that dark skin and agreed that this is one thing they had income forget that you're a Methodist forget that you're a Catholic forget that you're Protestant forget that you're a Muslim
(39:53) remember that all of us were black and we're catching him
