(00:04)  thank you you know the way you know you are the ones the one with the way you'll be okay you take the way in America 2021 has been the year of the great resignation otherwise known as the big quit millions of Americans are leaving their jobs over 4 million every month at the moment it would challenge that assertion that these are the happiest countries in the world uh the the fact that Americans may be less happy is their economic Mobility has essentially been slashed and Shackled in a world where social and cultural
(00:55) constraints are being weakened seemingly genuine and meaningful social progress expanded upon how might We Now understand power how can we understand newer ideological material and economic relationships today these are arguably the most prescient questions posed by contemporary cultural Theory and philosophy biang chulhan a South korean-born German philosopher and theorist offers some of the more interesting approaches to these questions to touch on this we have to establish the what is the conditions and time of now where these questions were
(01:33) asked and a socio-economic sense this now being neoliberalism I suppose for the sake of clarity we need to delve into the history of this since the late 20th century around the late 70s the entire global economic approach shifted drastically from a a more mediated capitalism one where regulation unionization and collective bargaining were all relatively common in scale some countries emphasize the Democratic or regulatory element of this mixed economy and some stuck to a more austere market-driven approach of a mixed
(02:11) economy but the Baseline approach to this capitalism was roughly similar across the West this period of post-world War II capitalism is roughly known as a democratic mixed economy some call it simply mixed economy some democratic mixed economy but I think the Democratic element here helps differentiate this period the result of this what economists call the Keynesian period in capitalism's history was a much more even distribution power of wealth that resulted in a creation of a new middle class and a focus on
(02:48) Democracy not merely in political functions but economic this approach drastically changed around the late 70s for Simplicity we often pin the timeline of the shift around the administrations of Reagan and Thatcher from here on unions were violently killed off yes violently safety nets and regulations be that environmental or financial or slashed in favor of lower taxation for the rich and the largest asset holders I highlight Rich because the newer tax burden was placed on middle-income people while corporate tax shrunk for more comparison
(03:30) to highlight the previous era in the 50s and 60s marked a corporate tax rate of around 50 percent to today where it sits at around a combined 21 percent in conjunction with state tax this is where the term trickle-down economics got its material meaning in theory neoliberalism was supposed to be a return to an unfettered Radical by ease a fair capitalism of the past if the result of neoliberalism a shrinking of worker control democracy increased wealth inequality sounds bad to you well it's because it likely is
(04:07) according to your moral outlook on the world and most people's at that yet this isn't a moral description of neoliberalism I'm trying to make something that is a more top-down model of capitalism something that lessens Commons forms of democracy and ownership in the workforce this is a literal description for a few here I'm going to throw a curveball I will preface by saying everything stated so far is a more classic definition of neoliberalism the logic therein the ideological textbook definition more preciously and
(04:40) accurately contemporary theorists and economists have defined it a bit differently which sees neoliberalism not necessarily as a subtraction of the state but a positive merging and restructuring of it for a specific class essentially a raw classic neoliberalism for working people and mixed economy-based subsidization for large business the state has the same welfare like system just not for working people 2008 and 2020 in mind here okay with the 21st century in mind this is still the economic backdrop of today
(05:20) and the Very basis in which byeongchul Han is developing a newer Avenue a lens within critical theory so with this we will be exploring these Avenues primarily within text of psychopolitics and the burnout Society psychopolitics I find to be a more Technical and theoretical approach to explaining the consequences of neoliberalism and the underpinnings of this very burnout society as the texts the burnout Society leans more into the picturesque tactile cultural theory of today do you remember   things have changed since the Advent of
(06:25) neoliberalism technology has grown and evolved power relations remolded and political systems fractured a re-fracturing newer function byeongchul Han coins psychopolitics okay so what is this psychopolitics to answer this we need to bring up Foucault's concept of biopolitics biopolitics and even bio power are often so simplified to the point of only really being half correct because of its comprehensive nature it is fairly tough to simplify but I'll attempt to do so in conjunction with how han uses it in his developmental idea of
(07:02) psychopolitics simply put in line with Nietzsche or later critical theorist Foucault saw modernity a modern society as something that hinged upon newer modes of power and domination with the rise of liberalism we are no longer under a sovereign a king a hierarchy directly controlling our day-to-day lives we are in a sense more free according to this narrative via its tenets of progress liberalism necessitated and increase in production but by taking it out of the hands of a sovereign and into Market functions
(07:40) rationale the scientific method its sociological implications have led to Stark categorization never seen before in history our necessity to understand That Grew From the enlightenment and in the case of biopolitics a categorization a set of norms that were ideologically developed from this desire to understand things like newer subjective ideals of bodies and our extreme concern with Statistics regarding biological functions death rates birth rates all biological categorization inserts liberalism necessitates
(08:19) hypercategorization categories that then ideologically devolve into cultural and moral ideals slim not fat straight not gay healthy not sick when these ideals aren't historically Universal or concrete at all they're subjective with large implications for people that deviate we can use this approach to understand things like racism sexism and homophobia the clear subtext I find here with bucco's philosophy is that liberalism ironically tears apart the myth of the promise of a free individual within modernity as we see the
(08:59) productive Force within modernity can't allow deviation from positive Norms categorization cannot allow for individuality in the end and in contemporary context biang Chul Han believes that we've superseded a biopolitics into a more psychopolitics our prior Western economies were much more bent on manufacturing a type of Labor more materially immediate Commodities that were tactile thus in Prior historical eras of Western economics we see a biopolitics that may favor analyzing human strength and output on a physical more biological
(09:39) level while in today's mode of service economics a type of psychopolitics can ensue how does one become more mentally agile ambitious and adaptive with the focus on the psychological Beyond punctual Han finds along with other theorists such as Mark Fisher and Herbert marcusa why we are seeing such a heavy emphasis and medicalization around the mental at the heart of Han and Foucault is an understanding that liberalism stands as a technocratic force that encompasses and dominates to Han this progression still stands this
(10:17) psychic turn that is the turn to psychopolitics also connects with the mode of operation of contemporary capitalism now immaterial and non-physical forms of production are what determine the course of capitalism what gets produced and not material objects but immaterial ones for instance information and programs the body no longer represents a central force of production as it formally did in biopolitical disciplinary Society now productivity is not to be enhanced by overcoming physical resistance so much as by optimizing psychic or mental
(10:59) processes physical discipline has given way to mental optimization and neuro enhancement differs from the disciplinary techniques of Psychiatry fundamentally in conjunction with psychopolitics to byeongchul Han we are entering a world away from negative repression we're moving away from the type of restrictions and repression of the past Foucault's concept of a disciplinary Society where active punishment for specific crimes and wrongdoings aren't the markings for our current lived ideology to Beyond julhan we have
(11:35) transitioned from a disciplined Society to an achievement Society exploitation now happens on a positive level we actively exploit ourselves by achievement and Entrepreneurship in essence the process of Education marketing yourself into a service sector job or building a business you are the ultimate commodity your worth is your psychological disposition your quote-unquote skill set or your educational background or of course most importantly your LinkedIn profile all atmospheric ideals of worth compared to physical material ones such as
(12:16) strength and durability there are differences here between Han and Foucault but their symmetry realigns with power at least in form to both the most effective form of power isn't violence or external the real threat therein is silent inoculation of oneself like Foucault's used symbolism of the panopticon discipline repression or achievement happens from within not from a mere external threat the panopticon and its seemingly infinite grasp visualize this it's the quiet knowing that matters Han States the greater
(12:56) power is the more quietly it works it just happens it has no need to draw attention to itself yet Foucault and Han's power differ in content as stated earlier here by way of its trajectory foucaos is negative prohibit yourself in the name of production in cultural constraints while Han sees a positively repressive power where repression happens from an unshackling of economic tradition and cultural constraints in the case of newer Market choices a culture of Entrepreneurship for everyone race gender and ethnicity aside again we
(13:41) aren't using the terms positive and negative in a moral sense like good or bad but positive and negative by way of access compared to restriction addition or subtraction Han continues in as much as it expands a great deal of energy to force people into the straight jacket of Commandments and prohibitions disciplinary power proves inefficient a significantly more efficient technology of power makes sure that people subordinate themselves to power relations on their own such a dynamic seeks to activate motivate and optimize not to inhibit or
(14:24) repress it proves so effective because it does not operate by means of forbidding and depriving but by pleasing and fulfilling instead of making people compliant it seeks to make them dependent it's here that Han finds the logic for designating neoliberalism as the capitalism of like a society that says yes more often a commodified ideal of self-care treating yourself to lavishness on a credit card abolishing scarcity today for a slavery tomorrow even to the literal meaning of a like via Facebook we are eager to positively
(15:05) affirm ourselves by allowing social media companies to exploit our data our entire recorded lives to just Pawn off to analytics companies and by politicians to supersede whatever small regulation meant to protect consumer privacy all regulations struggling to survive from a bygone era of mixed economies in the west this includes the basic responsibility of protecting people's information which we failed to do with Cambridge analytica this type of yes logic of smart and neuronal power is now the leading charge in institutions
(15:41) which are reflected by Capital where the very Bedrock of vital necessary services are becoming more available but only by way of offloading debt burden onto individuals rather than the state of which of course are tied to financial institutions you can now go to college you will not be turned away at the hospital but you will certainly pay for it and we absolutely have especially with medicine so now with neoliberalism we can escape the dreaded repressive government overreach of taking our money which which actually still exists and happens
(16:21) by the way so this new cultural logic this active yes Society movement into a psychopolitics what could this lead to yep you guessed it burnout the very basis for Han's burnout Society burnout fits Han's logic of psychopolitics of a yes and like culture because burnout is primarily a positive phenomenon an overflow and an excess of activity and stimuli the burnout Society overlaps with psychopolitics once more as today's main case of burnout is psychological and even emotional physical labor and exhaustion can
(17:05) passively mend themselves but psychological overload stands to be a much more difficult phenomenon to deal with we work longer hours for Less average purchasing power but most of all the bounds of work and life have been completely erased life outside of work culture rituals all in the same way lead us back to work our devices small or large mirror capability you can work from your phone while laptop or desktop thus you are permanently tied to it tied to a sameness of capability the lack of any difference of restriction among your
(17:46) devices your hobbies often hinge on monetization don't ask me how I know this this video is brought to you by patreon please give me your money seriously give me your money things like advertising are everywhere it's more multi-varied complex and aware of itself and its shortcomings but most of all there's simply more of it in the 21st century we are dealing with something within the realm of mental health here but the actual scary thing Han highlights is the logical or almost metaphysical Mountain we are up against
(18:24) by finding not only absolute cures or at best stopping mental health woes in the first place is such a daunting task from a pathological standpoint the incipient 21st century is determined neither by bacteria nor by viruses but by neurons neurological illnesses such as depression attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD borderline personality disorder BPD and burnout syndrome Mark the landscape of pathology at the beginning of the 21st century they're not infections but infractions they do not follow from the negativity
(19:07) of what is immunologically foreign but from an excess of positivity therefore they elude all Technologies and techniques that seek to combat what is alien the issue is that we are dealing with newer positive excess here not immunological subtractions and exterior deterioration of Health via viruses and bacteria is much more understood than mere burnout so there's some heavy subtexts and implications here I find what makes this dilemma extremely interesting and ironically disturbing is that the most insurmountable historical solutions to
(19:47) many systemic problems not yet achieved such as overthrowing capital reaching a new revolutionary Epoch or another type of Industrial Revolution doesn't necessarily contend with the pathology of excess history thus far has been primarily marked with negative phenomenon repression disciplinary social relations and drastic material scarcity with contemporary Theory and within byeongchulahoma there is another theoretical implication with critical philosophy we almost always have to contend with Marx's concept of
(20:23) alienation as presciently descriptive as it is of the reality encompassing modern subjects positivity really starts to challenge the notion of Marx's alienation in today's world for so many an entrepreneurial Society the logic of ownership of one's labor is often realized in many ways for many different people many have at least a similar type of ownership that Marx claimed was missing in industrial society while the division of labor that separated and isolated types of creation still exist many in today's service-based economy
(21:00) are more responsible for Creative Endeavors than say a manufacturing line worker their labor is less divided yet despite this excess positivity creates a newer type of alienation or at the least minimum a realization that even though I may technically come to own my labor I still feel outside of it there seems to be a new dilemma the concept of ownership within social Society may be too individualistic in accordance to Mark's definition even though I might control my labor it doesn't mean I'm free of it free of the necessity of
(21:38) external Society I still need other people to access my labor my art my product my service even though I technically control my labor it doesn't mean that my labor or myself is in an unalienated State again I always feel like I have to reiterate with Marx and give some backdrop because of how misunderstood he is for everyone who has actually red marks they know Marx was a large proponent of Labor I thought it was one of the most defining Grand things we can do this idea challenges his notion rather affirms it okay back
(22:13) to the theory at hand when taking capitalist relations out of the equation the conception of Labor itself may be a larger issue that is underdeveloped in the 21st century an issue that contemporary theorists such as Han are getting closer to in my mind I find this is why not only unionization is seeing a decent uptick in American society but things larger in scale like anti-work hinting towards the struggle with the labor itself on a larger level as a conception even in the best conditions but don't just take my guesstimating for
(22:49) it Beyond Han leaves us with this the reaction to A Life That's become bare and radically fleeting occurs as hyperactivity hysterical work and production the acceleration of contemporary life also plays a role in this lack of being the Society of laboring and achievement is not a free Society it generates new constraints ultimately the dialectic of Master enslaved does not yield a society where everyone is free and capable of leisure too rather it leads to a society of work in which the master himself has become a
(23:31) laboring slave in this Society of compulsion everyone carries a Work Camp inside this labor camp is defined by the fact that one is simultaneously prisoner and guard victim and perpetrator one exploits oneself it means that exploitation is possible even without domination as always thank you all for watching and making it to the end want to give a massive thanks to all of you on patreon for all who are not consider joining for just a couple bucks a month it truly keeps this entire thing alive before we go I want to give an extra special
