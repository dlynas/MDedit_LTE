Transcript:
(00:00) Tonight, we're talking about the news media.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is, for me, my bête noire, my white whale, the pea under my mattress...  I'm very bothered by it.  Now, generally, our news media has been collected into two major categories, for the most part.
(00:33) You've got your, what they call, the mainstream, liberal, corporate media. Mmm? And then you got your right-wing, also mainstream corporate media.  We're going to leave Facebook and TikTok for another day.  One side of this media equation believes they are the purveyors of truth and justice, the guardians of our Democratic Republic! The other side is...
(01:07) effective.  Now, we're not gonna talk about right-wing media for this whole program. We're just going to show you how fucking good they are at accomplishing their goals. Let's start with our story, and begin with a gentleman named Christopher Rufo. Rufo wanted to make critical race theory into a political winner for Republicans.
(01:33) This was his stated goal. It's not so easy! I'm kidding. Have a look. - It's absolutely astonishing how critical race theory has purveyed at every institution in the Federal Government. And I call on the President to immediately issue this executive order, and stamp out this destructive, divisive, pseudoscientific ideology at its root.
(01:59) The fucking guy! “Oh, call on the President.” Who the fuck? Let me tell you something! He's the President of the United States. Christopher Rufo, he goes on that other idiot's show on September 1st, and calls on the President. Well, guess what? His words echoed infinitely, all the way to September 17th.
(02:23) - Students in our universities are inundated with critical race theory. This is a Marxist act, holding that America is a wicked and racist nation.  Aren't cult leaders supposed to be charismatic?   That's the weirdest delivery.  “This is... Uhhh... This is Kool-Aid...
(03:00)  Fruity and delicious...  You should drink it...  Not around walls... Because...  Giant pitcher...”  Fucking 16 days from the time that guy went on Fox News and said, "I call on the President to do something about critical race theory," to when the President did something about critical race...
(03:33) Now, of course, you can't always rely on a president binge-watching your show and writing down whatever you tell him to do. So, in this new age of Biden, right-wing media had to work a little harder on their bespoke, harm-to-table critical race theory nonsense. - Kids across America are being force-fed the critical race theory poison.
(03:52) - You have to get organized. - Turn around and say, "I don't want Marxists- I don't want Communists teaching my kid." - Complain vocally, loudly. - Shame on you! - So, you're the racist! - This is an unlawful arrest! I have a first amendment right! - Parents have had it, Jack. - I don't really think I've seen something spur up with so much passion, out of the grassroots.
(04:12) It's not grassroots! You fucking started it! You lit the fire, and then as it was warmed up were like, "I've never seen a fire like this." It's like when a dog vomits on a carpet, and then eats it,  and looks at you like,  "Can I get a treat for cleaning that up?" No!  You made the mess in the first place! Suddenly, we're banning CRT, we're restricting race teaching, we're banning books, and Florida has legislation to make it illegal for a white person to feel uncomfortable.
(04:57) In Florida.  Good luck arresting humidity.  "My balls are sticking to my leg.  Officer!  Remove..." Alright.  That would be such a bad call to get over the radio. "Yeah, we got a sticky ball situation down in... In Ocala.”  The right-wing media, working seamlessly with their political arm, made that happen.
(05:42) Well, you know, Brian, we were the only channel that covered critical race theory. And that became a big issue.   It sure did!  But that's how fucking good these guys are. That's how good... And if you're gonna battle this coordinated effort, political and media, together- we're going to need a hero.
(06:07) A hero brave enough to heed the call of a society in grave danger of succumbing to CRT panic and “Let's Go, Brandon” memes.  Who's that hero? - There is no democracy without journalism. - Our job is to speak truth to power. - Our job is to shine a light in dark corners, to hold the powerful to account.
(06:30) - Because knowing empowers us. Knowing helps us decide. Knowing keeps us free.    I mean, seriously? But in an age of weaponized mis- and disinformation, secrecy and political polarization, the one group that stands at the ready to shine light into that darkness, so that the good ship America needn't stub its toe on the post-midnight snack of fascism...
(07:15) I'm mixing metaphors.  But the point is this: the fourth estate has claimed that they stand ready, twixt America and peril. A bulwark to creeping fascism. Our media. They are the watchers on the wall. No, that's the wrong... Okay, that’s...  That's the wrong watcher and the wrong wall.
(07:43) That's the wall. That's the watcher.  Yes, thank you. To the ramparts, heroes! - Three, two, one! Happy New Year!.  Well, America, it's been a pleasure. We're fucked. Yes, unfortunately, if they are the one thing that stands between America and chaos, we are in trouble, because rarely has there been an institution that has such a distance between its aspirations and its execution.
(08:26) And thus, the problem... With the media. The media keeps informing us how incredibly important they are to our survival, because knowing keeps us free, but when giving crucial informational tasks, they instead build us prisons of, "What the fuck are you people talking about?" For instance, a few years back, there was concern that the President of these United States may have outsourced our electoral integrity to a foreign power.
(09:02) Not of the Allied persuasion. And had fired his top cop, rather than risk the subterfuge being exposed. Journey back with me to 20-aught-17!  Nothing? We don't have any of the...? Alright. - The Department of Justice reveals that they will appoint a special counsel, to now oversee the FBI investigation into Russian meddling and any possible collusion.
(09:32) Former FBI director, Robert Mueller, will now lead the investigation. - Well done. You told us what was occurring. You gave it a tonal gravity that I thought was appropriate, and it was delivered with just the right soupçon of handsome. It was a very handsome delivery. So, what happens now? - One, a special counsel truly works in secret.
(09:55) And if any special counsel's going to obey that rule, it's a guy like Bob Mueller. - Virtually everything that happens with the special counsel happens behind closed doors. - The special counsel investigation, of course, is secretive. - Robert Mueller does not leak. - Mueller runs a very tight ship.
(10:10) Once again, I'm sorry. I congratulate you. Well done. The special counsel works in secret. That’s factual. Bob Mueller is tight-lipped. That's slightly subjective, but still. This segment leaves our democracy's pulse oximeter at a healthy 97, 98. - Bobby Mueller. Bobby Three-Sticks, as agents called him.
(10:32) - Why’d they call him- - Robert Swan Mueller III.  And slowly, the oxygen drops. And thus began the turn to darkness. Let the overplaying of the media's hand commence! - If you do have something to hide, Mueller's probably the last person you would want to be investigating you. - Bob Mueller is going to investigate this aggressively, and if there's any wrongdoing, he's going to find it.
(10:56) - Director Mueller is going to get to the bottom of it. - He will find it. - If you have a kid, and you despair that there's not a hero in America, wake up bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. Robert Mueller's it. - The Republic just got a chance of saving itself. We're not on fucking Tatooine! We're not looking for a child of prophecy.
(11:20) We need a competent prosecutor, working diligently to find the facts, and we don't need you narrating and overblowing and elevating the stakes of every moment! - This is Watergate. - Watergate, basically. - The peril to the President is just as great. - Is this bigger than Watergate? - In some ways, this could be worse than Watergate.
(11:44) Well, you know, Bernstein, certainly the coverage of it will be.  Even though it was already explained very clearly the special counsel operates in secret. Bob Mueller plays it close to the vest. It did not stop the public from being dead center in the information blast zone. - A bombshell from Robert Mueller! - This is not some Friday night news dump.
(12:13) This is a Friday night explosion. - Bombshell after bombshell. - The latest bombshell in an arsenal of bombshells. - Robert Mueller's twin bombshells... - Bombshell. - Bombshell. - Bombshell. - Bombshell. - A potentially huge bombshell. - Bombshell from the New York Times, the paper of record is reporting special counsel Robert Mueller has dozens of questions for President Trump.
(12:35) Bombshell, bombshell!  Detective has questions. Bombshell! Hungry people like food. Bombshell!  I also have a question: Do you think we are fucking stupid?  That's the responsible, measured way they handled something they actually knew. Then it started getting weird. - Folks, this could be a game-changer.
(13:00) If this report is true... - On 1 to 10, how big are these developments, if, in your view, true? - No one should underestimate how big this is, if it's true. - Really big deal, if true. - If true, is it a big deal? What else does it speak of? - If it is true, it would appear to be significant evidence of collusion.
(13:19) - If true. - If the report is proven true. We have not confirmed it. No other major news organization has confirmed it, but if it's true, what does it mean, big picture, for the Trump presidency? - Well, the Trump presidency would be over. - Is there a multiplier you use, that X times what we know equals what you imagine Mueller knows? Yes, yes, there is! I know this equation! That's the thing when you make your calculator spell, "Boobies.
(13:48) "  You press it in, you press thing, and then you turn it over.  And you show your friends, it says, "Boobies!"  There were so many, "If trues” in there, it was like a high-stakes tarot reading. But you know what?  It's not like any other important news happened in 2019.
(14:09) That's why they had the resources to do things like this. - The CNN stakeout team says they haven't seen Mueller leave for lunch today. He usually does.  My God, no lunch?  Could he have packed a sammie from home?  But ultimately, after two years of speculation, and innuendo, and flat-out bullshit, they were sure of one thing.
(14:36) - If you're Donald Trump, the news does not appear to be good. - The walls are closing in, might be a better way to put it. - Walls closing in on him. - Walls are closing in. - The walls closing in. - Closer and closer. - Closer and closer. - Closer and closer to the President. - It does appear like we're getting closer.
(14:54) Closer to the top. That actually didn't appear like they were getting closer. That last one. Seemed like there was a big gap, that he could get out of. It looked like he could get out the top on that one. The other ones, I thought, “Yes.”  And the news media promised, promised, that it was gonna be a finale to remember.
(15:13) - Now, there is talk of indicting the President. Now, there is talk of jail- time for the President. - This is going to be earth-shattering. There is just no way that this is not going to be one of the most significant events in the history of the United States. - If anybody from the Trump family and extended family is going to be indicted, it would be in the final act.
(15:34) - That the noose is tightening, and that people might go to jail. - You're exactly right. - For the rest of their lives. If true.  And then, after two years of just edging themselves to a Mueller climax...   Interesting audience of fetishists we have in here.  That's kind of a bombshell in and of itself.
(16:03)   There's a lot of knowing- edging-joke people in here.  The...  Dirty, dirty motherfuckers.   You know, you can’t...  When they're wearing masks, you can't really tell.  It's like the opposite of Eyes Wide Shut. It's just...
(16:29)  Don't even know what we're talking about anymore. Yes! Getting back to our subject at hand. After two years of edging themselves to a Mueller climax,  the day finally arrived. - CNN's special coverage of the release of the Mueller report begins tomorrow morning, 6:00 AM. - Tick tock, tick tock.
(16:52) We should have a Mueller clock down there. We're just about two hours away. - This is people waiting for the report. - It is 11:05 AM. The Attorney General said that 11:00 AM Eastern Time, this report would be handed to Congress. - Melber, do you have it? - It is up. Is it online? - And it's been posted. It is online.
(17:09) - Okay.  - You can go to www.justice.gov, and I think it's /storage/report.pdf. - Be ready, in terms of toner and paper.  We have to print it ourselves?  NBC doesn't have a Kinko's? Is that what you're telling me? You finally have real, breaking news, and I have to get it myself? - I'm gonna read it live here with you.
(17:40) Kind sir, I beg of you. No.  - What I'm reading here is the beginning of the treatment of this, and we're gonna go, as we go live today, Brian, but Bob Mueller defining in order... - On page 76 of volume two, Mueller offers a theory. “The President”- quote, "The President wanted to protect himself from an investigation into his campaign.
(18:04) " Okay, now, keep listening... - 448 pages. Who can claim victory?  He said at the end, "It's 400 pages. Who can declare victory here?" I believe Satan can.  You motherfuckers, spent two years, filled with breaking bombshells and urgent explosions, and teed up a season finale for the ages.
(18:37) A noose-tightened, closed-walled, family-style jail-gasm. And all we got was a fucking book report that we had to print ourselves.  I owe the producers of Lost an apology.  This was the worst finale...   ever!  And maybe it would have landed more dramatically if you hadn't already reported on Trump A.G.
(19:15) Bill Barr's Mueller Report Sparksnotes a month earlier! - Major victory for President Trump. The summary now from the Attorney General, who said Mueller and his team found no collusion, no conspiracy. - Big, big win for this president. - All the questions surrounding the President. - They've cleared him. - Did he obstruct justice? - They have just cleared that.
(19:30) -They’ve cleared the President. - But it's also- And the craziest part is, throughout the entire time, great reporters were doing impressive work. But you wouldn't know it, because it was all smothered in so much... News-cum.  And if anything is going to kill our democracy, it's gonna be news-cum.
