## Transcript:
(Singing).
There was a  
decade of popular uprisings from 2010 into 
the global pandemic in 2020. These uprisings  
shook the foundations of the global order. They 
denounced corporate domination, austerity cuts,  
and demanded economic justice and civil 
rights. The Occupy Wall Street Movement,  
the Black Lives Matter demonstrations following 
the execution of George Floyd in 2020 are cases  
in point. There were also popular eruptions 
in Greece, Spain, Tunisia, Egypt, Bahrain,  
Yemen, Syria, Libya, Turkey, Brazil, Ukraine, 
Hong Kong, Chile, and during South Korea's  
Candlelight Revolution. Discredited politicians 
were driven from office in Greece, Spain, Ukraine,  
South Korea, Egypt, Chile, and Tunisia.
Reform, or at least the promise of it,  
dominated public discourse. It seemed to herald 
a new era. Then the backlash, the aspirations  
of the popular movements were crushed. State 
control and social inequality expanded. There  
was no significant change. In most cases, things 
got worse. The far-right emerged triumphant. What  
happened? How did a decade of mass protests 
that seemed to herald democratic openness,  
an end to state repression, a weakening 
of the domination of global corporations  
and financial institutions, and an era of 
freedom sputter to an ignominious failure?  
What went wrong? How did the hated bankers 
and politicians maintain or regain control? 
What are the effective tools to rid ourselves 
of corporate domination? Joining me to discuss  
the failure of these popular movements and the 
resurgence of the right-wing is Vincent Bevins,  
former foreign correspondent for the Los Angeles 
Times and The Washington Post, and the author  
of If We Burn: The Mass Protest Decade and The 
Missing Revolution. I have to say, I was far more  
optimistic. I spent a lot of time in Zuccotti 
Park, but you're right, it completely... all  
of the advances that we thought we had made have 
been, at best, erased and often rolled back. But  
let's go back to, as you do in the book, where we 
were in that moment in history and what happened. 
Yeah, thank you. I do think that there are some 
victories, some partial victories, but certainly  
the moments that were experienced as euphoric 
victory in so many places around the world tended  
to end up with something far worse than what 
seemed possible in those moments. I tried to write  
a history of the world from 2010 to 2020 built 
around mass protests that got so large that they  
either overthrew or fundamentally destabilized 
existing governments. This really starts in  
Tunisia at the end of 2010, which inspires 
Egypt early in 2011. Egypt, of course, like  
every other uprising in the book, in the world, 
has its own particular reasons for taking off. 
But this inspiration that's coming from a smaller 
country, North Africa, is part of the story.  
And then, Tahrir Square really inspires quite a 
lot of movements across the rest of the decade.  
I call this the Mass Protest Decade. You could 
easily call it the Tahrir Square Decade. You see- 
This is when the Egyptians occupied 
Tahrir Square, which is this gigantic  
square in the center of Cairo and camped 
out there much like the Occupy Movement. 
The Occupy Movement did that because they were 
copying Tahrir Square. There was a protest on  
January 25th, 2011, aimed at police brutality. 
Now, the organizers that put together January  
25th had not even planned to call for the fall 
of the government, let alone expected to see the  
numbers flow into the streets that would make 
that possible. Yet, a lot more people come to  
the streets than expected. Then, on January 
28th, they really take downtown Cairo. The  
protest turns into a battle with the police and 
the police lose. Now, in that moment, they could  
perhaps have done a lot of different things.
What they do is they take the square, they  
stay in Tahrir Square for 18 days, and eventually 
Mubarak is ejected. If you want to look very, very  
closely at how that ejection happens, it's, in a 
narrow sense, perhaps a military coup, but it is a  
military coup that can be seen as very progressive 
compared to what was happening previously,  
especially if elections are really going to go 
forward. And so, around the world in 2011, you get  
the... not only are people taking inspiration from 
Tahrir Square but often copying and pasting that  
tactic. Occupy Wall Street is Adbusters Magazine 
saying, we should do Tahrir Square in New York. 
You get movements in Spain and Greece that are, 
to a greater extent in Spain than in Greece,  
trying to replicate this model. You get this model 
inspiring not only activists to act a certain way  
into the 2010s, but inspiring people like me to 
view other things later as if they're kind of the  
same thing, even if national and political 
circumstances are very different. But I do  
think the decade, of course, starts with Tunisia, 
with the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi, but  
really this mass protest form and this phenomenon, 
comes together in the 18 days in Tahrir Square. 
You mentioned that when the Egyptians occupied 
Tahrir Square, they didn't begin with a call  
for the government. What's interesting about that 
self-immolation, he was a fruit seller or just had  
a cart, and the police had taken away his scales 
to weigh his fruit. But this was a protest built  
around a very personal, in particular, 
injustice, but it, of course, resonated. 
Yes.
This was the very corrupt Ben Ali  
regime, resonated throughout Tunisia. That's an 
interesting point, that when these protests erupt,  
they don't necessarily have a macro goal in mind.
Well, the Tunisia example is really interesting,  
not only because it sets off so much of what 
happens elsewhere, but from... even with the  
advantages of looking back 10 years in the 
past or with the distance that is given to us,  
or even some with the distance that was 
enjoyed or felt to be enjoyed by journalists,  
looking back on late 2010, just in the middle 
of 2011, it's easy to see one thing happening.  
But if you look back at Tunisia, you can really 
trace day to day how it is that one man dies,  
what the circumstances are before he dies, how 
the people around him start to argue about what  
that means and what should be done next.
Then, I went back, so this book is built  
through interviews. I did 200 to 250 interviews in 
12 countries, and I did go back to Sidi Bouzid and  
I talked to members of his family, members of his 
community, people that worked with him that didn't  
have their scales taken away. You had a process 
where there were people that had already been part  
of rebellions in the region, labor rebellions, 
responses to the brutal neoliberalism that had  
been unleashed on their part of North Africa. 
There were more formal organizations, that they  
decide to take this lone act of protest, this cry 
out against this one very particular injustice,  
and to turn it into a small-scale protest.
You can see other groups joining and turning that  
into an even larger protest. And then, you can 
see now a national movement where a large union  
organization joins, and then civil society groups 
join. You can really, by going chronologically,  
and this is the method that I choose to employ 
in this book, by really looking at what happens,  
it seems very simple. On one day and then 
to the next day, you could see how... it is  
the people around Mohamed Bouazizi that decide 
what it means that he has done and would decide  
what to do with it and ultimately send a 
dictator, literally fleeing the country. 
It's interesting that this contagion, which was 
certainly true after the French Revolution. The  
French Revolution inspired much of the 
consternation of the French planners,  
the Haitian uprising, but it's a very similar 
process where it spreads to, I don't know,  
nine or 10 different countries at least.
Yes, and so we see this historically. We  
do see that uprisings and revolutions come 
in waves. We see that it's always really  
hard to put together what exactly causes these 
clusters to emerge. But we do see these clusters,  
and I think media is a big part of how this 
happens. In 1848, we see a cluster of uprisings.  
I think what happens in the 2010s is the process 
of media reproduction accelerates to such an  
extent that it's not like a guy on a horse that's 
bringing a newspaper from one country to another  
country in Europe that expand... Oh, my God, 
look what they've done in France. You can see  
three seconds later how this person responded 
to a tear gas canister arriving at their feet. 
This is something that I experienced. Strangely, 
this arrived in my life in a weird way when I was  
working in Sao Paulo in 2013, this constant and 
immediate back and forth between protesters in  
Brazil and in Gezi Park in Istanbul. I think that 
this inspiration has always happened as far as,  
we have records of clusters of revolutions, but 
the acceleration of this process really mattered  
in the 2010s. I think this allowed for people 
to draw inspiration immediately and it also,  
in some ways, allowed for people to copy and paste 
tactics rather than thinking about exactly what  
is the best thing to do in this case. How can 
we build upon the energy and the inspiration  
we're drawing from this case over here?
They often just thought, well, it's just  
the exact same thing. In the case of the Tahrir 
model, this was one that was reproduced not only  
in other countries with very different social and 
economic and political systems, of course. Mubarak  
is different than Barack Obama. You often still 
saw the replication of the Tahrir model after  
the coup that installs Sisi in 2013. You see this 
copying and pasting continuing after the original  
case falls apart. I think that a lot of people 
overstated the importance of social media early  
in the 2010s. There is this narrative that it's 
all about social media, and that's a good thing. 
I think I come down now saying that it's 
partially about social media, and to the  
extent that that's true, it's not really a good 
thing. But that is one change that I think really  
matters. The acceleration of reproduction of 
images and texts through mainstream media,  
through social media that allows for rapid 
inspiration to be taken for better or for worse. 
Well, you saw it after the Cuban Revolution.
Absolutely. 
So, everybody tried to replicate it. And Che is, 
of course, killed in Bolivia, but it doesn't work.  
It doesn't work because the conditions that made 
the Cuban Revolution possible are no longer there,  
largely. Also, they've understood how to fight it.
This is something that matters, is that back in  
the 2010s, some of the more naive commentators 
about the importance of social media, about how  
this is going to lead to transparency, 
forgot that enemies, that bad guys also  
learn how to use tools. They pay attention.
Right. You call them the techno optimists. 
Right. This was a real dominant narrative back in 
the early 2010s. It was Evgeny Morozov that said,  
"Hey, look, bad guys are also trying to learn how 
to use the Internet." In the case of the Cuban  
Revolution, and this, I think, is relevant for May 
68 as well. Some of the participants in May 68,  
when it didn't work that time and other people 
were trying to do it again, they came to the  
conclusion, well, you can only really surprise 
the ruling class once. Once they've seen a very  
specific tactic succeed, usually, if possible, 
they're going to set up a counterattack for  
that. They're going to create defenses for 
something like the Cuban Revolution. So,  
there were waves of Guevara's revolutionary 
attempts afterwards, but it wasn't just the  
leftist that had watched and learned from the 
Cuban Revolution, it was also the dictatorships  
around Latin America and the rest of the world.
Yeah, and you write about this,  
the Jakarta Method-
Yes. 
Your other book, after, what, a million people 
are killed in Indonesia and that cross-pollination  
doesn't only exist among the opposition or the 
revolutionaries but from the ruling elite as well.  
You think that the failure of these mass movements 
is that they didn't implement hierarchical  
discipline and coherent organizational structures 
to defend themselves even when they achieved  
power, in Greece and Honduras. Talk about that, 
because, of course, the ethos of these movements  
was consciously not to be hierarchical, 
not to create that traditional model. 
Yeah, this is something that is explicitly 
believed in by some participants. In many  
other cases, this is just the form of rebellion, 
the form of protest that is possible and easiest  
to carry out given conditions. So, I'm not sure 
if I would say that the failure of the protest  
is that they have this orientation. I would 
say that they have this orientation for real  
material and ideological reasons. In some cases, 
especially in the North African cases, it would  
be very hard to put together even if you... and 
many people did really believe in hierarchical  
revolutionary organizations. Civil society had 
been decimated, for example, in the Egyptian case. 
Regardless of people believed in hierarchy 
or didn't, some didn't, a lot of people did,  
it was just... this was not something that 
was really available. It was hard to put  
together very quickly. In the Brazilian case, for 
example, which is very different, the one that  
I know most closely because I lived through 
the uprising in June 2013, the originators,  
they would never want to be the leaders, but the 
originators, the early organizers, they believed  
deeply in horizontalist principles, absolutely 
no hierarchy, full consensus decision-making,  
no division of labor. There would never 
be any difference between anybody. 
Nobody could be told what to do no matter what. 
What I say is that while some of the participants  
in these movements were horizontalist, a lot of 
them were concretely horizontal. Even if some  
people would've liked to put together the kind 
of organization which would allow for collective  
decision-making or would allow for mediation 
with any existing government or would allow for  
somebody to step into a power vacuum when it was 
created. Most of them just didn't have that. And  
so, this type of protest, this particular approach 
to injustice, this particular way of responding to  
elites or governments that are committing 
abuses comes together in the early 2010s. 
There's a lot of different ingredients in this 
recipe, and I try to trace where they all come  
from, but they all come from somewhere. But 
even the people that put them together largely  
in the anti-globalization movement or the 
alter-globalization movement, people on the  
anti-authoritarian left, didn't put them together 
thinking they were going to overthrow dictators.  
What happens in the 2010s starting, especially 
in Cairo, but starting more specifically in  
Tunisia, is that this particular recipe, this 
apparently leaderless, apparently spontaneous,  
horizontally structured, social media-driven 
mass protest is far, far more successful than  
expected at getting people on the streets.
Far more people come out than anybody had  
even hoped for. This is, on the one hand, a huge 
success and this is a strength because given the  
kind of societies that we're living in, having an 
invitation extended to you that says essentially,  
no matter who you are, no matter what you believe, 
as long as you're with us on this one big thing,  
even in some cases it wasn't even one big 
thing, as long as you're with this movement  
in the streets, you're invited. You can 
participate as an equal with everybody  
else. You don't have to be in any kind of 
an organization. You don't have to have  
thought about this until it's five minutes ago.
This is incredibly effective at allowing people to  
surge into a public square, sometimes stopping 
a society from existing or at least stopping  
the military, in many important cases, from 
supporting a leader who's now been discredited.  
This particular style of protest generates huge 
opportunities, unexpected opportunities. In that  
case, I think this concrete horizontality, this 
lack of hierarchy, whether that's intentional,  
whether or not it's just the state of things, 
is indeed incredibly successful at creating  
opportunities. I think those opportunities 
come in two very broad shapes. Again,  
I'm trying to tell the history of a whole 
decade but every case is very different. 
Often, people like me made the mistake of thinking 
they were all the same. But there's two types of  
opportunities that are made. Either a government 
is sent packing and there's a power vacuum,  
there's no one in power. Or, an existing 
government is so scared of the streets,  
an existing government is so afraid of losing 
power that they're willing to give something. They  
want to offer some kind of a serious concession 
or a deep reform to the street movement. Now,  
at this moment, in the moment of the unexpected 
opportunity, the movement that is very horizontal,  
leaderless, that has no means for making a 
collective decision, easily, at least maybe would  
take... but not in the short amount of time that 
is often provided in these moments of opportunity. 
A protest, it turned out, more specifically a 
protest of this type, of the particular type  
that becomes dominant in the 2010s, turns out 
to be very poorly constituted to entering a  
power vacuum, very poorly constituted to 
taking advantage of an opportunity where  
there's really no government. And then often, 
to the horror of a lot of the organizers,  
turned out not even to be able to elaborate in 
a legible way, to the existing elites in these  
less pronounced cases where the government's 
not fled the country, but they want to give  
the streets something. Brazil is a case like this. 
Brazil, you have a popular central left president. 
Certainly, the original organizers wouldn't 
want her to be overthrown. Ultimately, she is,  
indirectly, perhaps because of the mass protests, 
but she's looking to the streets and saying,  
"Okay, what do you want?" Even in that moment, 
it seems impossible for the streets to come up  
with an answer as to what it is they want. 
This is what a leader really cares about,  
especially a leader that's a real 
bad guy. If there weren't bad guys,  
there'd be no reason for protests in the first 
place. A bad guy wants to know, if I give you A,  
B, C and D, will I get stability again? And 
so, often in that moment, what you want,  
or at least historically what has been the 
decision made, is to ask for A, B, C, D and E. 
Maybe you know that if you don't get D and E, 
that's okay. But if you get A, B and C, you can,  
as a union, would credibly promise to the bad 
guy. If we get these things, we'll go back and  
we'll build back stronger. In these moments 
of opportunity, neither thing seemed possible,  
entering the power vacuum as a protest or 
elaborating a set of demands as a very, very  
horizontally structured protest. In some cases, 
it doesn't go so poorly. But in the cases where it  
does go quite poorly, the very general answer that 
I have as to how they were not exactly failures  
but how they experienced defeats that were 
worse than they ever expected, is that somebody  
else did take advantage of the opportunity.
Well, you are right. The ruling class fills  
the vacuums, but they do it by rebranding 
themselves. This is really Obama, really.  
It comes out of the Chicago political machine, 
probably the dirtiest political machine in the  
country wins Advertising Age's Marketer of the 
Year in 2008. The marketers knew just precisely  
what he had done. He was a marketer's dream. 
I think the lack of a hierarchical structure,  
the lack of well-defined demands, and perhaps 
even the lack of any kind of solid ideological  
foundation made these groups very vulnerable 
to manipulation, which is what happened. 
Yeah. I found them, at least in the cases 
that I analyze, vulnerable to co-optation,  
which is the lighter, the nicest form of the three 
possibilities. Outright hijacking, so not just  
like, we're going to take your message and dilute 
it or water it down. Outright hijacking. Okay,  
you're on the left, we're on the right now.
Where was that? Where would that be an example? 
Hijacking? Brazil would be one case, I think. 
This is a case where the original organizers of  
the protests, they're a group called the MPL, 
the Movimento Passe Livre. They're a group of  
leftists and anarchists. Within one week you 
get a new group of protesters on the streets  
that intentionally copies that acronym. They come 
up with a new group, this is the MBL, and instead  
of being leftists and anarchists, they're a group 
of libertarians and right-wing students that are  
funded by... either have trained with the Koch 
Brothers or have been funded by US think tanks. 
They succeed in tricking quite a lot of people 
into believing that, one, they're the same thing  
as the original protesters, that they're the same 
people, and then, that they're now in a leadership  
position of the next protest wave.
I covered the Fall of Ceausescu,  
and the Securitate managed to do exactly the 
same thing, hijack the entire movement. They  
executed Ceausescu and Elena as fast as 
they could, and they did precisely that. 
Then, in other cases, you have imperialist 
counterattack. In other cases, you have the  
biggest, baddest guy in the neighborhood or 
perhaps in the entire global system. Libya,  
NATO, uses legitimate complaints about 
the Gaddafi government, legitimate citizen  
demands upon their own government as an excuse 
to launch a regime change operation. In Bahrain,  
one of the clearest cases of a country where the 
people are not represented by their government.  
You have a Shia majority and a Sunni minority 
monarchy. In that case, you simply have Saudi  
Arabia and other countries from the Gulf marching 
over the bridge and crushing the uprising. 
This mass of millions of individuals, and this is 
an oversimplification, but at their weakest, they  
were often millions of individuals with millions, 
if not, more ideas as to what the thing was all  
about. It turned out, in many cases, in the 2010s, 
to be vulnerable to co-optation, hijacking or  
imperialist counterattack, and in many cases, 
vulnerable to misrepresentation carried out by  
people like me. Again, I did lots of interviews 
with major participants, people in government,  
people that are experts on these uprisings. A 
lot of the organizers told me that they found  
this particular form, by the end of the decade, 
was particularly vulnerable to misrepresentation. 
One Turkish sociologist, (inaudible 00:23:53), 
in the book, paraphrases Marx's 18th Brumaire,  
those who cannot represent themselves will 
be represented. I think there's an analogous  
situation here in the 2010s where movements that 
cannot speak for themselves will be spoken for.  
For example, in Egypt, a lot of people told 
me that they were shocked to see that global  
media showed up and said that their movement 
was about the opposite demands of what they  
thought it was about. They thought that they 
were, necessarily, a democratic Egypt would  
necessarily challenge Washington's partners 
in their region, Israel and Saudi Arabia. 
Then, you get global media showing up and saying, 
this country wants to join the West. They want to  
be in the minor leagues of America. They want 
to be junior partners of Washington. People  
that put together January 25th and January 28th 
in Egypt often came together through a decade of  
pro-Palestine solidarity and protest against the 
invasion of Iraq. Because there is a concrete mass  
of individuals with no one that can say, actually, 
we're doing this in a way that Martin Luther King  
could do. Again, not everybody that supported 
Martin Luther King in a march was part of some  
hierarchical organization, but by virtue of being 
there, they were often assenting to him to be able  
to speak in some way for the movement.
Because Egypt often didn't have that,  
some of the original organizers were horrified to 
see leaders selected either by CNN or by social  
media. Some post goes viral and now that's the 
person speaking for the movement. Or, global  
media walks around the square and looks for the 
person that's saying what they want to hear. Now,  
our movement that we fought to build over the 
last 10 years is being rendered as its opposite. 
That was true with every movement I covered. 
The international media would come in and  
define it in their terms, which were often... it 
completely ignored the core of the movement or  
the orientation of the movement. They recreated 
the movement. I want to ask about Guy Debord,  
Society of Spectacle, because this is also 
a very pernicious force within the movement,  
the playing to the cameras, the creation 
of spectacle as opposed to organizing. 
Yeah, and I think this is another thing 
that this strange slippage really matters,  
this slippage between a protest into something 
else. Because when you're at the moment of a  
protest... Again, my book is only about cases 
of mass protests that becomes so big that they  
become something else and then, oh, this 
is great for this particular moment. Oh,  
there's a whole new set of rules for which 
we're... there's a game that we're not prepared to  
play. I find that protest itself is always somehow 
a communicative action. It's always somehow a  
media action. That's not to be dismissive of it, 
but protest as a human activity, as a phenomenon,  
historically, emerges alongside mass media.
People didn't do it before mass media existed,  
and you could see why they wouldn't. You wouldn't 
go to the square in the center of a nation.  
Actually, nations didn't exist before mass media 
either, but you wouldn't go to the square in a  
capitol and demonstrate to just the baker that's 
actually working on that corner if no one's going  
to reproduce the images. To the extent that a 
protest is communicative, depending on who you're  
trying to reach, it may be the case that you want 
to somehow perform. It may be the case that you  
want to at least demonstrate what we believe in. 
This is who we are, this is what we believe in. 
Maybe even to some extent, this is the kind of 
way that we want to interact in the world that  
we're wishing to create. But I think this dominant 
form of protest in the 2010s became so hegemonic,  
often even seeming as the only natural way to 
respond to injustice, that sometimes it was  
forgotten that there's a difference between when 
communication is the right action to take and when  
you really need to take away someone's power or 
put someone else in power. In some cases, you had  
protests continuing and there wasn't really anyone 
to protest to, or the protest was continuing even  
when the person you were speaking to agreed with 
you and was saying, okay, well, now what do we do? 
You wouldn't get the mass scaling up of the 
protest that we saw in the 2010s without some  
positive reproduction that happens between some 
vicious or virtuous cycle, depending on how you  
want to interpret it, between media and the thing 
on the ground, social media and traditional media,  
which often work together. If you don't have some 
positive representation outside of the actual one  
part of downtown New York or Central Cairo where 
people can actually see with their own eyes,  
you're not going to get lots of people joining. 
That is usually part of, at least this package,  
is some kind of a performance and some kind of a 
bid to say, we're a good thing. You could join us. 
Now, again, the dark side of this is that if the 
media doesn't think that you are a good thing,  
it's incredibly easy for them to pick one 
person, the stupidest person that shows up,  
or someone that the government has sent in, an 
agent provocateur, and say, "Oh, look. Look at  
this stupid thing this one person's done. That's 
what the movement's really about." Many protesters  
told me this, so I don't want to act as if I'm 
criticizing smugly from the outside because this  
is something that a lot of my interviewees 
told me. "We got caught up in a cycle,  
and it took us a while to realize this, that we 
internalized the kind of stuff that Western media  
wanted to see, and then we did it, and then we 
saw that it worked, and then we did it again." 
It's the kind of cycle that I think is familiar 
to social media users. You figure out what people  
like to hear and then you do it. Then, many of 
them came to the conclusion by the end of the  
decade, well, it turned out that what Western 
media was going to reproduce was going to give  
lots of positive coverage, was not the thing 
that was going to get the concrete results  
from this or that action that we really 
needed to help real people in our country. 
I want to ask about an absence of political 
theory, which I think characterized many  
of the movements, I would even argue the 
Occupy Movement, which I was involved in  
and very supportive of, and how many times they 
retreat into popular culture, V for Vendetta,  
for instance, as reference points.
Yeah. Again, this is something else that  
many of my interviewees told me. Because V for 
Vendetta, for those... I remember, you remember,  
wearing this mask was somehow...
Oh, you'd see it in the protests. 
All the time. This coded US revolutionary in 
some way or another. Then, this group, Anonymous,  
which, again, there was a strange case in Brazil 
where someone just put on the mask in Brazil and  
everyone assumed that they were Anonymous, but 
it turned out it was just a person that was  
in the mask. At the end of the decade, people 
told me that they had, to some extent... Well,  
people told me two things. Three things. I'll 
do three things. We wish that we had organized  
better before the eruption because we never saw 
it coming. But if we had been a little bit more  
organized before it arrived, we would've done 
better in this scrum that we hadn't anticipated. 
Two, we wish that we had just simply read more 
history of revolutions. Every revolution's new.  
You don't want to foreclose the possibilities 
of the future by reproducing the past,  
but things tend to happen. You tend to have a 
counterrevolution. You tend to have a moment  
that is difficult. You tend to have a moment like 
this. A lot people told me that, we wish we had  
spent more time reading history of revolutions.
Well, this was the secret of the Bolsheviks. They  
studied minute by minute, the Paris Commune, 
which lasted a hundred days. Once Lenin and  
Trotsky lasted a hundred days, they considered 
this a huge victory. But I think you're right,  
this was the power, in that they 
were steeped in revolutionary theory. 
Again, you brought up Cuba a few moments 
ago. Che Guevara was waiting for the Bay  
of Pigs before 1959. He was waiting for the US 
counterattack before the victory because he'd  
been in Guatemala in 1954.
Arbenz, yeah. 
Yeah, he knew how things go. He know there's going 
to be a counterattack and he had prepared for it.  
People told me that they wish they had studied 
more revolutionary history, and many people told  
me, and this was quite tragic, that we believed 
in some sense. Many people made these analogies.  
We believed in this Hollywood idea of, okay, the 
bad guy falls and magically, the whole world gets  
better. One guy uses the end of the Lord of 
the Rings when Sauron, I don't even know how  
to pronounce that, I only watched it because he 
told me this, that the evil wizard falls, and then  
across the land, flowers sprout up from the earth.
Or, in the case of V for Vendetta, which I  
watched, if you look at its actual 
political content, not the movie,  
I heard that the graphic novel is much more 
sophisticated, but I'll re-watch the movie because  
that was really dominant. In the decade, you get 
one guy creating clips, essentially viral clips,  
that get all of society ready to rise up, and 
then they just march in a giant mass on the  
capitol. But there's no analysis of, well, then 
what's going to happen? Because the people in the  
Capitol, if they're bad enough, they'll just 
kill all those people. They'll shoot all of  
them. But if they run away, then what is this? 
Who are these men? What are they asking for? 
Again, I think it's very easy now to act as 
if that was a mistake. I think what it is, is  
that it's the type of response that was possible 
and that emerged historically. The reason that  
people sat down with me for this book is because 
they believed that this can be the beginning of  
something bigger and something better, and they 
wanted to learn from the missed opportunities,  
the organizational forms that were lacking. 
Because my starting point for this investigation  
is that this is the decade, as far as we know, who 
knows how to count these things, really, is that  
this was the protest in which... sorry, this was 
the decade in which more people protested than in  
any other previous decade surpassing the '60s.
The desire to change things is there. People  
are willing to take risks. It seems there is a 
real and deep will across the global system to  
change and improve that global system. This 
became apparent very quickly in ways which  
weren't expected and generated opportunities 
and challenges which weren't expected. Yeah,  
some people came to the conclusion that, 
oh, well, yeah, it turned out to be we got  
further than we expected, which meant that there 
were opportunities that we had not planned for. 
I want to read two quotes from your book. One 
is from an Egyptian human rights campaigner,  
Hossam Bahgat, and this is what he tells 
you. Organize, create an organized movement  
and don't be afraid of representation. 
We thought representation was elitism,  
but actually it is the essence of democracy. 
Then, you quote a Ukrainian leftist, Artem Tidva,  
who says, "I used to be more anarchist. Back 
then, everyone wanted to do assembly. Whenever  
there was a protest, always an assembly. But 
I think any revolution with no organized labor  
party will just give more power to economic 
elites who are already very well organized." 
I just want to interject before then, because I 
was in Zuccotti at the beginning, and when they  
had the assemblies, they worked when they were 
small. But by the time they got to 4,000 people,  
it was paralysis. Kropotkin writes about this 
actually, caps the number at 150. Once it becomes  
a mass movement, consensus doesn't work, and I 
think that is one of the points of your book. 
Yeah. I want to go to Hassam's quote quickly 
but, yeah, I think one lesson that had emerged  
already in the 20th Century and some people 
had held onto and some people had forgotten,  
is that whether you like it or not, every group 
of large individuals has a structure of some  
kind. Whether you like it or not, if there's 
enough individuals, if there's enough people,  
especially if there's power to be grabbed, if 
there are resources to be claimed, no matter  
what your inclination is, leaders will emerge. 
There will be some kind of leadership. In a large  
enough group of people, there will be leadership.
The question, going back to these discussions in  
the 20th Century is, not whether or not you can 
get rid of representation forever, not whether  
or not you can get rid of leadership forever, 
because even if you would like to, it seems,  
at least historically, that's never been the case. 
The difference between leaders that you choose,  
leaders that you can remove when they're doing 
a bad job, a structure that you have decided  
on or a structure that is imposed upon you. 
What often happened, and Artem is speaking  
to a phenomenon which was painfully common 
to a lot of these movements in the 2010s. 
Okay, the guy on stage was knocked off the 
stage, but then the people that were in the  
wings just entered, right? I don't know if it 
was him that put this, we effected, essentially,  
a game of musical chairs at the elite level.
That's what happened in Egypt. 
Yes. Yes. I asked everybody the same question. 
I like Hassam's quote because he was very busy.  
Living in Sisi's Egypt right now is not an 
easy thing. The world was crumbling around  
him as he was giving me this interview. 
But he put succinctly and elegantly, what,  
about 200 other people had said. That is 
the condensed, perfectly polished gem of  
wisdom that maybe hundreds of people put to me in 
some other form that... create an organization,  
do organization now. Representation is actually 
how you construct a democracy. It's not something  
that you can avoid, even if you might.
Philosophically, I'm sympathetic to the  
urge to reject it, especially when all of the 
representative structures that we actually have  
either frayed or disappeared or become a farce in 
the last 40 years. It turns out you need it. But  
I absolutely take your point about numbers. 
This is something that the Brazilian group  
discovered. Again, this was an opportunity that 
they had not anticipated. The Brazilian group  
that set off the mass protests that I lived 
through, the Movimento Passe Livre, the MPL,  
this group of leftists and anarchists, they came 
from the anti or alter-globalization movement. 
A lot of them worked for indie media, which I 
remember is a very important part of my childhood  
in covering the Seattle protests in '99 and so 
on. They formed in 2005 and they were explicitly  
horizontalists. Some would say now that they were 
dogmatically horizontalists. But from 2005 to  
2013, this worked pretty well. There was 40, 50, 
60 people at the meetings and, yeah, the meetings  
would last forever. It might be annoying to get 
everybody to come onsite, but it worked. These  
50 or 60 people knew each other well enough that 
they created quite a good plan, really a brilliant  
plan for igniting a popular revolt in June 2013.
But when they do ignite a popular revolt in 2013,  
it doesn't go the way that they expect. 
Different people show up on the streets than  
they expected to see. It's not the working class 
that they want to help. It's often center, right,  
middle class, more privileged Brazilians 
that come out to the streets. And then,  
a really strange moment confronts them when 
Brazilians that are inspired by what they've done,  
want to join the group. They're inundated with 
recruits. They weren't trying to recruit anybody,  
but there's all these Brazilians that show up 
and say, "We want to join the Free Fare Movement.  
We want to be part of your organization."
But they don't know what to do, because if you're  
a group of 40 committed activists that know each 
other and work out everything through consensus,  
and you let in a thousand people, now the movement 
is just whatever those thousand people think it  
is. However, if you create a training program, 
something that the civil rights organizations  
of the '50s and '60s, (inaudible 00:40:11) 
Martin Luther King would've certainly done,  
that to them was a betrayal of their 
horizontalist principles. Somebody said, well,  
that's a Leninist deviation. We can't do that.
We can't create the original organizers and the  
new people that we're training, so they didn't 
know what to do. It exploded the movement.  
They essentially just went away. They stopped 
organizing protests and eventually were torn apart  
by not only internal divisions, but by the revolt 
that they intentionally caused. But, yeah, it was  
that question of rapid scaling up in numbers that 
really called the bluff on their horizontalism  
because it worked when there was just them. But 
when everybody else wanted to join, actually,  
they didn't agree with those people, and they 
didn't want to let them overtake the movement. 
You make, I think, a very important point. You 
write, the disciplined political organizations  
are not in... I'm paraphrasing, in and of 
themselves, sufficient as Greece's left-wing,  
the Syriza government proved. If the leadership 
of an anti-establishment party is not willing  
to break free from the existing power 
structure, this was the curse of Greece,  
they will be co-opted or crushed when their 
demands are rejected by the reigning centers of  
power. I thought that was a very important point.
Yeah, I think so. Again, this is a very difficult  
game. A lot of the lessons that emerged through 
these conversations in my book are not easy.  
They're easier said than done. One thing that I 
try to avoid in this book is the idea, which was  
dominant sometimes in the 2010s, that there's one 
weird trick for a revolution. There's one perfect  
riot that you can carry out, and then that's it. 
But even when there are structured organizations,  
even when there are real movements that can 
act collectively, they need to be always  
in dialogue with the less organized masses.
Even in the most structured, disciplined...  
if you want to accept the narrative of 
the most clean revolutions of all time,  
because none of them are clean, they still rely 
on the support of lots of people that are not in  
these types of organizations. The organizations, 
something like Martin Luther King's organization,  
or the Cuban revolutionaries, there's not that 
many of them, but when they march in Havana, if  
the people of Havana attacked them, then it wasn't 
going to happen. That's not a revolution, right?  
You've won a battle against the military, and 
then you're not going to take over the government. 
The organized group needs to always be in 
close contact with the people that have  
other things going on in their lives, 
because normal people are always going  
to have other things going on in their lives, 
but also needs to be very aware of the elites,  
the pre-existing system that they're going after. 
What are the interests of these people? How can  
you act upon them? How can you really seek to 
transform the society that you're up against? 
Well, the tragedy of Syriza, and I think this 
is the point you make, is that they ended up  
replicating the programs of the people they 
were fighting against in order to survive as an  
entity rather than, essentially, turning on those 
power structures with full-throttled rejection. 
That's a familiar story, right, throughout 
politics is, if the dominant system is too  
strong, then the easy move often is to 
reproduce what already exists rather than  
to seek to fundamentally transform it. 
This is especially true, which I think  
is very relevant for many cases in the book, 
Greece included, and which is why I... well,  
the reason I concentrate on cases outside the 
United States is because most of the protests  
that actually get big enough to qualify for my own 
criteria are outside the United States. But this  
is something that is easier to forget as a citizen 
of the US that if you're not in the United States,  
there's always bigger, more powerful countries 
around that are limiting the range of movement. 
For a country like Greece, obviously, it was 
very famous in constant fights with Germany.  
But in the cases of North African countries, 
Egypt, Libya, your range of movement is limited  
by regional power structures than the global 
system. Again, it's a horrible, cruel reality  
and you can't just wish it away. But the better 
you understand the range of movement that is  
possible, the better you'll be able to plan for.
I want to ask, this is a point in your book that  
the Iranian-American sociologist, Asef Bayat, 
makes. He lived through the Iranian Revolution,  
the 2011 uprising in Egypt, and he distinguishes 
between what he calls subjective and objective  
conditions for the Arab Spring uprisings, and 
argues that the protesters may have opposed  
neoliberal policies, but they were also 
shaped by neoliberal subjectivity. Explain. 
Yeah. This is a really interesting point 
that several thinkers in different parts  
of the world come around to, across. There's 
similar trajectories, the Turkish thinkers,  
Iranian thinkers, thinkers in the Arab world. 
Rodrigo Nunes, this Brazilian philosopher,  
that come into conclusion that not only were 
a lot of these movements aimed at neoliberal  
economic structures, aimed at a particular set 
of societal conditions that were opposed on them,  
often from above, with the help of multinational 
organizations like the IMF and the World Bank,  
these were also people that had been 
living in neoliberal societies for decades. 
What this meant at the subjective level is 
living in a society which exhorts everyone,  
calls upon all of us to think of ourselves as 
individuals first, to think of ourselves in the  
extreme case as one man or one-woman businesses 
operating in a market rather than part of a real  
collective struggle. Often, what you get in 
certain moments is people make the move to  
brand themselves on social media rather than 
to take part in some collective struggle. We  
are so individualized, these various thinkers 
would affirm, that it became impossible to  
even imagine what it really takes to act 
collectively and overthrow a government. 
I think it's correct. You say 
that, essentially, that imbibing  
that belief system is de-radicalizing the 
movement. It may speak in radical terms,  
but the way it responds to power is shaped by 
the wider society and by neoliberal ideologies. 
This is something, as you just quoted, Artem 
said, the ruling class is always organized.  
They're always in concert. This is something 
that Adam Smith understood back hundreds of  
years ago. The ruling class is always organized. 
The more individualized to the society the people  
below are, the more limited they're going to be in 
taking effective collective action. A society in  
which everybody... and social media both, I think, 
reflects and incentivizes this type of behavior,  
to think of myself as a brand, as an individual 
firm, that is always trying to find my place in  
the marketplace rather than acting collectively.
Asef Bayat points to the differences between the  
types of demands that were made in the 
2010s versus the types of revolution,  
the revolutionary horizon that would've been 
obvious to most people in the global south,  
in the second half of the 20th Century, which was 
a collective transformation of the economy along  
more equal lines, if not socialist or communist 
lines, a collective transformation of society.  
The demands that tended to be elaborated in the 
2010s, alongside other more traditional demands  
were often more formal. Often the things that 
rose to the top were things like anti-corruption,  
things that everyone can agree on, things that are 
more purely political or even symbolic demands. 
I forget who put (inaudible 00:48:13) this to 
me. If you are making two types of demands on  
elites and one type of demand is going to take 
away their money and privileges and the other  
type of demand is purely symbolic or cultural, 
you're going to get the symbolic or cultural one. 
I want to read, to close, a quote from your book 
and have you comment. You say the horizontally  
structured, digitally coordinated, leaderless 
mass movement is fundamentally illegible. You  
cannot gaze upon it or ask it questions or come up 
with a coherent interpretation based on evidence.  
You can assemble facts, absolutely, millions 
of them. You are just not going to be able  
to use them to construct an authoritative 
reading. This means that the significance  
of these events will be imposed upon them from 
the outside. In order to understand what might  
happen after any given protest explosion, 
you must not only pay attention to who is  
waiting in the wings to fill a power vacuum.
You have to pay attention to who has the power  
to define the uprising itself. I think that's the 
heart of your argument and I think you strike at  
the core of why these movements failed.
Yeah. I was in the strange position of  
being called upon to do the second thing. I 
remember, and this was a very strange experience,  
not only because people like me had no business 
trying to define this, I think fundamentally  
illegible explosion on the streets of Brazil. 
But what we were doing essentially was going out  
and trying to ask as many people as possible, 
what are you here for? What are you here for?  
What are you here for? What I found, because I 
knew the other foreign correspondents in Brazil,  
is that we all came back with a narrative 
that suited our pre-existing ideological  
biases. I don't think we did this on purpose.
We saw something that made sense, that fit,  
that complemented the structures already 
existing in our brain. The president,  
at the time, I found out... the story came to me 
later. She also was trying to figure out what the  
streets were asking for. And so, she sat in her 
presidential palace, as Dilma Rousseff in 2013,  
with the television on watching media coverage 
of the protest and just reading the signs. She  
turned off the volume because she didn't want 
to be influenced by the journalists that were  
coming up with their own interpretations. She's 
trying to figure out what this really is all  
about. This is a strange and absurd scenario, 
right? Because she wants to help the protest. 
She was tortured by the US-backed dictatorship. 
She believes in street action. She believes in  
dissident pressure on governments, but yet 
she cannot gaze upon this thing and come up  
with an answer. She's limited because she 
can't walk the crowds like I can. She's  
limited to what the cameras are showing 
her. The cameras of often oligarch-owned,  
right-leaning media in Brazil. Now, 10 years 
later, there are directly contradictory  
narratives about what June 2013 was that you 
will hear. The (inaudible 00:51:21) Movement,  
the defenders of extreme right president, Jair 
Bolsonaro, will tell you, "Well, that's where we  
were born. That's when our movement came together.
That's when we realized that we could take the  
streets and we could take power." Then, the 
anti-authoritarian left will say, "June 2013 was  
about the people standing up for better social 
services. It was about progressive values and  
about an opposition to police brutality." Some 
members of the Workers' Party will say, "Well,  
this was the beginning of a parliamentary coup 
that had support from outside of Brazil." These  
three very contradictory narratives, I think 
they're all correct. You cannot look upon June  
2013, and no one has, there is no authoritative 
reading. There's so many things were happening. 
Different things were happening from one 
day to night, from city to city, it was  
so entirely different that you were able to 
construct so many different narratives. Again,  
in a situation where various narratives can 
be constructed with existing facts, it is the  
actors with the biggest microphones that win. The 
actors with the biggest microphones in the case  
of Brazil were these oligarch-owned, center 
to right-wing outlets. Then, when there is a  
vacuum that cannot be filled, it is the people who 
are already either organized or have quite a lot  
of power or the ability to act quickly, because 
acting quickly is important in these moments of  
revolutionary opportunity to take advantage of it.
And so, that might be national elites, as it was  
in the case of Brazil, sometimes with foreign 
backing, or it might be in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia,  
marching over the bridge and crushing an uprising.
Well, this is what makes a figure like Lenin. I'm  
actually not a fan of Lenin, particularly pretty 
immoral, but brilliant in terms of being able to  
read quickly what was happening around, because 
the Bolsheviks were a tiny minority, actually.  
But I think it buttresses your point, that 
without being steeped in revolutionary area and  
political theory and without having a highly 
disciplined and structured organization,  
and I would add a figure like Lenin, who 
is able to read quickly because the October  
Revolution would've never happened without Lenin.
Even Trotsky dragged his feet, Stalin didn't want  
it, et cetera. That combination, I 
think, we've seen throughout history  
is key in order to make these popular 
movements successful. Would you agree? 
Yeah. Certain things that come out of that, 
Lenin doesn't invent, but he crystallizes in  
some of the works that become famously associated 
with him, were simply common sense at the time. I  
think they turned out to be common sense in 2010s. 
They get called Leninism because there was a state  
that put forward him as the man that came up with 
these ideas. But one of those is that there is no  
revolutionary movement without a revolutionary 
theory. One of the things that you can read  
in What is to Be Done?, and this is something, 
again, that 50 people told me in the course of  
my interviews, but they used different words, of 
course, is that a purely spontaneous uprising will  
simply reproduce the society that already exists.
Because the ruling class would not be the ruling  
class if they did not have the means at their 
disposal to get out their message and to assert  
their power. If literally everybody comes to the 
streets, now, you just have the existing society,  
but everyone's outside instead of inside. Your 
question points to the importance of, I think,  
what would be called in that literature, some kind 
of a revolutionary theory. Because if you just ask  
everybody, "Hey, aren't you mad about things?" The 
answer is always yes. What are you mad about? Now,  
you're going to get more answers. Now, what 
to do about it? Now you have a real problem. 
These are two points that were made very famously 
by him, but a lot of other people put to me,  
and these were people that also very often would 
not... Not all the movements that I look at in the  
book are even left-wing, some of the movements 
I think would be more properly characterized as  
right or center. A lot of people that hate Lenin 
put to me some version of these two points in  
contemporary language. There is no revolutionary 
movement without a revolutionary theory,  
and a purely spontaneous uprising will 
simply reproduce the existing society. 
But it's also that deafness, being able to 
read all power to the Soviets, which resonated,  
especially in the industrial sector in Russia. 
But what it really meant was all power to the  
Bolsheviks.
Ultimately. 
He destroyed the Soviets. That's why we don't 
have any anarchist history of revolution because  
he lined them up against the wall and shot 
them. But I think the points you make are key,  
and I think that your dissection of the failure of 
the movements, I think you completely nailed it. 
Oh, well, thank you very much.
It's a very important book. 
Thank you very much. I tried to, as I said, write 
a work of history so, looking backward on this,  
we are limited to the things that have 
happened so far. Maybe in the future,  
things can go very, very differently. 
It's, I think, one of the driving hopes,  
but I'm grateful that these people were 
willing to sit down with me and make it  
possible to try to tell this global story which-
Well, it was important because they were involved  
and then they went back and were self-critical, 
and were quite upfront with you about where they  
had been mistaken and that things had gone wrong.
Some of these people, almost all of them,  
incredibly smart and brave people, had spent 
10 years polishing those perfect gems of wisdom  
that I'm allowed to just take and present in 
the book, like Hassam there, as you've just  
quoted. I was very grateful that they allowed me 
to try to give this global vision to the story,  
which I think is hopefully part of understanding 
what happened and what can happen next. 
Great. That was Vincent Bevins, author of If We 
Burn: The Mass Protest Decade and The Missing  
Revolution. I want to thank The Real News Network 
and its production team, Cameron Granadino,  
Adam Coley, David Hebden, and Kayla Rivara.
