in 1972
british cybernetician stafford beer
published the first edition of brain of
the firm
in it beer recounts conversation he had
with chilean finance minister
fernando flores at the time chile was in
a state of great turmoil
and flores and beer were attempting to
completely redesign the country's
political and economic structures
such a complicated process flores argued
would require a kind of manual which
laid out the important principles of
this new government in a way that would
be easy for the general public to
understand
beer eventually settled on five
statements these would be the keys to
building a cybernetic government
he then further simplified these ideas
even going so far to draw cartoons to
help make the principles more accessible
the five statements were what the
government is the people's help
two to help means to help now
three the road to help has signposts
four help is a name and a face
five the future starts today
one of beer's most famous contributions
to cybernetics and the management of
organizations
is the viable system model the viable
system model
encapsulates beer's five principles for
the people toward good government
and could potentially function as a
guide for the construction
of more just and emancipated social
structures
and workplaces the building blocks for a
better future

a system is simply a collection of
interacting parts that come together to
make a larger hole
a cell is an example of a system as is a
human being
a factory an economy or a government
the viable system model stands in
contrast to many
modern human-made systems it attempts to
remove the rigid
hierarchical structures of top-down
decision-making without falling victim
to the disarray
of complete decentralization to beer the
top-down approach of say
a governmental hierarchy is as
unintuitive
as it is inefficient the chain of
command
often winds up becoming lesser way of
understanding the actual functioning of
a system and more a roadmap for who gets
blamed for what
b recognized that hierarchy obstructs
productivity and freedom so he created
the viable systems model in part
to model a system that balanced autonomy
with cohesion
the viable system must be viewed as
three main parts
interacting with each other operations
meta system
and environment operations carry out all
the basic work of the system
the meta system ensures the cooperation
integration and forward planning of the
entire system
and the environment is simply the
external conditions the system
as a whole operates within the viable
system can be broken down into five
internal systems that carry out the
various functions the system requires to
operate
to help us understand the system let us
use the human body as an example
of a viable system but as we go through
the structure of the viable systems
model
keep in mind that these structures can
be applied to
everything from a business to a
political party
first there is system one in a body
system one would consist of the limbs
internal and sensory organs of the
individual
the lungs heart and eyes would all be
part of system one
these systems bsas all operate
essentially autonomously and directly
monitor and engage with the environment
for example when walking up a steep hill
the heart will respond to the difficulty
of the climb
by beating faster without direct
intervention
system 2 is a cybernetic spine it is a
system of communication
stability and conflict resolution it
facilitates communication between
various aspects of system 1
as well as transmitting data deemed
important and necessary
upwards to system 3. system 3
is comparable to the medulla cerebellum
and ponds of the brain
it maintains the operation of each
system within system 1 as well as their
interactions
because it is able to view the organism
in its totality
system 3 is uniquely qualified to help
in the coordination of the day-to-day
management
of all operations to maintain autonomy
system 3 only receives data deemed
necessary
for macroscopic management all other
management
is devolved to the systems inside of
system one
importantly system three is also
responsible for filtering
all data upwards towards management
systems four and five are different to
those already mentioned
they exist outside of the day-to-day
operations of system one two and three
they play more of a managerial role
system four is the all-important link
between autonomy and control
it is akin to the diencephalon basal
ganglia
and third ventricle of the brain like
system 1
system 4 directly monitors the external
environment
and creates plans for the future of the
organism
it sends this information to system 3
which then sends the appropriate
information to the relevant operations
centers
of system 1. system 4 is crucially not
directly dictating policy to systems 3
however
while standards must be held to if the
system as a whole
is to continue to function smoothly they
maintain that system 3 and 4 are
partners in an ongoing conversation
not bosses and subordinates in a typical
sense
system 4 also receives and sends
information
to the final system system five
this is the top of the system the
cerebral cortex
system five maintains the identity of
the organism
and sets policy for the system to work
toward
it also resolves conflicts between
system 3 and 4.
importantly beer also designed a mode of
communication
in the viable systems model called an
algebraic signal
literally pain pleasure the aldogenic
signal makes it possible
for any component part of system 1 to
immediately communicate
vertically to systems 3 4 and 5
without any of the lag that would come
with traditional
hierarchical structures think of this
like burning your hand on a stovetop
the algodonic signal to the brain causes
us to flinch
and quickly move our hand but also to
turn the heat down so it doesn't happen
again
finally it is crucial to note that the
viable system model
is fully recursive in its structure each
subset
of system one is organized along the
same principles
as the system as a whole meaning each
firm workplace
or team winds up having the same
democratic structure
as the greater economy in biological
terms we can see
that the heart is made up of a multitude
of individual cells
to beer these cells all operate in a
similar fashion
to the human body system as a whole
these levels of recursion
make it easy for any single entity in
the system
to relate to and understand the
structure of any other part of the
system
because the rules are all the same
inside every system
we find many other smaller systems all
following the same principles
and operating along the same lines
hopefully
it is easy to see how the viable system
model could be used to organize any
number of systems
to beer the system that works best is a
system that operates almost
entirely autonomously and only sends
information vertically when it must
for example in beer's estimation system
one
the factory floor is best left to
organize itself
along democratic non-hierarchical lines
the only time a business should have to
send for help from higher management
is when there is a problem essentially
the workers should organize themselves
to boost productivity and create new
less exploitative social relations
it is easy to see how this balance of
freedom and responsible management was
attractive
salvador meyende the former socialist
president of chile when he was
attempting his restructuring
of the chilean economy and its
government allende
wanted to build a society that allowed
for maximum social liberty
but he also wanted to bolster the
economy and end
chile's dependency on exploitative
entities
the ideas behind beer cybernetics are
central to a brighter future
one free of the limits of not only the
market form
but of the bureaucratic failings of
authoritarian
hierarchies capitalist markets rely on
exploitation
coercion and brutality they cannot be
expected to correct their errors before
environmental and social degradation
lead to collapse as we look to build
organizations that connect us house real
power to take control of our collective
future
we must create viable systems that do
not simply recreate the failings we
claim to be moving beyond
a better future is not only possible it
is entirely necessary you
