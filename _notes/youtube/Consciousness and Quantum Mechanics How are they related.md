Transcript:
(00:00) Physicists have debated the role of consciousness  in quantum mechanics for more than 100 years.   Some podcast episodes will soon reach that length,  but I have a dentist appointment in 2 hours,   so we’ll have to wrap it up a little more quickly.  Why did some physicists like von Neumann and   Wigner think that consciousness is necessary  to make sense of quantum mechanics, and can   consciousness influence the outcome of a quantum  experiment? That’s what we’ll talk about today. 
(00:34) In quantum mechanics, everything is described  by a wave-function. There’s for example a   wave-function for a particle going left, and  one for a particle going right which sounds   about as exciting as you expect physics to  be. But the weird bit is that there’s also   a wave-function for a particle that goes both  left and right. This is called a superposition. 
(00:56) According to the standard interpretation  of quantum mechanics such a superposition   means that the particle is indeed neither left nor  right, but both, until you make a measurement. The   moment you measure the particle, you know whether  it went left or right, and the wave-function   “collapses” to one that fits to your observation. Albert Einstein didn’t like this at all.
(01:21) Yes,   that guy again. Einstein said, this collapse  happens faster than light, that’s a “spooky   action at a distance”, so it has to be wrong.  But Bohr said, there’s nothing wrong with that,   because the wave-function isn’t real. It just  describes what we know. And you can update   knowledge faster than the speed of light.
(01:45) John  Bell used the following example: “When the Queen   dies in London, the Prince of Wales becomes  instantaneously king.” No matter where he is.  So why wasn’t the speed of light limit broken  when the queen died? Because we can update our   knowledge about what happened elsewhere  without causing any event elsewhere. And   this is how Bohr thought about the collapse of the  wave-function.
(02:08) You can update it instantaneously   because it just describes what we know. Einstein wasn’t convinced, but Bohr won   the argument. So, if you believe Bohr, then  the wave-function has something to do with   knowing. But who or what knows? Well, the  observer does. By this logic, the update   of the wave-function becomes linked to the thing  that can know something, which is the human brain. 
(02:32) Bohr didn’t actually explain what this all means.  He was quite content with being incomprehensible,   and a lot of physicists have since followed  his example. But Eugene Wigner was bothered. He   thought the idea that the wave-function describes  knowledge has a big problem. To illustrate this,   he came up with what is now called  the “Wigner’s friend experiment”. 
(02:55) He said, suppose you have created a particle in  a superposition of left and right and you measure   it. But you’re inside a laboratory and have a  friend waiting outside, in front of the closed   door, because that’s how physicists treat their  friends. Your friend doesn’t know the outcome of   the measurement until you open the door to tell  her what you measured.
(03:18) Wigner said that for her,   you are in a superposition of having  measured the particle left and right,   until she collapses your wavefunction. He then  argued that it would be “absurd” if consciousness   was in a superposition. And since no one knew  just what caused a wave-function to collapse,   he postulated that it was consciousness.
(03:43) Most physicists think today that a measurement is   an interaction with some apparatus. It has nothing  to do with whether you or someone else looks at   the result, or whether you tell someone about  it. But in the early days of quantum mechanics,   it was unclear what the mathematics means. A similar interpretation of quantum mechanics   as Wigner’s had been put forward earlier by John  von Neumann.
(04:05) Despite the German-sounding name,   von Neumann was Hungarian, like Eugene Wigner.  Both later emigrated to the United States.  Von Neumann’s argument was that a particle  in a superposition can cause superpositions   of the things it interacts with. This leads to  superpositions of entire measurement apparatus,   and everything that follows from that.
(04:30) Say,  you use the measurement outcome to decide   whether to blow up a bomb or not, then get a  superposition of superposition of a bomb that’s   blown up and one that didn’t. And that leads to  a superposition of a world in which you died and   one in which you didn’t. And a superposition  of worlds in which you go on to win the Nobel   Prize and one in which you didn’t, and so on.
(04:54) Von Neuman said that this chain of events   needs to be cut somehow, and since everything in  physics seemed to keep the superpositions alive,   he thought the collapse had to be caused by  something “extra-physical” or “psychophysical”. It   had to be the conscious perception of an observer.  The observer either sees a bomb explode or not.   That’s the end of that chain of superpositions,  and maybe also the end of the observer. 
(05:21) This idea of Wigner and von Neumann that  consciousness causes the collapse of the   wave-function is an interpretation  of quantum mechanics rather than a   new theory because mathematically it doesn’t  make any difference. That’s because the only   observations we can make any statements about  are those which were eventually registered in   our brain.
(05:48) Though you might argue that really  there’s only one brain which is your own and   everything else is your imagination,  in which case, thanks for imagining me.  The Wigner von Neumann interpretation has problems  because all interpretations of quantum mechanics   have problems. Reinterpreting maths just pushes  problems around like bumps under the carpet. In   the Wigner von Neumann interpretation the problems  manifest themselves as conscious observers who   have inconsistent knowledge about reality.
(06:18) If  you take this seriously it would imply that   reality itself depends on who’s observing what.  I talked about this in an earlier video, but   today I want to focus on the consciousness issue. The interpretation from Wigner and von Neumann is   weird but not wrong. Still, it never became  widely accepted. I believe the major reason   it’s never been popular with physicists  is that it’s unnecessarily complicated.  
(06:43) No one knows what consciousness is anyway  and if you want to calculate the outcome   of a measurement in quantum mechanics you  don’t need to know. So introducing some   psychophysical factors to induce the collapse of  the wave-function is just unnecessary word salad.  Philosophers dislike this interpretation for a  different reason, namely because it’s internally   inconsistent.
(07:11) You start with assuming that  consciousness is not subject to the same   laws of nature as everything else because it’s  “extra-physical”. But then consciousness interacts   with the physical world and that means it’s itself  physical because you can test its effects on our   observations. It’s the same problem as dualism.
(07:31) If  the mind is non-physical, then it doesn’t help you   explain observations in the physical world  – you can’t have your cake and eat it too.  But there are still people working on  it. For example, just a few months ago,   David Chalmers and Kelvin MacQueen wrote a  paper about this. They proposed to address   the issues of the Wigner von Neuman  interpretation by using a particular   mathematical model for consciousness, that is  integrated information theory, IIT for short. 
(07:59) We briefly talked about IIT in an earlier  video. The basic idea is that each system   is assigned a quantity, big Psi, that you can  calculate from how well-connected the system is,   and how it processes information. The bigger Psi,  the more conscious the system. In this theory,   consciousness it’s not binary, it’s not on or off,  it’s gradual.
(08:25) This is why Christof Koch, one of   the proponents of Integrated Information Theory,  thinks it’s a panpsychist theory. Everything is   a little bit conscious, it’s just that humans are  a little bit more conscious than carrots. I want   to apologize to all carrots who are watching. In their new paper, Chalmers and MacQueen use   IIT to build a model for wave-function collapse  that is induced by systems which are “sufficiently   conscious” in this quantifiable sense.
(08:56) This is no  longer an interpretation of quantum mechanics but   a modification, and it leads to predictions  that differ from those of quantum mechanics.   For example, they propose that some states  that a quantum computer could generate might   be “sufficiently conscious” and thus induce a  collapse, though the details depend on the model.  For a paper by two philosophers it isn’t bad.
(09:19)   My major misgiving about their consciousness   induced collapse model is that it’s  unnecessarily complicated. If you’re   building a model in which collapse is induced  by a macroscopic thing, why use a brain. Why not   use the measurement device? Or cheese. I would  like to propose that it’s really cheese that   collapses the wave-function. Prove me wrong.
(09:41) Okay, so here we have people thinking that   it’s somehow the amount of consciousness in  a system that induces collapse, which is kind   of weird already. But there are also people  who think that deliberately focused attention   actually influences *how* a system collapses. This idea was also brought up by Wigner, though   I think it wasn’t his intention.
(10:05) In 1967, Wigner  published a very influential essay titled “remarks   on the mind-body problem” in which he wrote  “we do not know of any phenomenon in which one   subject is influenced by another without exerting  an influence thereupon.” It’s not a big step from   there to conclude that if conscious knowledge  can be influenced by the result of a quantum   experiment, then your conscious knowledge can  also influence the result of a quantum experiment. 
(10:28) Now add to this that back then scientists were  still experimenting with telepathy. Some of them   were also studying if concentrating on the  outcome of a random number generator would   change the outcome. It was just a small step  from there to the idea that if you focus your   attention on photons going through a double  slit that affects the pattern on the screen. 
(10:53) I’m not making this up, this is literally  how those experiments work. There have been   a few of them since the 1990s. The most  recent one was published in 2012. The idea   is that when a conscious being concentrates  on the light passing through a double slit,   then that has a similar effect as if you had  measured which slit the light went through,   so the interference pattern should change.
(11:22) The authors describes their experiment as   follows “It was explained to the participants  that they could try to mentally “see” or imagine   which of the two slits the photons were  passing through, to “become one with” the   optical system in a contemplative way, to  mentally block one of the two slits, or to   mentally “bend” the laser beam so as to cause  it to pass through one slit rather than both.
(11:45) ”  They then statistically analyse the difference  in the interference pattern between the cases   where the participants were told to concentrate  on the double slit and not. The authors claim to   see a statistically significant difference.  Their analysis method was later criticized   by another group which argued that the  method of analysis is unreliable and the   results can’t be trusted. Similar criticisms  have been raised about earlier experiments. 
(12:15) How difficult can it be you may ask, to figure  out whether the pattern of a double slit changed?   Well, the issue is that the common illustration  with multiple stripes for the unobserved double   slit and two thick bands for the observed one  is so misleading I can only call it wrong. It’s   because a single slit also makes an interference  pattern, it just looks slightly different from   that of a double slit.
(12:46) So if you don’t expect  your conscious observes to affect really each   photon it can actually be difficult to tell  the difference. There’d be easier examples   to look at but maybe they didn’t want that. In any case the brief summary is that the results   of experiments that claimed to find an influence  of conscious thought on the outcome of quantum   experiments have remained highly controversial  and have not been reproduced.
(13:08) In addition,   the idea that your conscious attention somehow  influences what a wave-function collapses into   doesn’t make sense. Wigner was right in saying  that in physics, if one thing can affect another,   then that influence can go both ways. But that  doesn’t mean that the influence is equally   relevant in both directions. If it rains, you’ll  get wet.
(13:33) If you swear at the sky in response,   then the pressure waves coming out of your  mouth move some air molecules. So they indeed   influence the rain. But for all practical  purposes it doesn’t make any difference.  And your brain indeed has a physical influence on  its environment. That’s because thinking generates   electric and magnetic fields. But they’re too weak  to collapse the light going through a double slit. 
(13:56) I believe this is where the idea  of “quantum healing” comes from,   that by focusing your attention you can  somehow influence what processes happen   in your own body. My major problem with  this isn’t even that it’s pseudoscience,   but that it blames patients for being  ill.
(14:17) Hey, if you’re dying from cancer,   that’s your own fault, should have learned  more quantum mechanics when you still could.  Finally let me add a brief comment about Roger  Penrose and Stuart Hamaroff, who are maybe   most famous for claiming that consciousness  has something to do with quantum mechanics.   Their argument however is a completely  different one.
(14:37) It’s that the collapse   of the wave-function leads to consciousness,  not that consciousness leads to the collapse.  They have this idea that in the human brain there  are certain large molecules, the microtubules,   that can form coherent quantum states, and  their collapse is relevant for consciousness.   There are several problems with this.
(15:03) First of  all you wouldn’t expect such large molecules   to remain in quantum superpositions for a  sufficiently long time in the human brain. Second,   all cells have microtubules, so how come  my liver isn’t also conscious? And third,   what’s this whole microtubule business  got to do with consciousness anyway?   By the way, in my book “Existential Physics” I  have an interview with Roger Penrose about this. 
(15:24) So, in summary. A) That consciousness causes  the collapse of the wave-function is a possible   interpretation of the mathematics,  but it’s as problematic as all other   interpretations of quantum mechanics. B) One  can formulate a collapse model based on this   idea which is a testable modification of  quantum mechanics.
(15:45) But in all honesty,   I think if they test it, they’ll just  rule it out. C) The idea that you can   influence the collapse of the wave-function  by thinking is pseudoscience. And D) none   of that is what Penrose and Hamaroff are  on about, which is another story entirely.  Yes, I’ve been talking about quantum  mechanics again! But if you want to   really understand how quantum mechanics works,  then passively watching videos isn’t enough,   you have to actively engage with the subject.  Our sponsor, Brilliant can help you with that 
(16:19) Brilliant offers courses on a large variety of  subjects in science and mathematics. The great   thing about their courses is that they’re all  interactive with visualizations and follow-up   questions, so you can check your understanding  right away. This is why I like to look things   up on Brilliant. It’s fast, it’s easy,  and it tells me what I need to know. 
(16:40) To understand better what I talked about in this  video, check out for example my course about   quantum mechanics. It gives you an introduction  to interference, superpositions and entanglement,   the uncertainty principle, and Bell’s  theorem. It begins from the very basics,   so you don’t need to bring any background  knowledge.
(17:02) And after that, you can continue maybe   with their course on quantum objects, or quantum  computing, or wherever your curiosity drives you.  If you're interested in trying Brilliant out,  use our link Brilliant dot org slash Sabine   and sign up for a free trial where you'll  get to try out everything Brilliant has   to offer for a whole week.
