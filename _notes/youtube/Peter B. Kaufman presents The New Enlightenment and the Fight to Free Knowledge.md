harvard bookstore's friday forum takes
place on friday afternoons during the
academic year as a way to highlight
scholarly books in a wide range of
fields
through virtual events like today's
harvard bookstore continues to bring
authors and their work to our new
digital community
during this challenging time every week
we're hosting events here on zoom and as
always our event schedule appears at

some time for questions
if you have a question at any time
during the talk go to the q a button on
your screen
and we'll get through as many as time
allows if you would like to buy a copy
of the new enlightenment and the fights
of free knowledge there will be a link
in the chat where you can purchase
all sales through this link support
harvard bookstore so thank you
especially during this difficult time
for community spaces
like your local bookstore there will
also be a link for donation in the chat
if you would like to give additional
support to harvard bookstore
your purchases and financial
contributions make this virtual author
series possible and now more than ever
supports the future of a landmark
independent bookstore
thank you so much for tuning in in
support of our authors and the
incredible staff of booksellers at
harvard bookstore
we sincerely appreciate your support now
and always
and finally as you may have experienced
in the virtual gatherings this past
year uh technical issues may arise if
they do we'll do our best to resolve
them as quickly as we can
thank you in advance for your patience
and understanding now i am very pleased
to introduce today's speakers
a writer teacher and documentary
producer peter kaufman works at
mit open learning and knowledge future
groups
previously he served as the associate
director of columbia university's center
for teaching and learning
and as a consultant to the library of
congress congress's national audio
visual
conservation center the largest archive
of moving images
and recorded sound in the world he
currently serves as a member of the
editorial board of the moving image and
also
the editorial advisory board of the
russian library an
initiative based at columbia university
press to bring out more russian
literature into english
he is joined today by peter suber peter
is the director
of the harvard office for scholarly
communication in the harvard library
he is the director of the harvard open
access project
in the berkman client center and senior
researcher at berkman klein
today they are presenting the new
enlightenment and the fight to free
knowledge
today the giant corporations of our age
work to control not only us but our
access to knowledge
these corporations are part of what
peter calls the monster verse
this book maps out the opportunities to
mobilize for the fight ahead of us
with the internet and other means of
media production and distribution at
hand
knowledge institutions like universities
libraries museums and
archives have a special responsibility
now to counter misinformation
disinformation and fake news and
especially efforts to control the free
flow of
information michael scamel says about it
kauffman's brilliant exposition of the
need for an online fifth estate
and his ardent supportive and online
creative commons are both
timely and convincing everyone who draws
on the web for research and intellectual
inspiration
should read this book and on that note
of praise i'll
turn things over to our speakers peter
peter thank you so much for joining us
today
thank you
um shall i go
yeah go for it great thank you um
audrey for such a generous introduction
thank uh
you all uh here today um
for coming out to hear us a special
shout out to
carol horn from the bookstore whom i met
uh
30 years ago literally um
and uh also to peter suber here whose
work has been inspiring me
and others in the zoom i know um for
decades
i'm grateful to have a chance uh to talk
about
my book my first at such a distinguished
venue
the book begins with torture and
ends with a vision of another violent
civil war
there's some gun violence in here
there's some beheadings
tanks rolling over people really
something for everyone
um let me make five points to help
prompt some
discussion first we are in the middle of
maybe just coming down from or maybe who
knows with a new
trump social media network heading up
again into
uh peak information disorder right now
it's an epistemic disorder the health
pandemic that we are
in uh today um it's like nothing we've
ever seen
the economic and jobs crisis we've
plunged into
the unhinged political violence we are
witnessing
in our national and in our state
capitals
are all a function a direct function
result
of the severe information disorder we
find ourselves in today
a result of the fact that lies are
everywhere the big lie
about the election still very much with
us
but also thousands of millions of other
lives big
and little big about covid the vaccine
inequality injustice you you name it
now just over half the people
in the country believe in angels you
know so it's a tough laboratory
we live in we're trying to do something
about this kind of stuff
um just under half the country believes
in evolution
um now you know about that when you look
around sometimes and some of our
political
leaders you know they may have they
they may but anyway more seriously and
egregiously uh we're in
um crisis we have more than half a
million
people dead uh here at home because
they didn't believe in science in part
we've caused so much
damage here and around the world by
circulating and allowing false
information to circulate
that shame should hang on us from now um
to the end of time and you're not born
believing this madness that's like the
main
point you know you're not born believing
that white people
are superior to anybody else you're not
born a trump
voter or any other kind of voter you're
not born an anti-vaxxer
so these ideas they come from somewhere
they start somewhere
and they get propagated um sometimes
endlessly
uh um maybe we can do something about it
the second point is um my book
makes the point that we've seen this
before
the book uh opens
with a guy getting strangled
uh and a guy getting burnt at the stake
in an auto defeat it's the same guy
actually
um because he wanted to share real
knowledge
the book opens in the 16th century
william tyndall
was his name and his thing was to
translate the bible
so people could read it and hear it in
ways that the apparatus of the crown
and the apparatus of the church did not
want it read
did not want it heard worship back then
was a little like television now
but television and newspapers and
magazines and the web
all together uh once a week it was like
listening to our conversation this
presentation whatever today
maybe one or two others and that's all
you had for media representing the
outside world
for the week worship was your media i'd
be here
probably alone back then standing
probably at a pulpit
reading stuff to you uh from the same
book
every week um a book that looked like
you know uh this um
and no other book just the same book
every week
if it were my book that'd be great for
sales
harvard bookstore you know um but
actually
no you couldn't have your own copy of
this book
the bible here you could not buy it you
could not own it
not in the original languages and
especially not in a language like
english that you could understand now
another guy in tyndall's time gets burnt
at the stake
also for having the lord's prayer in
english written on a scrap of paper
in his pocket anyway i'd be here reading
this
giant thing to you but i would be
consistently
systematically lying it would be like
you were watching me but i were
fox news the church was like fox news
back then i would be saying i'd be
reading to you
you have to give money to me otherwise
you won't get to heaven
you have to do this you have to do
penance when the word in the bible
actually was to repent you have to do
that you have to engage
in charity you have to give money to the
church
when the greek word actually meant to
love
for confess which is what the church
said it wanted
this tyndale fellow gave us the simpler
and more personal
and more accurate acknowledge
tindall was a genius ultimately his work
with the bible
gave the english language as many idioms
as shakespeare gave us
he knew seven languages greek latin
hebrew aramaic
he was completely devout when he's in
jail
okay for two years just about he
converts his jailer
and his jailer's family um anyway this
system of lies and and
uh toxic information that uh
he was born into he would have none of
it so he wades through the bible
from genesis 1 through revelation 22
not only owning the thing uh upon pain
of death
not translating the thing upon pain of
death
but printing and distributing it upon
pain of death
and he worked with all the publishing
technologies of his day
connecting personally with book
designers paper suppliers
printers boat captains horsemen
across 16th century europe the youtubes
the twitters
the websites back then uh to bring the
knowledge
and the book that contained it into the
hands of the people
they chased him down and they killed him
for it
anyway that's just the opening that's
just the happy opening
of this book the battle of knowledge
against ignorance
truth versus lies is not new the
problem's
been around for a long time
the third point is we've been let out of
darkness before
the time i like best the time you know i
move into talking about
in chapter two was was the enlightenment
it really has kind of left a mark on us
that time uh newton's
physics montesquieu's laws
linnaeus's taxonomies russo's political
philosophy
the declaration of independence the
declaration of the rights of man
and at the heart of it there was no
greater offering to truth and reason
perhaps
than the 22 million word
encyclopedia that the french
enlightenment philosophers
22 million words
started writing compiling and offering
to the public publishing
in 1750 is amazing not just from a
content
assembly perspective an effort to gather
all the world's knowledge
and to print and publish it but also
from a socio-political one
given the powerful forces that were
suppressing
knowledge and the you know
that would get provoked by such an
action and did
the encyclopedia found the state and the
church banning at one time or
another almost every one of its 72
000 articles 18 000 pages
and 28 volumes and invoking 100 ways
to forbid its distribution
the act of doing this to compile all the
world's knowledge and pack it into one
place that could be published
distributed shared
was mind-blowing but so was what was
inside
the encyclopedia smote all
the 18th century orthodoxies no
proposition can be accepted as divine
revelation they wrote
in the article on reason if it
contradicts what is known to us
either by immediate intuition or by
obvious deductions of reason
it would be ridiculous to give
preference to such revelations
this is in the late 1700s the entry for
fortune
spotlighted the gross inequalities of
wealth
that were already evident in 18th
century europe
in the article on the slave trade they
wrote
and this is the 1750s again mind you the
purchase of negroes to reduce them into
slavery
violates all religion morals
natural law and human rights
but even more the encyclopedia announced
from day one that the giant project
would be as we say today
fact based how
there would be an underlying and
overarching commitment
to the verification of all source
materials
verification is a long and painful
process
dennis diedro wrote in his introduction
to the whole enterprise
the famous preliminary discourse we have
tried as much as possible he said to
avoid this inconvenience by citing
directly
in the body of the articles the authors
on whose evidence we have relied
and by quoting their own text when it is
necessary
what this meant in practice was
revolutionary
there would be no accepted truths but
for those that could be proven
and cited and there's a lesson
for today in there
the way out of it for us today is to
publish
as much as we can that's factual true
and verifiable and this is my fourth
point and this is why it's so good
um to be speaking with peter suber today
verification is a key for us to get out
of this mess
and so is freely publishing
material online deed row's commitment to
reference to citation to verification
continues in the enlightenment's most
important successor project
which is wikipedia founded by jimmy
wales and his colleagues
20 years ago this year it's the
foundation of what today's wikipedia
terms verifiability
and in many ways it's likely to be the
foundation for truth
in knowledge and society today online
verifiability and i'm reading from
wikipedia statement
of principles means that material added
to wikipedia must have been published
previously
by a reliable source editors may not add
their own views to articles
simply because they believe them to be
correct and may not remove
sources views from articles simply
because they disagree with
them verifiability is a necessary
condition
a minimum requirement for the inclusion
of material
though it is not a sufficient condition
it may not be enough
wikipedia of course is one of the
world's most
popular websites it's the world's most
popular
non-commercial one and it's an
irreplaceable source of verifiable
information
open to any and open to all
the internet archive is another and it's
actually working together with wikipedia
now
digitizing books so that links to
sources in wikipedia
link all the way through to the books
themselves and render images and text
on the cited pages so in a wikipedia
article on martin luther king jr for
example
the reference link to a biography of
reverend king
by taylor branch now hot links to the
entire readable book online
that work is essential can we take it
can we take verifiability further now
especially as this crisis this epistemic
crisis deepens
information about vaccines online
literally epoxy on our house now about
elections
same can we improve citation for the
medium that's beginning to overtake us
all
which is video can we make
resources on the web fundamentally
verifiable
what does a citation look like sound
like in
a podcast these are our tech challenges
and they're super important again
why because the use of footnotes
and the research techniques associated
with them as princeton's great historian
anthony grafton writes
makes it possible and i'm quoting from
one of his books
makes it possible to resist the efforts
of modern governments
tyrannical and democratic alike to
conceal the compromises they have made
the deaths they have caused the tortures
they and their allies have inflicted
which takes us back
in a way to where we started
um finally uh and talking about this
uh in cambridge is of course again a
special
pleasure we all have a role to play
in this cambridge boston
is a place rich in universities
museums libraries archives
consider the things that we possibly can
share with one another
the direct objects of what we want to
share the
photograph the image of an
artwork maybe uh from a museum a musical
score a piece of music a manuscript
metadata an artifact a museum wall card
uh a museum catalog sounds and moving
images
property is the term that we use for it
intellectual property more specifically
and you know this last point that i want
to make is that the
the copyright law that first came around
to describe all this stuff
the uh statute of queen anne also came
around
during the enlightenment at the same
time as montesquieu
and rousseau and jefferson were getting
busy and at the same time that isaac
newton
was formulating his laws of motion while
observing apples
while he was at home in his orchard
during a play like this one we're in
in 1665 which shut down the other
cambridge
um just as newton figured out that
apples
fall to the ground ultimately because of
gravity and the laws of motion that he
started writing up
in the early 1700s so the people who
wrote queen anne's law
at the same time and most of the laws
that have followed
recognized that when all is said and
done an
idea a human creation art culture
science also fall by
their nature by nature into the public
domain
there's a physics of intellectual
property which
i talk about in here and that should
give us
some hope uh that that there's a natural
order
to things that the state of nature of
all the things we curate
is ultimately the commons and sometimes
we just have to give it a little push
to get it there so this is a
this is a book about um power
uh as audrey said it's a book about the
monsters
who try to take it away from us
but it's also about the power that we
actually have
and that's the main part of it that's
the last sort of third
of the book we have to be aware
of both of these things the power that's
sitting on top of our
necks if i can go there
um but also the power
that we have and if we're aware of both
of these things
the challenges which
peter subra has been writing and and
talking about and activating communities
about
for years um
we have to re-examine our terms of
service agreements
with the technologies that we use with
the publishers and with the producers we
work with
and especially with others wherever
we are wherever they are we have to
recreate
um some new covenants with
our readers if we're publishers our
visitors if we're museums
um our students our teachers if we're
universities um or other educational
institutions our viewers if we're
public broadcasters or any kind of
broadcasters
we are actors and signatories
de facto and de joure um
in this in this new enlightenment
social contract um that we find
ourselves
working on today but we're also it's
authors
and uh we should all of us um
get to writing when we're um
made aware of all of these pressures
that exist upon us and all of the
opportunities that in fact we have
with the technologies and other powers
at our disposal so um
thank you you know again for the
attention of the time uh today um
and i you know i would love to launch us
into
some discussion um um during this lunch
hour
thank you peter it's an honor for me to
be here
and i thank peter kaufman for that
introduction for his book
and i thank the bookstore for hosting
this event but let me
pause first and say something to the
audience i will get things started by
asking
a question or two to peter but after
that
uh he'll be responding your questions
please post them to the q a panel in
zoom not to the chat
okay and now just to get started uh
peter you cover a lot of territory
and for those on the call who have not
yet read the book let me just mention
some of the topics that it covers
because he didn't mention them all
in his introduction he covers william
tyndale's translation of the bible into
english
he covers dietero's encyclopedia he
covers the literary underground in
eastern europe
during the cold war he covers
educational television
wikipedia the internet archive open
educational resources
and the projects by the growing number
of museums to digitize their art
and share it online in every case in
every one of those areas he finds
what he calls monsters threats to the
projects themselves threats to the
people
behind those projects so here's my
question peter
it seems to me that many of the monsters
you identify in those different topic
areas
have different motives for suppressing
knowledge different motives for
threatening the people behind the
projects different rationales
can you disentangle those can you
distinguish different motives and
rationales and
see what kind of family they form
um i think it would be a great project
to do that kind of thing um
there is a word it's not phylogenesis
but it's some other word for a family
tree
if you go to the museum of natural
history
you can actually see one of the largest
displays of one of those of life
you know the history of life and it
would be
um a
phenomenal exercise to actually um
you know create a
phylogenetic tree of monstrosity
that would um diagram uh
these different branches of people
in different places in different times
with different reasons
who um
have really done their best to just
keep us from
knowledge and from sharing knowledge um
can i disentangle them here that's
that's a tough one
it's a great it's a great exercise um
i just published a piece yesterday
audrey mentioned the knowledge futures
group which is a
um outstanding uh spin-off that
was incubated for a while at mit
uh that that um
hosts a a publishing um
uh platform one of them is pubpub uh
where my book is available
um open access the entire book will be
available
next week uh to read doesn't mean you
shouldn't buy it
way cooler to buy it help harvard help
authors but um
um but in this piece which appeared in
the commonplace which is a
sort of sister um platform to pub pub
pubpub
i talk about these new branches of
information science that could
you know exist maybe
riffing off the physics of intellectual
property
so i imagine like you know what what
would that discipline actually look like
the physics
what could there be a could there be is
there a chemistry
of information could there be a periodic
table
that would be that would uh you know
allow us to understand
certain types of verifiable information
versus other types are they stable are
they isotopes like
um uh i think maybe i've been around too
many people at mit
for too long like a periodic table for
for information um and
a few other branches i go on about but i
i hadn't thought about this one which is
a kind of um
yeah a family tree of monsters
which i'd love to do
but i i don't know that i can i mean
i'll say one more word about it because
it's such a great question like
there are
i mean power and profit are probably the
driving
forces you know um behind a lot of it
um and there are people who want to
remain in
power kings popes
um uh but they're also people
maybe closer to today we're in the
states anyway as far as i remember we
don't have a king
anymore or a um
or a church leader per se um
you know who are motivated maybe by
profit
um and so maybe those are the
maybe those are the like
yeah i don't know i'm trying to design a
tree right now but i can't
by mentioning the possibility of a
family tree
you're suggesting that these different
motives might
be historically related and that's a
very interesting
hypothesis again i'd love to see you try
to work that through
but some of the motives that you seem to
surface in the book
are profit and power some of them are
controlled maybe that's another word for
power
some are political intolerance some are
ideological
certitude some seem to me to be
bureaucratically thick inept regulation
and some seem to be ideological
opposition to regulation
as such and offhand it doesn't look like
all of those are historically related
although they might be causally related
and it just raises the question is there
more than one monster um
rather than one monster verse uh one uh
unified uh enemy of the free circulation
of knowledge
oh um boy you know first of all i'm
going to say i looked
at another great question and i look
forward to turning it back to you to
understand your thoughts about it as a
you know long time professor philosophy
uh
an activist in this area but i i would
say
the monster verse that i speak of is
just a
it's a nifty you know kind of basket um
phrase for all of these
you know i wrote something else uh after
i finished the book
um on open culture where you know i've
been doing a series the
the website open culture which i love
out of stanford um
shout out to my friend dan coleman who
runs it um
where i you know the first piece was
thinking about all of these book series
that have captured the imagination of
children around the world harry potter
the lord of the rings
you know um and there
there always is this kind of heinous
dark
evil that you know
the forces of good are battling against
half our office at mit open learning is
consumed
with star wars you know star wars is the
same
um uh what what a
what a picture what a series uh in
filmic
media um and i think
i think what i'm what i'm trying to get
at is
you know
whatever the monster looks like today
um and sounds like
uh and whatever it does
um it's related to what the monsters
have been doing
you know since uh
i don't know when like they were they
were
they were sacking the library of
alexandria
and ripping out these things and
lighting them
on fire um to uh
you know to heat the baths of the
marauding soldiers that it
that that attack these are these are um
these are the same somehow there's some
common denominator
i don't know uh how best to put it and
you know once again what do you think
uh i don't want to turn the spotlight on
me but in my work for
open knowledge uh i see many obstacles
and it's more useful to address them
in light of their strength than their
historical relations
again when i mentioned that power and
uh profit
may not be historically related i didn't
mean that they're not connected i meant
they're not connected as parent and
child uh power and profit have always
coexisted
uh and they probably reinforce each
other they're probably reciprocal
rather than parent and child and the
obstacles open knowledge faces
uh may be related in exactly that way
but
they take a different form in different
academic disciplines in different
countries and different economics
greater
and it's best to understand their
particularity if you're going to
strategize
around them i don't have a unified
theory of monsters or
of obstacles to free knowledge but i do
think
pluralism helps to take seriously the
actual obstacles
you faced but i don't want to take too
much of the floor
but let me follow with one more question
and then i can turn to some of those
that are
appearing in the q a panel
i'm thinking about the differences
between the first enlightenment and the
new enlightenment that you're calling
for
lots has changed since then and you
close
with some goals and principles for
bringing about a new enlightenment
as if you had grounds for hope
and yet you do talk about efforts in the
digital age uh the contemporary age
for our new enlightenment and you find
monsters there too
and certainly power and profit are
present today so they have not
disappeared
so what are your grounds for hope if
power and profit and the other monsters
have not disappeared
um so that one
comparatively isn't is an easier
question for
me first um just
like rhetorically i want to say that
in the preface to this book i quote um
who who you know wrote the
original uh social contract
um was a peculiar fellow um
but also wrote these memoirs what he
called his confessions
and he wrote you know i guess i
i address this how can how can one
possibly write
a book of hope now to your point um
and rousseau put in his
confessions this sentence if i want to
describe the spring
it must be in winter if i want to
describe a fine
landscape i must be within doors
and as i said a hundred times if ever i
were confined
in the bastille there i would draw the
picture
of liberty but substantively i would say
this you know we are
what is it uh yeah i need a slide rule
but um 600
700 600 plus years
into the age of print um enlightenment
the original enlightenment was called
the republic of letters
um and look how we fouled it up
i mean look you know when when
you guys got together almost
20 years ago 19 years ago to do the open
access
declaration in budapest you know
what a world you were dealing with then
look how many um
forces existed at that time exist today
in the print universe in the book world
uh um no offense harvard
bookstore um in the journal world um
in the world of scholarly communications
as it was defined then and as
in many ways it's still defined now um
look how many tortured contracts existed
how many knots in copyright
law and practice policy have been tied
up
now we're um only 120
25 years into what i'm calling like the
new enlightenment whatever the republic
of images not the republic of
letters um most of us
in this zoom today you know first of all
we're talking over video
um second you know we have the capacity
to connect
ourselves with video and record and
preserve
and share and publish um
all kinds of stuff on video and so you
know i work at
mit open learning which which

is also celebrating 20 years of
mit open courseware one of the great
dramatic
interventions in sharing where we put
now 2
500 courses online um absolutely for
free from mit
uh for the world forever uh anywhere you
are
um you know i think there might be an
opportunity for us to look at
the audio visual
medium the medium through which we're
communicating now
the medium through which we're doing a
lot of teaching and learning during this
pandemic
willful or not um you know and and
and try to
perhaps with the help of some of our
friends within
public media and there's no greater you
know i should have said right at the
outset
like cambridge and boston
not only home to all of these
extraordinary
museums and universities in one hour but
it also happens to be home
to perhaps the the greatest public media
enterprise
anywhere in the world i mean as far as
i'm concerned it rivals the uh
it rivals the bbc nhk
which is wgbh and just this week you
know
um wgbh together with the library of
congress
released the original archival
interviews
um from a great series on the history of
the
civil rights movement 14 hours
the series was the rough material is
hundreds of hours called eyes on the
prize
can we can we look at ourselves now 100
years into
you know uh this world before we get to
be
650 years old and try to figure out ways
of making sure we don't
mess up i use saltier language in the
book
mess up the audio visual universe
in the way that we somehow allowed the
print universe
to have all of these constraints built
in that we somehow
accept we should uh
you know take another crack at it and um
my hope is that
uh if we collectivize a bit we we we
um we will
uh thanks i'm not gonna follow up with a
question uh just an observation that was
a very good
enlightenment answer because it was
empirical that is
one ground for hope uh is that we've
been succeeding
uh some initiatives have been working
i'll just point out
you document very well that earlier
initiatives also seemed to be succeeding
for quite a while
until they were demolished stamped out
okay i think it's time to turn to
questions from the audience
here's one from an anonymous participant
how can this
power and fight for information change
the broken college system
in the united states
um great great question
uh you know yeah
many ways the whole education system is
broken
and i don't know that
you know uh the recipes for fixing it
are in my book in this conversation in
all of what we can think of together
today alone
but um i think if we uh
commit ourselves to sharing
the knowledge that comes out of these
great
institutions that comes out of
institutions that are not as old as
harvard or
who are founded in the crucible of war
like an mit
um um
you know that are more recent um if
there are
ways of more systematically connecting
between the institutions that
are wealthy and the ones that are not
the ones that are old and the ones that
are new
the you know community colleges that
uh it go about educating so many people
um in ways that when we think of higher
education sometimes
you know especially in cambridge that's
a downside i guess
we don't always talk about um
boy is there room for improvement um
so you know if i had one sort of
thing to impart it would be to kind of
blow into those conversations um
the hope that we were discussing in the
very last you know part of our
conversation
um to try and see
to try and empower us with the knowledge
that
we should be working toward those goals
that we
can work together toward those goals
and that there are opportunities for
resources and support um
you know we're still i don't know about
you guys all of you
but uh peter you uh we're still
kind of you know post-traumatic
stress from the trump years
um but you know as someone put it on
twitter the other day
how do you like this new administration
you know that's
vaccines for everybody and trillions of
dollars for infrastructure
so i think there is some you know
opportunity
for hope and i think um hope and
collective action
and confidence i guess in our own power
um are really at the key to
transforming the educational system
sorry if that's a watery answer
thank you peter there's one more
question in the q a
panel uh and before i read it let me
just urge people to post
their own questions if you don't you're
going to get more of mine
okay here's the next one could you say
more about the physics of knowledge and
the physics of information
i'm intrigued because in the world of
data visualization
when one builds a knowledge graph or
visualization of network information
through software
there is actually a physics engine
behind the visualization that determines
the layout and display of related
entities and information
sure i can but i would
i'll tell you i'd much rather hear hear
from from you about that physics engine
uh then prattle on uh you know about
some
kind of funky uh funky metaphor
um the the the book is
um has probably 30 or 40
my book probably has 30 or 40 pages on
um this physics of intellectual property
give or take and
you know it involves discussions
of information as something that's
always in motion
um and it is a
you know uh it would be a dream to
actually get together with a couple of
physicists there's no shortage of those
either
in this town and and um maybe
whoever is asking this question data
data visualization and think about
how one could actually map um
you know the the physics
of information my main point
is that and it also is a source for hope
so who knew that hope would be such a
topic today
but but um uh that the
destiny of human creativity
is really in the commons that's like a
that to me is like a if it's
true if it's like if that's also you
know
possibly empirically accurate that's a
kind of breathtaking concept that we
had actually articulated copyright law
with that point in mind and that in some
ways despite all of the restrictions the
contracts the agreements
in print and you know the complex
visual con look at a look at the number
of agreements in the rights bible for a
documentary for example
you'll pass out um
if that's really the point of it all
um that's kind of mind-blowing
um so that all these things like apples
on the ground you know land there um in
the commons
the difference being that or maybe it's
the same because then you dip into
biology i don't know exactly what
happens to
apples once they get onto the ground
what do they do there but in the commons
anyway
they information becomes shareable
and shareable again forever
so um yeah i'd love to talk about that
some
uh more but uh hopefully that's the
start
good thank you yeah here's a new
question
do you think it's possible to combat the
spread of misinformation when the
democratized digital landscape of
publishing
means that formatter false information
is often indistinguishable
from true information to an untrained or
uninformed observer
yeah it's a great question i i i do
think it's possible and i not only think
it's possible i think it's
um um
it's our responsibility uh whoever we
are scholars authors publishers
booksellers
to figure out ways of doing that um
and the nub is in the how you know
um and and one of the answers that i go
on about
um is like if there were a way to know
when a when a when a congressman
stands up and you're watching him on
c-span a bunch of us have been involved
in projects like this by the way
in the same way as you know you watch
uh race car drivers going around the
track or in their you know
suits when they are out of their cars
and they're like
logos of all of their sponsors
everywhere
if there were a way to as someone's
talking right
um on video on television on whatever
you're watching
like have at the time that they're
speaking
a sense of who is contributing to
their position to their
election campaign that those
sources that are relevant to the topics
that are being spoken of at that moment
almost like live annotation
uh you know which follows the money um i
think that would be
interesting if you imagine
today if we're all going to watch like
this hemingway
film of ken burns that's coming up
premiering in a few days the credits are
all at the end
right i made a point and you know
kudos to the publisher at seven stories
press in new york
and dan simon who is the head of it of
making sure that my
you know footnotes were footnotes uh
at the bottom uh there will be ways
125 years into
this medium of you know audio visual
medium that we're talking over today to
have footnotes appearing
at the same time to have source
materials appearing at the same time
in audio-visual media so that you don't
have to wait
for the end of the movie to see where
this was shot
or where this image came from or where
this piece of music
or local news footage surfaced out of
um and i think we can do a lot more with
um text today
online than we've done um there are all
kinds of initiatives uh
you know to further this kind of work
but they need to be um yeah
they need to be given a few steroids
today
thanks peter we have a new question from
edward embiir
do you have any thoughts on how
copyright law should be written to be
more fair to authors
publishers and the common good
yeah so the first thanks for that
question it's a great question and uh
you know once again they're like there
are a few law schools in this town a few
lawyers
um as well uh and professors of law who
you know um can can
um can address this far better
than i can the first book talk that i
gave was on the
day this book was released five weeks
ago at february
23rd i think it was at the
university of california berkeley's
law and information school at the
invitation
of the hero of mine um pam samuelson
uh who teaches copyright law and you
know
when i was done talking she was like so
should the first amendment be rewritten
you know it's a different talk and
you know unlike i'm talking to one of
the great
you know or present anyway was one of
the great is one of the great scholars
of the first amendment and of law and
copyright law in particular um
i i'm not sure
what the answer is to that question but
i'm
pretty sure that the beginnings of the
answer
lie in reinforcing the point
and recognizing it everywhere that
copyright is
is
a great vehicle um for
generating progress uh
for generating maybe even
power and profit you know as good things
sometimes
uh often um but in the end
like um in the end
we're you know is it ridiculous that
you know we can't quote a simon and
garfunkel
song in in um
you know in in a documentary uh
without jumping through hurdles about it
or you know isn't that part of our
common intellectual human
heritage um so i don't know i think i
think we need to
um kind of underscore the intentions of
copyright law and be emboldened
by those original uh visions
uh of it there's there's a lot
there's a lot there i will say one other
thing which is creative commons which is
mentioned
in this book at some length
uh it it remains
to be proven to me why
a system like creative commons can't
evolve
in the same way that time affects
copyright
sometimes right if you're the the right
situation on
one of these books in back of me may be
different from one of these other books
simply because of what year
it was published or the author died or
whatever
could creative commons licenses shift
so that for five years a comment a
licenses
under these terms uh for the next five
years it's under some perhaps more
liberal terms and for the remainder of
its time
it is under perhaps the most liberal or
something like that
i think that that the question of time
which is this is also a book about time
i think
um um is vital to understand
as part of the answer
good thank you we've only got four
minutes
uh and there are no questions in the
panel so
here's one from me and if it takes
longer than four minutes feel free to
just cut it off
but maybe some people can stay on longer
it seems to me
that many of us including
you and i were more excited about the
potential for digital media and the
internet
to create a new enlightenment when they
were new
than we are today that is between then
and now we've seen more
threats risks hazards obstacles
than we saw then and so this is the flip
side of my question of
your grounds for hope what are your
grounds for pessimism
and what are the most important specific
uh
threats or obstacles that we should pay
attention to in order to
avoid them
how much time do we have grounds for
pessimism come on tough days yeah yeah
yeah um
i guess the grounds for pessimism that i
have that are the most
sort of substantial involve
it's super hard to imagine reform
of the regulations that
have been chipped chiseled away at
for 30 40 years
without reform of the political system
that in part
governs us and governs how
regulations are enacted
and enforced and those political
systems and i speak specifically of the
second branch of government
like it are um
are um corrupt
so uh you know and it turns out that the
number one lobbyist is the book
you know explorers in washington is the
parent of google and facebook isn't far
behind
you know in terms of the size and dollar
amounts that is being poured in
to efforts um where are we going to find
the people
who are unbought you know who are um
i think that's key and that's a
generational issue so it also involves
considerations of time
it is inconceivable to me that we can
engage in the
you know we talked a little bit about
eastern europe
um this whole chapter in here um and
it's how i
you know first encountered
carol horn who might give a shout out to
it at the beginning
of this talk um you know
timothy gartnash wrote a lot for the new
york review of books in the
90s talked about the system of eastern
europe the communist totalitarian
regimes put in as turning what used to
be
an aquarium lively and vivacious
into fish soup and how do you
return from fish soup
back into an aquarium that can't be done
overnight god knows
how to do it um it's happening in weird
ways
over in that part of the world today but
i think that um
when you look at our own systems uh that
you know the macro systems that exist to
regulate uh laws rules
other systems of information education
expression of all kinds here

there are lots of grounds for pessimism
because the regulators or the people who
legislate or the people who adjudicate
um are so corrupt i think we need to
yeah be good to get some new people in
here so i hope some folks
in this call are 25 years old
well i think that's about all we have
time for today but
um thank you so much for joining us and
having this really
impeccable conversation um
and thank you for sharing your time and
thank you to everyone at home who's
