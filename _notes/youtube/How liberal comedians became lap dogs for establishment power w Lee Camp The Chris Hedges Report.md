How liberal comedians became lap dogs for establishment power w/Lee Camp | The Chris Hedges Report - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:03) The fusion of politics, news, and entertainment  has given prominence to comics, especially those   such as Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert, Seth  Meyers, John Oliver, and Bill Maher, who serve   as attack dogs for the Democratic Party, which has  joined forces with the establishment wing of the   old Republican Party against Donald Trump and his  supporters.
(00:57) By belittling Trump and his followers,   these comics feed the smug, self-righteousness  of the ruling establishment and their sense of   moral and intellectual superiority. These comics  and the networks that give them platforms, HBO,   Comedy Central, TBS, ABC, CBS, NBC, and even CNN,  which has hired comics such as W. Kamau Bell to   host shows on the news network, have little to  no effect on the political landscape.
(01:23) They are   as loathed and ignored by Trump supporters as they  are feted by Trump haters. They're constrained by   the corporations and advertisers that employ them.  They function as court jesters, never questioning   the right of the rulers to rule, or the terrible  social injustices built into a rigged system. 
(01:43) They traffic almost exclusively in  negativity, searching out the weird,   the bizarre, the stupid, and the inane  in celebrity culture or mainstream news   reports. They perpetuate the fiction that we  live in a democracy. They do not challenge the   folly of permanent war from the Middle East to  Ukraine.
(02:04) They do not call out the corporations   that have de-industrialized the nation and  abandoned and impoverished American workers.   They attack critics of the system even  if these critics come from the left.   John Oliver, for example, devoted a show to  mocking Green Party presidential candidate,   Jill Stein. Bill Maher made public his $1 million  donation to Barack Obama's 2012 campaign.
(02:30) These   comics traffic in a self-defeating cynicism that  askews all critiques of the real configurations   of power. Power only laughs at its own jokes and  these are the jokes these mainstream comics tell.  Joining me to discuss the transformation of comedy  from an art form rooted in the counterculture to   one that has largely become a megaphone for power  is Lee Camp.
(02:57) Who, like the comics of another era,   Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, Mort Sahl, Bill  Hicks, and George Carlin and a handful of his   contemporaries, including Jimmy Dore, is not  afraid to use his razor-sharp wit against our   real enemies. So censorship of comics is not new,  we can go back to Lenny Bruce. And also providing   acerbic comics with heavy financial support to  essentially buy their loyalty isn't new.
(03:31) But let's   go back and talk in the preceding decades where  we were, how that operated and where we are now.  Well, first of all, thanks for having me, Chris.  It's an honor to be here. Even though many of   those people you mentioned in that intro, they  were my heroes when I was beginning and starting   out, and then I slowly got to the bottom of  things, realized how the systems worked.
(03:52) But yeah,   you're right that censorship is not new.  Lenny Bruce, for those who don't know,   was essentially driven to his death. I mean, he  was arrested on just about every stage he would   get onto towards the end of his life, simply  for his words, for going against religion,   for going against the government, making fun  of police. He couldn't make a living.
(04:13) He was   chased. They'd threatened his venues with taking  away their liquor license. He ultimately OD'ed.  So this isn't new, but I think it's almost more  insidious now, because there was a very select   group of gatekeepers back when there were three TV  channels. And so in a way, things have opened up.  
(04:33) You can now have all this information and it's so  accessible and comedians from nowhere can go viral   on YouTube and things. But if you get far enough  and your criticisms are strong enough, you are   not going to be accepted into those mainstream  outlets. You will be banned from them.
(04:50) You will   get pushed out of the way. Those who are still  there, the people on Comedy Central regularly,   the people on these late night shows, they have  made that deal with the corporations that they are   not going to really question them in a large scale  way. They may have a little line here or there,   but they're not going to get at the heart  of the inverted totalitarian system we have. 
(05:15) Talk about Bill Hicks. You were the  one who had me watch Bill Hicks. He   was brilliant, but he's an example of that. He's a real great example of... his legend   has grown. He was known but not really famous  in America when he died. I think it was 1994.   He was pretty well known in Britain then, even  though he was American.
(05:36) But his legend has really   grown because he was saying things about our  invasion of Iraq for the first Iraq war that   held true for the second one. "How do we know they  have WMD? Because we have the receipts," those   were his lines. Those were the type of things  that ultimately did get him censored. His final   Letterman did not air famously, even though he  taped it and they still didn't air it.
(06:00) But he said   things that were so important and he went after  those corporations, he went after marketing and   how it manipulates message. And he did it in a way  that really brought large scale audiences in with   laughter. It wasn't like he was losing everybody  and wasn't funny. He was tremendously funny.  
(06:17) And so his legend has really grown and he now  ranks alongside George Carlin and those others.  We should talk about Carlin because he appears  to have had a pretty successful career and yet   have held fast to that kind of ability  to ridicule the real centers of power.  Yeah. He had an incredibly interesting career  because initially, and this is the way...  
(06:43) We talked about the gatekeepers a moment ago.  Initially this... if you were going to question   things, the deeper things, you had to first  get famous doing the clean comedy that was   allowable on the Ed Sullivan Show and stuff  like that. Richard Pryor and George Carlin   a
(07:03) re a few examples, they got... and Lenny  Bruce, they got famous doing that clean,   nice family style comedy that they would allow  on the late night shows or the various shows.   And then they started to question things  themself, and it was kind of too late   for the system. Lenny Bruce was already hugely  famous. George Carlin, already hugely famous. But   the system then realized Lenny Bruce was a risk  and they started chasing him and arresting him. 
(07:23) Carlin, his big change was he realized he wasn't  being himself, he wasn't being open. He was doing   this clean comedy, and he had a very dramatic  shift where he hated himself and he switched   everything, started using curse words on stage,  which got him fired from all his Vegas gigs,   lucrative gigs. And for a few years was barely  earning a living.
(07:48) But then the culture turned   around, all of a sudden he got respected for being  the type to push authority and push against these   restrictions and became hugely famous kind of  again. But then at that time, he wasn't really   going after the endless war state or the American  empire. Those weren't his criticisms.
(08:09) Instead,   it was the cursing that was challenging and  went all the way to Supreme Court. It was a   Supreme Court case as to whether his curse  words could be heard on our radio stations.  But eventually, and I don't hear a lot of  people make this point, and the reason he   was allowed to do this was because HBO was a  young, new thing, it was subscription-based.  
(08:28) There wasn't really subscription-based television  happening before that much. And he was given these   comedy specials where he wasn't accountable to  any corporate ads. They put him up there because   he was George Carlin. He did like 10 specials and  they just wanted people to subscribe.
(08:46) So he could   swing for the fences and do whatever he wanted  and he did it until his death. And he put out   some of these brilliant and scathing, scathing  critiques of American empire, jokes about how,   "Oh, we're really good at bombing brown people.
(09:04) "  Those were the type of bits that America had   never heard. The reason he was allowed to  was A, because he was famous before that,   and B, because he was on a subscription rather  than corporate-based platform. Nowadays, HBO,   however is still not going to have people that  question Israel or question the American empire.  It seems that comics, because they have  catered to corporate power, advertisers   laid off of serious critique of the Democratic  Party because it's a kind of one-sided comedy...  
(09:40) I'm talking about the mainstream. They've  essentially rendered themselves utterly   ineffectual. I think back to, there's a wonderful  memoir by the Lutheran minister, Martin Niemöller   who finds himself in the Dachau concentration  camp, I believe it was Niemöller, with the cabaret   owners from Berlin who savaged the Nazis in the  cabaret, in the cabaret shows.
(10:06) But of course, they   weren't going after the ineffectual aristocratic  government that didn't know how to handle the   fallout from the Great Depression or had abolished  unemployment insurance. It was a very similar kind   of... And because they were essentially  working tacitly on behalf of the system,   they didn't have any kind of real political  impact.
(10:34) I think you would agree that that's   kind of an apt analogy for what's happening here. Yeah. People may look at these late night shows,   Colbert, et cetera, and say, "What do you mean?  They mock the rulers all the time. They may   even..." I haven't watched them recently.
(10:53) "They  may even make fun of Biden," but even if they're   making fun of Biden and Trump equally, which  they're not, it was far more heavy on Trump,   but either way, they're making fun of these  surface level critiques. So he's acting dumb,   he fell down.
(11:12) It's never the system writ large,  it's never the American empire, it's never endless   war. So as long as you have people thinking, "Oh,  this is funny, we're making fun of the rulers,   we're doing this edgy thing," while never  getting to this center, never getting to   the critiques that could actually change  things, you're still servicing the whole system.  You go back to the Greeks, comedy was  Aristophanes and I mean, these were political *inaudible* and these were... and they  would take down the ruling, the lead of Athens.  
(11:49) In Greek drama, comedy had an extremely  important political function. You and I   were both on RT. You had a great show on RT and  you did all of this. I want you to talk about   in your mind what great comedy should do. Yeah. I think it has to make power nervous,   I think is the end goal.
(12:18) If they can sit up there  on a stage, like they do at the White House press   corps dinners and laugh with you, then clearly  you're not that threatening. Clearly, you're not   hitting at the things that power is afraid will  get out to the people. That is actually what   radical comedy that is seeking to create even  the slightest bit of change has to do. We just   don't get it from the most of the famous comedians  that people can name on their late night TV shows.  
(12:51) And there's two reasons for that. One is  that many of these people, they either   haven't educated themselves... They haven't  read your books, Chris. They haven't educated   themselves enough to get to that point that they  understand that kind of critique or if they have,   they understand how that television system  works, they understand you don't stay there   for long if you are making those critiques.
(13:15) I  mean, hell, I was on a network that wasn't even   a mainstream network and still my show and your  show were ultimately sanctioned to death. And-  Well, let's be clear, all of the shows  that were on YouTube were erased.  Yeah. For me, over 2000 videos, just basically a  digital book burning of everything that existed.   And unfortunately, not that I enjoy  seeing it happen, unfortunately,   that means that our critiques were effective  and were threatening to the powerful. 
(13:41) Let's talk about some of the things  that you were able to say on that show   that can't be said in the mainstream. Well, I always like to make the point,   because people think you're on RT, you're told  what to say, as you and I can tell people,   I was never told what to say. I wrote all my own  words, which for comedy shows is unheard of.
(14:02) These   people all have teams of writers. I did not. I  wrote every single word and was never censored.   Now that being said, I could go after things  that are completely hidden from mainstream media,   things such as Israel being in apartheid  state, things such as just big Ag. I mean,   how often do you hear criticisms of big ag,  which controls our government and is one of the   largest environmental destroyers on this planet.
(14:32) Criticisms of so many corporate entity entities,   whether it was Cargill or Monsanto or Nestlé. And  not just go after them with a slight little joke,   but go after them in a real deep and real way.  To give people an example of how it works on   other networks, which this is a single page in  a entire book that was written about the Daily   Show that summed it all up for me and it has  always stuck with me.
(14:55) Right after Jon Stewart   finished the Daily Show, they put out a book,  I don't remember what it was called, but with   all of the interviews and everything showing how  the Daily Show worked, the internal mechanism.  I
(15:10) found it very fascinating, but one page they  go, "I was the guy..." there was a certain person   who was in charge of if the show wanted to make  fun of a corporate sponsor or someone under the   umbrella of one of the corporate sponsors, this  person who worked for the Daily Show would call   that company and try to convince them it's cool  to be made fun of.
(15:27) It's okay to be made fun of   on the Daily Show. The clear implication was if  that company says no, it's not getting on there.   So imagine the level of corporations that are  somehow tied to Viacom, Comcast, all of those,   every entity.
(15:43) If they don't want to be made fun  of on the Daily Show, then they're not going to   be. Well, then the Daily Show can't critique half  of what owns this country. It's insane to be like,   "We are a show criticizing how America works,  trying to show people the internal structure   and we can't critique half of the system." Well, they can also pull advertising.  Yeah. Yeah. Let's talk about woke culture in comedy. 
(16:06) Whether it's a good or bad thing? I'll let you go into that snake pit.  I have a bit of a nuanced view on this. I think  in general, yes, it has harmed a lot of comedy   in that people are perhaps, I'd say too easily  offended. They just hear a buzzword and they   decide that this person should never be allowed  to speak on a stage or on a screen again.
(16:31) So it   has gone overboard, absolutely. However, I- Can you give me some examples or an example?  I think an example would be if... you have to  think of the entirety of the joke. So some people   will hear that a joke uses the word gay or uses  the word obese or something and they say, "That's   terrible. He is making fun..." Well, but did the  entire joke make fun of those? I don't know.
(16:54) I   think you have to take the entire joke and its  structure and everything into account and people   don't do that. They just hear a word and they say,  "I don't like that that word was used." So to me,   that's taking it too far.
(17:08) However, I also  want to say that you hear a lot of, more often   right-wingers, but a lot of comedians in general  act like they're being canceled because someone   got offended. And it's like, no, people also have  a right to be offended. If you hear a comedian who   to you is offensive and you storm out of the show,  that's your right.
(17:25) You had a right to be offended   and you were offended. Now saying, "I need to  make sure this person does not have a career,"   is a step too far, generally speaking. I think both sides are wrong on this. I think the   pendulum often swings back and forth in American  history. There was a time when blackface was quite   common on American stages, and now it's rightfully  not, and these things swing back and forth.
(18:00) But   I think that by actually going too far, by  acting like someone should lose their career   because they said a joke that you didn't like, I  think we actually open up a space where now these   conversations can't be had.
(18:19) You open up a space  where now it's cool to see how many people you can   offend. And so I don't know, I have a nuanced view  on it and it may piss off both sides, I think.  What about Dave Chappelle because  he's been called out for this?  Yeah. A couple of points on this. One, people  say he was canceled. He's not canceled. He   makes $100 million a year or whatever it is,  $100 million deal with Netflix.
(18:39) This is not   canceled. You could make an argument that I've  been canceled, when you lose your YouTube and   your podcast and your TV show all at once, Dave  Chappelle's not canceled. So when people say   someone's been canceled, it's crap.
(18:57) Now, do I  like his anti-trans comedy? No, I think it's   pretty lame. But if people like it, then okay,  they have a right to hear that form of comedy.  My bigger issue, honestly, and this doesn't mean  he should be canceled, is of all the oppressed   peoples in this world that, I think, Dave  Chappelle seems to at times have had some concerns   a
(19:19) bout, of all the people that have... of all the  issues that we could be dealing with, that we   could be fighting over, the 6 million people  that have died from the US Global War on terror,   those type of things. Really, you're upset that  they changed the symbol on the bathroom? It's   mind blowing that that is your issue. And not  only is it your issue, it's your issue on four   straight specials. It's like clearly, you have  some kind of hangup where you can't get past it. 
(19:41) So what happens? I mean, does  comedy go underground? I mean,   what are people like you doing? I mean, in terms of trying to keep getting   my stuff out there, I do continue to do my live  streams. I try and be on as many platforms as I   can so that they can't be deleted, or at least one  of them can be deleted and I'm still out there.  
(20:04) But yeah, I mean it's a tricky time and it's a  dangerous time for these type of truly radical   comedy. I do hope that it continues and people  don't... there's a lot of self-censoring,   I think that goes on. People understand  what's going to get a YouTube strike and   they stop saying those things.
(20:33) And that perhaps  is almost more threatening than just straight up   deleting of channels because that... yes, it  happened to me, but that doesn't happen that   much. What happens probably more often across all  of these platforms is people begin self-censoring,   because they're, "Oh, you can't question that.  You can't talk about Palestinians.
(20:47) You can't   talk about this or that." So they just stopped  talking about it, because why risk your platform?  So you have this irony where you have  far more platforms, but you can say less.  In some regards, yeah. Well, because the apparatus of censorship,   and this came out in the Twitter files, it  hits all of the social media and they dictate,   t
(21:16) hey... both right wing, left wing critics, if  you're critiquing that establishment center,   you're targeted, which is why you were  targeted and why I was targeted. So we   may have a multiplicity of platforms, but  we don't actually have greater freedom.  Yeah. You can spend a long time, many  years building up these platforms,   finding your fans for comedy or finding readers,  and then it can be shut down in a minute.
(21:38) So it's   like you're playing whack-a-mole trying to... or  they're playing whack-a-mole trying to stop you.   But yeah, I don't know any other way to do it.  I guess a lot of comedians would just ultimately   throw their hands up and say, "I'm going to do  a different kind of comedy.
(21:54) " Because certainly   capable of that, I spent the first five years  of my comedy career doing comedy that was not   offensive to the empire. But nowadays, I can't  ever see backing down, I can't see doing it   any other way. To me, the road I want to be  on is the one where these critiques matter,   not where I just get the laugh.
(22:17) Yes, I want  a laugh, but I also want to be speaking about   these incredibly important issues and I can't see  abandoning all that, maybe other comedians do.  And yet there are pretty powerful financial  incentives. I mean, we both know comics that   were on Air America and were overtly political  and are now doing extremely well and have shed   themselves of any political commentary at all.
(22:44) Or shed themselves at least of the brand of   political comedy that will get you censored  or stopped. I think there's a lot of people,   and it goes for... it's interesting how  parallel it is to journalists. I mean,   there are many journalists who maybe started  to get up to that line, realized what it was   and backed off.
(23:07) And now you go, "Whatever happened  to so and so? Whatever happened to that journalist   that I really respected and now they seem  to be parroting state department releases?"   And it's, I think, a lot of them get up to that  line and they see, "Oh, this is where I can go.   And if I go there, then the money starts to shut  down, the positions start to shut down and it's a   lot more fun over here with all the money bags.
(23:33) " So if you are on the mainstream,   are there consistent themes? Does it retreat...  and you know far more about this than I do,   retreat primarily into the personal? Do you  find common patterns among mainstream comics?  Yeah, I'd say a lot of it  retreats into the personal.   And I'd say for those who claim to have  some political comedy in their routine,   it's usually just a few Trump jokes or things like  that. It's not actually going deeper than that.  
(24:08) As a comedian... so I lived in New York and  I was on stage every night of the week, often   three shows a night, and you see what gets laughs  from crowds, but you also see what is going to get   you booked on these late night shows. You see your  colleagues, your compatriots in comedy, you see,   &
(24:31) quot;Oh, that guy got selected for late night, that  guy got selected... Oh, the person that's ranting   about how we're killing children overseas, that  one's not getting selected for late night."   So you see the path, and I think some comedians  consciously go, "Oh, this is the one that works."  Well, you have examples. Randy Credico would be a  good example.
(24:45) He was, I think, mainstream, right?  Well, and Randy Credico, one of his many claims  to fame, I mean, now he's on the Ukrainian kill   list, but- As am I.  Are you on there too? With Roger Waters.  Congrats. But going back to the '80s, one of his  claims to fame was he appeared on Johnny Carson   and told some jokes they didn't like and they say  he's the only one to appear on Johnny Carson and   lose gigs because he was challenging the American  ruling elite in a way that other comics were not.  
(25:16) So yeah, Credico's an interesting example.  How important is comedy to the sustenance  of an open society or democracy?  Maybe I'm biased, but I think very important,  but it has to have those two sides. There is   wonderful comedy that is not critiquing anything.  There is abstract comedy.
(25:42) There is comedians who   I have loved, like Steven Wright and Mitch Hedberg  that were never talking about anything political,   nothing about... and so it's not that I  think that all comedy has to be radical,   edgy comedy that makes people think. But  if you're going to be in even slightly in   that realm or think that you do that at all,  then my view would be don't just do the little   lighthearted Trump jokes that changes nothing.
(26:13)   If you've made a choice that you are going   to take a stance on these issues, then do it. I think a functioning society needs both those   sides. Yes, you should have the comedy, the  abstract comedy and the non-political comedy.   It's important. People want to laugh. They  want to analyze their culture, and I think   that's all very important. But you also need  to have the other side.
(26:35) And if you don't,   then you are in a form of an authoritarian society  that can't handle critiques of itself. I think   there's a good argument to be made that the ruling  elite are less able to handle critiques as the   empire crumbles, as things become more tenuous.
(26:52) Well, you look at, I covered the Stasi state   in East Germany. I mean making jokes  about the communist dictator Honecker   would see you get in jail, even to a friend. Same  was true under Stalin. I mean, that when you live   in a... oh, and the Nazis as well. I mean,  they don't have any sense of humor at all.  Right. It's eradicated.  Right.
(27:12) You can make jokes of the vulnerable   or the demonized, but not of power. I mean, I'm no historian, but here it   was similar with art where- Oh yeah.  ... if the paintings were clearly  criticizing the government, then-  And books. And books... then that was   a problem. But if it was abstract, then- Right.
(27:33) Well, the German film industry   boomed under the Nazis, but it was all  froth, it was all light entertainment.  Right. Right. I wonder if the attacks   on the mainstream, which are largely anti-Trump,  are actually counterproductive in the long term.  The attacks on the mainstream- Against Trump, the constantly   hammering of Trump and his supporters. I  wonder if that's ultimately counterproductive. 
(27:58) I mean, it's quite possible. I know that... So  it can be counterproductive in that it makes   his followers think- Well, if it widens-  " ... I'm with the rebel." It widens the divide. They hate the institutions   anyway that are giving these people platforms. Yeah.
(28:17) It also makes Liberals, which not just in   comedy, but in so many areas, it makes Liberals  think, "Oh, we are fighting the good fight.   We're fighting against the bad guy." Meanwhile,  they'll cheer, "Oh, well, Biden, well, he is no   Trump." Meanwhile, he's locked up more Black and  brown people than Trump ever could have hoped to. 
(28:31) Yeah, yeah. The Trump jokes   actually make Liberals think they're doing  right, they're fighting against the evil.  When in fact they're only exacerbating the  antagonisms, siloed demographic. Are there any   serious comics who are strong supporters of Trump? Yeah.
(28:59) I mean, I'll be honest, I don't keep up with   what the kids are doing these days. But yeah, no,  there are fewer right-wingers, but they do exist.   I think that most of the right-wingers I knew in  New York City in the comedy scene, they'd be more   right-wing off-stage.
(29:21) So they'd hide it on stage  because they knew that audiences would often back   off if you got too right-wing, but it was clear  that that's where their worldview was when they   were off-stage. So they also knew which way to go  to be acceptable on late night shows and stuff.  Great. I want to thank The Real News Network  and its production team, Cameron Granadino,   Adam Coley, David Hebden, and Kayla Rivara.  You can find me at chrishedges.substack.com.
