Transcript:
(00:00) Quantum mechanics is more than a hundred years  old. That sounds like it’s the stuff of dusty   textbooks, but research on quantum mechanics  is more active now than a century ago. That’s   because many rather elementary facts about quantum  mechanics couldn’t be experimentally settled until   the 1980s.
(00:26) But then, by the year 2000 or so,  experimental progress had totally transformed   the field. Today it’s developing faster than  ever. How did this happen, why does it matter,   and what’s quantum teleportation?  That’s what we’ll talk about today. Before we talk about the second quantum  revolution, big thanks to our tier four   supporters on Patreon. We greatly  appreciate your help.

(01:16) He thought quantum mechanics couldn’t  possibly be a complete description of nature and   he argued that something was missing from it. You see, in quantum mechanics we can’t predict   the outcome of a measurement. We can only predict  the probability for getting a particular outcome.   Without quantum mechanics, I could  say if I shoot my particle cannon,   then the particles will land right there.
(01:41) With  quantum mechanics I can only say they’ll land   right there 50% of the time but have a  small chance to be everywhere, really. Einstein didn’t like this at all. He thought  that actually the outcome of a measurement   is determined, it’s just that it’s determined by   “hidden variables” which we don’t have  in quantum mechanics. If that was so,   the outcome would look random just because we  didn’t have enough information to predict it.
(02:06) To make this point, in 1935 Einstein wrote a  famous paper with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen,   now called the EPR paper. In this paper they  argued that quantum mechanics is incomplete,   it can’t be how nature works. They were the  first to realize how essential “entangled”   particles are to understand quantum mechanics.
(02:33)   This would become super-important and lead to odd   technologies such as quantum teleportation  which I’ll tell you about in a moment. Entangled particles share some property,  but you only know that property for both   particles together. It’s not determined  for the individual particles.   You may know for example that the spin of two  particles must add up to zero even though you   don’t know which particle has which spin.
(03:00)   But if you measure one of the particles,   quantum mechanics says that the spin of  the other particle is suddenly determined.   Regardless of how far away it is. This is what  Einstein called “spooky action at a distance”   and it’s what he, together with Podolsky and  Rosen, tried to argue can’t possibly be real. But Einstein or not, physicists didn’t pay much  attention to the EPR paper.
(03:24) Have a look at this   graph which shows the number of citations that  the paper got over the years. There’s basically   nothing until the mid 1960s. What happened in  the 1960s? That’s when John Bell got on the case. Bell was a particle physicist who worked  at CERN. The EPR paper had got him to think   about whether a theory with hidden variables can  always give the same results as quantum mechanics.  
(03:52) The answer he arrived at was “no”. Given certain  assumptions, any hidden variable theory will obey   an inequality, now called “Bell’s inequality”  that quantum mechanics does not have to fulfil. Great. But that was just maths. The question was  now, can we make a measurement in which quantum   mechanics will actually violate Bell’s inequality  and prove that hidden variables are wrong?   Or will the measurements always remain  compatible with a hidden variable explanation,   thereby ruling out quantum mechanics?
(04:28) The first experiment to find out was done  in 1972 by Stuart Freedman and John Clauser   at the University of California at Berkeley.  They found that Bell’s inequality was indeed   violated and the predictions of quantum  theory were confirmed. For a while this   result remained somewhat controversial because  it didn’t have a huge statistical significance   and it left a couple of “loopholes” by  which you could make hidden variables   compatible with observations. For example if  one detector had time to influence the other,  
(05:02) then you wouldn’t need any “spooky action” to  explain correlations in the measurement outcomes. But in the late 1970s physicists found out  how to generate and detect single photons,   the quanta of light. This made things  much easier and beginning in the 1980s   a number of experiments, notably  those by Alain Aspect and his group,   closed the remaining loopholes and  improved the statistical significance. 
(05:30) For most physicists, that settled the case:  Einstein was wrong. Hidden variables can’t work.   There is one loophole in Bell’s theorem, called  the “free will” loophole that cannot be closed   with this type of experiment. This is something  I’ve been working on myself. I’ll tell you more   about this some other time but today let  me just tell you what came out of all this.
(05:54) These experiments did much more than  just confirming quantum mechanics.   By pushing the experimental limits, physicists  understood how super-useful entangled particles   are. They’re just something entirely different  from anything they had dealt with before.   And you cannot only entangle two  particles but actually arbitrarily many.  
(06:16) And the more of them you entangle, the  more pronounced the quantum effects become. This has given rise to all kinds of  applications, for example quantum cryptography.   This is a method to safely submit messages with  quantum particles. The information is safe because   quantum particles have this odd behavior that if  you measure just what their properties are, that   changes them.
(06:46) Because of this, if you use quantum  particles to encrypt a message you can tell if   someone intercepts it. I made a video about this  specifically earlier, so check this out for more.  You can also use entangled particles  to make more precise measurements,   for example to study materials or  measure gravitational or magnetic fields.   This is called quantum metrology, I also  have a video about this specifically.
(07:07) But the maybe oddest thing to have come  out of this is quantum teleportation.   Quantum teleportation allows you to send  quantum information with entangled states,   even if you don’t yourself know the quantum  information. It roughly works like this. First   you generate an entangled state and you give  one half to the sender, lets call her Alice,   and the other half to the receiver, Bob.
(07:36) Alice  takes her quantum information whatever that is,   it’s just another quantum state. She mixes it  together with her end of the entangled state,   that entangles her information with the  state that is entangled with Bob, and then   she makes a measurement. The important thing  is that this measurement only partly tells her   what state the mixed system is in. So it’s still  partly a quantum thing after the measurement.
(08:00) But now remember, in quantum mechanics making  a measurement on one end of an entangled state   will suddenly determine the state on the other  end. This means Alice has pushed the quantum   information from her state into her end of the  entangled state and then over to Bob. But how does   Bob get this information back out? For this he  needs to know the outcome of Alice’s measurement.  
(08:27) If he doesn’t have that, his end of  the entangled state isn’t useful.   So, Alice lets Bob now about her measurement  outcome. This tells him what measurement   he needs to do to recreate the quantum  information that Alice wanted to send. So, Alice put the information into  her end of the entangled state,   tied the two together, sent information about  the tie to Bob, who can then untie it on his end.  
(08:57) In that process, the information gets destroyed  on Alice’s end, but Bob can exactly recreate it   on his end. It does not break the speed of light  limit because Alice has to send information   about her measurement outcome, but it’s an  entirely new method of information transfer. Quantum teleportation was successfully done   first in 1997 by the groups of Sandu Popescu  and Anton Zeilinger.
(09:26) By now they do it IN SPACE…   I’m not kidding. Look at the citations to the EPR  paper again. They’re higher now than ever before.  Quantum technologies have a lot of potential that  we’re only now beginning to explore. And this   isn’t the only reason this research matters. It  also matters because it’s pushing the boundaries   of our knowledge. It’s an avenue to discovering  fundamentally new properties of nature.  
(09:51) Because maybe Einstein was right after all,  and quantum mechanics isn’t the last word.  Today research on quantum mechanics is  developing so rapidly it’s impossible to keep up.   There’s quantum information, quantum optics,  quantum computation, quantum cryptography,   quantum simulations, quantum metrology,  quantum everything.
(10:15) It’s even brought the big   philosophical questions about the foundations  of quantum mechanics back on the table. I think a Nobel prize for the second quantum  revolution is overdue. The people whose names   are most associated with it are Anton Zeilinger,  John Clauser, and Alain Aspect. They’ve been on   the list for a Nobel Prize for quite some while  and I hope that this year they’ll get lucky.
