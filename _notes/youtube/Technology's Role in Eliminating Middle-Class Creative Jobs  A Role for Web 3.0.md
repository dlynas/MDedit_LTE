## Transcript:
how does technology play a role in the
declining middle class and how could
technologies in the future including
blockchain
reverse that trend i would like to
explain this using some ideas from jaron
lanier's book who owns the future
and i'm going to go with his example of
musicians to think it through
because i think it's really vivid even
though you can extrapolate the examples
to think about how would people in other
industries with other skills
be subject to the same forces i'm going
to use these two diagrams to think this
through
so on the top we have artists or in this
case musicians
where we have a normal distribution of
talent among musicians where the top
here is the very most talented there's a
small pool of them there's a lot of
people who are sort of in the middle and
then there's aspiring musicians who are
kind of at the bottom
and this is a essentially a histogram
now we also need to keep in mind that
people almost certainly are going to
move up through this distribution
as they practice as they gain more
skills
this person at the top who's really
really talented they started somewhere
in the middle or at the bottom
and through skill through deliberate
practice they sort of worked their way
up now down here we have consumers of
music
and they're once again lined up
where on this graph we have income so
this is the richest person this is the
second richest person so the people here
on the access in comes here
talent is on this axis uh people are
here but these are going to match up and
we're going to be thinking about how
they match up now the short version of
what's happened since technology came on
the scene
is that you used to have to match up
more or less one-on-one with the the
musician
like there was a time in history when
you had to be in the same room as the
musician
meaning a lot of musicians were employed
by regular people who just wanted some
kind of music technology essentially
makes it such that all of these people
in the population can have access to the
very top most talented people
and in essence that essentially
eliminates the jobs of a lot of
musicians kind of in the middle now one
of the things he points out in this book
is that a healthy system requires a
thriving middle class
and that's essentially because the
middle class is the space where
musicians can build their talent and he
actually points out the same thing with
professors
uh professors get lots of space to have
a middle class job while we develop our
our skills in teaching our skills in
doing research our skills and innovative
thinking
and that long period of time where we're
practicing
explaining things to people where we're
practicing playing with new ideas
that actually makes the very top tiers
of the intellectual class way more
thriving if that middle class exists so
in the book he is very much lamenting
the fact that technology has eliminated
a
work a day job for artists and
intellectuals and for a lot of different
professions
because everybody just has access to the
very top tier now i have hope that some
of the blockchain-based technologies can
enable that eventually to come back can
enable a reversal of the trend but
before i explain that i want to go
through sort of a historical way of
looking at
this diagram so i would like to think
about the musician example with these
diagrams in five different worlds
one of those worlds is going to be where
each person who wants music
has to hire someone to play in their
living room and of course this is a
world that never actually existed
because it's a world where there's no
such thing as a concert so of course if
you can only hire musicians for your
living rooms there is going to be a
one-on-one connection between everyone
who wants to consume music or at least
every household who wants to consume
music
and the musician so because human beings
love music this is going to be a world
where there are a lot of employed
musicians now historically this world
didn't exist because if you rewind back
to the time when there was no theaters
well that time was way back in history
and people were more focused on just
sustaining their own
existence more focused on buying food
than buying luxuries
and of course having stadiums or large
gatherings for people probably existed
far back into antiquity so this never
actually existed but this is a thought
experiment it's helping us think about
the evolution of technology then we go
to our second world where suddenly there
are stadiums of people who can all
listen to one of the best musicians
for one performance so what happens here
is that there are probably still some
occasional people who hire out musicians
for their living room
or for their wedding or whatnot
but many many people go to these
concerts and therefore a lot of
musicians who were previously employed
in people's living rooms
are no longer employed in this case it's
really the top group who get to give
concerts
but there's still a lot of positions
because this this performance has to
happen live
people have to buy tickets
so you need enough performers to sort of
fill out
uh one for every 200 people in the
audience so we see here that we're
shrinking the number of producers but we
still have a sustainable producer class
now our third model is our record model
and the key thing with this model is
that many many people can listen to the
same single performance
over and over so the very top people are
able to make a lot of money because a
single hour of their time recording
something or maybe it's eight hours or
whatever is going to
be distributed throughout a much larger
set of people each perhaps paying a much
smaller price than they paid for the
ticket
to the opera but
when you add that up it channels a lot
more money toward the very top
and this is of course where you start to
get a pareto distribution which perhaps
you've seen where the top one percent of
people make
a a lion's share of the income
in a particular industry so as we move
through these three models we're moving
closer and closer to a really dramatic
pareto distribution and of course that
pareto distribution is associated with
inequality now the other thing that
happens with the record version of this
world
is that you start to have important
intermediaries these are record
companies whose job it is to distribute
the records
they design the contracts they work with
lawyers they make sure that people
aren't copying your records illegally
they have a big role and they're doing
things that are important for those top
performers to be able to make money
but of course these intermediaries are
taking a pretty big cut as well so keep
that in mind now we move to the internet
world now the internet world is actually
pretty similar to the record world
with a few key exceptions it's going to
make our pareto distribution even more
dramatic even more associated with a
highly unequal society and that has to
do with how how people find top
performers how easy is it for them to
download a new song
there's some technical details about
that but it's basically going to
exacerbate
the pareto distribution those are the
first four worlds
the last world is one that hasn't even
close to happened yet
but we're starting to have technologies
especially those related to blockchain
that could enable a reversal of this
pareto distribution trend and some
people are calling this web 3.0
i don't know if that term is going to
stick but there are suite of
technologies related to blockchain that
are trying to do this so let me give you
a taste for what they're trying to do
the first thing they're trying to do is
to create smart contracts that do the
same thing as those intermediaries so
that the intermediaries these companies
that have lawyers and
technological ways of making sure people
don't copy
the artist's work they have a lot of
structure in these intermediaries
that has been necessary to make sure the
artist gets their work even when that
work is being copied over and over and
over smart contracts are designed to
move that power and that money that's
going into these intermediaries
into the hands of the artist
so that's one thing that's going on a
second thing that smart contracts could
enable in the future
is an ecosystem of artists where
everybody is trying to move up the chain
in the artist world
with the assumption and not only the
assumption but with smart contracts in
that ecosystem they guarantee
if you end up at the top of that pareto
distribution
a lot of the money that's going toward
you will be channeled toward people in
the middle
and if you if you just implement this
automatically
right now the people at the top are
going to be like no way i earned my way
to the top i don't need to pay those
middle tier artists i'm better than them
etc etc etc
but if you start everyone while they're
still working their way up in the artist
world when they don't yet know am i
going to be that person at the top or am
i going to be in the middle or the 75th
percentile when they're in that early
stage if you say hey you're going to
sign a contract saying
we're going to support you while you're
in the middle class
but the cost of that is if you reach the
very top
a lot of your money has to be
re-channeled to support the middle class
a lot of the up-and-coming artists may
gladly agree to that and i could imagine
a community that really supports that
ethos that we want middle class artists
to be able to support a family
so smart contracts could be developed
that would make that happen within an
ecosystem and then the third element of
this new world
is you could get
non-fungible tokens that are associated
with ownership of a person's creative
work
in a way that has new features that we
didn't see in the past for example if
you could pay to own
an artist's work such that if that
artist's work got picked up somewhere
else you would make part of the profits
you're kind of investing in that artist
that you care about investing in their
future success and you could get a
benefit by identifying the up-and-coming
artists early and there could be other
types of contracts for example
maybe there are a few lyrics to a new
song from an artist you like that are
up for grabs that you would have the
opportunity to participate in the
development of those lyrics to actually
co-create with the artists that you love
and smart contracts non-fungible tokens
these may enable more creative ways of
interacting between
the music listener and the the artist
and that creativity that these new
contracts could allow
could create new structures besides just
performing in your living room besides
just going to a live concert
other ways that there could be unique
and meaningful relationships between
artists and the people who consume their
work and want to support their work so
that's the hope is that the pareto
distribution that has become so dramatic
could be disrupted by some of these new
technologies
it'll take a while for those
technologies to actually develop
but that's the hope
and it's and it's really exciting
