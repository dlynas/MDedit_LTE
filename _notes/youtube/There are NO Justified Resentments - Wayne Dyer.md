There are NO Justified Resentments - Wayne Dyer - YouTube
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbuN0uvHmW4)

Transcript:
(00:01) I was in a group one time of uh drug addicts and  alcoholics and I was one of the people that was   a sponsor and leading this group and the sign on  the wall said there are no Justified resentments   in this group and what I said to that group that  that night was no matter what anybody says to you   here no matter what kind of anger comes directed  towards you no matter how much hate you may   encounter showing up in your life there are no  Justified resentments meaning that if you carry   around resentment inside of you about anything or  about anyone and I'm talking about the person that  
(00:54) you lent money to and hasn't paid you back I'm  talking about the person in your life that you   feel was abusive I'm talking about the person who  walked out on you and left you for somebody else   I'm talking about all of the things that you  have justified in your heart and in your life   that you have the right to be resentful about and  I'm suggesting to you that those resentments will   always end up harming you and creating in you a  sense of Despair I've often said that no one ever  
(01:32) dies from a snake bite the snake bite will never  kill you you cannot be unbitten once you're bitten   you're bitten but it's the Venom that continues  to pour through your system after the bite that   will end up destroying you so now you have to  take a look at all of the resentments that you   may have in your life and I'd like to suggest  to you that I think there is a Wonder wonderful   metaphor for this that I have created in my life  for how to make this work there's a show called  
(02:08) uh Who Wants To Be A Millionaire and basically  this show has two levels that you have to get   to now the first level is the $1,000 level and at  the $1,000 level you basically have to answer a   question like on your hand you have some digits  those digits on your hand are called your feet   your nose your ears your fingers uh and everybody  whoever goes on the show has this horrible dread   that they're going to go out on one of those  questions right so basically in order to get   to the Thousand level all you have to do is answer  five pretty simple questions in order to uh to get  
(02:55) to the th000 level now the th000 level for you  in this metaphor means that you will leave with   something if you get this at least get this this  is the Thousand level you must send blame out of   your life for any conditions of your life blame  has to go all right now blame means if you're   sitting there with a disease you say without  guilt it's mine I take responsibility for it   this means that if you have been through any tough  circumstances in your life this means if you have   a minimal amount of Financial Security in your  life this means if your children don't get along  
(03:41) with you this means that uh if your neighbors are  having taking up a petition to get you out of the   neighborhood whatever it might be that's going  on in your life you name it and everybody has   a series of these things that you're willing to  say I am here because of the choices that I have   made right now I'm willing to say that even  though it's difficult and we know it's really   not your fault we know really there's a lot of  people out there who are really bad all right  
(04:10) but but you're willing to say no blame that's the  first level all right that's where you understand   no Justified resentments and then on the uh Who  Wants To Be A Millionaire show there is what is   called the $32,000 level and the $32,000 level  is not only an opportunity for you to walk away   with a sizable amount of goodies but it also is  the door opener to multi- wealth but you got to   get to this in order to have an opportunity to  move into these Transcendent levels all right  
(04:47) millionaire spiritual status all right you got  to get through these next five questions and this   $32,000 question or level rather comes to this and  it came to me from a quotation that I use in the   writing of a spiritual solution to every problem  I read the uh a book that was written a couple of   thousand years ago by pangali the yoga sutras the  aphorisms of patang and one of those sutras one of   those aphorisms observations that This brilliant  man made almost 2,000 years ago was this he said  
(05:27) if you become steadfast in your exensions of  thoughts of harm directed towards others all   living creatures will cease to feel enmity in your  presence now this translates to blame pretty basic   no more blame I'm just not going to assign  responsibility to other people for where I am   because now I have an opportunity to get rid of  it if I think someone else CAU it then I've got   to wait for somebody else to change in order for  me to get rid of it and you might wait forever for   that but if I take responsibility for it I can  do something including move on which might be  
(06:11) the most important thing to do but at the higher  level when there are no Justified resentments what   you are doing is you are at a place where you are  sending love in response to hate you are literally   saying no matter what comes my way I am going to  be steadfast in my exstension of thoughts of harm   directed toward others I'm going to work hard at  no matter what comes my way having it come out   of me what I want to come out of me and that is  love and that is a higher energy and if you can  
(06:51) get to that level patanjali said all living  creatures will cease to feel enmity in your   presence I have a little girl a precious little  girl I have six precious girls and two precious   Sons but I have a a little girl who is almost  12 and she loves animals like no one I've ever   met in my life I mean her whole life revolves  around animals and when we walk in the woods   butterflies avoid me fly away from people around  and they come and they land right on her arm and   it happens all the time all living creatur she  couldn't have a thought of harm directed towards  
(07:32) any living creature and patang said to us all  living creatures will cease to feel fear or   enmity or anger in the presence of those who can  send love in response to hate that's what I mean   when I say there are no Justified resentments  what I'd like to do I'd like to share a little   story here with you it's a very tender story it  was sent to me by someone who sends me beautiful   things in the mail and I call it the teddy story  and I'd like to read this to you if I can do it  
(08:05) without tearing up and this story illustrates  this as well as anything I've ever seen there's   a story many years ago of an elementary school  teacher her name was Mrs Thompson as she stood   in front of her fifth grade class on the very  first day of school she told the children a lie   like most teachers she looked at her students and  said that she loved them all the same but that was   impossible because there in the front row slumped  in his seat was a little boy named Teddy Stoddard  
(08:41) Mrs Thompson had watched Teddy the year before  and noticed that he didn't play well with the   other children that his clothes were messy and  that he constantly needed a bath Teddy could be   unpleasant had got to the point where Mrs Thompson  would actually take Delight in marking his papers   with a broad red pen and making bold x's and then  putting a big F at the top of his papers at the   school where Mrs Thompson taught she was required  to review each child's past records and she put  
(09:12) Teddy's off until last however when she reviewed  his file she was in for a surprise Teddy's first   grade teacher wrote Teddy is a bright child with  a ready laugh he does his work neatly and he has   good manners he's a joy to be around his second  grade teacher wrote Teddy's an excellent student   well-liked by his classmates but he's troubled  because his mother has a terminal illness and life   at home must be a struggle his third grade teacher  wrote his mother's death has been hard on him he  
(09:46) tries to do his best but his father doesn't show  much interest and his home life will soon affect   him if steps aren't taken Teddy's fourth grade  teacher wrote Teddy's withdrawn and doesn't show   up much interest in school he doesn't have many  friends and sometimes he even sleeps in class by   now Mrs Thompson realized the problem and she was  ashamed of herself she felt even worse when her   students brought her Christmas presents wrapped  in beautiful ribbons and bright paper except for  
(10:15) Teddy's his present was clumsily wrapped in his  heavy brown paper that he got from the grocery   bag Mrs Thompson took pains to open it in the  middle of the other present some of the children   started the when she found a rhinestone bracelet  with some of the stones missing and a bottle that   was one qu full of perfume but she stifled her  children's laughter when she exclaimed how pretty   the bracelet was putting it on and dabbing some  of the perfume on her wrist Teddy Stoddard stayed  
(10:46) after school that day just long enough to say Mrs  Thompson today you smell just like my mom used   to after the children left she cried for at least  an hour on the very day she quit teaching Reading   Writing and arithmetic and instead she began  to teach children Mrs Thompson paid particular   attention to Teddy as she worked with him and his  mind seemed to come alive the more she encouraged   him the faster he responded by the end of the year  Teddy had become one of the smartest children in   the class and despite her lie became one of her  teachers pets a year later she found a note under  
(11:26) the door from Teddy telling her that she was still  the best teacher he ever had in his whole life six   years went by before she got another note from  Teddy he then wrote that he had finished High   School third in his class and she was still the  best teacher he ever had in his whole life four   years after that she got another letter saying  that while things had been tough at times he   stayed in school and stuck with it and would soon  graduate from college with the highest of honors   he assured Mrs Thompson that she was still the  very best and favorite teacher he ever had in  
(11:58) his whole life then four more years passed and  yet another letter came this time he explained   that after he got his bachelor's degree he decided  to go a little further the letter explained that   she was still the best and favorite teacher he  ever had but now his name was a little longer   the letter was signed Theodore F Stoddard MD but  the story doesn't end there you see there was   yet another letter that spring Teddy said he'd met  this girl and was going to be married he explained  
(12:29) that his father had died a couple of years ago and  he was wondering if Mrs Thompson might agree to   sit in the place at the wedding that was usually  reserved for the mother of the groom of course   Mrs Thompson did and guess what she wore that  bracelet the one with the several rhinestones   missing and she made sure she was wearing the  perfume that Teddy remembered his mother wearing   on their last Christmas together they hugged each  other and Dr Stoddard whispered in Mrs Thompson's   ear thank you so much for making me feel important  and showing me that I could make a difference Mrs  
(13:03) Thompson came with tears in her eyes and whispered  back Teddy you have it all wrong you were the one   who taught me that I could make a difference I  didn't know how to teach until I met you isn't   that a beautiful story that symbolizes there are  no Justified resentments work at reaching that   $32,000 level the place where the only thing you  have to send is love because that's what's inside   and that's the message of our greatest spiritual  teachers that's all they ever had to give away
