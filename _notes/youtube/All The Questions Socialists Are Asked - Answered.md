Transcript:
(00:11) all right hakeem let's get right down to it i've got a question uh from justin here oh and he's getting into the thick of it with my boy gnome so justin or actually is uh juicin j-u-s-i-n uh juicin asks one argument made by chomsky when he compares indian and chinese famines is that india had a more open media environment which forced the government to intervene productively when journalists would expose malpractices resulting in starvation or other humanitarian crises the soviet union like china did not have
(00:42) this they chose not to be public about the events in ukraine because this would have been the basis of a crisis of domestic and international legitimacy what do you make of this argument from chomsky and what maya tell us about how we view the scale of these famines that occurred in both communist states and i just want to commend juice an amazing question that's a very interesting question um and i can reread it if you would chew on it a little bit more there no that yeah yeah no that's fine don't
(01:11) worry um i think we can split that into two bits the first part is about uh journalistic freedom uh and then the second part uh is about um the uh publicity uh of the famines uh on the first part i agree wholeheartedly um there is and historically has been uh an issue with uh let's say uh levels of journalistic um observation we could say of these events and that occurred both in china and the ussr but uh with the necessary caveats i'll answer in the second half of this but you're very much correct this is
(01:46) something that needs to be rectified in the future we shouldn't have um there is two sides to it right uh on one hand we understand that the press like everything else in a modern nation state can be used by different entities for different purposes so for example if there is a possibility for a particular group to use it to spread let's say anti-semitic or racist or or sexist remarks and attempt to popularize them in society these are things that can be combated but on the other hand free access of information especially when it
(02:20) is a vital importance to people's lives and access to the things that the need uh this is something of utmost importance and should be um allowed to an extent so this is very much so an error of former socialism that needs to be corrected in future attempts uh as for the second part of the question on the publicity aspect uh i would disagree uh in that um the claim there for example when we were taking the 1931 ip3232 famine uh is that there was no publicity the thing is that the central government didn't even know what was
(02:49) happening until maybe the mid uh mid 1931 so it's been already going on for a little bit uh this happened because of numerous issues particularly mid-level official corruption uh and also the fact that that there was very primitive um we got to remember that most of these countries for example uh the ussr and china came from incredibly um poor uh agrarian semi-feudal um states and as a result they did not have the infrastructure for communication that we kind of take for granted today most of the time it was either through
(03:19) telegrams or through people personally delivering letters for the uh for example in china and uh with that i think we can see that uh there's more numerous there that's very difficult to have this open amount of information be spread especially when uh the government who needs to know the most about the situation could barely even get a hold of um the information necessary what's exactly going on you even see it in telegrams uh that have been um what's the english word for this declassified i believe yeah declassified
(03:51) um from the soviet archives where you see the central government some of the telegrams being signed directly by stalin saying what is going on we have no idea what's going on why don't you guys why where is this information why is it two weeks late blah blah there are several of these um that you see so it shows that the chaos are the thing when it comes to the chinese experience it's similar but it's also way more nuanced than that uh well can i can i say wait a minute or live sure that we could find yeah i'm
(04:14) sure that we can find go ahead in numerous um telegrams from donald trump right now at the pinnacle of human telecommunications where he's like what's going on what the  is happening and so forth um i the first part of your argument is really strong uh where you say that um that it it took a while to understand the um the capacity of um uh like the the depth and scope that was going on but the they did have modern telegraphic communications at that point we're relatively modern i don't uh well let me not
(04:46) let me not wait in too deep but i do want to move the ama along i think that's a good answer um sure i'd like to go to uh chimichanga's answer right here chimichangas asks why do you think the value of items is objective and not subjective when there are multiple examples to prove you otherwise for example the value of a code changes depending on what season we're in and if you're going to say price and value are different then explain cryptocurrencies is there a difference between their price and their value
(05:13) when they directly correlate based on scarcity yeah i really like this question um because the person answers it and then when they uh assume that i'm gonna state the answer the correct answer to that then they're like oh well if you're gonna say this then what is above this but the second part is also answered by the first part um so first thing is um when it comes to objectivity of values you need to understand that first of all there's a misunderstanding that goes on between um uh price and value between uh
(05:43) the the basic this is the best way of uh actually internalizing the marxist criticism um of capitalism uh always remember that when we have discussions for example between value and price remember that the assumption there is that supply and demand is equalized that's why and we see that when we have such in the real world these situations rarely occur but we can empirically create them uh in when testing right and when we do do that we see that price does generally fluctuate to uh levels as high as 98 uh around the value
(06:19) the labor input of said commodity which is very interesting um but the thing about the for example like a code is more or less valuable depending it doesn't matter what you personally perceive it as right if supply and demand were equalized then it would be the value wouldn't change what you're seeing is a difference in the supply and the demand happening there's a higher supply in winter and a lower supply uh excuse me higher uh demanding winter and a higher and a lower demand uh in summer and as a
(06:48) result because of the higher demand in winter people want it more hence the price goes up if there's a lower demand in summer then there are less people want it and as a result the price goes down um as for cryptocurrency this is very interesting especially when we get into the discussion of fiat currencies and whatnot um there's some interesting stuff that's been written on this but generally from the marxist position you're going to realize that when it comes to cryptocurrencies that's nothing more
(07:10) than your electricity bill being monetized essentially there is a value uh there is a social institute or labor time for recreating for example a bitcoin right now um that can change depending on the amount of effort that needs to go into your creating and people say oh it's just a click of a button but when you do mining nowadays um you have to take into account for example all the labor that goes into everything you need to get that uh to get the mind done which includes the electricity includes the computer
(07:34) components includes the networks all the engineers that uh put the system together and what have you um and the reason that there is uh heightened uh like let's say the price is the same price is very high is because there's speculation on these right people want to hoard coins so that the price goes up so then they sell it right this is still a supply and demand argument you're not getting to the core which is value if you want to understand value then marx has an excellent essay called value price and profit is very
(08:04) short it's very concise um and i highly recommend you take a look at it it'll clear up all these and more there's also another one called wage labor and capital these two essays if you were to take a look at them you're gonna get i get i'd say the gist of the marxist criticism of uh capitalism without having to touch capital which i still recommend you do it's not nearly as hard as people make it out to be all right great let's take a deep breath you have uh you have at least two hours
(08:26) here uh wally p okay tj sillius 24 7 um asks why are you akami and if you wouldn't mind detailing uh what a particular flavor of communism is most appealing to you and why sure i'd love to uh by the way apologies if i speak quickly that's just my natural right now speech i realized i need to slow down sometimes yeah just a tiny bit you know we're all friends here yeah my apologies of course yeah no i'm having a great time i love doing these amaze because people come with very um uh they're very open with their
(09:03) questions they don't uh hide any punches is that the english saying you know what i'm trying to say they're right in your face yeah but yeah so so why am i communism what is the flavor of marxists that i am that i consider to or socialist that i consider to be ideal uh the reason i am a marxist personally is because well i'm iraqi and my personal experience has been growing up in this country is that of um continued uh imperial aggression against my country um that and also i lived in a or i grew
(09:35) up in an environment that was uh of an anti-colonial flavor let's say um and that kind of parallels a lot of third world people in their their uh politics um but for the longest time it was just that i was just a lukewarm like anti-colonial vaguely anti-imperialist i know i didn't like the way that the big quote-unquote big countries bullied the small countries and i had no fundamental understanding or framework around that um a couple years passed i uh come across um the writings of marx while i'm doing my own political
(10:10) research um and uh i decided to read marks first and i read lenin afterwards and reading lenin's imperialism uh at the highest stage of capitalism really gave me that fundamental framework of what i was feeling why why is finance capital monopolies uh this conquering of new markets why is it that sometimes it's insidious like imf loans why is it sometimes outright with military action um this is this was like the first step to seeing the light you could say for me uh then afterwards i delved deep into the criticism of
(10:42) capitals because i had my own vague criticisms of capitals that almost everybody does right with their political assistant i had those same criticisms they were kind of untargeted uh but i uh took a look look into that i read the criticisms of capitals that existed uh i looked into the histories of the different socialist countries i looked into the history of liberalism for example um and as an ideological trend uh and that kind of helped me understand why the world is the way it is why things have historically happened and what
(11:10) the future could possibly look like um it kind of gives you like this holistic approach uh it isn't a dogma it isn't something that's meant to you know like see appear into the future right it's not like this crystal ball but uh it gives you the tools to carry out an empiric and material analysis of the world around you and to arrive at uh answers that can somewhat at least reflect the realities of the world you live in rather than give you you know um vague platitudes or sophistry uh about you know uh freedom and and
(11:43) and uh all that kind of yeah uh relatively vague talk so that's why i'm an artist i i was vaguely you know by my environment and i decided to read and that made me and that's my recommendation to everybody if you have criticisms of marxism or um you just kind of don't know where you politically stand approach the literature it's a lot easier to read than people make it out to be it's very interesting even if you disagree with it which you're well within your right to um it will still kind of give you food for
(12:09) thought you know if you disagree with 95 hey you'll get five percent that's kind of good that you can cooperate to your own personal perspective it's lovely so do uh if you want to do the reading do the reading yeah that's for the next part yeah yeah yeah don't worry i remember thank you for keeping tabs on it though i really appreciate yeah yeah yeah if you hear me like being like that's that's me moving the conversation along there so yeah yeah by all means i do appreciate you thank you
(12:34) um my uh particular flavor i'm marxist lannist and i uh believe personally that uh it has marcellinism is the um uh i don't wanna use the word ideology per se but it is the approach um that has best uh described understood the world as i see it and as i've lived it and uh it is the uh thing that gives me the tools or uh historic players given many different kinds of people across the earth many millions of people across the earth the tools to um grab like to to have to grab life by the hand by the horns let's say to to be able to
(13:13) change their current uh state um and to be able to analyze the situation the way that it is um the reason i'm not an anarchist or other variants of marxism is a mixture of uh lack of historical uh relevance and um uh success uh to be very blunt with it and secondly also the uh approach yeah and the approach of their analysis is usually very either muddled or just kind of placed or somewhat skewed in one way um and that's kind of why i choose marcelino but really if you the fundamental is i read lenin and that
(13:50) kind of like brought everything into place and then i read mal and i was like wow okay yeah this is really this is the box that i want to sit in okay so that's my recommendation read learn read now then see if you're a marxist linus if not hey all is fair okay so our next question comes to us from ali nali so ali nali says i've heard marx describe democratic socialists or revisionists as dictatorship of the bourgeoisie can you elaborate more on how that looks in our current day and age sure um i would like to see uh
(14:25) where this person saw marx commenting this um because the concept of democratic socialist didn't exist um back then um yeah like i think i think he's um he's a little bit um incorrectly paraphrasing but the phrase dictatorship of the bourgeoisie so i think what he's asking here is to draw a parallel from his idea of a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie to perhaps how uh the party has been co-opted uh by wealthy status seekers now um or or how do you feel about it for sure yeah yeah uh i just wanna i was just
(14:59) saying that just to give clarity um for people who aren't who are unaware of marx's works um marx i believe never really used the term revisionist nor had to use the term democratic socialist um but when if you're meaning um generally like uh those that would be considered to serve the interests uh of a dictatorship dictatorship to bourgeoisie first of all let's define our terms what is the dictation of the bourgeoisie so when we have a state right the concept of a state um it is a class dominated thing it is
(15:28) not class neutral right there is a certain class character to each state that exists in the world um and uh when we define if it's a dictatorship of the virtuosity or dictatorship of the proletariat it doesn't particularly mean it is a literal dictatorship in the like roman sense right uh what it means is that that only that class's um interests are uh let's say um pushed forth or advocated for by the state because the state directly serves those interests um the united states for example is a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie
(16:04) how is this empirically proven how can we see this well uh it's not too difficult to take a look at it's not an idea of oh um there is a co-opting of the democratic almost like a class neutral democratic system to the interests of the wealthy no the system is simply built from the its very first brick to support the interest of the rolling class of the bourgeoisie of those that own the means of production own capital right how can this be uh like evidenced well number one lobbying that exists in the united states
(16:37) when we take a look at lobbying or basically it's bribing by another term really uh what it is is it's pushing minority quote unquote minority minority interests meaning minority as in like uh industry uh interests meaning like large business interests it never means like for example hey let's try to get more um african-american women to universities that's not the sort of minority interest we're talking about um these sort of modalities let's say for influencing state policy exist not only this excuse me it is very late
(17:08) here and i've been talking all day uh because i just got off work so my voice may sound a little weak now yeah but um not only this but we also have uh something that's i think everybody's experienced in their life particularly in the united states for example is that look around you look around your community look around the things that need to be done what is the stuff that almost everybody that you talk to generally wants to have at least to some extent some level of uh education that's uh free and of high
(17:37) quality and provided by the state or not even provided by at least accessible education um some level of healthcare whether you want to be single-payer or universal order some level of healthcare that's accessible to the majority of the population some level of state subsidization for uh for example life-saving medicines so people in the united states don't need to go um and pay 600 per insulin dose for example um the infrastructure of the united states to help you get to and from work and school and to your grocery store and
(18:07) stuff like that um people would like to see that improved people would like to see um increased opportunities for their children uh for for example employment so they don't have to like slave away in like intern jobs and be paid nothing only to get maybe a whiff of employment you know all these sort of things when you look at the united states as it is for example right now you see that all of these things that would serve the interests of the proletariat of the working class so the vast majority of people are not catered
(18:32) to right but what do we see like in real policy we see things that advance the interests of the military-industrial complex we see things that uh advance the interests of pharmaceutical companies we see high cups on prices on things that everyday people need while also we see tax cuts for the richest even if on occasion some like a democrat comes into power and there's some level of uh you know slightly increased tax on the wealthy it is so superficial and so easy to get out of that it practically is null why is it that in a supposedly
(19:07) class neutral democratic system the interests of the vast majority of people are completely ignored while the interests of a small minority do that number in the thousands really like three five ten thousand people maybe right why is it that their interests are catered to that's because the system is not class neutral and that's because we live in a so-called dictatorship of the bourgeoisie now as to the solution many people have different ideas social democrats think that there should be just more city over
(19:32) sight and more like a nationalization of some certain industries marxist leninist or marxist of all flavors uh think that there should be an abolition of capitalism uh marxists believe that we should conquer state power anarchists think that we should just do away with the state altogether the solution and the potential future is up to you to decide based on your own reading but what i want to impart on to you is that that the current system we live in isn't as class neutral some people say it is and that's what marxists mean when
(19:58) they say dictation i hope that's a clear answer as to what that means it's a very lengthy answer to the question right there i don't think anybody who's uh educated in the united states uh thinks of it as a glass of society um i think it's there's a little bit of a straw man argument there uh no i don't mean it i don't mean it um and that way i mean i never said classless i mean that the democratic system the us is neutral meaning right right like class neutral and close as being different from each other
(20:29) classless means no classes that exist meaning there's no working class no uh bourgeoisie that's not what i mean what i mean is that class neutral means it doesn't serve any class in society despite there being classes in society it doesn't serve either or you know it's neutral whoever it's one person one vote you know that that's the kind of idea that i'm trying to impart and how and my point being is that it is somewhat flawed um because in reality it's not one person one vote it's
(20:53) one dollar one vote and the people who have the most dollars end up with the most votes okay yeah again even from that standpoint i think it's like a little bit reductive but um i do want to do so and i want to apologize for a little bit stepping on you earlier in the thing i'm having a little bit of trouble just uh keeping up with the pace of conversation he said you've been talking all day but it did not slow you in the slightest all right so sniper king says do you think the actions the chinese government took
(21:23) during the 1989 tiananmen square protests were justified or correct and i'd like to know just in general your feelings on the current state of uh china and uh and how you feel it reflects uh what's going on with marxism worldwide yeah for sure this is a very very large question um so i'm going to try to very briefly because there's a lot that would be neat there's three sections of this question um that would need to be covered so i'm gonna try to do it yeah um and the first thing is uh the
(21:55) question of the tiananmen square and what occurred and if i think it's justified um it depends on what you mean by justified because if we're talking about how the uh event is covered um or is currently understood the popular understanding of the of the event uh in western spaces um and the events that actually transcribed that actually went on and then there are some let's say disparities between those two views if you want to take like a deep look into it then there's a really good reading list that
(22:27) is compiled by the chicao collective i believe that's how it's pronounced but it's written spell it's spelled a q-i-a-o collective and they have a um a long um reading list on the dtm square exactly what happened they use i think almost entirely western sources so you can take a look at that and see for yourself uh but generally um if they were justified uh the the what's it called oh my lord so yeah my english fails me sometimes um sequence of events that's the term that i was looking for
(22:57) the sequence of events was as such um there was an occupation by mostly students uh within the square um they weren't advocating for um free it's like just some vague aspect of freedom that as it was painted as it was incredibly diverse movement there are some that were for example mouse and want to return to more male-like policies there were some who were wanted the dangerous um opening up uh and reforms to go even further than they had um there are some that wanted outright to transition to capitalism there's some
(23:26) that wanted more of a uh liberal democratic system but still with a attempted socialist um economic policy uh it was a very complex uh movement uh number one number two we should not overstate the size of the movement um we all remember that uh china's a country of a population of over a billion people um i think at the time was 1.
(23:46) 1 billion people and this uh movement was no larger than what 70 000 people that were present there so it really isn't representative of the chinese people it is better to say it's more representative of a certain layer of the intelligentsia within chinese society particularly within the universities and that is evident in their um demands which included mostly things that only catered to intelligence which included political power for intelligence um increased pay for those who are part of intelligentsia um certain access things within
(24:17) universities and whatnot uh it was a very uh the the this is the aspect that was really highlighted by western media as almost like the only part of the movement uh that's the part i'm talking about um but yeah they occupied the square um and they're asked to leave and they held their place um and this the people on the square were peaceful what occurred outside the square around the square though was certain levels of violence if people are unaware before any troops were mobilized before any shots were
(24:44) fired um numerous uh chinese soldiers that were just um if you don't know by the way in case you're unaware because in the united states i don't know if it's the same but in most third world countries and china is included in this um it's very normal to see a uniformed soldier on the street in fact it's very normal to see them just going out and about uh previously or they might be more in charge of a particular place yeah in the united states if you're um essentially if you're in proximity to a
(25:09) military base you'll see in uniform or military personnel fairly frequently but it's nowhere near the level of um that you would see in a place like mexico or honduras um where some are there for security presence and i think in in china at the time we would see a lot more who were this just there in uniform to lend security more so than just going on their day-to-day operations for sure exactly thank you for uh much more eloquently being much more eloquent with what i was trying to say yeah exactly that um and what happened
(25:42) outside the square before any military being fired or any violence took place was um severe violence against those uh soldiers that were present most of them were unarmed by the way several were burned alive even um and this was recorded by uh reported on excuse me by western media and that's when uh the events transcribed um on the square itself no massacre took place what happened around the square though that's where the violence took place it's a maybe a pedantic point uh but that's why i don't like the term for example
(26:12) tiananmen square massacre it's a bit uh incorrect um and by the way the western media sources if you go back and look at the bbc reporting and whatnot you'll see in fact there's even a uh the u.s embassy in beijing there was a wikileaks documents that show that they even admit that there was no american officials which were in the uh at the square and also reported to the embassy in beijing the american embassy uh that there was no uh master that took place on the square itself um but yeah so to say if it was justified or not let
(26:48) me ask let me invert the question um because by the way if you didn't know um the movement which is a very uh this is very uh well documented all the student leaders and all the leaders of it completely the ones that were highlighted by the u.s by the way all of them got direct diplomatic and monetary financial support from the united states and associated groups that the united states supported um and you can see that by the fact that all of the people who are in charge of the movement um a few of them were
(27:13) imprisoned for several years and let go like two three years uh sentences and then let go uh after which um they immigrated to the us or they just directly immigrated after the uh press descended to the us and all of them are in uh highly lucrative financial sectors all of them uh lay their lives in the u.
(27:34) s right now um with uh yeah i'm gonna try to get at is that that is a very interesting point and i'd like to turn that back to the artist imagine if in the united states um there were like protests that massive protests would um that occurred which were directly supported by chinese money um that uh had uh people that were directly in contact with chinese officials um that uh when the movement then fails by the way after they uh assault uh numerous officials and and uh personnel uh burning some alive even and then afterwards they leave to china
(28:04) where they end up being very uh in very lucrative positions wouldn't you assume maybe china had some part in this movement uh and by the way i don't mean the entire tiananmen square movement there are certain sectors of that movement that did have genuine grievances that's now i'm trying i'm not trying to explain that china is perfect it never was and never is um even currently it isn't uh but the point i'm trying to get is get at is the uh american perception or the western media perspective on the tiananmen square
(28:31) movement and the small sector that they decided to highlight is suspect but there are other issues that were um protests at the time for example the dismantling of the iron rice bowl was something that was discussed especially by the mao sectors of the movement that existed in the square of the time that is a very uh fair criticism to be meant to be made um there are some criticisms that are made of corruption um particularly within uh universities but also the government those are also fair criticisms to be made but what i find interesting is that
(29:00) the united states uh and like official support never highlighted those grievances that directly affected people's like livelihoods employment uh access to education where they are uh instead this decided to highlight very vague platitudes of oh democracy oh freedom um yeah that's kind of my my hope of like other that my hope is that you understand my perspective if you really are interested by the way i and i strongly uh i strongly suggest people do the readings they're interested to see like what my
(29:28) perspective personally would be in more detail um check out that uh uh child collect chow collective uh q i a u collective uh reading list um you'll find it on google if you uh look it up as for the other questions on china i think they're in the ama there are further questions on china later so we'll get to a little bit later there i think that was a pretty extensive answer to the question there uh let's move up to um and just to be fair there like a lot of the a lot of the criticisms there like similar uh like
(29:58) um and not to get in an argument or whatever but they're just about any large protest movement whether it's happening in hong kong whether it's happening in russia whether it's happening in the united states will have uh foreign backers and agitators attached to it it's just too profitable uh not to do um so yeah it's not it's not unique to the situation i think that your claims um are are most likely accurate and the cia was probably involved um but just about every place where power is shifting
(30:28) or an agitators will be in there trying to get a piece of the pie yeah definitely okay so let's go to chief pot leaf uh who says you have read settlers before and other books similar to this topic but i've never seen you talk specifically about uh uh native american or amer indian slash canadian uh issues so i wanna ask what your opinions are on decolonization in north america generally and what marxists should do regarding that also if you could say something about specific events or movements uh like the what sue
(31:00) whitten pipeline blockade the dakota access pipeline missing and murdered indigenous women and girls etc that would be amazing but i don't expect you to know about these yes thank you um the first uh just on the first point that i have read uh settlers i have readers it's an absolutely excellent work of course you should um read it to the critical eye but i would say it's maybe like 80 percent correct 20 a bit iffy um on its political conclusions but i recommend everybody particularly americans particularly those
(31:34) who are non-white americans but even those who are white uh should read um settlers it's an absolutely excellent work as for the question of indigenous uh issues within the us and whatnot you're correct that i haven't spoken about this extensively because i simply lack the knowledge uh i'm sad to say and this is actually a failure on my part and i do apologize for this um i have not done the necessary reading on the topic uh and i hope to eventually um but i currently as of now i have not uh not only this but i have little to no
(32:04) contact of people of indigenous origin um or sources information about them uh so that's a failure on my part but also um i feel not qualified um to talk about such issues and i would very much like if there was an person who was indigenous from the u.s or just latin america or canada who would like to talk about these issues uh and if you would by the way and you'd start a channel and whatnot then please just hit me up in the dms we can talk and i'll gladly boost your channel because this is something that does need
(32:29) to be covered um yeah yeah oh sorry please make sure yeah uh as for the question itself and my perspective i think that one of the if not the greatest tragedy of humanity thus far has been the administration and absolute complete destruction decimation of the native american identity native american indigenous i don't like the term native american because yeah um you're describing already a colonial name on to them yeah exactly but yeah most of amer indians do not uh prefer native american it's a it's a
(33:05) confabulation obviously um so i would say uh it's uh one of the greatest tragedies it's not the strategy of humanity what has been done to them and how they have to this day not been able to achieve even a level of dignity from what they've had for example you look at the statistics the uh unemployment and poverty and alcoholism rates uh amongst them are some of the highest in north america particularly us but even in canada um the uh disgusting level of um racial propaganda like um or uh almost like uh
(33:41) um like eugenic like um policies that are they were targeted with um throughout their history but even up to this day with for example sterilization indigenous women in prisons for example um it is like i i it is beyond um angry to even know about it as to what marxist should do um this is a group of people that we have to learn from we have to uh boost their messages and we have to personally internalize their assessment of the american question meaning what to do with the united states suppose revolution were to happen
(34:13) which we should be working towards how the united states and canada all these post colonial places um i mean like uh after uh the revolution they become postcolonial what to do with them how do we divide the nations up do we have to do a reintroduction of native american languages um and have them be like reinvigorated spoken and reused widely in society um is there an issue with uh let's say um uh educational access and whatnot which there definitely is but how we'd go about that all these issues i'm not qualified on
(34:46) native american comrades are so those are the people you should talk to and those are the people that should uh be uh have their voices heard and ask for marxist organizations they should internalize their critiques and their suggestions um so that hopefully um in the future what has done what has been done cannot be undone but at least maybe um some amends can be made and their future history can be more bright and that's kind of a yeah my loose answer but i'm sorry if it's a bit unclear no no that's fair
(35:15) um and just to anybody watching or listening right now uh if you are an expert in amerindian studies um or want to talk on here we'd be happy to host an ama with you i will be in window rock doing doing research on the navajo in early 2022 so i'm happy to uh uh meet up with anybody out there who wants to do a live interview on this thing okay uh and text defuncts here um this may not be a fair question but i'm gonna read it anyway because i've read all the other questions so far so text defuncts says in your opinion
(35:45) are labor camps a justifiable form of punishment in any case uh and the reason why i feel that this question is not super unfair uh or is not totally fair at this point is at present every uh prison in the united states of america is more or less a labor camp at this point to like uh like not to get too deep into it uh but if you feel this is an interesting question we can proceed if not i'm happy to move to the next sure go ahead i'm sorry i didn't hear the question the question is are labor camps a justifiable form of
(36:17) punishment uh and just in the u.s that's the only form of punishment that we really use yeah for sure um so the question of labor camps so historically they have been used um and uh to this day like you said um they are still used for example in the united states um with the 13th amendment and whatnot um so it is a thing that is done now ask the question of its effectiveness effectiveness effectivity my god my english is failing excuse efficacy yeah try efficacy yes he's a superior thank you so much yeah um
(36:48) well in my personal perspective there's two views number one i would like to see extensive um research into this and empirical uh data on this to see if it is a good method of um rehabilitation if it is then it should be continued to be then they should it should still remain at least as a form not as the soul form but it should be there um as for the second side uh imagine you have like a place let's uh remove all the political badges let's say okay you have a bunch of people one you have three guys right one of them uh
(37:21) is like a known public harasser of let's say women another guy is known for or has been caught embezzling state funds and a third guy has been um for example i don't know some other more or less illegal activity that you can imagine i don't know let's say dealing drugs um yeah exactly dealing drugs and i don't mean just like as a low person who's um like who's in poverty and has to use this as a you know let's say it's like a middle level guy in a in a sort of organization that
(37:50) deals drugs maybe he's the guy who procures and he has like a great in investment in this uh endeavor let's say so you have these three guys let's say you catch them all and you want to put them in prison and you have two options either you can leave them in prison and let them basically eat up from the social surplus let's say in the united states would be taxes for example tax money they'd sit they they eat they live their life but they don't contribute anything back to society and they're not really being
(38:12) rehabilitated they're just they're just living their life but in prison so their freedoms are restricted that's one option what about you have another option where these people are put to uh work not only are they put to work but after work they have to attend classes directly um related to their particular crime uh they get a proper ideological education they try to weed out whatever anti-social elements they may have um for example the person who deals drugs uh would have access to people who are
(38:39) whose lives have been destroyed by drugs who who they would be able to talk to them see the actual negative impact they have the person who's in belle's embezzling state funds maybe he could see what that money would have gone for and what you know you get what i'm trying to see um maybe you're describing the way that prison currently exists here i can't i'm not qualified to speak on iraqi prisons but those are all things that we do right now in america yeah but also to from mine you can't go
(39:02) to prison as a drug dealer and not see like people who are  uh like literally uh smoking like paper that's been doused and raid that's true uh but what i mean is uh uh there's a i think a miscommunication in terms uh what i mean uh is ideological re-education it isn't just like hey come take a look at this person i'm talking about actual classes um that are relatively uh stringent upon this um it is practically like courses that they'd have to do not only this but this is coupled with the labor
(39:32) um so it is uh more uh let's say um maybe some people would dislike this perspective hey um if you want to disagree with this that's perfectly fine and i would be more than happy to hear what your proposals would be so that i could correct my view if your view that you believe superior uh if maybe you can turn me on to your side um but yeah my uh general point is you can either have them just sitting and rotting or you can have them put to work in the united states what happens is they are put to work and they do get some education but level
(40:00) education is not nearly adequate um there is massive levels of inequality um when it comes to first of all exposure to it attendance of it as well as um like racial and you know these more unpleasant aspects um like very significantly prison to prison uh and just because so many of the prisons are privatized by different corporations is really like a little bit of a crapshoot uh which um prison supplying system in your area uh like what subcontractor handles the education and so forth and the when you talk about cost attack
(40:31) pay taxpayers uh often like costs to house an inmate are upwards of like in some cases 150 juveniles i know can be like 300 to 400 a day just to house them so that's my point yeah uh so in the united states the education they get is inadequate and the level and they do labor but labor is for just cheap labor for like you know uh silicon valley tech bros or other you know like for large industries that you society will never see the benefit of now that's in the capitalist system in the social system uh the idea on historically what had
(41:03) been done to an extent is that they would have proper ideological uh education to weed out these uh elements that exist within this person basically uh with um extensive say like uh multifactorial or um eclectic let's say that's a better word eclectic approach to it uh either from uh like medical site um and psychological psychiatric help to uh vocational training too on and on as well as uh these people will be put to labor but not for a small minority of very rich people to make stuff but instead um to basically to not to give profits
(41:35) to a small minority but instead they could contribute to for example infrastructure projects of the nation so they could give back to the country that for example the embezzler stole money from for example right to build roads and bridges and all that kind of stuff to build schools and hospitals um yeah and of course we did that in the us prior to uh privatization there was a lot more of that kind of chain gang labor here in the us but as soon as we started privatizing all those gains were they only um did uh forced labor that was
(42:05) benef benefiting like the parent corporation exactly right and just one more point i'd like to say um historically both in the united states and in former socialist countries and across the whole world there have been a grave um what's the word uh injustice is committed in in prisons funnily enough when you look at the history it's way greater in some countries than others but that still doesn't excuse for example any sort of justice that may happen if somebody is being rehabilitated that means they
(42:35) should still get an adequate um like have adequate housing they should still have adequate access to nutrition and healthcare um for example uh the soviet union early on wasn't good at this they got much better later on for example if people are aware the the famous dissident soldier nitsan he's the one who wrote the gulag archipelago he had cancer in um in the gulag when he was imprisoned and he got treatment for his cancer uh to the point of remission he was cured um i'm saying that this is something
(43:02) that should be even if the people may be um if you have for example in a bezler or a drug or whatever that doesn't mean they shouldn't be barred from having proper um health care and adequate access to nutrition and uh activities that like you know they should be able to play a game of football if they want to um and have access to even education if they wanted so let's always strive to be better and also recognize the mistakes of the past and criticize them and criticize them very ruthless uh ruthless
(43:31) ruthlessly excuse me i hope that's my point all right great let's move on to our next question here i'm seeing a few complaints in the chat that you are not being challenged enough on your beliefs i'm supposed to be like a mostly impartial moderator for people like viewing in the background i only try to call out factual disparities and add whatever small bit of personal experience i might have there but i'm not in a debate uh with uh with uh this is an amen so uh yeah and like it's not a free ride
(44:02) either but um yeah yeah let's go to wardia yeah ceo of excuse me okay please uh i would just like to say yeah like you said yeah this isn't ask me anything so it was just a question and answers thing if you personally have uh something that you'd like to challenge me on or ask me about feel free to dm me i will answer your dm so please go and and write up whatever you will and i'll listen to your grievances and i'll give my perspective and we can have a nice discussion later that's an awesome offer right there and
(44:27) not one that um uh many of our people who do amas are prepared to make so please take advantage of that everybody uh because we're going through these but uh he's got a lot to say and i'm just trying to get through these questions we'll speed up a little bit i think so warty who is apparently the ceo of based takes um he says that considering 68 of the world's richest are self-made and oh my god that like i i that does not look like an accurate statistic to me right here um so but it's a cnbc article so it's
(44:59) got to be true do you think it's moral to seize the means of production from them and he cites a cnbc article uh from 2019 majority of the world's uh richest people are self-made says new report right there that's not how my understanding of gender relational work and then we go the report was released by wealth x so i'm going to do some um hustling on uh this in the background right there but his question once again is he states that 68 of the world's richest people are self-made which i i doesn't seem accurate to me
(45:32) but i'm going to look into it in the background do you think it's moral to seize the means of production from them yeah sure so uh first of all i would strongly or highly that the statistic is very suspect i would uh encourage people to take a look into the methodology of linking the uh i'm looking at the uh the chat channel for the ama if anybody else wants to look into this and potentially find if it's uh accurate or not there so that's not i'm sure they're they're doing uh they're lying by a mission or um they're
(46:04) trying to uh they've um redefined a few terms to get to this pleasant statistic um vast majority of wealth that currently exists in the united states especially of very wealthy people it's either generational wealth um or um basically gained through illicit means or less than illicit means and most of the people have generation generation wealth uh have got it um through a list of means back in the day um so that's just generally how the trend is so i'm very that statistic seems very suspect but
(46:34) let's take it at face value let's pretend that it's true all right let's say that two-thirds of all people are self-made who become billionaires let's say or the mega wealthy whatever you want to define it as if that is the case then let me ask you this how do people make all that wealth where is the profit coming from jeff bezos let's take an example how has he become the richest man in the world right he has uh amazon fine okay um let's say he didn't get any help from let's say he did stay started
(47:05) himself he didn't by the way but let's say um he didn't have any outside help even if at the end of the day he did everything like he built it uh himself and then afterwards now he just stands a ceo he currently earns what something like uh tens of millions of dollars per minute or something or per per day or something or even more than that some basically a staggering amount right let's say let's make it less let's say he earns a thousand dollars a minute or thousand dollars an hour let's say um
(47:33) which is way understating how much he gains if that's truly the case um how much does the average amazon worker get per hour i believe their average their yearly wage is like what like thirty thousand dollars let's make it higher let's make it like fifty thousand dollars fine um do you personally believe that or can you qualify that uh jeff bezos works one thousand ten thousand a hundred that a hundred thousand times harder than the average um person uh who works at amazon let's say let's turn the
(48:03) argument around let's say you have an engineer at amazon he's very smart with his work and he does everything he's supposed to do would you say that jeff bezos works um also a thousand ten thousand hundred thousand times harder or smarter than that engineer you can't make this uh criticism uh even particularly from a moral perspective now that's number one number two then we actually need to look at the origin of profit here's where moralism goes out the window because i don't like moral arguments
(48:25) uh profit vast majority of profit comes from surplus value meaning there's the extraction of surplus value from the labor of others this is not a moral argument this is a empirically proven thing not only this but aside from extraction forcible extraction of surplus value there is also wage theft these are two independent things um that occurs um there's also illegal stuff stuff that is considered legal but isn't usually uh prosecuted things like uh 39-hour contracts things to avoid paying benefits things
(48:53) to avoid paying overtime for example all of these things lead to basically a build-up of wealth um that is illicitly gained that's my general point um now what my question is let's say uh all like let's just take it at face value amazon exists right you have jeff visas and a few board of directors up and the tens of thousands under the hundreds of thousands of workers that work underneath um who let's talk about interests of society what would be better for jeff bezos to maintain his wealth and for those small board of directors to do
(49:28) that or to turn that massive enterprise that by the way uses economic planning uh in case people want to there's no market allocation when it comes to amazon or walmart or any of these uh there's a really good book written about that called people's republic of walmart actually so you should check that out um but uh this uh enterprise would it be better to keep it in the hands of this small minority that just does it for their profit or would it be better to put it in the hands of the workers themselves
(49:50) so they turn it into a cooperative that they run on a democratic basis so that they can both ensure the quality of their own products as well as ensure the well-being of the workers that work that job so that amazon workers wouldn't have to pee in bottles and while they're speeding on the highway to do a prime time delivery you know i'm trying to it's more of a let's say a bombastic argument i know but uh if we want to look at really what is more beneficial for society as a whole right then basically what you're telling
(50:19) me is you really want to defend the wealth of one guy who will never do anything for you instead of putting that massive enterprise that can do a lot of social good in the hands of the people who actually do all the work right and in a way could then give back to society in a way that jeff pieces doesn't uh that's just my my general perspective on that okay so in the interest of giving back to uh society right here um our next question comes from the audience so i've just uh invited doomshop uh to ask his question
(50:47) right here doomshot are you with us can you hear me i'm gonna give him a second it takes a second for people to get on the stage doom shop be there uh it may be muted or something like that so i'm going to give you a few seconds to get it together and see what's happening and if not i may have to ask you a question for you i'm sorry well you're limited on time amigo there you go there you go yeah thank you for waiting for me no no my question was my question was in your opinion what did what do you think about these
(51:17) champions socialists in the west who like looked down upon the eastern revolutionaries who try to bring bring about socialism by their own means by actually instead of following this idealistic version of or socialism socialism which the westerners have in the academia they actually go on the ground and alleviate the material condition of the people and also what do you think about these uh westerners electing stockton candidates in order to just fund their welfare program by using period sources yeah i got most of that question i hope
(51:57) i'll do it justice thank you very much doom shop i believe yeah all right so uh the general um question was uh what do i think of certain sectors the western left and their approach to um uh eastern marxist let's say or those in the third world let's say an imperial periphery one point that i would like to say is let's not uh glamorize the third world at the expense of the work of um those in the last quote unquote first world or imperial core there are many um principled and hardworking um comrades that exist in the united states
(52:33) in germany in the uk and everywhere else uh and they're also very they're equally exist lazy and incompetent uh marxists in the third world and imperial periphery so let's not uh try to paint one uh uh well and despise the other with that being said though there do exist certain trends uh within the western left for example that uh seems to just basically uh want more of uh the social democratic order that is for example in europe um instead of uh advocating for the abolition of capitalism and the transition to a socialist system
(53:05) what i would say about these people um is that it shouldn't be surprising because they are advocating for their class interests now what does this mean what this means is that when we go into a more in-depth let's say analysis of capitalism as it currently exists within the world there is a certain um let's say segment or or or section um the english word is is not coming to mind right now um uh a certain yeah segment of society uh that we would refer to as labor aristocracy these are people who are given greater um
(53:43) basically uh concessions from the ruling class in order to placate them into a non-revolutionary or uh basically reactionary position against the overthrow of capitalism and the overthrow of the current imperialist system um this is not the majority of people in the west but it is a sizable portion that you can see um and these people look out for their class interests and their class interests about abolishing capitalism isn't there and ending the imperialist system is not uh there if you want a deeper look into this uh because this can be a
(54:18) very long question i can talk about for like the next hour actually i made a video on it titled the failure of social democracy um and i believe unequal exchange i think um something like which you can find it's it's uh over a year old at this point otherwise i can recommend some books that you can take a look at um there is uh two books there are two books that i can recommend from zack cope z-a-k-c-o-p-e uh the first is uh the wealth of some nations and the second is um unequal world unequal class hey no that
(54:49) doesn't sound right uh sorry my mind is black but if you write unequal um i'm sure actually it is an unequal world no divided world divided class yes that's my mind was wrong uh divided world divided class that's one word uh there is another work by intan suandi i n t a n suwandi um that's called value chains which i recommend another one is by emmanuel uh emmanuel or geary it's called unequal exchange um he has another book as well titled unequal unequal exchange and the prospects of socialism which
(55:17) talks more about what you're hinting about uh the uh labor aristocracy what could be done uh with the western with western left and their um potential future uh decisions and whatnot yeah other than that i have a book recommendations video uh on my channel titled book recommendations uh i think believe is number five or number six number five uh and it's uh titled unequal exchange in which i recommend other books for example from samira main um so i hope that will cover that question broadly all right thank you to doomshop for uh
(55:47) popping in to ask his question there and uh yeah i just like personally i want to uh thank you for uh you know i hate to see movements where they're tearing each other apart um just based on um on you know where you're from because it ain't about where you're from it's where you're at all right let me get to the um next question that we have here i'll give me one so i have to uh uh resituate everything to get in here um so uh oya yamaguchi 2.
(56:17) 0 says in your video how rich countries rob the poor the failure of social democracy i think is the one that you just referenced so this is very timely uh you claim that while western countries get richer poorer countries get poorer if this is the case how come the number of people living in extreme poverty has decreased significantly since the 1950s and some of the fastest growing economies are the poorest example south sudan uh which is like immediately like the the south sudan case is like a very i would i wouldn't cite it myself um in
(56:50) the same video you imply that a decrease in the welfare state is bad for workers when in fact inequality of wealth is higher in countries with a more developed welfare state and he cites fessler ensures 2015. uh there are two errors being made in this uh question um the i'll touch on the first um in the first one he said that uh there's uh how come there's um uh part of that poverty is decreasing uh i would like you to go into the wealth not well so this excuse me poverty statistics and take out china and then
(57:20) just see how much wealth has decreased uh not well excuse me poverty has decreased in the world china accounts for maybe 90 to 95. i've seen some points in some uh um studies as high as 96 of all uh poverty reduction in the world uh now i don't think it's a very good um let's say uh example for you to use a communist party-led uh supposedly what it calls itself socialist nation uh as the uh prime reducer of poverty uh even though some people disagree with this i'd be part of that disagreement as
(57:53) well um so that's number one um if you look at generally across the world um social inequality is generally increasing poverty depending on how you define it can be increasing can be uh just kind of more or less the same or has decreased ever so slightly um and that's not good enough for a time frame of like five decades you know one percent two percent five percent improvement is not good enough uh but that's my the first point the second point he said uh how about like the fastest growing economies blah
(58:22) blah and then he gave um he cited south sudan but it's not a fair i understand just so people understand why that is countries with no industrial base to begin with have really high levels of gdp growth and particularly economic development and percentage points because they are industrializing for the first time so when you first let's say you live in a let's just hypothetically let's say you're on an island right and you produce nothing on that island right then your gdp will be very low now
(58:50) all of a sudden let's say you have i put a coconut processing uh plant on that island you've never had one before all of a sudden you get to process really large amounts of coconut juice and and other sorts of coconut products all of a sudden you're going to have massive amounts of sales like or income relative to what you used to produce because you didn't have industrial base before so it's going to show like a really high spike that's when you see countries that are war-torn for example and then the
(59:14) like next couple of years after the war all of a sudden they have really high levels of economic development that's not because all of a sudden they have an economic miracle that's because all the former or pre-existing industrial base that existed was most likely destroyed in that war so there's that's why there's the high economic growth in south sudan's case there was no industrial growth before or industrial base excuse me before that's why it's really high you see this in many countries around
(59:36) the world and then finally the third thing he said i believe if um reduction of welfare states means that the conditions of the working classes are worse and then he says uh countries that have higher social inequality uh are could you please just repeat the very last the way that he phrases it just to get it exactly correct here um he he says in the same video you imply that a decrease in the welfare state is bad for workers and then he says when in fact inequality of wealth is higher in countries with a more developed welfare state and he
(1:00:06) cites fessler and assures 2015. he's arguing to different points incoming and well-being of the working class are two different things you can have for example you can have a system where incoming quality uh increases but the general trend is upwards for both so that's one thing that can happen or you can have increased income and quality where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer or you can have an income equality that is the same but the general estate of both the quote unquote poor and the quan
(1:00:35) quote rich has gone down so uh we're arguing two different points uh there so let's move on to the next question by comrades spatial who has messaged me by the way if you message me on discord while i'm doing the ama i can only do so many things at once i'll review uh the dms later but if it's like super important or something just type it like hundreds of times in the chat then i'll see it so comrad spatial asks what do you think of the ecp i know you're a fan of cockshot but computerized central planning could
(1:01:06) not possibly take into account subjective preferences and local information which is what the ecp critiques about central planning he says long live capitalism long live the bourgeois long live america tell me that when the american brings back conscription then sends you to die in a war my perspective personally about this is this when it comes to the economic calculation problem the fundamental problem isn't subjective uh demands it is input outputs that is the fundamental criticism that is being made uh but let's touch on both
(1:01:41) um first of all the claim that there is uh let's say uh planning cannot account for subjective demands um that is sophistry that is actually objectively just untrue um would you say that walmart can adequately uh plan for uh demand subjective demand would you say that amazon can of course both of them do well surprise surprise none of them work by market mechanisms they work based on planning fairly extensive planning actually the what's very interesting is that they use similar planning models to the ones developed by cantor virgin co
(1:02:13) uh our soviet uh researchers soviet mathematicians that developed them um so when it comes to real examples of uh meeting subjective demand planning can take care of that as for the economic calculation problem in general uh what you have is uh basically an issue with again input output how can you calculate for all these different products and all these different communications that exist across different time points in different locations blah blah blah oh the complexity is way too much we just have to leave it to the market
(1:02:40) well the market doesn't allocate to need or subjective want that many uh the market allocates to um profit where most money will be made it will uh put resources and then and manpower um that's not a logical way to uh govern or uh deal with our society that's number one number two modern economic planning uh based on modern computing methods can more than um surpass a market in uh decision-making uh particularly what i mean is directed decision making not anarchy of the market sort of stuff i'll use an analogy that i borrow from
(1:03:15) richard wolff which is uh when he talks about marcus versus um planning he mentions it criticizes markus by saying imagine that everybody's driving on the road right and we have like uh traffic signals but everybody ignores them because what's good for me is good for like like what uh that american capitalist said well what's good for what's good for general motors is good for the united states um what's good for me is going to be good for all society so everybody just drives how they will uh well you're
(1:03:41) gonna get lots of car accidents which is exactly what happens in the markets there's extensive anarchy and massive mismanagement and misallocation of resources but you don't really see it because it's number one on global scale and number two it's divided on basically who has enough money to pay for stuff and also um the uh where the most profit can be derived uh when it comes to modern computing methods um numerous uh studies have uh demonstrated the efficacy of this of which cockshot i like to highlight
(1:04:09) because he has very accessible information about this there's way more but it's very mathematical and complex and you i think you really need to be a specialist in the field to fully be able to understand a cocktail is the first person that i've approached that i feel uh can adequately explain to a layman um so that's why i recommend people check out his work towards the new socialism in which he um documents or describes uh economic planning as it couldn't possibly exist now he also describes
(1:04:34) really interesting modes of direct democracy that could be um implemented in the future uh they can be implemented now i mean but uh we need a revolutionary situation for that uh on and on so uh yeah the tl dr of this is that the economic calculation problem is a meme it's been a meme for the past 50 years um it is not an issue and has hasn't been since like 1956 all right so not that hundred percent absolutely um i wrote a book about this by the way i'm just going to plug it real quick there it's called uh hawks at the diner
(1:05:04) by zac zyz but i literally wrote a book about this topic and i can confirm 100 it's a meme so good luck with that one yeah please do send me the um title talks at the diner it's short it's only about 40 pages right there but it's a hell of a book i highly recommend everybody buy and five-star or just uh don't at least don't  with the reviews anyhow anime king right here says is before i ask this question uh let me let me ask you um do you identify as a muslim yes yes okay um okay so then i will ask this question
(1:05:41) anime king asks is islam compatible with marxist theory and in what way considering most scholars denounce marxism and at its core marxism is inherently anti-religious lastly uh what are your thoughts on salafism and muhammad so the first question is is marxism compatible or socialism better to say um is it compatible with islam and yes it is uh the reason that um lots of uh scholars state uh the like to the contrary is because they're dealing with a historical um experience and when we look at like for example the
(1:06:20) way that soviet union for example or albania treated uh religion um we can see that yeah it's very negative and as a result that's what they assume that all socialism is no those were great mistakes on the parts of those um socialist administrations and this is these are mistakes that shouldn't be uh repeated in the future that being said um most uh islamic scholars have very bad understandings of socialism and have very bare bones analysis of capitalism as you may imagine their uh area of expertise isn't
(1:06:50) economics or political economy or sociology it is uh mostly theological matters and the stuff around that um we can talk way more extensively about this in the dms um so if you're interested message me as for the uh question of uh marxism being inherently um uh like anti-religious um it is inherently secular not anti-religious now when people say anti-religious is because oh there's material materialism is a founding principle of marxism uh well that is true but what we need to what we need to realize is that the
(1:07:22) materialist arguments that are put forth um are basically philosophical dead ends that reach a point where uh they just kind of change lane into the usual atheist arguments you encounter there's nothing inherently more uh potent let's say about the marxist criticism of uh or the supposed materials criticism of religion uh that marxist put forth that anybody else hasn't already put forth uh that's the fundamental point the second point is there are some errors that are made for example angles makes the common airway says that oh
(1:07:54) once the material bases religion disappears religion will disappear uh he's making a very let's say mechanical point mechanically materialistic point here um this is just wrong uh yeah people some people are religious because of their conditions for example they're very poor and they have uh face loss of hardship and as a result they turn to a higher power but also many people like myself are religious for other questions like the the quote-unquote big questions of life so why are we here and what is my purpose
(1:08:21) and uh all this couldn't have come from nothing like these sort of questions um and if that is a perspective then even if the material basis of poverty and whatnot were to be eradicated then you'd still have people who have those inherent curiosities within themselves so you can't say that religion will disappear you could say maybe that religion will change you could say that maybe the practices might change or the way that we understand it might change but you can't say that all be gone completely and that
(1:08:43) everybody will be just like a secular you know edgy reddit atheist but other than that there's a lot more we can talk about we can talk about the pitfalls of materialism or the materialist analysis of belief but this will go on for way longer because then we're going to delve into philosophy i'm going to have to start defining terms so if you're interested in this dm me and by the way i should have said this way earlier if you want to dme please dm me on twitter not on discord because i really don't like how discord works
(1:09:12) but i'll answer everybody who's already wrote to me on on discord but please do dm me on twitter instead okay cool that's good okay uh so i also want to get mango right here who's a constant fixture in our amas right here he says hakeem do you think the u.s will ever become a marxist leninist state pepe hands when will a revolutionary revolution happen um i can't see into the future so i can't tell you that do i think it will be marxist linus i have no idea i think that there's two things that
(1:09:43) will occur in this world either the united states will become socialist or we all die basically i think that the united states will not go i will will not go out without a fight i don't think the united states gonna go the way the soviet union um it's not gonna be not with the bank but with the whimper i think the united states gonna fight tooth and nail to maintain its current position in the world order and confirm yeah and that includes their their uh possession of nuclear weapons and a massive military so yeah it's not going to be
(1:10:14) quiet so either a revolution does occur and socialism does happen or we all have to face uh potentially nuclear war um with that being said a time frame that depends on you the americans um it's up to you guys when you want to overthrow the current system that you live in which has basically all benefits given to the absolute minority of wealthiest while your family members have to go without health care without proper education while people are incarcerated for basically trumped up charges small drug possession uh particularly if
(1:10:45) they're of particular racial orientation where there is a constant system of fighting against you where you can never feel a sense of security in your country even though that you're born here that you live here that you die here i'm not even an american but i can imagine how it must be for you guys where you even some of you have family members that have died for the country and afterwards they throw them to the streets so they can't even get veterans benefits they can't get anything i mean at this point it is up
(1:11:13) to you guys to take your own country's uh future into your own hands and decide hey we want to run things differently for the very man for the massive people for the people who actually do the work for you know the mom and dad and apple pie all that kind of stuff that's my my very proper propagandistic speech to you guys yeah not equally propagandistic  never it was america god damn it uh no i have a book about that too it's called the right to bear arms uh yeah just a  oodle of plugs here today
(1:11:44) there check them out it's about a soldier who loses both of his arms definitely take a look at all that yeah yeah i just love the uh from myself so um anime king um says in the chat he said that you didn't uh list your thoughts on salafism and muhammad sorry sorry sorry um by the way it's a it's a light age it's to have but yeah i wanna i wanna get my iron in there yeah okay yeah oh yeah go ahead we'll have a conversation later oh that's a good idea you must have the the iraqi accent because then you would have
(1:12:26) not understood anything anyway so the questions about sophism and that okay so uh what existed what is um colloquially known in the west as salafism but more i guess regionally we call it the next um propagation or the the next let's say um this is can you do me a favor and just give like a very broad uh explanation of exactly what it is people are not gonna not off the top of their head yeah uh salafism is basically a concept or an idea it's a reformist movement within islam that's something that a lot of people do not
(1:12:59) know it is not uh in any way rooted uh in traditional scholarship it is a uh basically um you know those fascist memes that go um reject modernity embrace tradition right it's something like that but a way more extreme version where it's basically like reject all tradition and go back to the very first generation after the prophet basically what yeah what the what we call this uh salaf um these people um it's the very first and then the topic on the the people it's the first two generations after the
(1:13:29) prophet um these people and their opinions and whatnot should be taken to heart but the thing is that they don't even take these people's opinions to heart they twist them in a way to justify very strange ideologies now this was generally developed by uh in the middle of the 1800s can you give us an example of one of the strange twists on ideology because i can't hear that and not want to get a specific example for sure for sure yes okay for example uh i'll give you a good one uh in traditional islamic practice throughout
(1:13:59) all of history uh there is a we do not um worship graves right certain christian sects do for example uh and that's like a point of criticism that islam has had of uh like uh for example christianity islam we don't have worship of graves but certain populations do venerate certain graves for example let's say a prophet's grave um for example uh a prophet noah or the prophet uh jonas uh uh eunice it's jonah or other prophets where we know where they're buried um some people venerate those graves
(1:14:33) they like put flowers around it sometimes they go and they pray near those graves um in what's what salafi ideology says is that these people um by doing so have excommunicated themselves from islam they are no longer muslim because they're doing something that we're not quote not supposed to do despite the fact that they're not worshiping the graves they're just venerating them and hey certain muslims have those disagreements with that too for example i personally would not choose to take part in that
(1:14:56) practice but i know people that do and fine to each their own why not i know you're not worshiping the person in the grave you're just doing it because it's a traditional cultural thing and also other reasons but these people not only they don't say live in that lift like i don't agree with it but whatever what they think is like uh you have ex community excommunicated yourself uh this is called uh techfia that's why sometimes you maybe have seen the term techfiri when they're described
(1:15:20) which means it's like making them making them disbelievers so they're saying we have similar similar automatic extra communication things within catholicism there are some acts where when you commit them you're assumed to be automatically excommunicated um so there is a parallel at least thank you for the perspective yeah exactly right um and so what these people will do then they take a next step which then uh can be like oh we have to forcibly correct these acts and these this forcible correction uh
(1:15:49) can include everything from like uh points of humiliation and whatnot to even outright violence and uh murder and and every step of that process is uh islamically you cannot sanction it it is uh illegal both from an islamic perspective as well as um uh from a theological perspective but this is what exists now what is the issue with it well when saudi arabia became a thing when the uh britain and the us set up the saudi monarchy um as their own little kind of like puppets in the region uh these people adopted and began advocating this brand
(1:16:22) of uh islam to the rest of the world right and this then went on to morph to other forms uh like it's already extreme and it was becoming more extreme uh for example the ideology of daesh of isis is one of those ideologies they follow a very extreme version of this by the way if i say this to a a person who is of that persuasion they would highly disagree but the ideological continuum and and and uh let's say uh the genetic um relation between these uh ideologies is highly documented uh especially by uh
(1:16:57) scholars in the field uh particularly even like particularly islamic scholars in the field um yeah if there's if you want a good book about this just generally there's a book called uh management of savagery uh i believe it's by max that's amazing max blumenthal management of savagery i like it and if you want a uh islamic um scholars position on these ideologies there is a really good book that's in its english translation i believe it's in the second edition it's called refuting isis by
(1:17:26) uh a uh syrian um scholar and he is a descendant of the prophet as well um so uh yeah look him up uh the name the name of the book is um refuting isis uh you'll you'll definitely find it um so yeah these are two books to look into but i hope that covers your question absolutely that and honestly like just listening in that's a fantastic answer to that question and i uh picked up a lot it's one of my favorite things about doing these game a's is getting perspectives like that that i don't run into every day so thank you
(1:18:00) that's i enjoyed that one okay i'm gonna be skipping through a bunch of these to uh how long do you have left uh do you have another 30 minutes you have longer yeah i thought we'd do two hours i think that's fair for the for that so i'm going to try to get a minute i'm going to skip a few of these questions that are similar to ones that we've already uh touched on here so um those guys matt cia plant do not trust um so this is an interesting question um do you think there's an honest ethical method to sanction rivals
(1:18:33) or should global powers avoid it altogether since an it's an instrument of economic exploitation um and so this is you absolutely would have firsthand knowledge of how sanctions function this is a very good question so thank you to the person that asked it uh what i would say is that just like a quick answer no i don't think sanctions should ever be a thing um if uh there's a uh a way that you could make them work then please the entire world world would like to know so please come out with the answer but i personally in my personal
(1:19:05) experience as well as my research uh it is a it's just all negativity why because what it does is it doesn't punish leadership it punishes the people um yeah so what you end up is what you end up with is uh the uh like increasing poverty and reduced access to medical equipment and food and whatnot to the vast majority of the population while relatively not harming the leadership there are different kinds of sanctions that you can place for example individual sanctioning for example uh you freeze the assets of a particular
(1:19:34) individual let's say for example hypothetically donald trump or anybody else uh you were to freeze their assets so that they wouldn't be able to use the property they own they won't be able to mobilize the wealth that they have uh sitting in banks and whatnot on and on maybe that's a superior method but the thing is that uh we need to remember that as a currently stance economic sanctions uh exist as a arm of american foreign policy to bully countries into aligning with what the united states wants them
(1:20:00) to do right privatizing for example industry or uh not basically doing something that would be otherwise positive for their population usually usually across the board that's how it is that's why they sanctioned for example libya that's why they sanctioned venezuela in cuba which has been under embargo for 60 years now um it's honestly insane at this point is well is the word for it um so that's what i would say uh it's not a good option okay fantastic um so i want to get to a theorist has
(1:20:31) spotted no i'm sorry aetherius ispidia and if i mispronounced your discord name you just made it up and added like an anime avatar anyway so like hey there is ask would you consider wage laborers employed in the public sector to be proletarian such as teachers police officers public defender lawyers cia analysts soldiers or the president of the united states if not why and what do you consider them as yes uh this is a very nice question actually so i thank you for asking that um this is where we get very interesting
(1:21:05) this is why i personally am so enamored with marxism because the uh analysis is never just superficial it gets deeper and deeper and the more you look into it the more you find further layers to delve into and this is what it is across the board all those people you mentioned are uh proletarian they are working class people whether they be soldiers whether they be even actors or whatever um they are people who sell their labor power in return for a wage they fit the definition of a working-class person a proletarian definition now when it
(1:21:36) comes to let's say people who are who are very wealthy let's say but they still are in this position what do we call those people well here's where an analysis of a labor aristocracy comes in right if you look at the world generally right uh if you look at civil servants in for example um the u.
(1:21:55) s high-level civil servants they're still working class but they get paid very well uh other levels for example include what's called actors and those uh artistic types they're also working class people but they get paid very highly um you look at lawyers and doctors for example they are people who usually if they work in a public system for example um they uh are proletarian but they still get paid very highly so we need to look at number one an analysis of labour aristocracy which means basically that there's increased basically
(1:22:26) bit of the pie that's given to these people uh be they like high civil servants or high lawyers or some stuff like that or number two it's they are proletarian but they have a petty bourgeois aspirations as we say um to use kind of like a a truism um petty bourgeois aspirations as in they even though they're proletarian they don't want to be proletarian and their current standing could maybe hopefully propel them into a higher class right into being part of uh maybe starting like as a medical professional maybe you'll start your own
(1:22:58) clinic a private clinic and then you'll be a petty bourgeois owner of a private clinic uh and then your aspirations your class interests align closer to the ruling class than they do with a working class right when we reach um for example you see the same with like lawyers and whatnot so these are perspectives we need to take into account if you want to look at also people who are working class who still make uh like not that good money but otherwise still align themselves with um ruling class interests um you should
(1:23:28) take a look into the the works of gramsci he were he wrote extensively about this he is the one who developed the concept of hegemony it's called i'm sure you've heard it before cultural hegemony the idea that um the prominent ideas or the popular ideas of society are the ideas of the ruling class right and the society itself reproduces uh ruling class uh ideological motives um you can look at uh the work of alphazer um the oh my lord uh the english title was um oh my lord uh the something of capitalism hold on i need to check this
(1:24:03) from for myself i'll just uh sit here and have a banana of silence for my homie george uh on the reproduction of capitalism by altas air um yeah uh sorry about that the the brain fart happened and i wouldn't have been able to sleep if i could remember the title but yes um so that's another work that you can take in a look into how capitalism reproduces itself on a social level um so i hope i covered this question actually because i touched on three things more than adequate and we'd like to get to kind of like our
(1:24:42) lightning round here um just i'd like to get as many of the pin questions as we possibly can thank you to everybody who's been so patient for this whole thing so greta says how do you think as a marxist leninist that your ideal world would solve resource and land scarcity there are already wars over water in ukraine and there will possibly be in the future between ethiopia and egypt that's going to happen there at some point they're going to damn the nile do you think europe china or usa will stop exploiting
(1:25:09) third world nations to get those resources just because what's the material incentive of the pros of these nations to stop taking from the third world which greatly benefits them sure uh sure uh the question is very good um but i'll say number one uh the most working-class people do not see the benefits of the wars that are fought by their ruling classes right uh the vast majority of the benefits that are seen go to number one the ruling class itself number two it's political wackies and number three
(1:25:36) those who directly supported the war effort within the industrial base of the country so those who produce ornaments for example so the raytheons and the other such companies for example the the iraq war was a perfect example for this the american population saw no improvement of their material uh standards in fact they saw uh an administration for us yeah we're still paying the tab do you know who didn't see a decrease in their living standards though yeah you know my boy dick cheney dangling dick cheney's sitting pretty
(1:26:08) pretty well right now he just gets to shoot whoever he wants in the face he's got an endless supply of artificial robot hearts he's doing good he's a christ if i've ever seen somebody who looks more like a devil but yeah um i met him and rummy uh both irl and they are they are absolutely  reptilian lizards from outer space uh you could they are bloodthirsty  both of them so you take it from your boy load radio i don't know how you resisted the urge to tear the throats out with your bare hands but uh i would have been
(1:26:39) executed yeah i understand that but yeah the uh so what i'm saying is that who saw the improvement of that or the uh it was the oil companies and the armed country companies and the politicians who took part that just goes across the board so war is not wait just before i miss this so greta um greta is taking issue with the explanation right there greta says uh is completely wrong taking from a political enemy already benefits them it benefits them by lowering prices it destroys rising economy that might ally with enemies
(1:27:06) uh europeans uh benefited greatly from imperialism so uh we're greta we're kind of talking about two different eras the modern era of uh exploitation of third world nations generally uh benefits large corporations and state level things uh whereas like the early areas of imperialism absolutely uh resulted as you said in a flood of uh goods and services and stolen things but that's no longer the case that's not how um sort of imperialism works any longer to add on to that also the point about for example current imperialism there is
(1:27:38) a small segment like i mentioned uh of society that does directly benefit from imperialism that is the labor aristocracy that i mentioned if you really want to look into this and take a look at the works of zac cope z-a-k-c-o-p-e uh he'll have all the answers for you with uh extensive um documentation it's the numbers actually get kind of boring after a while but they're very good works otherwise um so take a look into that uh as for the general idea of how would socialism sort would like deal with this
(1:28:04) uh well here's the issue or or the solution under socialism number one we want to have an economic plan we don't want to have uh basically uh allocation according to markets basically according to profit we want allocation according to need that's number one number two if you look at um the resources of the earth generally um across the board we have enough fuel we have enough water we have enough food and we also have enough capacity to produce those things um to provide for the need of more than the
(1:28:31) current population that exists on the earth more than the current what seven and a half billion or eight billion that exist on the earth um far more actually uh we have food or agricultural areas capable of producing at current levels of development by the way not all arable land is utilized to the same levels of efficiency uh that can feed up to 11 billion people uh there exists a technology of uh massive um desalination uh for uh water this exists in saudi arabia for example i'm sorry can i can i jump in there like
(1:29:00) the the figure of being able to feed 11 billion people is only there there's certain um that figure i see it tossed around all the time but it doesn't mean that you can sustainably uh feed those 11 billion people right there there are like cycles of um uh basically like the nitrogen cycle isn't forever right we can do that for maybe a century and then where everything is vastly depleted and we're in a terrible situation that's exactly right no no thank you for the clarification clarification what i
(1:29:30) mean by that is that um with the current uh levels of uh agricultural development particular scientific agricultural development if arable land was used sustainably but also to its maximum efficiency we could provide for that when it comes to the 11 billion mark it usually has certain set like um points that we need to talk about for example it talks about specifically meeting the caloric necessity of populations it doesn't reach for example the um points about uh consumption levels differing between nations that's number
(1:29:58) one number two uh that's not even touching on the mass amount of food waste that happens in most of the world particularly in the developed world where nearly half of all food gets wasted um and by the way in some cases food waste in the third world is even worse because they don't have the appropriate methods of preserving food that is getting to them to market for example a popular case that's given for example in egypt and iraq that you have you have is that sometimes they'll farm tomatoes and they'll have them sitting
(1:30:25) in a truck basically in the hot sun and half of them are ruined before they get to market for example because they don't have appropriate refrigeration they're poor farmers they're not gonna you know and other such examples that being said though um generally across the board um with the current levels of scientific development and by the way in the future we're only gonna improve we can meet the needs of basically everybody to a sufficient level that doesn't mean that certain restrictions
(1:30:51) shouldn't apply for example the amount of energy expended per american is way too high this is something that even americans should recognize if everybody on earth consumed like an average american would then we would need something like 50 earths to meet the demand um compared to an average for example nigerian or average iraqi for example um that being said what happens when you have proper economic planning for said things is that you can do allocation according to need that doesn't mean that everybody
(1:31:16) will get their absolute fill maybe uh sometimes it does happen traditionally historically that is what happened uh but if it's on a worldwide scale um but it means that everybody will get what they need like enough but maybe they won't get to the extreme amount that they would like to be able to consume that's number one uh number two if there is extensive cooperation between nations right um for example the issue of the dam that's coming between ethiopia and the egypt this is an issue that if they were
(1:31:44) to put more cooperation towards uh it could be fixed it doesn't have to go to war the reason it has to go to war is because again ruling class interests buffet a prevail the two working classes of the independent nations would very much benefit from a uh more level-headed approach maybe for example let's say bonds that would be paid across uh for delaying um the the damning so that appropriate uh collaterals for water supply can be found or developed for example in egypt this is something that could be this is
(1:32:12) something that could be done um otherwise uh there's several article articles i've been writing on this i'm not gonna like talk about it too much but this is something that could be done in which both working classes of the two countries would benefit but that's not we're talking about what's going on right now is that the two ruling classes of these countries are fighting over this because one of them is poised to gain a lot of wealth and influence and the other ruling class is supposed to
(1:32:38) lose a lot of wealth of influence and that's why they want to push for this uh really heightened rhetoric in war and whatnot so based on mutual cooperation economic planning scientific development we can reach a kind of uh equalization point where everybody can see the maximum level of uh like a maximizing of standard of living while taking into account the local limitations on the environment on uh people's labor on uh the society around you and so on and so on let's get to email's question um
(1:33:08) and stop me if i ask this one it's been a long ama um did i already ask email asks do you think revolutionary leftists should participate in elections and vote for the lesser evil or do you think bourgeois democracy is totally unnecessary yeah uh neither the two suggestions it depends on the local conditions um if your current this is something they should do with an organization where you have a proper discussion and reach upon democratic consensus what to do sometimes it is good to participate in electoralism sometimes it
(1:33:39) isn't sometimes it isn't even possible um and the general point is that you should have organizations that kind of have their foot in everything you should have a foot in being able to push some sort of electoral demand you should have a foot in organizing community arranging you should have a foot in uh trade union movements and like a side note maybe even illegal methods if it's possible yeah um i think you understand what i mean i've talked about this before in several videos i talked about also in
(1:34:05) my most recent video the problems of the western left so take a look at that okay i'm going to get to a question um i look for you in the chat uh poganist but uh if i don't see you in the chat like on a cursory thing i can't uh promote you to the top of the stage there so uh pogonist.
(1:34:22) com says how do you respond to allegations made by reformists like socialism done left and others that we ought to be skeptical of revolutionary leftist ideologies given their failure to institute socialism in first world capitalist countries often reformists will state that revolutions can only be successful in third world countries largely in virtue of workers there having less to lose in the event of failure under what circumstances would a leninist or vanguard revolution be successful in neoliberal capitalism i am familiar with marx's predictions
(1:34:52) but i want your view specifically that's a great question um thank you for that my personal perspective is mentioned again in that uh video that i mentioned um the failure of social democracy um yeah oh i i forget the first half of the title but you look it up if you write the failure of democracy email come up but yeah uh that i expressed my view in detail there also a good book that i'd recommend is uh emmanuel or gary's book um unequal exchange and the prospects of social which you can find as a free pdf
(1:35:22) online so read that as well even having said that though um i would say that generally no revolution has occurred or i mean very rarely has revolution occurred in a first world developed nation i think the only example a person can mention is uh east germany the gdr and that was as a result of you know war mona it's not a realistic approach to to to follow um without said though the current existence of uh social relations within the united states and other developed western countries um disallows certain radical activity
(1:35:55) currently revolution is not uh the most likely i'm not saying it's impossible nothing is impossible i'm saying it's not as likely in the united states not as likely in germany or in the uk that doesn't mean that isn't the case in the future as marxist we have to be realist and we have to see what is the thing that will bring about revolution and bringing about the about evolutionary capitalism and the institution of socialism and when we think about in that sphere we need to realize that
(1:36:17) historically as well as even to this day the most likely uh form or place for evolution to occur is in the imperial periphery it's more likely going to occur in bangladesh or peru or the philippines or india it's not going to occur in sweden or the uk or the us and if that's the case then we should support those movements because what do they do they break chain they break links in the chains of capitals in the chains of imperialism they weaken the power of imperialist countries that rely on those third world countries those imperial
(1:36:44) perfect countries for their wealth and their uh uh ability to kind of um placate their populations which will then cause them to turn inwards and force basically further exploitation of their populations again like how it used to be 100 years ago in the u.s like in the 1910s and 1920s in the us um and as a result of that there will be a heightening of the class struggle within the us or the uk or germany where have you and then it becomes a possibility it isn't a reform mistake it's more a uh assessment based on the current material
(1:37:11) conditions in 1912 revolution may have been possible in the us currently i think it's far less likely than it was historically but hey i'm leaving this up to american comrades to discuss further and also to prove me wrong please do have your revolution no no it's hopeless um i do every time i hear links on the chain i just want to shout out to phil oakes uh his song links on the chain is one of my favorite protest songs of all time check him out if you can okay uh so we're towards the end of this ama and i
(1:37:39) wanted to end with uh ducky kancho's uh final question right here um so he asked several but i want to ask this one he asked what are your thoughts on saddam the current iraqi government and other former iraqi governments and if you uh would care to uh where do you see iraq going in the next 20 years or so yeah i get this question asked every single um a man do you want to skip it for another one cause like yeah if it's i've got another one in the chamber yeah let's skip it for another one i'm sorry
(1:38:08) i tried so um and blah blah blah's question was what was your opinion on implementing socialism in post-industrial countries where there isn't a dire need for change that's the exact uh question we just answered right there um so how about this one from pres material hakeem seeing as you're a medical worker and from a more impoverished country i'm sorry for the dis what do you think global vaccination policy should be should vaccine manufacturing nations give out some basic level of vaccinations to help to send the tide
(1:38:34) all over or should they secure their own nations first before sending out vaccinations yeah um that's a very interesting question by the way to the person asked a question by iraq um feel free to dm on twitter and then we can talk about as much as you like uh but for now we're tied on time as for this question though i personally think that uh the approach that cuba and china has had is far better in which that they are uh increasing the capacity for production of vaccines and also they're donating or giving very cheaply uh
(1:39:02) vaccines and unnecessary supplies to third world countries i think the appropriate um appropriate oh lord what's the english word course um right now should be possible to have no um uh copyright or any form of ip over um this the any life-saving anything medicine or vaccine or what have you should not be uh copyrighted and prevented from being like reproduced uh elsewhere that's number one number two the countries that do have the industrial base to uh produce vaccines should help countries that don't to
(1:39:34) develop their own industrial base uh in this sphere yeah of course because less people being affected in india and in iraq and in egypt and in wherever else in brazil means less infections down the line in the u.s and sweden everybody really benefits right it's very myopic and very short-sighted to be like let's just secure our own population first of course you should you should maximize the vaccination program for your country but also that doesn't mean that you should uh privatize or limit access to the
(1:40:03) information or the vaccine directly and of course as much internationalist like aid that can be given should be given in the form that china has done in the form that cuba has done that's my personal perspective on it okay um so the the immediate counterpoint that somebody would ask is um if you eliminate the profit motive from the development of drugs are you worried that it will uh reduce the pace of development since a lot of that is driven uh directly by the profit motive uh the vast majority i'd like to
(1:40:33) introduce people or now you're breaking up um so i'm gonna i'm gonna like just kind of talk to fill the silence right here but uh i can try again can you hear me now i can hear you now yes perfect yeah what i was gonna say is i would like to direct people to a great work uh titled the entrepreneurial state in which it is discussed that the vast majority of pretty much all development happens in the state sector um meaning state funded and state developed rather than the private sector what happens in the private sector is the
(1:41:03) selling and basically price hiking that happens afterwards it's the marketing and whatnot that's where it comes into play now when it comes to really big pharmaceutical companies if they were nationalized and then run on a state-run basis or even cooperative basis um they would be as effective if not more effective uh when you look at the terms of these things you're going to see that the vast majority of life-saving medicines okay right now covet is kind of a big deal so they want to develop vaccines for it fair enough but the vast
(1:41:28) majority of medicine that could be life-saving for very bad diseases uh is not even really researched all that well because it's not as profitable as for example foot fungus cream or acne cream uh which is has a much wider base to reach even though foot fungus or acne is not gonna kill you but uh drugs against leukemia or drugs against certain kinds of other cancers or drugs against very rare congenital disorders which can save lives are barely looked at or even researched because there is no money in it and even if they are researched
(1:41:58) and produced the hope is that they can be sold to the state at exorbitant amounts um like i'm talking like millions of dollars for per per dose usage um so they're still hoping that there's going to be down the line some money to be made uh it's better for such things i think to be in the hands of systems that are more um oriented towards the mass of the working people and people who benefit from it rather than from profit uh so yeah and also yeah the book uh the entrepreneurial entrepreneurial state excuse me you
