![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JpPBx2dA0c)

## Transcript:
- Thanks for all being here
on this Thursday afternoon
in week seven I think, I know
it's a busy time for everybody
but I'm very delighted
to be able to introduce
the first talk for this
academic year sponsored
by the Institute for
Cross-Disciplinary Engagement
and the philosophy department,
and even more delighted to be able
to introduce Eric Campbell.
So, Eric is assistant
professor, is that right?
At University of Maryland,
Baltimore County.
He got his PhD at UCSD,
he works in the areas
of philosophy of mind,
ethics, metaethics, Nietzsche.
I got to know Eric when
I was visiting down
in Washington, DC and I just thought
his work was super interesting.
I think he's one of the most
interesting people working
in metaethics, and I wanted
to bring him up here.
So, he will be giving us a talk today
entitled Pragmatic
Naturalism: A New Methodology
for metaethics and metamorals.
Thank you, Eric.
- Thank you.
I slightly reduced the--
(audience lightly applauding)
Thank you.
As you can see, I sort of
took the metamorals part out,
thinking it was a bit too long.
- Oh--
- No.
It's not your fault, it was my fault.
So, I guess for like
the past, I don't know,
last maybe 10 years or so
I've sort of been working
somewhat off and on,
on a sort of large project
the heart of which is trying to cultivate,
or promote the cultivation
of various forms
of self-awareness in
ethics and in metaethics.
And as I was writing my dissertation,
several, well almost started
it about 10 years ago,
well by the time I got done with it,
I was nearing the end of it I realized,
the whole way I've been doing
this is kind of confused.
But I kind of let myself
off the hook a little bit,
because what that meant was,
the whole way that people
had been doing metaethics
was actually confused in my assessment.
So I had been doing something,
I had different ideas within metaethics,
but the way I was framing those ideas
and the way I was getting
at them I thought, you know,
if I had to start this
dissertation all over again,
I would really have to reframe everything.
And so, there's a certain methodology
that I thought would have
been much more appropriate
for doing the kind of thing
that I was trying to do.
But I also think it
would be more appropriate
for doing just metaethics generally.
And so I'm going to try to tell you
a little bit about that today.
Well, what is metaethics?
Some of you probably know, not everybody.
Well, that's actually part of
what's going to be at issue today.
It's not going to be like
a real focus you know,
if at the end of the day you think,
hey, that sounds like a cool methodology
but I'm not sure it's
necessarily metaethics,
I don't really care, because I mean
there aren't any metaethicists in here.
If there were, (audience laughing lightly)
if there I would fight you on that.
But I don't want you to have to think,
oh, I need to make a
judgment about whether
this meta methodology
really is metaethics or not.
Let me tell you at least one idea.
A fairly standard idea,
in fact I don't know
if you could get a more
authoritative source.
It's the Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy.
That tells us, this is
from 2012 by the way,
so it's a bit dated, but it
says, "Metaethics is the attempt
"To understand the
metaphysical, epistemological,
"Semantic, and psychological
presuppositions
"And commitments of
moral thought and talk."
It's okay if you don't
understand what that all means.
Yeah, you'll get a little bit of a sense
of what it means going forward.
Just a couple of things,
that it's worth pointing out quickly.
First of all that actually
characterizes metamorals,
not metaethics so that says moral thought,
oh, what was that?
What just happened?
Okay, so I guess there's
no, is there a laser?
I won't try to use it regardless.
That's what I tried to point at,
it didn't point, it just turned off.
So, that actually would
characterize metamorals,
whereas ethics, most
people, not everybody,
but most people would recognize
that there's a very
important sense of ethics
which is broader than morality.
So I'm going to use the
word ethics in sort of,
well, a sense that maybe
Bernard Williams made popular
but it's very, very old,
and it's just got to do
any questions about what
to do, what to think,
how to live, how to act, how to feel,
any questions that are normative.
So I'll use those terms interchangeably.
Ethical questions, normative questions.
That's got to do with anything, how to do,
how to be, how to think, how to feel.
Any kind of reasons for
action, reasons against,
that's all going to be
encompassed in metaethics,
and I think intuitively morality
is only some subset of that.
And now secondly, this is
not an ethical enterprise.
And that's going to be
part of what I think
is a mistake in conception of metaethics.
I think metaethics ought to
be, an ethical enterprise
and I think implicitly it actually is.
I think that actually a
lot of what's goin' on
in metaethics really is trying
to vindicate certain concepts
even though, that's not on the surface.
So you can see, if I'm just trying
to understand various
presuppositions and commitments,
I'm not trying to evaluate
them, I'm not trying to say
whether they're good or
bad, or right or wrong.
As a matter of fact I
think that is going on,
and even to the extent
that it isn't going on
it ought to be going on.
Now here's--
- Eric?
- Yes.
- (Student) Why is meta in front of ethic?
- So the meta, that prefix generally means
something like about, like about ethics.
So you could ask, so I
think, you know, intuitively,
if ethics is like, if
we're arguing or discussing
good and bad, right and
wrong, let's call that ethics.
But then metaethics
would ask questions like,
what's going on when you're doing that?
And one way of understanding that is,
okay, what are the
metaphysical presuppositions?
What are the epistemological,
what do you mean
when you say, stealing is wrong?
What is wrongness?
That's a metaphysical question, and so on.
So now there's these standard
approaches to metaethics.
These are by far in a way
the most common approaches
to metaethics and I'm going
to call them following
somebody named Huw Price,
metaphysics and semantics first.
And the idea there is
that well, let's just try
to directly get at these
metaphysical questions.
Are there more obligations?
That's an ontological question.
Do they exist?
What's their nature?
What's the nature of a moral obligation?
Now these questions are often framed,
especially in the past
several decades or so,
often framed in semantic terms.
So, I might ask, look,
we've got this concept,
moral obligation, what does that refer to?
So that's a semantic notion of reference.
That's a way of getting
at, it's a way of framing
a metaphysical question in semantic terms.
And, finding reference, suppose I can find
a referent of moral obligation.
It refers to this, whatever this is.
That, whether or not its
necessarily meant to,
or whether or not that's on the surface,
sometimes it is on the surface.
But that actually plays an important role
in vindicating the concept.
You'll see more how that works,
but you might think,
take God or something.
If the concept God refers to something,
then at least to that extent, hey!
I guess there's no inherent problem
with using the concept God,
'cause a lot of people think
God doesn't refer to anything.
It's just an error.
Or like witches, or something like that.
Or phlogiston, if you've heard
of phlogiston. (chuckles)
There's a lot of stuff that we
think, or unicorn, take that.
A unicorn, we think that
doesn't refer to anything.
It tries to refer, it might try to refer
to something, but it just fails.
So if it doesn't fail to
refer, then, to that extent,
at least to that extent the
concept is in good order.
And I'm going to suggest
that vindicatory role
that this sort of standard
approach to metaethics,
that it actually doesn't
vindicate anything,
even though it often is assumed to.
Now, one source of skepticism,
when it comes to morality,
and a number of other things,
there's a very influential way of thinking
about naturalism which we'll
call metaphysical naturalism.
According to metaphysical naturalism,
everything that exists is
part of the natural world.
That's actually part of why people
could be skeptical about God, or witches,
or at least the supernatural witches,
because well, they're supernatural!
And nothing's supernatural,
there is nothing supernatural,
especially within analytical metaethics.
But even more broadly, as
soon as you start talking
about something that's
outside the natural world,
skeptical hackles are going to get raised.
That's a common sort of a priori
starting point for a lot of people.
Now that starting point motivates
a certain kind of project.
Well look, if everything that exists
is part of the natural world,
well about all this stuff
that doesn't really look like it's part
of the natural world, like moral reasons?
Or in fact, like any normative reasons.
They don't look like
they're natural things,
logical properties, modal
properties like possibilities.
Where are possibilities in the world?
Where are necessities in the world?
Now that isn't meant to
be a rhetorical question
so as to mean, oh, there's
no way you could locate them.
Some people will try to locate them.
But the point is, if you are starting
with metaphysical naturalism,
if you're committed to that,
but you also think there's definitely
some kind of moral reasons,
there's definitely some kind
of ethical reasons, then
you're going to think
that a certain project is
going to present itself to you.
How do we locate moral
reasons, logical properties
and so on in the natural world?
But if you think you can't,
then that's a common motivation
for something called Moral Error Theory.
Now it's not the only motivation
for Moral Error Theory
but Moral Error Theory
is an accepted position.
I don't mean it's accepted in the sense
that people accept it,
(audience lightly laughing)
I mean, it's accepted that it
is a position in metaethics.
It's a very small minority position,
but it's nevertheless
taken seriously enough.
In fact in some ways
it's taken extremely seriously
in the following sense.
Lots of views in metaethics you
can see sometimes explicitly
and sometimes implicitly, as a response.
As a way of avoiding error theory.
In a similar way that lots of,
there's other kinds of moral skepticism
other than Moral Error Theory,
but you can see a lot of
what's going on in ethics
as ways of avoiding skepticism, right?
Now here's the most common
version of Moral Error Theory.
Moral concepts, so the concept
of moral obligation, duty,
permissibility, impermissibility,
responsibility even,
or even just the concept
of a moral reason itself.
A moral truth, moral fact, all that stuff.
All those concepts,
presuppose categorical
reasons or requirements.
Now what does that mean?
That term, and by the
way that's just one way
of framing the basic idea in
terms of categorical reasons.
That term comes from Kant,
and it's set in opposition
to hypothetical reasons.
Hypothetical reasons are reasons
that depend on some kind of desire
or concern, or goal that you have.
So, I had the goal of getting here in time
to give this talk, and given
that goal, I needed to leave.
There's a requirement.
You had better leave by 3:00.
But if I didn't have
the goal of being here,
then that reason for
leaving by 3:00 goes away.
There's no requirement,
there's nothing normative,
you don't have to leave by 3:00,
if you don't have the
goal of getting somewhere.
Categorical reasons, are
reasons or requirements
that don't have that kind of dependence.
And so according to this premise,
the very concept of a moral
reason to do something
is one that, it doesn't go away,
just because you don't have
some kind of concern or goal.
So you have a moral obligation
not to steal for example,
you still have a reason not to steal.
In fact according to some
people's way of thinking
including Kant, you have
an overriding reason
not to steal regardless
of what your own concerns,
or interests, or values are all right?
So that's a semantic premise
or a conceptual premise if you like,
that's it's built into
the very idea of morality.
That's there's these kinds
of reasons or requirements,
but their aint no reasons
or requirements like that,
that's the second premise,
or we're not justified
in believing in them.
It's not the only way to
argue for this premise.
But as part of arguing for
this premise is to say,
requirements that are somehow
just floating totally free
of any of your actual concerns,
those are just spooky.
Those would have to be
some kind of other worldly,
non-natural kinds of entities.
And so, metaphysical
naturalism plays a role
in motivating this error
theoretic conclusion.
And the conclusion is, all
moral claims are false then.
Just like, it's modeled really
on an argument for atheism.
It's the same idea.
Religious concepts presuppose
some kind of supernatural creator.
There aint no supernatural creator,
therefore all these claims are false.
That's the basic logic.
Now, if you accept an
error theory or in fact,
even if you think an error
theory is sufficiently plausible,
something called the now
what question shows up.
Well, if moral error
theory is true now what?
What are we going to do?
Well, what I want to
first of all point out
is that all error theorists
acknowledge that that question
is left wide open by their error theories.
When they make an error theory,
when they present an
error theory, they're not,
in and of itself, not trying
to say anything negative
about moral discourse,
they're just trying to say,
the claims that are made in the discourse
are not true, or they're not justified.
It's just like you could imagine
with religious discourse.
We might think okay, all these
claims are technically false
but geez, suppose the whole society
was just built on religious discourse.
It's not obvious that you
should just immediately stop
with all the religious discourse.
So there's a certain kind of response,
it's fictional, we'll
talk more about these,
I'm going to list them very briefly.
Fictionalism says, we should just pretend
to believe moral judgements.
I'll tell you why, soon enough.
Now we shouldn't believe
'em 'cause they're wrong,
'cause they're false, and you
shouldn't believe false things
and there's reasons given for that.
Another one is, hey, maybe we should
just get rid of moral discourse.
Now that's partly because
all the claims are false,
or unjustified, I'm
just going to say false,
and that'll mean false or unjustified.
But abolitionists also think
there's something the matter
with moral discourse beyond
the claims being false.
They think its no good, and
I'll tell you a little more
about why they think that,
and then conservationists,
really only one of these that I know of,
and the basic idea there is just like,
ah, just keep on keepin'
on, don't worry about it.
If they're all false, if
they're all unjustified
it really isn't that big
of a deal in and of itself.
Really, who cares?
And you might think, maybe you
think I think that's silly.
I don't think that's necessarily silly,
I just think the whole way
of framing this problem,
the whole way of getting
to where we've gotten,
that's what I think the problem is,
not let's say conservationism
or something like that.
And of course you'll see
what I mean as we go on.
So now, the now what question is really,
now we're entering, necessarily,
and by anybody's acknowledgement,
now we're entering into conceptual ethics.
Now what's that?
Well, generally speaking,
normative and evaluative questions
and ethical questions about concept usage.
So, for example, moral
obligation, that concept.
Is that a good one?
Is it a good one maybe for certain people
but not other people?
Maybe in certain contexts
and not other ones?
Just as an example,
you're asking about the
ethics of concept usage.
Now why would you do that?
Why is conceptual ethics interesting?
Or important?
Well, as I think you already can tell,
I don't think it's
interesting and important,
because maybe error theory is true.
That's the way that metaethicists,
in fact the only way that
metaethicists acknowledge,
it's widely acknowledged
that an error theory
is going to lead to questions
in conceptual ethics,
but those questions in conceptual ethics
are not questions in metaethics,
as it's ordinarily thought of.
In fact, unfortunately David Plunkett
in the philosophy department here,
he's not here, but he's a leading figure
in conceptual ethics and
he's also a metaethicist,
and he thinks that metaethics
and conceptual ethics
are completely separate,
there is no overlap
between metaethics and conceptual ethics.
And I think on the other
hand, that conceptual ethics
ought to be a central part of metaethics.
And in fact it already is,
even though we don't
really acknowledge it.
Now I think the reason why,
and David would agree with
me here, that folk concepts,
and by the way, the concepts that we use
are all folk concepts basically.
In ethics, concept of moral
obligation and justice,
they're all hundreds or
even thousands of years old,
these are historical products,
at least some of which are
likely created or maintained
by questionable forces of selection.
For me, I wouldn't say natural selection.
There are people who think
that certain concepts
are the product of biological selection.
I don't think that's plausible,
but a cultural selection, yeah.
And I think that's especially
plausible in ideology,
and it's especially plausible I think,
when you're talking about concepts
that pretty clearly serve
some kind of function
of social control or coordination.
Like, it shouldn't be too shocking to us
if some racial, gender,
religious or moral concepts
are the way they are as a
function, at least to some extent
of ideology and other
maybe forces of selection,
that are not normative, in the sense that
the forces of selection
are not trying to select
for good stuff, they're trying to select
for something else that may not be good.
So, Pragmatic Naturalism,
that's the methodology
that I'm advocating, whether
or not you think it's part
of metaethics, but I
think it is, should be.
There's really two steps.
The first step is to seek.
The naturalism part is that we're seeking
naturalistic explanations,
functional explanations,
or what I'll call used explanations,
of problematic or otherwise
interesting concepts.
So instead of asking,
what does the concept
moral obligation refer to,
that's a standard metaethical approach.
I'm asking what's the
function of that concept?
And that as we're going to see I think,
can come quite apart
from a semantic thesis
about what the concept refers to.
And then, you just use those explanations,
and by the way, the function could be,
it could be the function that the concept
was evolved or developed to serve,
but it could also just be,
what are we doing with it now
whether or not it was developed
or evolved for that purpose?
So, you could put what's
it for, what's it good for?
What are we using it to do,
at whatever level of analysis?
Then you use those
explanations to get leverage
on questions in conceptual ethics.
So, if you have a sense of what
we're doing with the concept
as distinct from what the concept means,
or what it refers to,
what are we doing with it?
That is very valuable information,
when you're asking questions about,
okay, well should we keep the concept?
Do we want a concept that does that?
And if we do, maybe a
different concept could do it
a little better, maybe we
could revise the concept.
If we don't want something
playing that role at all,
maybe we just abandon the concept.
Maybe we should bring
in some other concept,
or something like that, but the question,
the point is, knowing what
we're doing with the thing
is very important information
when we want to know
whether we should keep doing it
in that way or in some different way.
And there's no error theory required here.
There's nothing about semantics in there.
And an error theory, as
it's universally understood,
has some kind of conceptual
semantic premise.
I'm not saying anything
about the semantics.
In fact I'm pointedly leaving them aside,
'cause I think, as I'll try to show you,
I think they end up being quite confusing.
Now I've already talked
about the now what question,
and the now what question
the way it's framed
is sort of bound up with error theory.
It's, if error theory is true now what?
And that's a different question,
it's a related question but
it's a different question
than what I'm calling
Nietzsche's question.
Nietzsche said, this is the Gay Science,
said, "Look, the value of
the injunction 'Thou Shalt'",
and what he means by that, by the way,
he's doing some conceptual
ethics already, himself, here,
and I wanted to have another
quote where he told us why
we should do conceptual ethics,
but it's already too long.
But he's using this phrase,
or this term thou shalt as,
so he knew about categorical imperatives
and categorical reason, but he thought,
there's something deeper and
more fundamental going on,
that the notion of categorical imperative
or categorical reason,
that's a precisification
or a conceptualization of some
anthropological phenomenon
that he wanted to point
to, without infusing it
already with a certain conceptualization
of what that phenomenon was.
And he uses this notion of thou shalt,
to just point to this sense that we have
which is central to moral
discourse he thought,
but not only moral discourse maybe,
that there's certain things
that we just have to do,
regardless of whether or not those things
comport or conform to our own values.
And he said, "All right, the
value of that injunction"
that thou shalt do certain things,
"Is fundamentally different
from and independent of
whatever "Weeds of
error", whatever beliefs
that may have grown up
around that sensibility.
There may be beliefs, there
may be systematic beliefs
that have grown up
around that sensibility,
and those beliefs may be false,
they may not be as systematic as all that,
but his interest was, in
this passage at least,
his interest is,
what's the value of that?
And it's independent of whatever
these false beliefs might be.
So he says, "No one until now"
and when he says until now
he means himself, 150 years ago-ish,
"Nobody's examined the value
of that" what he called
"The most famous of all
medicines, morality."
And he means other things by morality
in a different context,
but in this context
he's talking about this
injunction, thou shalt.
So look, for once we've
got to question it.
Precisely that is our task,
and that's what I'm going to
suggest metamorals in particular,
metamorals ought to be doing that.
At least a central aspect of metamorals
ought to be investigating the value
of
moral concepts,
and this feature of moral
concepts in particular.
And that is something that only,
first of all only error
theorists do at all,
because from the standard
metaethical point of view,
you don't even get to this question
unless you go through error theory.
And then even then conservationism
doesn't take that question up.
Conservationism doesn't
have a long defense
of the value of moral
discourse, it just says hey,
the fact that the beliefs
are false, so what?
There's like two pages
of Jonas Olson's book
that are devoted to conservationism.
You just take the value of moral discourse
for granted essentially and say,
okay, false belief, who cares?
But there has been some defense
of the value of moral
discourse, Moral Fictionalism,
being the most sustained defense.
And Richard Joyce says,
as I already told you,
"We should pretend to
believe in moral judgements."
We should pretend to
believe moral judgements,
"Because they have value
as a commitment device"
or a commitment strategy,
and the basic idea there,
is that the belief that
there's certain things
that you just have to do regardless
of whether you want to or care about it,
is it good for stabilizing intentions
against preference switching?
So we humans and in fact all vertebrates
have a pretty systematic tendency
to switch our preferences
overtime as certain temptations
get closer in time, get more available,
the preference for not partying,
or not stuffing your face or
whatever it might be, switches.
Not cheating on your spouse maybe.
I prefer the long-term benefits
of staying in this relationship.
But when various temptations,
or stealing something,
the various temptations become
more immediately available
we have a real tough time a lot of times,
not switching preferences,
and then regretting it.
And so, Joyce says, and by the way,
this is the most sustained defense
of the value of moral discourse,
and he's specifically talking about
the thou shalt feature of moral discourse.
Takes up eight pages of a book.
That's the most sustained
defense we've got.
And it's good for avoiding punishment.
Like if you don't have
these commitment strategies,
you're more likely to steal, cheat,
and so on, and more likely to suffer.
So that's what's good about them.
So we should pretend to
believe them for that reason.
But the thing is, he didn't
consider any of the downsides
of those strategies,
it was all just upside.
And so a few years ago,
I guess five and a half
years ago at this point,
I published a paper called
Breakdown of Moral Judgment
where I argued that that
committing function is,
you're right, and now,
he's not the only one
to argue for this, a number
of people have thought
that the sort of
attitude-independent feature
of moral discourse has this
basic committing function.
This is not the subject of the talk today,
but I argue that that
committing function comes
with very serious and unrecognized risks,
including, especially,
the unwitting violation
of our own, deepest values.
And like I said, this is not the time,
I'm not going to try to
convince you of that now,
you can ask about it in a question.
But, just to give you a sense
of how that might happen,
it shouldn't be too shocking,
if a mode of thought
and discourse that says,
certain things you have to do,
there are a number of things,
in fact all the moral things,
you have to do them whether or not,
they comport with your values.
That shouldn't be shocking
if you end up being obligated
to do things that are against your values.
So it shouldn't be terribly shocking
if this resulted from a moral discourse.
And you can imagine,
quite similar critiques
of religious discourse couldn't you?
You're probably already
familiar with some maybe.
God commands you to kill.
Whether you want to
kill isn't the question.
God said kill, and morality
sometimes says kill too.
I'm not saying killing's always wrong,
I'm just giving you an analogy.
So I just want to get a couple
of quick theses on the board,
one, commitment, that's
just me agreeing with Joyce
and a number of other
people that the thou shalt
in moral discourse functions to commit us
to certain ways of thinking,
feeling and acting,
and then the more original contribution
was this thesis, deflection, which says
that this committing function operates,
an important part of how the
committing function works
is by deflecting attention,
and therefore awareness
from the motivations that in
fact generate moral judgments.
And you can imagine divine command
would have essentially the same function.
God wills it,
you might think, yeah, it's
not really God willing it
though is it, it's you, but
you're just saying God wills it.
And by the way, that goes
whether there's God or not.
You can have all kinds of people talking
about what God wills,
God wills that we go kill
the infidels or whatever it might be.
That God paradigmatically has a will
that's independent of your own
and authoritative over your own.
And so, but really moral discourse,
especially our Judeo-Christian
moral discourse,
it just comes right out of that tradition.
It's a legalistic framework basically.
Divine law, but with God stripped out.
And I argue that those
two theses together,
support the most common and
central abolitionist critique
of moral discourse, and that is,
I call them critiques from self-awareness,
because the most common kind
of critique of moral discourse,
one that really runs through a number
of quite different kinds
of critiques otherwise,
is that moral discourse
does promote self-ignorance.
Especially ignorance of your own motives,
I would also say ignorance
of your own values,
and promotes some kind of bad faith,
hypocrisy, something like that.
That's not to say, that
everybody including probably
the majority of people in this room,
who are sincere, committed
users of moral discourse,
that you're all a bunch of hypocrites
and acting in bad faith,
anymore than it's saying
that about religious people.
It's instead pointing
out, there's a dangerous
and very real tendency for
a certain kind of discourse
and way of thinking to
generate very serious problems
even though, in a world
where everybody's religious,
you might say hey,
those people over there,
oh, they're super hypocritical
or acting in bad faith,
but it would take a perspective
from outside of all that
to say, well really, part of the problem
is just the religious framework itself.
I'm not saying you have
to agree with that,
I'm just trying to get you to
understand how the idea works.
And these are some related things,
that moral discourse promotes
exacerbation of conflict,
group-think, slavishness to a
certain conception of value,
and violation of one's own values,
and there are some authors
who have made arguments like this.
Now the thing is that
all of these critiques,
with I would say the
exception of Nietzsche,
Nietzsche's going to be the exception
in so many different ways,
they're all predicated on error theory.
Everybody arguing this, explicitly says,
first let me show you
that error theory is true,
then the now what question arises,
and then if I'm an
abolitionist, then I say,
and moral discourse is
also bad in these ways.
But what's happened as
a consequence of that
is that by their own likes,
like these abolitionists
don't think otherwise,
if you could rightly
reject their error theory,
then the rest of what comes after it
is just off the table already,
if they're predicated on error theory.
And I think that has,
been very, very bad, especially
from the perspective
of somebody who thinks
that these critiques
are on the right track.
So I think these abolitionists
treat error theory as a bridge
to the now what question,
or Nietzsche's question,
but really it's a mote.
It's really an obstacle,
because error theory actually,
in my judgment isn't very plausible.
I don't think it's right.
And even more importantly,
almost the vast majority
of metaethicists don't
think it's right either.
And I'm going to show you,
just a couple of different
kinds of examples
of metaethical theories
that are not only consistent
with those abolitionist critiques
from self-awareness but
actually support them.
But nobody has any idea,
because nobody's thinking
about it this way.
Nobody's asking, what's the
value of moral discourse,
unless you're an error theorist.
Instead people are asking,
what does moral fact refer to,
and can I locate that
in the natural world?
And if I can, then Nietzsche's
question isn't even arising.
And that's all confused, in my assessment.
So, I'm going to show you,
pretty much the rest of the
discussion is going to be,
couple of examples of
how pragmatic naturalism
is going to help reveal
that,
whereas the standard metaethical
methodologies obscure it.
So one way to attempt to
vindicate moral discourse
by rejecting error theory,
is there's a very large class of views,
in fact some of which are
even called realist views,
confusingly, but really they're a kind
of naturalistic relativism,
and the core idea here,
is that you reject that semantic premise.
So, first the naturalism
is a kind of metaphysical
naturalism, it's fine,
it thinks that moral concepts,
they don't presuppose or try to refer
to any kind of
non-naturalistic kind of thing,
and not a categorical reason either,
that's the relativism part.
They're relative to some
kind of human attitude,
or goal, or concern,
and given that these judgments
are relative to some
kind of human concern,
sometimes they're going to be true.
Maybe very often true.
And of course as soon as you get that,
you've beaten error theory.
If any moral judgments are true
error theory's done, right?
Especially if lots of 'em are true.
Now I'm going to give you in some ways
a very extreme example of this.
The general point I'm going to make here,
I think applies to all views like that.
But it's going to be especially striking
in this particular case.
According the Jesse Prinz,
"Moral claims just refer
to moral sentiments"
and who could doubt that
moral sentiments exist?
Nobody's doubting that.
Moral sentiments are just dispositions
to feel someway or another
with certain kinds of emotions.
Now he has a causal account of reference.
You don't have to really
understand what this means,
but just for those of
you who are interested,
the idea is, the thing
that causes the judgment
is what the judgment refers to.
Do you need to think that's plausible?
Or even really understand it?
No, you definitely don't
need to think it's plausible
because the point is, so what?
My point is, suppose it's true.
Suppose it's the case,
that the things that cause
the judgments are also
the semantic referent
of the judgment and therefore,
there's going to be lots and
lots of true moral judgments.
In fact, the judgment
interracial marriage is wrong.
It's true, provided that
the person who says it
has a sentiment of disapprobation
toward interracial marriage, and likewise,
interracial marriage is
our highest duty provided
that the person who says it
has the relevant sentiment.
So there's going to be, and Prinz
completely acknowledges this,
I mean, the vast majority
of moral judgments are true.
The only time moral judgments aren't true
is when you don't have the sentiment.
When you're pretending
to have a certain kind
of sentiment, that's pretty much it.
So, two diametrically
opposed moral judgments
can easily both be true on this account.
Well error theory's done, and yet,
intuitively we're not really
vindicating moral discourse.
Why?
Well, on Prinz's view moral truths
are just as abundant
as they are worthless.
They're all over the place all the time,
and they're worth what you'd expect
something to be that's all
over the place all the time.
Or even less than that actually,
'cause errors all over the place
all the time are super-valuable.
But the crucial thing to see here
is that the concept of moral truth,
if we accepted that semantic account,
the concept of moral truth
simply could not serve
what seems to be something
central to its function.
The concept of moral truth has a function,
very plausibly, of guiding,
thought and action,
and sentiment, in fact.
If you have a sentiment,
and somebody says,
let's say if you have a sentiment,
let's say you're opposed
to interracial marriage,
and then somebody says,
well it's a moral truth
that interracial is perfectly fine,
that's supposed to function
to adjust your sentiment.
So you don't disapprove of it anymore.
But if we accept this
account of moral truth,
just whatever I say is
true, as long as I have
the relevant sentiment, then
we would just have to ask,
okay, well what should the moral truth be?
And then that would even just be weird
because won't we just ask
what our sentiment should be?
We're just getting confused, I think.
And I think also,
this is actually somewhat widely accepted,
pretty widely accepted,
I'm not sure how wide.
I think most people would acknowledge it,
and at a minimum acknowledge
there's a very serious challenge here.
I think, no naturalistic
account can accommodate
the categorical, or really even,
or the inherently normative
character of morality.
And this goes back at
least to Hume, who told us
that "You can't ever derive
an ought from an is."
No matter what naturalistic
state of affairs
I describe to you, it'll never follow
from that naturalistic state
of affairs that it's good,
or that you should pursue
it, or anything like that.
So any attempt to try to be
a metaphysical naturalist,
and to accommodate normativity
to metaphysical naturalism,
I personally think is doomed to fail.
And this is an extreme example of that.
There's lots of other examples
that are not so strikingly obvious,
but they're never the less the case.
Now,
Prinz
is a total relativist,
and he tells us,
and he's at least to
this extent Nietzschean.
He's like, "Look, we've got
to constantly remind ourself,
"That our values are not
reflections of an absolute truth.
"Morals are inculcated"
as Nietzsche would say,
"By power struggles and happenstance.
"Reminding ourselves
of the deep contingency
of morality", of moral
truth, in other words
the deep contingency of
our moral sentiments.
Our moral sentiments themselves,
are highly contingent
to a large extent by the kinds of cultures
we've grown up in which themselves are
the function of long historical processes.
"Reminding ourselves of
this deep contingency
"Is just a first step.
"We've also got to subject our values,
"including those we treasure",
and be thinking very specifically
of moral values here,
"To rigorous reconsideration."
Now, I think that's great,
and he describes that, as that's
going to require hard labor
and I could not agree more.
But why moral discourse?
In fact, I think an excellent way
to undermine that entire project
is just to keep referring
to your contingent moralized sentiments
in terms of moral truths, obligations,
duties, responsibilities and the like.
There's no
plausible reason
why, a project like this one,
should take place,
using
concepts of moral obligation,
and moral truth and moral duty and so on.
Plausibly,
those
concepts, even by Prinz's own likes,
and I was tempted to sort
of beat this over the head
a little bit more, but
by Prinz's own likes,
those kind of concepts plausibly work,
precisely to prevent a
rigorous reconsideration.
The idea that the way you feel now,
is reflecting a moral truth,
inhibits you reconsidering
the way you feel right
now, at least very often.
So I think, we need not just
hard labor, but better tools.
The idea that we should
continue using these tools,
at least as an open question, I think,
pretty plausible.
So what about, there's this one other,
very different kind of way
for rejecting error theory
and vindicating moral discourse.
And I'm going to tell you what
expressivism is in a second,
but before that, the idea,
I'm going to put it a
couple of different ways,
we're going to start as expressivist,
and then mimic normative realism.
Now realism, that's one of
the many ways of referring
to this basic idea of categorical reasons.
Realism is like mind independence.
So, realism in the way
that they are using it,
the way the quasi-realists use realism,
is they mean normative facts
that are totally independent
of your actual attitudes, all right?
I'm going to skip that quote.
So, expressivism.
We're starting as expressivists,
what are we starting as?
Well the basic idea is a certain
kind of explanatory strategy.
You're going to explain moral judgments
and normative judgments more generally,
as expressions of practical attitudes
or desire-like attitudes.
Desire-like meaning, if you
have what you ordinarily
think of as a belief, and
you perceive the world
doesn't match the content of
your belief, what do you do?
You change the belief, right?
That make sense?
Whereas if you have a desire,
and you see the state of the world
doesn't match the content of your desire,
do you change your desire?
No, the whole point of a desire is,
you try to change the world,
to bring it in line with
the way you want it to be,
that's just the nature of a desire.
So that's the core idea here,
is that these moral judgments
are expressing certain kinds
of practical attitudes,
desire-like attitudes.
So if stealing is wrong for example,
expresses some kind of
disapproval toward stealing,
and that's just what it does.
It doesn't say some proposition
and also expresses approval,
it just is expressing disapproval.
Now that has seemed for a
long time, to a lot of people,
like that's got to entail
some kind of relativism, or error theory.
Why relativism?
Well how could moral facts be
independent of our attitudes,
if moral judgments just are
expressions of our attitudes?
So if moral judgments are
simply being explained
in terms of the expression of attitudes,
how could moral facts be
independent of the attitudes?
That's one problem that
quasi-realists want to solve,
especially as quasi-realism
has developed over time.
And it used to be that they would
kind of say, well they're not.
They would try to really not be realists,
but over time they're like, okay,
we're just go full on and mimic realism
as much as we conceivably can.
And also, again, expressivism
kind of started out
as what's called non-cognitivism,
which is saying that moral judgments
are neither true nor false,
and that avoids certain kind of problems,
but then again, boy, you might
as well be an error theorist,
because people definitely
think moral claims are true.
It's the idea that a moral
claim, at least could be true,
it's so bound up in moral discourse
that if you think that
can't be true or false,
how is that better than
error theory really?
So they don't want error theory,
and they don't non-cognitivism
anymore either.
They want that moral
judgments can be true.
And even attitude-independent.
That's a lot to do,
if you're starting from
where they're starting.
And one of the really important
tools that they've used,
especially Simon Blackburn has used to try
to get this project to work
is semantic deflationism.
And this may sound quite wrong to you
as it often does when
people first hear it,
but just bear with me for a second.
And, it's really going to be okay
even if you don't totally get it.
But it's worth putting on the board.
The idea here is you reject the
idea that a sentence is true
because it corresponds
to how the world is.
That's a very intuitive idea.
That a sentence is true,
like grass is green.
Why is that sentence true?
Well because,
grass is green.
Because it corresponds to
how the world actually is.
Some deflationists don't
think that's what explains,
the truth of a sentence.
Instead, for the predicate true,
that functions to express agreement
with a certain proposition,
and false functions to
express disagreement.
So, I mean I agree that grass is green,
so I think that sentence is true.
But the idea is that states of the world
don't explain why sentences are true.
So, now why is that important?
Well, take the sentence stealing is wrong.
That's going to mean the same thing
as the sentence, stealing
is wrong is true.
So, this is part of what
motivates deflationism,
is just this idea that you can always move
between any proposition P,
and saying that proposition P is true.
I can say, grass is green or I can say,
the sentence grass is green is true.
And I've just said the same thing.
It sounds like maybe I
said different things,
but really according to
deflationism, you haven't said
anything really different
in those two cases.
Now why is that important?
You'll see more but the crucial thing
just for now is to notice that,
well if those two things
mean the same thing,
then the second one is
a normative judgment
because the first one certainly is, right?
Stealing is wrong is
definitely an ethical judgment.
And so if I say the sentence
stealing is wrong is true,
I've just said stealing is
wrong, in different language.
And given that I'm an
expressivist, that bottom sentence
is also expressing a practical attitude.
They both express practical attitudes,
in fact the very same practical attitude.
So I'm calling this sort
of the normative turn,
and the idea here is
that, well I interpreted
that last sentence as
a normative sentence.
If I say the sentence
stealing is wrong is true,
that's a normative claim,
in fact the same claim
as stealing is wrong.
Now what about realism?
How do I get to be a realist,
if I'm an expressivist?
And remember, keep in mind realist
is what Nietzsche had
in mind by thou shalt,
is, how do I get
attitude-independent normative truths
if normative judgments just
are expressions of attitudes?
Well, I'm going to interpret
belief about the nature
of normativity as itself
a normative belief
expressing a practical attitude.
So for example, belief in realism,
I'm going to explain that in
terms, if I'm an expressivist,
and this both Allan
Gibbard and Simon Blackburn
have done this in their different ways,
I'm going to explain belief in realism,
or sometimes objective
moral truths, in terms,
of the possession of certain
kinds of practical attitudes.
But specifically,
practical attitudes aimed
at stabilizing other practical attitudes.
So, basically as commitment devices.
For example, saying that the wrongness
of kicking dogs for fun.
If I say, the wrongness
of kicking dogs for fun,
is totally independent
of anybody's attitudes
about kicking dogs for
fun, including my own,
Allan Gibbard tells us, "Well
look, you're just expressing
"A commitment to not kick dogs for fun,
"And to condemn kicking dogs for fun,
"Even in circumstances that
might happen in the future
"Where you're disposed to
approve of kicking dogs for fun",
or maybe you're disposed
to kick a dog for fun,
"Or maybe you're not
disposed to condemn it."
It's a kind of second order
practical belief in realism,
is a second order practical attitude aimed
at stabilizing certain first
order practical attitudes.
So, we can sort of see how this
quasi-realist master argument goes.
The idea is the following,
and then we're going to try
to defeat error theory and
legitimize moral discourse.
According to error theory,
beliefs about the nature
of normativity are not
themselves normative beliefs.
So if I'm an error theorist,
I think, look, people believe
that there are these
attitude-independent reasons,
but that belief itself is
not a normative belief.
It's just a belief about
the nature of normativity.
So according to error theory,
these are not normative beliefs.
Well, yeah they are
according to quasi-realists,
they are normative beliefs.
Well in that case, error
theory is just confused.
Error theory thinks these
beliefs are not normative
but really they are, and in fact
they're just expressions
of practical attitudes.
And therefore, according
to Simon Blackburn,
"There's nothing illegitimate
"In our ordinary practice and thought",
and he specifically means
moral practice and thought.
"The respects in which
we talk as if there are
"For instance, moral
facts, are legitimate."
Why are they legitimate?
Because error theory is false.
But that's just confused.
That whole line of thinking is confused.
I should say, that no quasi-realist
has actually laid that argument out,
but that is, how it actually works.
Cause if you actually
laid it out like that
it would be more obvious
that it doesn't work.
Why doesn't it work?
Well look, showing that
apparently non-normative,
metaphysical beliefs about
the nature of normativity,
if you show that those apparently
non-normative beliefs
are actually normative,
that doesn't suggest
that they're legitimate.
Instead, it suggests that those beliefs,
if they're going to be defended at all
would have to be defended
on normative grounds.
If it's a normative belief,
how do you defend a normative belief?
With normative arguments.
It doesn't just become legitimate
because it's normative,
anymore than slavery is great.
If I'm expressing a practical attitude,
does that mean its fine?
No!
I'd have to defend it
on normative grounds,
it doesn't become
legitimate automatically.
And quasi-realists just have not engaged
at all, with any normative arguments,
against realist moral discourse.
And the reason they
haven't, is because they,
like everybody else literally, almost,
just assumes that if
you defeat error theory,
then all those abolitionist
normative arguments
are just off the table.
But they're not off the table at all,
in fact, it's strictly entailed
by the interpretation of realism here
that's it's a normative belief.
That just means you have to defend it
on normative grounds if you're
going to defend it at all.
And abolitionists have lots
of normative arguments
against moral discourse.
Unfortunately they've predicated
them on an error theory.
So nobody pays any attention to them
because nobody believes error theory.
But you don't need to
believe error theory.
So, I say the quasi-realists
have worked so hard
to earn the right to talk like,
that's one of the ways
quasi-realism has been framed is,
we're going to earn the
right to talk like realists.
Well I guess, I have the
right to eat my own poop.
(audience laughing mildly)
But, should I eat my own poop?
And I'm like well, let's at
least have that conversation.
You've heard the right
to talk like realists,
you've been trying to do that so much
that you haven't wondered whether,
what's the value of
talking like a realist?
What's the value of
moral discourse realism,
and by they way, they see realism
as tightly bound up with
moral discourse itself,
and you can tell that they do,
because that's why they work
so hard to talk like realists.
Because they believe, they
have accepted their criticism.
Look, if you can't deliver realism,
then you're basically an error theorist.
And they don't want to
be an error theorist,
so they're trying super-hard
to say everything that realists say,
but they haven't asked
Nietzsche's question.
What's the value of this?
What are we doin' this for?
So, if we're aware of these commitments
and I just showed you how Gibbard thinks
of belief in realism basically
as a kind of commitment strategy.
Expressing a second order attitude
aimed at stabilizing
first order intentions.
Why can't we just talk in
terms of those attitudes then?
Why can't we just say, I
really think kicking dogs
for fun sucks, I think that's
a cowardly thing to do,
or however you feel about it,
and it's hard to imagine
a case in which I'm,
that's not what I'm ever tempted by,
kicking dogs for fun, but
I'm tempted by other things.
So, it's worth both
individually and collectively,
trying to figure out how do
we structure our psychologies
and our societies to deal with
this problem of all kinds
of preference switching,
which is the whole point
of a commitment strategy,
is the avoid certain kinds
of preference switching,
at least that's the main point.
Why can't we just talk in terms
of our attitudes and sentiments?
Why do we have to talk in terms
of attitude-independent moral facts?
In fact it just seems to be
confusing everything at best.
That thesis deflection
explains why we're not aware.
That thesis deflection that I am not
arguing for it here directly,
but I'm arguing for it
a little bit indirectly, is
that all these people, Prinz,
I didn't tell you why Prinz
thinks this but he does,
Joyce, Prinz, a number of other theory,
including people who
aren't even metaethicists,
just people investigating moral discourse,
this commitment thesis
is quite widespread.
But nobody,
or essentially,
nobody thinks that that's what I'm doing
when I say that it's a moral fact,
is expressing a certain
kind of commitment.
Well deflection of tension thesis
explains why you're not aware of it,
as it doesn't work so well
if you're aware of it.
We could talk about
that later if you want.
How are we on time?
I need to be done?
A couple of minutes?
- (Moderator) We started a
little late so-- (murmuring)
- Okay, so I'll tell
you pretty quickly then,
why I think expressivists
should embrace deflection.
Well, first of all that would
explain why the vast majority
of non-quasi realists,
just straight-up realists,
don't accept expressivist explanations.
So like Terence Cuneo is a
just straight-up realist,
he says, "These expressivist
interpretations"
of what he's saying, if I
put my Terence Cuneo hat on,
and I say, there are moral
facts that require us
to behave in certain ways regardless
of whatever our attitudes are,
and an expressivist says,
"Well you're expressing
"A certain kind of practical
attitude", Cuneo says,
"That's super uncharitable.
"No I'm not."
Now I think expressivists
need to make a decision.
I think they should either accept
that those are really
uncharitable interpretations,
or,
they could have,
I want to point,
they could appeal to a non-ad hoc,
explanation for why it wouldn't
seem that way to realists.
Because, the way these
concepts have developed,
the way the thinking works,
is that you're not supposed
to realize you're doing that.
Now I'm not saying they
would be necessarily right,
but I'm saying they
should embrace deflection,
as a concomitant to the commitment thesis
that they already essentially accept.
It's a non-ad hoc,
and it would explain
this sumptuous rhetoric.
So Gibbard says, "Look,
suppose somebody says,
'It's a normative fact, out
there independent of us,
'That kicking dogs for fun is wrong'.
He says, "Well look, that turns out
"To be internal to normative thinking",
I already kind of told you
what that meant, right?
That is actually a part
of normative discourse.
It's not a claim about
normative discourse,
from outside normative discourse,
it's internal to normative discourse.
But it's just kind of arrayed
and sumptuous rhetoric.
Well sumptuous is one word for it,
I would say deflecting,
misleading would be a better term
than sumptuous, it's
super misleading rhetoric!
Especially when you
combine it with the fact
that actual realists don't
think it is internal.
If I'm a realist,
well sorry, I should
say, a lot of realists.
Some realists do think it's internal
but they're not expressivists,
but anyway I can't get into that.
Some realists do think
it's a normative claim
but they're not expressivists.
So it wouldn't be hard at all to come up
with an expressivist-friendly
abolitionism.
In fact I have a paper arguing
for a kind of expressivist abolition,
which is not to say that I'm
committed to expressivism,
it's just to say hey, if you
are committed to expressivism,
abolitionism looks pretty good.
But nobody's even aware
of it as a possibility
because there's just no error theory.
And you have to have error
theory to have abolitionism.
But you don't have to
have error theory at all.
And by the way, abolitionism I should say,
in my mouth, doesn't mean
everybody abolish moral,
it just is, there's a
tradition where you offer
these sort of systematic
critiques in moral discourse.
I'm not saying everybody
ought to abolish it.
I'm not even saying it's all bad.
In fact, the whole
commitment thesis explains
why there's a lot of value in it,
just like I think there's a lot of value
in religious discourse,
a great deal of value.
Nevertheless, here's just
an expressivist-friendly
argument for abolitionism.
One, a lot of people,
and these are things,
I think that a expressivist
would actually accept.
We feel values imposed on us.
Obligations to be certain
ways, act certain ways,
and we're encouraged by the mode
of discourse that we engage in,
to feel as if the world, in some sense,
we can't put our finger on it but somehow,
these obligations are just imposed,
either by the world in
the some sense or by God,
if we're talking about
religious discourse.
We're encouraged to feel that there's
something outside of us
that's doing the imposing
and it's not our culture,
it's like normative reality.
You can't ever say really what it means,
got to have these just
holders, or if you're Kant,
you build up an enormous
metaphysical system
to try to justify this sensibility.
But according to expressivists,
it's some combination of your psychology
and culture that doing the imposing.
Now again, there's nothing in expressivism
that would be in conflict
with the second thesis that,
well that leads to some confusion
about the nature of your
relationship to yourself,
and to the world, and
it can promote attitudes
that are impoverished and disempowered.
In fact, Blackburn talks about
defectives in earlier work,
talks about how there's a certain kind
of sensibility out there, and
it's actually kind of common,
according to Blackburn himself.
And what's this sensibility?
The sensibility's the following:
That
unless
my reasons, my moral reasons,
unless they're independent
of my own attitudes,
then they don't really matter that much.
If it's just my attitudes, if
it's just what I care about,
then that just doesn't
have the oomph I need
to get motivated, and Blackburn calls
that very sensibility I
just described, defective.
But gee Blackburn, I mean
doesn't realist discourse
contribute to that sensibility?
The very discourse that
you're trying to mimic,
very plausibly contributes
to the sensibility
that you find defective.
So I'm just going to quote
Joyce here, Richard Joyce,
and by the way, this is somebody
who defended the value of moral discourse.
But he is pointing out here,
that it needs a defense.
He says, "It's something of a travesty
"In moral philosophy that philosophers
"Have just largely contended themselves
"With the unexamined
assumption that morality",
and when he says morality he
means this particular feature
of morality we've been talking about,
"That that's a good thing without which
"We'd all be worse off",
and you can see it happening
with Prinz and lots of
other metaethical theories,
and the quasi-realists
who are just trying to get
this attitude-independence to work out.
Or, even if we're not trying
to get attitude-independence
to work out, we're ignoring the fact
that moral discourse just
has attitude-independence
kind of built into its functionality.
But I think we've got good reason
to think that moral discourse does
inhibit important forms of self-awareness.
That's not only because of thou shalt,
it's also because of, I
didn't talk about this,
but a lot of the punitive
reactive attitudes
like anger, and guilt, and shame
that are central to moral discourse,
and I think standard
approaches to metaethics
have tried to give you
some reasons to think
that standard approaches to metaethics,
including error theory even,
unwittingly protect moral
discourse from such critiques.
Error theory protects
it by presenting itself
as necessary to get to
these normative critiques.
So you reject that,
and you don't even have to
worry about the critiques.
And I think Pragmatic Naturalism
provides a valuable methodology
for evaluating moral and other concepts,
especially if you do it with
a healthy dose of skepticism.
You don't just kind of
assume they're super-good,
and then look for their functions,
but be skeptical about 'em, and then look
for their functions with some skepticism.
I think it connects metaethic inquiry
to cultural critique in an attractive way.
I also think just
independently, investigating,
like if asking the
question, what are we doing
with these concepts from
a functional perspective,
is an independently
interesting contribution
to the project of self-awareness
that has ancient roots
in both Eastern and Western traditions,
and that's a big part of
what I'm trying to do.
All right, thanks, that's it.
(audience applauding)
- Okay, thank you.
I'll keep a list of questions,
if you'll stick your hands up
I'll try and keep order of the microphone
that's going all around, so, all right.
Oh, all right, a long list, awesome.
We're going to stick around a little bit,
so we'll start with Ethan,
and then keep your hands
up, I'll make a neat list.
Is the mic on?
Is it green?
If it's green you're
good, that green light.
- Hello, yeah.
Thanks for the talk, very interesting.
So, I like the pragmatic
naturalist approach,
but basically if we are not
going with error theory,
and we're also not
realists about moral fact,
what is to guide our conceptual
engineering in the situation?
Like basically, when we're thinking
about which concepts to adopt,
what is the thou shalt for
example, in that situation?
I mean it seems like it might
require at least some
normative stances on things,
unless you're simply going
basically off attitudes
and cultural realities, in which case
you might fall into the Hume problem
of deriving Nietzsche From it all.
- Right, thanks.
So I would want to distinguish
between normative
considerations and thou shalt.
So I don't think we need
to have a thou shalt.
Thou shalt is specifically referring
to a certain kind of feeling
that normativity, or
that how you ought to be,
how you ought to do,
is robustly independent
of what your actual concerns are.
So I think, if we're going
to have normativity at all,
it's going to be tied up
with some concerns of ours.
That doesn't mean that it's just
whatever the cultural reality is.
You may have quite deep concerns,
I'll just use concerns by the way
to cover like values, even
instincts, things like,
anything with a sort of directedness
that has a kind of trying to
do this or want to do this,
even sort of maybe certain
kinds of development.
So yeah, any judgments to the effect
that something is good
or bad or right and wrong
or we should do it, I
think all those judgments,
to this extent I agree with expressivists,
that those are preceding,
those judgments just,
whatever the semantic story is,
I don't care what the semantic story is,
but from an explanatory point of view
I think those judgments do
precede from some aspects
of our broadly motivational,
conative psychology.
And so the first thing you asked was
what guides us in the
conceptual engineering,
and that was the main thing that I argued.
I don't think this is the only thing,
but the function was supposed to do that.
The function was supposed to give you
some important information.
It doesn't fall afoul of
Hume's dictum because,
even if you ascertained all
of the functional information
with 100% certainty,
that would not entail,
what to do with the concepts.
But it's going to give you information
that feeds in to the
things that you care about.
So the way I put it was
it gives you leverage on the questions.
If I know what I'm doing
with these concepts,
that gives me important
information to answer the question,
do I want to keep using these concepts,
do I want to use different concepts,
do I want to maybe modify
the concepts that I've got?
And by the way, I'm a big fan
of sort of, looking elsewhere too.
The way that metaethics is presented is,
actually I was going to put
David Plunkett's conception
of metaethics up here, but
there's only so much time.
And he said, "Look, we look
at actual ethical thought
"And talk and we see how
that fits into reality."
But I don't think we ought to be focused
just on our actual
ethical thought and talk,
because there's a lot of other traditions.
There's a lot of ways
we don't actually talk
but that might be worth talking in.
Whether it's Eastern traditions
or religious traditions,
what are all these people doing?
Maybe some of what maybe those concepts
could be really valuable for us.
And I think one of the
ways, but not the only way
is to see what are the concepts doing?
What roles are they serving?
Did that get at it?
- (Ethan) Yeah yeah, it does.
- (Moderator) Sam's next.
- (Sam) I wanted--
- Green?
- Now it's flashing.
Okay, so I wanted to ask
about the contribution
of the naturalist part of your formula.
- (Eric) Yeah.
- Seems to me that naturalism is another
disputable position, and
it wasn't clear to me
how to add it to your critique.
And so my short version of thought is,
error theory is a big mote.
You got to get people over error theory
to form the bridge to conceptual ethics.
- Yep.
- Naturalism's a small mote
because it's a certain kind of orthodoxy
but I think it's sort of widely thought
that when people drill down to ask
what's the content of naturalism,
and how do you police the boundaries
and then stuff turns out
to be something like,
we bow a lot to what the methodology
and the actual sciences tells us
is available and relevant explanation.
Suppose I just set that aside and said,
here's what I want, let's
use whatever tools seem
to be acceptable generally,
whether we're naturalists
or, set aside the ideology
of naturalism and say,
we're looking at broadly speaking
sociological debunking explanations,
or sociological explanations
of what our concepts are doing.
So we're pragmatists, what are we doing?
Seems like we can push this whole program
and the naturals part about whether
I'm wedded to saying that
the world contains roughly
what a fairly unified
vocabulary of science,
'cause, God what that
turns out to be right?
Naturalism is often poked
as turning out to be
toothless open-mindedness in the end.
Why don't we just take the
naturalism off and say,
let's not have to cross that mote either.
- Right, so the kind of
naturalism that I'm promoting,
is not metaphysical naturalism.
The kind of naturalism I'm promoting,
the pragmatic naturalism,
is entirely consistent with
saying that normative reasons
are not part of the natural
world but they do exist.
In fact I think, that's my own view,
but it's not a robustly metaphysical view.
It's just,
if you need to posit,
normative reasons, to explain
normative reason discourse,
then that's a good reason for thinking
that normative reasons are natural.
I'm just getting this from Huw Price,
which I just, I think he's right.
If you need to posit some
entity or property,
to explain
practice, then that's a
good reason for considering
that thing that you
posited to be naturalistic,
because it's playing a
role in causal explanation.
And so, but if you don't need to posit it
to explain natural things,
then it's probably best just
to consider it non-naturalistic.
But it's so metaphysically lightweight.
It's not saying anything that
ought to be controversial
or ought to get your
hackles up, like what?
You might as well be
talkin' about witches.
It's like no, no, no, it's just literally,
it's just a trivial consequence of what is
or isn't needed to explain something.
And as far as what is and isn't
needed to explain something,
the reason
I think,
the kinds of explanations
that I think have
by far the best chance of succeeding,
are ones that are broadly naturalistic.
They're broadly scientific explanations.
That doesn't mean they have to be the ones
that science currently
says, but they're the kind
of explanations that you could recognize
as totally fitting into
the scientific enterprise.
That's really the only--
- Yeah, so if I just said,
I'll just take an explanatory pragmatism.
Just set aside the whole question like,
how do we police the boundaries
of accounts as the natural?
We're just trying to get
good, tractable explanations
on how we use these concepts,
and then that's going to turn out
often to have stuff that
oh, raises self-awareness,
and we're seeing where
we're replicating ideologies
that we might not sign up
for, where we're pressed,
even standing in a kind of Foucauldian,
scales fall from your eyes
when you look at things
from a different point of view.
And so the naturalism piece
isn't something I need to buy,
to buy the rest of your package.
I mean I can see how like it's a nice--
- Yeah--
- If you like naturalism
anyway--
- It sounds--
- You can fit it together with this.
It just didn't look like it
was doing much to drive your--
- If I'm understanding you right,
it wouldn't be so much
that you're not buying it
as opposed to you don't
think that the term
is really doing much work--
- Yeah, I don't mean to say
you're rejecting, I'm just thinking,
suppose I'm just neutral
about what this dispute
about naturalism is.
- Yes.
- I can still take on board--
- Yeah--
- The structure--
- Okay, yeah--
- Of your critique--
- So two maybe,
if I'm understanding you right,
aren't you thinking that,
so one of two possibilities.
One is that naturalism just
doesn't even denote anything,
so it's just confusing
to even put it in there.
Another possibility is, it does
denote something but namely,
whatever the broadly scientific
enterprise investigates,
that's natural stuff, it does denote that,
but why restrict our explanations
to those kind a priori?
Is that--
- Yeah.
- Okay, in that case,
so you make a good point that
I wouldn't want to restrict
necessarily but at the same time,
from the point of view of a methodology
I do think those are the kind
that you ought to be looking at.
Yeah.
- Okay, fair enough.
- (Moderator) Will you
pass that to Rachel?
- Yeah so, well it seems to be
an incredibly complex problem
to deal with, (chuckles) so kudos to you.
Am I right to say that the big difficulty
behind a lot of it is that it
kind of binds together value?
Would you say value, what value has this?
Nietzsche's problem, right?
And then you say value to whom?
And that is a can of worms
without a bottom right?
Because it's just very complicated,
because then you go into the question
of binding value and authority.
Who's going to decide, what is right
or what is wrong, in a more universal way?
So, you mentioned the kicking of the dog.
Well, in some cultures
eating dogs is cool.
In fact it's wonderful.
So, how do you pass,
how can we ever hope
to go beyond this sort
of cultural polarization
of right and wrong, and value?
- Well, so, the question
is a huge one as well.
The project is big and
so is that question.
So I'll say a couple of things,
without pretending that there's anyway
I could possibly satisfactorily
answer that question.
But, there's two rough things
I think it's worth saying.
One is that,
a lot of cultural disagreements
might not be as deep as they seem to be.
Many people have written
on this kind of topic like,
it may be that the disagreement
between let's say slave owning societies
and non-slave owning societies
isn't as deep as it seems.
One reason to think so is that,
and then you could just talk about
our society at different times right?
Often, there are
non-normative or at least
beliefs that look non-normative,
that are playing a kind
of justifying role.
So if you don't think that
certain kinds of people are,
if you think that certain kinds of people
are inherently inferior in certain ways,
well that goes and plays a role,
whether it's a sufficient justification
is a different question,
but it's playing a role
in justifying let's say slave practices.
But there might be beliefs
about the basic potential
of certain kinds of people
that are just false.
And so the disagreement is
actually not fundamental.
We could call it a non-fundamental
normative disagreement.
So if you could know certain things
about humanity, about different races,
then you might well
lose the justifications
that you yourself think you need.
So when it comes to eating dogs,
I'm not going to stand a
stand on whether it's right
to eat dogs or not, 'cause honest,
I don't know the answer, in
a different cultural context.
So that's another thing, is to be,
a kind of due humility
about whether you know
what's right for other people.
But it may turn out, it could
turn out for all we know,
that if you understood what was up,
with not only dogs but cows and pigs
and other animals like that,
if you knew the kinds of things
that they were capable of,
whether emotionally, cognitively,
that you yourself would find, well gee,
I don't think we should eat them.
And so the disagreement
may not be so fundamental.
On the other hand, you may
have fundamental disagreements.
It could turn out, that
two different cultures,
or just two different kinds of people,
whether they're culturally
different or not,
they may be genetically different,
or developmentally
different, you could turn out
to have fundamental disagreement,
and if you have fundamental disagreement
then you have to figure
out what to do about it.
It doesn't automatically follow
that just because we have
fundamental disagreement
we have to go to war, because
we may also have some values
about not killing people over
fundamental disagreements.
Depends on the nature of the disagreement.
But it would be very
valuable to investigate
whether certain disagreements
are fundamental or not,
and if they are fundamental,
then to try to figure out
what to do about that,
and the answer to that question
will depend on the case.
If it turns out that some culture,
at the very deepest level
just values certain kinds
of torture and genocide
and so on, then we may,
maybe we should, try to
eliminate that culture.
But you just have to see
in a case by case basis.
- (Rachel) That's why religion's good
on a supernatural level, it's in thought,
it gives moral value--
- Could you use the mic?
- (Rachel) Yeah, that's
why religion's brought this
away I guess, from the human plane today,
supernatural is that,
this is coming from above,
it's beyond us, so that
it's beyond value choices.
- Yeah.
- And that sort of
settles the problem, with
the confusion that of course
there are many different
kinds of religions
or different value systems
but it's kind of around that,
it's really difficult but it's
very wonderful, thank you.
- I hate to add one more complication
but given that I'm sort of Nietzschean,
there's also the issue of,
when you said up to us.
So there's two different things going,
one is this kind of basic relativism
that I've been suggesting
where all normativity
is relative to our values,
but then there's also
this question of it being up to us,
and that's not the same
thing as relativism.
If you imagine that you just
have a certain set of values,
well they're not up to
you, you just have 'em.
But then there is also the question,
of what kind of things can we do
both as individuals and
groups, to change our values,
and I do think we can change our values,
and so then there's an issue
of self-creation coming up,
and the question of it being
up to us what our values are
raises a whole other
dimension of complications.
- (Moderator) Mike next.
- Thank you so much, it was
a very interesting talk.
I had a question,
this maybe a little bit
outside of the scope
of what you were talking about,
but definitely within concern,
and it is why should we
care about the commitments,
or why should we care about stability,
and I'm asking this question
in light of this idea that I,
from my limited understanding
of Darwinian theories--
- Of what theories?
- Darwinian theories,
like Sharon Street--
- Oh, yeah--
- Which you sort of said
that you don't support,
and I'm wondering, to me it
seems sort of very plausible
that ideas of stability and commitment
are sort of feeding on
these Darwinian ideas, right?
- (Eric) So you're saying that,
the committing, or the
stabilizing function
of moral concepts has a
Darwinian explanation?
Is that what you're suggesting?
- I'm suggesting that
it's at least plausible,
and I'm curious why--
- Oh, I see--
- You think that's not the case.
- I do think that they might
have a Darwinian explanation
as long as Darwinism
is applied to culture.
I think you can apply
Darwinism to culture.
I don't think that all cultural
evolution is Darwinian,
but to the extent that we're
talking about selective forces,
if that's what we mean by Darwinism,
is some kind of selective process,
then I do think those kind
of selective processes apply
at the level of cultural variance,
but I don't think it's plausible
that biological natural selection
has done, I could be wrong,
this maybe I think is limited,
I don't think it's plausible that
at least the concepts that are
articulated, these linguistic concepts,
I think it's pretty implausible that those
are the product of biological selection
just because there hasn't been
a lot of time for that to happen.
But I could be wrong, I
think what's more plausible
is that what Nietzsche talked
about, that phrase thou shalt,
there's a basic sensibility,
which is unarticulated,
or at least pre-articulated,
that, I think is more plausibly
a product of biological selection because
it's at least prior to
language presumably.
- (Mike) Then just quickly to add to that,
it seems like sort of the main concern
with the Darwinian theories
is that should there be
some kind of biological
Darwinian explanation,
then that really undermines
our idea of morality, right?
And so, it sort of like
defeats the purpose
of the project of all kinds
of moral investigation
including what you are trying to do.
- Oh, including what I'm trying to do?
- (Mike) I mean I think
all kinds of morality,
'cause there's no such thing necessarily,
and I might be wrong, I
might not be understanding
that at all but it seems to me like
it is sort of this
ultimate like error theory,
saying that there is no such
thing as morality, period.
- Yeah, good.
I mean, it's not the only reason,
but a big part of what has got me
going the direction that I have been going
for some time now, just is
broadly Darwinian considerations.
So, the idea
that
whether through biological
selection or cultural selection,
some combination of those
things is going to explain
somewhere between almost all and all, of,
my broadly moral and
ethical sensibilities.
And so I think, it's a very big mistake
to build a conception,
to go around operating
on a conception of ethics that requires,
that that kind of
explanation not be correct,
because that kind of
explanation probably is correct.
So what I want to do is recognize
that the sheer fact that,
if it is a fact, the sheer fact
that my profound concern
for my brother's welfare,
or my niece's welfare,
if you told me that all that
is going to get explained
in terms of biological and
cultural selective forces,
I'm going to say, okay, no problem.
The concern, I still care the same.
- All right, thank you.
- Yep.
- Yeah, I've got two more on the list,
and then Susan said we're
short on time so if we
could go directly, and then
you, and then-- (murmuring)
- So I'm next?
- Yeah.
- Okay, thanks, I wanted to ask about,
I think you called it
expressivist master argument.
- (Eric) Yeah.
- So, broadly it was,
according to error theory,
beliefs about the nature
of normativity or non-normative--
- Yeah.
- Error theory's confused
about that, therefore
there's nothing illegitimate
in ordinary thought and practice.
Okay, yeah.
So I wondered if that was uncharitable
if what Blackburn or
someone else would mean,
in the final claim there is,
there's nothing illegitimate
of the sort that the error
theorist wanted to say
was illegitimate--
- Yeah, right--
- In ordinary practice and thought,
and then I was thinking,
maybe the deeper mistake
that this school is
making according to you,
is that they want to say that
the hard work of figuring out,
whether there is something illegitimate
about your caring deeply for your brother,
is going to always be properly understood
as something that at its base is conative,
whereas you want to say,
at least part of it, and
maybe the most important part
is going to be an
essentially cognitive project
where we're trying to gather true beliefs
about the functions that
these are actually playing,
in our practices, and perhaps
also historical accounts
of how you came to have those values,
and I guess my thought is that
that would be helpful for you,
because as you presented it
this is a mistaken argument,
but then the expressivist could say,
yeah, but I'm not going
to make that mistake,
and you have a deeper beef
with the expressivist,
and it seems plausible for you to say,
why assume that all of this
is going to be just expressing
my conative attitudes
as opposed to actually
at least in part a cognitive project
of trying to figure out what functions
these things are actually playing?
- Okay, tell me if I got this right.
It seemed like there's a couple
of things going on there,
I'll try to take 'em in turn.
One is, this may not be
charitable to the expressivist,
and I can totally see why
that might seem to be right.
The reason I would say
that they can't quite make
that move that you suggested which is,
that that is what they mean,
you're right, that they do mean
there's nothing
metaphysically illegitimate,
but that's the only kind of legitimacy,
that's the only kind of problem
that they're even acknowledging
as a potential problem.
So there's,
the only kind of legitimacy
that even could be at issue
on their own understanding,
just as normative legitimacy.
So, here's a way of seeing why
I don't think that it's uncharitable.
If they thought,
if they recognized, look, yeah,
there's no metaphysical illegitimacy,
but the now what question
is still totally live,
they would've said so, at some point.
They would've said, in
a footnote somewhere,
we realize that our view
raises the now what question
just as much as error theory,
and we're not going to argue
for it or whatever, there's
nothing like that, anywhere.
Just acknowledging that we recognize
that the now what question or abolitionism
is a possibility on our view.
There's not even so much
as that recognition.
So I think what's happened
is, they've confused,
metaphysical objections with
the only kind of objections.
Even though on their own
view, metaphysical objections
just have to be understood
as normative objections.
I sent a paper, it wasn't this same paper
but it was a similar paper,
I sent it to Blackburn and
Gibbard recently, and it wasn't,
yeah, they didn't say that. (chuckles)
That's maybe not very valuable,
but what's more valuable
is just that the claim that
if this was interpreted the
way that you were suggesting,
then at some point somewhere
they should've acknowledged
that there's this whole
other normative question,
which our view not only
allows to be raised,
but entails that the only way
to defend metaphysical belief
is in normative terms,
and therefore abolitionism
has certainly got to be on the table.
We recognize that at least at some point,
we ought to engage with
abolitionist arguments
but there's nothing like that, anywhere.
And secondly, I think you might
of been drawing a contrast
between this deeper conflict
that you were pointing to.
I'm not sure that there is that conflict.
So the way that you're saying
that they would evaluate
normative judgments in
broadly conative terms,
so normative judgments just are
conative judgments for them,
and then, if you're
somebody like Blackburn,
or if you are in fact
Blackburn, then you think,
how do you evaluate normative progress?
Well, you can only do it by reference
to other conative attitudes.
There's a kind of coherentism,
there's a kind of, look,
if I make a normative judgment,
and suppose its insensitive in some sense,
well I might value sensitivity
in my normative judgments,
and so if I made a
different normative judgment
that was more sensitive,
then by my own likes
that might be a superior
normative judgment.
I don't have any beef with that.
The kind of cognitivism that you
were attributing to me
is aimed at the level
of investigating the function of concepts,
but it wasn't aimed at the level
of evaluating first order
moral or normative judgments.
There I think, released at
least to a first approximation,
I think that Blackburn is basically right.
I just think that if that's how
you think about normative progress,
why not just do that more transparently?
Why talk in terms of
attitude-independent normative facts,
if your own view is that the way
that you evaluate normative progress
is by appeal to your own sentiments?
By to your own values,
I value sensitivity,
I value informativeness,
I value being informed.
If my normative judgment's uninformed,
then by my own likes that's a problem.
Why can't we just talk that way?
Why are we talking about moral facts
that are independent of
all of our attitudes?
That just seems to be really in conflict
with the insight of expressivism itself.
- (Moderator) We have
one last quick question.
- Yeah, thank you very much for your talk.
I think you've already
started to answer my question,
which was, so I take it you're advocating
that even on a quasi-realist view,
there's space for this
abolitionist critique
or like reevaluation of
normative and moral discourse.
And so I totally understand
what that would look like,
if you were an error
theorist about morality
but not about practical
reasons or prudence,
'cause then here's a standard by which
we can evaluate all moral discourse.
Is it good for us, is it healthy?
So yeah, really I was
just kind of confused
about what this evaluative
project would look like
for a quasi-realist,
like by which standard
would they evaluate, and what discourse?
- Evaluate moral discourse?
- Yeah.
- Oh, I was trying to give one standard
by which they might
evaluate moral discourse,
and by which they might
negatively evaluate it.
I think,
it
flies in the face
of
the very kind
of methodology,
for lack of a better term,
but the very kind of process
by which Blackburn himself
suggests that we evaluate
normative progress,
how do we evaluative normative progress?
By appeal,
to our own values.
So if I make a normative
judgment that's insensitive,
that could be inferior,
to a normative judgment
that's more sensitive.
But there's no suggestion that sensitivity
is some kind of value that you simply
just have to have, no
matter what your values are.
In fact, quasi-realism has
been accused of schizophrenia,
but I think in a confused way.
I think that people have
accused quasi-realism
as being literally inconsistent.
Why is that?
Because as an expressivist I say,
normative judgments are
expressions of practical attitudes.
As a quasi-realist I say,
normative facts are
independent of all attitudes.
That looks inconsistent to a lot of people
but it's not inconsistent.
But even though it's not
inconsistent it's really intention.
The one way of talking,
where I say normative truths
are totally independent
of any of my attitudes,
I think the more that you
really think that way,
the more you lose sight of the
expressivist insight itself,
the more that you lose sight of the fact
that these are expressions
of practical attitudes.
I'm a little concerned I'm not necessarily
getting at your question though, am I?
- (Student) No, I think
you are but I mean so,
I think the passage which
I was kind of confused by,
I wrote down, which was,
you said something like
that quasi-realists have worked so hard
to earn the right to talk like realists,
that they little consideration to whether
they ought to do so.
- Yeah.
- (Student) I was just
wondering, what this project
would look like for a quasi-realist.
- Okay--
- You talked about
what it would look like
for an error theorist.
- Yes.
- I'm just wondering
if you could expand--
- Yeah, yeah, so yeah,
I hope I was addressing it then.
I think, what I call the
expressivist insight,
let's assume it's true,
so it's an insight,
that when we make moral judgments
we're expressing conative
attitudes, practical attitudes.
That insight, I think,
gets
obscured,
the more that we talk
as if, moral facts are totally
independent of our attitudes.
I think,
it's worth recognizing,
I think it's worth building into,
and I think an expressivist
should be able to see this,
I think they probably could,
I have, wishful thinking.
I think if I could just, come
on expressivist, just look!
Why not,
talk
in terms of the very things
that by your own account is
generating the judgments,
and the very things by reference to which
we can judge certain normative judgments
to be superior or inferior to other ones?
Namely, the kinds of things
that you yourselves value
in normative judgments,
whether it's informativeness,
or sensitivity or whatever it might be.
We could just talk far more
transparently, in terms,
I don't think transparency's
the only virtue
but I think it's an important one.
I think that it would
help us be far more aware
of the kinds of things
that we're trying to do
which often are, in bad faith.
Everybody in this room excluded of course,
but some people, sometimes,
make real highfalutin
self-righteous arguments,
moral arguments about what has to be done,
and this just must be the case,
and there's no recognition that ultimately
this is comin' from our own values.
And I think that could help
with cultural disagreements,
that why don't we at least
just start with the recognition
that the way that we,
like I quoted Prinz there,
that we have contingent
moralized sentiments,
and that's a starting point.
How do we figure out what
we ultimately care about,
and what we should care about?
I think the question of
what you should care about
is a completely legitimate
and necessary question,
but ultimately, that
question can only be answered
by reference to some
things that you care about.
And I think that should be what
an expressivist should say.
But I think there's a
kind of schizophrenia.
An expressivist has got to want
to say something like that.
But on the other hand, as
soon as you start talking
about moral truths being
attitude-independent, well what?
I thought this was your view.
So I think they really
shouldn't, the travesty,
is that there's just this
unexamined assumption that if you,
so here's the extent to
which I was technically maybe
almost slightly wrong
in what I said to you,
when they haven't defended quasi-realism
or realist discourse on normative grounds.
That's technically not correct.
Blackburn has a footnote that says,
"Thinking that the
wrongness of kicking dogs
"Depends on your own
attitudes, is not nice."
Full stop, as far as
defending realist discourse.
There's a footnote in someplace,
that says, relativism is not nice.
I think,
you need to do a lot more than that.
- (Student) So a quasi-realist could like,
recommend getting rid of like,
talk of moral obligation,
because,
it's defective or something.
Like, they could adopt your theory
and say this is hardship.
- Well, that's not the slide.
I think there's good reason
to think it promotes exactly
the kind of so-called
defective sensibility
that Blackburn talks about in other areas,
and I think it inhibits awareness
to the expressivist insight itself,
and of the basic kind of methodology
by which expressivists themselves think
we can judge the
superiority or inferiority
of certain normative judgments,
namely by reference to
values that we have,
with respect to our normative judgments.
- Thanks.
- Yep.
- (Moderator) My deepest values say
that we should go no more
than 15 minutes overtime,
but they also say more importantly
that we should thank our speaker
for an excellent
discussion and a good talk.
- Thank you.
(audience applauding)
