(00:03) good afternoon and welcome I'm Kim vanir the chairman of the MIT faculty We Gather here today to honor two people James AR Killian Jr and Professor Nome Chomsky the Killian award is the highest award that the MIT faculty bestows upon one of its own it's named after the late Killian 10th president of MIT he came to MIT as a student in the mid1 1920s he joined the staff of Technology review 1926 and he retired as chairman of the MIT Corporation 45 years later in 1971 he brought great honor and distinction to MIT through his many
(00:59) years of national service I'll mention two examples which are just the tip of the iceberg in the late 1950s he was the first full-time science adviser to a president of the United States and provided important leadership in the period that set the nation's course to putting a man on the moon he also served as chairman of the Carnegie Commission on educational television which recommended the formation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting he was also a very genuine and likable person as I discovered quite by accident
(01:45) one day about 20 years ago when I was a new graduate student at MIT I sat down at a table in the Lobdell dining room with an elderly gentleman that I didn't know and we struck up a conversation one that was to begin a long series of enlightening conversations I had with him until the time of his death in 1988 I think his easy way with students and with other members of the MIT Community or one of the things that defined Jim Killian to us this award is named in his honor we bestow it upon a faculty member each year who has also brought honor and
(02:30) distinction to MIT Professor Chomsky has been doing so for 37 years as a member of our faculty Professor Chomsky would you come to the stage please in preparing for today I did one small piece of research on Professor Chomsky which I'd like to share with you with the help of the MIT Library staff I was able to determine how often he is cited in the Arts and Humanities citation index as of the last time the statistics were compiled we discovered that he is in the top 10 it happens that none of the others are still
(03:22) living he he is the most cited living author I thought you might like to know the names of of the company he keeps they are in order Marx  lenon Shakespeare Aristotle the Bible Plato Freud Chomsky followed by Hegel and Cicero    I would like to read from the award it says the president and faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have the honor to present the James R kilan Jr faculty Achievement Award to n Chomsky and to announce his
(04:26) appointment as Killian award lecturer for the Academic Year 9 192 in recognition of his extraordinary contributions to Linguistics philosophy and cognitive psychology one of the foremost thinkers of this Century he revolutionized the study of language and of the human mind his books monographs and articles constitute major milestones in the history of linguistics an inspiring teacher he has trained Scholars who are among the most important contributors to to the discipline his presence here has greatly enriched
(05:05) MIT Professor Chomsky the microphone is    yours he was lucky he didn't read what those citations say but the the uh title of this talk the announced title has three parts uh refers to language uh the cognitive revolutions uh and then there's the quotes around cognitive revolutions uh the uh uh the relation between language and cognitive science is natural that's a reasonable combination uh modern Linguistics developed as part of what's sometimes called the cognitive revolution of the 1950s actually to a
(06:08) large extent here in building 20 thanks initially to Jerry weisner's initiatives uh it was also a major factor in the development of the cognitive Sciences uh ever since their modern Origins so those two words are sort of obvious the quotes are intended to express a lingering skepticism uh and when I say cognitive Revolution from here on in uh you're supposed to hear a so-called cognitive Revolution I'll explain why as I proceed uh the skepticism that I feel does not have anything to do with the actual work
(06:51) that's done in the various areas of cognitive science so Vision language cognitive development a few others uh in these uh areas there have been quite uh significant advances over the past 40 years the questions in my mind Arise at a second order level that is thinking about the nature of the disciplines that are uh concerned with what were traditionally called uh metal Acts or mental faculties and I want to come back to a few of those questions some of them are substantive some of them are historical uh first a few words
(07:32) about uh the Contemporary cognitive sciences and the cognitive Revolution uh as they look to me and let me stress that others don't see it this way at all this is not intended to be a survey but rather a rather personal point of view uh uh George Miller who was one of the leading figures and founders of the modern field uh in a recent article um uh uh he uh he traced the modern cognitive Sciences back to a meeting in 1956 uh held in Cambridge I can't remember whether it was here or at Harvard but one or the other uh it was a
(08:17) uh meeting which of the Institute of radio Engineers which had a uh a series of papers on experimental human psychology which made use of information Theory and Signal detection and other then pretty new ideas it had a paper of mine on language which outlined some of the basic ideas of generative grammar it had another paper on uh problem solving and uh reasoning it was a paper by herb Simon and Al Newell simulation of a pro of theorum proving in elementary logic and he argues that that Confluence of of research papers essentially initiated
(09:02) the the modern field well there were some shared ideas among the participants uh one shared idea was a kind of shift in perception uh or perspective toward the disciplines uh a shift which is not terribly surprising now but was pretty striking at that moment uh the uh shift was away from the study of behavior and the products of Behavior such as words or sounds or their arrangement in texts uh a shift from that Focus toward the study of the states and properties of the mind and the brain that enter into uh human thought and action uh from the
(09:46) first point of view which overwhelmingly prevailed at the time uh behavior and its products were regarded as the object of study from the second point of view what later came to be called the cognitive Sciences uh behavior and its products were of no particular interest in themselves they simply provided uh data uh data which would be interesting in so far as it served as evidence for what really concerns us now the inner workings of the Mind where the phrase mind here simply is a way of talking uh about relevant properties and states and
(10:25) processes of the brain uh the data of Behavior and the texts and so on from this point of view are to be used alongside of other data whatever might turn out to be useful say electrical activity of the brain uh but it has no inherently privileged status and it's not the focus of Interest that's a shift it's a shift away from what was called Behavioral Science or structuralism or uh Str statistical analysis of texts uh and a shift towards something that might properly be called cognitive science in my my personal view
(11:00) it was a shift from a kind of Natural History uh to at least potential Natural Science now that shift was highly controversial at the time and it still is uh and in fact if you were to use such measures as amount of government funding uh it would still be very much in the minority uh but I think it was the right move well that was one kind of shared interest from independent points of view there was no communication among the people prior to the meeting uh a second shared interest was U an interest in what we might call computational
(11:37) representational systems uh that means a way of looking at mental activities and mental faculties at what the brain is doing to look looking at them as a kind of a software problem that is a study of the mechanisms but viewed from a particular abstract perspective uh analogies can always be misleading but one might compare this approach to say chemistry about a century ago uh where there were Notions like Valance or periodic table or organic molecule and so on but they were not grounded in the basic physics of the
(12:13) time they did the results however and the ideas did provide guidelines uh for what turned out to be quite radical changes in physics that were necessary to accommodate these ideas chemistry was never actually reduced to physics it would be more accurate to say that physics was expanded in a certain sense to chemistry uh similarly uh computational representational theories of the brain attempt to establish States and uh properties that have to be accommodated somehow in the brain sciences and might well provide as far
(12:50) as they're correct they might well provide guidelines for inquiry into mechanisms uh it's possible again that they may provide uh guidelines for what'll have to be radical changes uh in the uh in the way that uh U the brain and its processes and states are conceived uh how two approaches to the natural world will be unified if ever uh can never be get guessed in advance really could be reduction as in the chemistry as in say the biology chemistry case more or less it could be what you might call expansion as in the
(13:26) physics chemistry case or it could be something else uh crucially there's nothing mysterious about any of this uh it seems to me at least to be just normal science uh normal science at a typical stage before unification of several approaches to some area of inquir some Topic in the natural world before they're unified well again that was and remains highly controversial uh assuming it anyway how can we proceed uh you can look at the brain and or the person from number of different points of view let's begin by
(14:01) taking what you might call a receptive point of view so we think of the brain say as being in a certain State uh a signal reaches the brain uh it produces some kind of symbolic representation of the signal internally presumably and it moves to some other State uh if we focus on the interstate transitions we're looking at problems of learning or maybe more accurately growth uh if we focus on input signal and the symbolic representation of it we're looking at perception uh if we focus on the initial state of the system prior to any
(14:41) relevant signals uh we're looking at the biological endowment the innate structure we could trace the processes back further uh at that point we'd be moving into embryology and one should stress that these distinctions are pretty artificial actually uh typically the system sys that we're looking at are like physical organs or we might say more accurately like other physical organs because we are studying a physical organ from a particular point of view uh the uh they're like physical organs other physical organs in that say
(15:16) like the digestive system or the circulatory system or the visual system or whatever uh which again we often look at abstractly as one would expect in the study of a system of any degree of complexity we can call these particular systems metal organs not implying again anything more than that they are involved in what were traditionally called mental States mental faculties or mental processes well like other physical organs uh these mental organs quite typically reach a kind of a stable State at a certain point that is the input signal that's uh
(15:54) causing an interstate transition sort of moves the system around Within some kind of equivalence class of states that are alike for purposes at hand uh that's obviously an idealization but uh a reasonable one uh when you look at the stable state after the point at which there isn't significant change uh then you're very clearly studying perception when you look at the signal result relationship uh so for example if you take the visual system uh if you look at the initial State the state prior to
(16:27) relevant signals you're looking at the basic structure of the visual system if you look at the interstate transition uh you're looking at the growth of the visual system the changes in the distribution of uh vertical and horizontal receptors in the striate cortex or uh the onset of binocular vision after a couple of months of age and humans and so on uh if you look at the stable State uh you're studying adult perception uh adult perception of course has some kind of access to systems of belief belief about the world
(17:00) uh not much is known about this but it seems reasonable to assume that that involves some kind of computational procedure that specifies an infinite range of beliefs which are called upon when needed uh although here we move into a domain of almost total ignorance uh turning to the language system you can look at it the same way the initial state of the system uh the initial state of the language faculty uh the study of it is sometimes called Universal grammar these days uh the study the initial state of the language faculty uh is the
(17:37) study of that is a study of biological endowment uh it's an empirical fact which seems pretty well established that this element of the brain is pretty uniform across the species the variations appear to be quite slight apart from extreme pathology and it also appears to be unique in Essentials uh there's no no other known organism that has anything like it uh also it's rather different from other biological systems in many respects systems of discrete Infinity which this plainly is are pretty rare in the biological world so
(18:11) it appears uh the uh uh if you're looking at the interstate transition as signals some relevant information comes in uh you're studying language acquisition uh it apparently reaches a stable State at about puberty uh the this stable steady state incorporates a computational procedure which characterizes an infinite set of Expressions uh each of them uh having a certain array of properties properties of sound properties of meaning properties of structural organization uh that computational procedure constitutes
(18:48) a person's language to have such a procedure in the appropriate part of the brain is to have a language or as we sometimes say to know a language when I speak of a language I simply mean the computational or generative procedure that specifies the properties of a infinite range of linguistic Expressions such as say the one I just produced since your language is similar enough to mine uh when the signal that I just produced reaches your brain your generative procedure constructs an expression a set an expression with
(19:23) these properties which is similar enough to the one that I form so we understand one another more or less uh unlike the system of belief that's accessed in visual perception in this case we happen to know quite a lot about the generative procedures that are involved in the use of language and even about their innate invariant basis and these in fact are the areas of major progress in the past generation well what about perception of language uh um there is there are a bunch there are several common assumptions about this
(19:59) uh one major assumption is that there is something called a parser a parser is something that Maps a signal into a symbolic representation uh paying no attention to any other uh aspects of the relevant environment of the environment uh of course it is assumed if people are rational that this parser accesses the generative procedure that is it's assumed that you use your knowledge of English uh when you interpret signals uh note SE however several assumptions first one assumption is that such a thing exists that a parser exists
(20:37) there is some faculty of the mind that interprets signals independently of any other features of the environment that's not at all obvious uh the existence of an internal generative procedure is far more secure and far more obvious than the exist the question of the existence of a parser and and it's also far better grounded uh assumption far better grounded empirically and with much richer theoretical structure this is contrary to Common belief which usually considers the two the other way around uh
(21:11) nevertheless let's assume that a parser exists though it isn't obvious uh it's further assumed that the parser doesn't grow the way a language grows from some initial state to a stable State now that assumption again is not very well founded it it's based mainly on ignorance it's the simplest assumption and we have no reason to believe anything about it so we might as well believe that uh there is some kind of evidence for it indirect perhaps but interesting there's a forthcoming book
(21:42) coming out from MIT press by Robert Berwick and S Fang former student of his uh on what you might call a universal parer a fixed invariant parser uh which has the property that if you sort of flip it switches one way it interprets English and if you flip it switches another way it interprets Japanese uh and if that's the right idea then there is a universal parser which is unaffected by environmental factors uh apart from the properties that serve to identify uh one or another language that is the array of uh flipping of switches
(22:23) I'll come back to that uh there's a further comment so that assumption the assumption that par doesn't grow while strange could be true and there's only this kind of indirect evidence for it uh a further common assumption is that parsing is easy something that the brain that you do very quickly and easily in fact that's often held to be a Criterion for the theory of language it's often held to provide it's it's the Criterion is supposed to be that the theory of language must provide generative
(22:53) procedures that satisfy this requirement that parsing is e easy and quick well that one's flatly false uh uncontroversially uh parsing often fails completely and quite systematically and it's often extremely difficult uh many categories of what are called parsing failures are known even with short simple Expressions a parsing failure just means a case where the parser works fine but it gives some kind of an interpretation which is not the one that's assigned to the U signal by the by the language so it's wrong in that
(23:28) sense uh the uh uh it's perfectly true that when and very often you know you can easily find categories of exper of Expressions even pretty simple ones uh where the parsing system just breaks down people don't know what they're hearing sounds like gibberish even though it's perfectly well formed and has a fixed strict meaning so on and so forth uh now it's perfectly true that one uses Expressions that are readily parsed but that verges on tautology what it means is we use what is usable other
(24:00) resources of the language we just don't use uh there's a related assumption it's often alleged that language is well adapted to the function of communication it's not clear that that statement is even meaningful uh or any similar statements about biological organs but to the extent that one can give some meaning to that statement uh this one again looks just false uh the design of language appears to make it largely unusable uh which is fine we just use those fragments that are usable for us doesn't mean that the design made
(24:35) it usable somehow uh there are similar assumptions in learnability theory uh uh formal learnability Theory it's often claimed as a starting point that natural languages must be learnable in fact natural languages often defined natural languages are defined often as the set of languages that are learnable under standard conditions now notice that that could be true we don't know that that's false as we know that the comparable statement about parsing is false it could be true that languages are learnable uh but it's not a conceptual
(25:08) necessity uh language design might be such that's our language faculty could be such that it permits all kinds of inaccessible languages uh these would be realiz realizable in the brain just as say English is but not accessible to humans again that wouldn't stop us from doing what we do we would just pick up the accessible ones uh in fact there is some recent work quite recent work which suggests that natural languages are learnable but if true that's an empirical Discovery and in fact a rather surprising one well I've said nothing so
(25:44) far about production of language uh there's a reason for that uh the reason is that apart from very peripheral aspects it's almost a complete mystery uh we can learn a good deal about the mechanism is Ms that are put to use when we speak and we can study at least certain aspects of perception the mapping of of signals to percept uh using the uh internalized mechanisms the generative procedure of the language but no one has anything sensible to say about what I'm doing now or what two people are doing uh in a normal
(26:21) conversation uh it was observed centuries ago that the normal use of language has quite curious property uh it is unbounded it's not random it is not determined by external stimuli and there's no reason to believe that it's determined by internal States uh it's uncaused but it's somehow appropriate to situations it's coherent uh it evokes in in in the hearer thoughts that he or she might have expressed the same way that collection of properties we can call them the creative aspect of language use
(26:57) uh that set of properties U was U regarded by the cartisian as the best evidence that another organism has a mind like ours not just a body like a dog or a monkey or a robot uh actually if you look back at their argument it was quite reasonable uh the science happened to be wrong but it was very reasonable and within the framework of scientific reasoning we might put matters in different terms uh but we haven't made any progress in understanding these critically important phenomena the phenomena that concerned
(27:33) them and that Li lie much they provide much of the basis for the traditional Mind Body distinction uh in my opinion in fact contemporary thought about these topics usually phrased in terms of Notions like the touring test uh involves a considerable regression from the much more scientific approach of cartisian psychology I'm not going to have time to elaborate uh properly I merely mention this to provoke some possible interest or maybe outrage we'll see uh well I've mentioned uh several kinds of shared
(28:10) interest in the early modern cognitive Sciences a back to the 1956 meeting that George Miller pointed to uh one common interest again is in computational representational systems looking at the brain in terms of software problems uh for uh Linguistics at least this be turned into the study of the generative procedures that are put to use in perception and presumably an expression of thought speaking although the latter again remains a complete mystery uh there's another shared interest it's what we might call the unification
(28:46) problem that's a problem that has two different aspects uh one aspect is the relation between the hardware and the software uh the relationship between computational representation theories of the brain and what and the entities that they postulate uh and what you might call implementation and as I suggested I think you can regard that as similar to the problem of the relation between say chemistry and physics 100 years ago or genetics and chemistry 50 years ago and so on uh that's one problem the unification General the one aspect of
(29:21) the unification problem the deepest aspect uh a less deep aspect uh has to do with the relation among the various domains of cognitive science say language and vision uh whatever may be involved in problem solving this is the question what do they have in common notice that that's much less profound a problem if it turns out the answer is nothing just the way it is uh uh on the other hand we'd be kind of upset if the answer to the first one was no answer uh well at this point some of my skepticism begins to surface so let's
(29:57) take the the first one the Deep problem the serious scientific problem uh the relation between roughly the hardware and the software chemistry and physics uh here uh there are two different approaches you can identify one approach let's call it naturalistic uh says goes kind of like this it says the mental organs are viewed as computational representational systems and we want to show that they're real that their statements in in these theories are true that is there are certain states of the and properties of
(30:30) the brain which these uh theories exactly capture uh in which try to show uh the uh metal organs can also be viewed in other ways for example you can look at them in terms of cells or atoms uh or more interestingly for the moment you can look at them in terms of electrical activity of the brain so called event related potentials erps uh now rather Sur surprisingly there's some recent work which shows quite dramatic and surprising correlations between certain properties of the computational representational
(31:07) systems of language and of erps um uh evoke potentials uh for the moment these Erp measures have no status apart from their correlation with categories of Expressions that come out of computational representational theories that is there just no numbers sort of picked at random uh they don't have any because there's no there's no relevant theory about them that says you should look at these numbers and not at some other numbers in themselves in other words they're Curiosities still it's interesting because they do there are
(31:41) correlations to rather subtle properties that have emerged in the attempt to develop computational representational theories which explain the form and meaning of language uh so that suggests an interesting direction for research namely to try to un ify these quite different approaches to the brain and to place each of them in an appropriate theoretical context for the moment that's primarily a problem for the erps uh but if you can pursue it could be quite an interesting Direction and one can think of lots of
(32:13) consequences uh well the same is true of the relation between CR systems computational representational systems and Physiology uh at least in principle here it's just in principle because in practice at present we don't really have much uh to look at there except from the theories of the computational representational systems uh but here whatever the difficulties may be we seem to face ordinary problems of science uh before than typical situation when alternative approaches don't there's no understood way to unify them or connect
(32:48) them uh well there's a different approach to this unification problem which actually dominates contemporary thinking about cognitive science not necessarily the actual work but the thinking about what it amounts to uh this approach is to divorce the study of mental organs from the biological setting allog together and to ask whether some simulation can essentially fool an outside Observer uh so we ask whether the simulation passes some rather arbitrary test called the touring test but touring test is just a name for
(33:21) a huge battery of possible tests uh and so we can we pick out one of those kind of random uh and we now ask whether some say extraterrestrial invented organism or some actual programed computer uh passes the test that is fool somebody uh and uh people write articles in which they ask how can we determine empirically uh whether an extraterrestrial or a a programmed computer or machine can say play chess or understand Chinese uh and the answer is supposed to be if it can fool and observe under some arbitrary conditions called
(34:00) the touring test then we say we've empirically established that actually you may have noticed last November uh there was a big splash about a uh a a running of the touring test over at the Boston computer Museum uh with together with the Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies and a quite distinguished panel that had a bunch of programs which are supposed to try to fool people uh there was I think a $100,000 prize offered uh uh big story in the Boston Globe front page story in the New York Times science
(34:32) had a big splash on it I wasn't there but I'm told that the program that did best in fooling people into thinking that it was a human was one that produced cliches at random uh apparently it did pretty well I don't may tell you something about humans but I'm not sure what uh uh as far as I can see all of this is entirely pointless uh it's like asking how we could determine empirically whether an airplane can fly the answer being if it can fool someone into thinking that it's an eagle say
(35:07) under some conditions but the question whether an airplane can fly and whether it's really flying or for that matter the question whether High jumpers were really flying at the last Olympics that's not an empirical question that's a matter of decision and different languages make decisions different so if you're speaking Japanese uh I'm told airplanes uh Eagles and high jumpers all are really flying uh if you're talking English uh airplanes and Eagles are really flying but humans aren't except
(35:44) metaphorically uh if you're talking Hebrew uh Eagles are flying and neither uh airplanes nor humans are but it's that's just a matter of there's no substantive issue involved there's nothing to to determine no question to answer uh simulation of an eagle could have some purposes of course say learning about eagles or maybe solving some problem in aerodynamics but fooling an observer under some variety of the touring test is not a sensible purpose as far as I can see as far as I'm aware
(36:18) there's nothing like this in the Sciences incidentally if you go back to the 17th and 18th centuries uh scientists were very much in who we call philosophers were but they didn't distinguish were they were greatly intrigued uh by automa by machines for example autom that simulated say the digestion of a duck but their goal was to learn about ducks uh not to answer meaningless questions about whether machines can really digest as proven by the fact that they can fool an observer who's just say looking behind a screen
(36:52) or something uh however they may be doing it well this is one of the aspects in which in my opinion at least there's been regression since the 17th and 18th century uh chess playing programs are a perfect example of this in my opinion well anyway that's two approaches to the first question of unification the sort of deep one uh what about the more shallow question of unification that is the question of unification among the various branches of the cognitive Sciences uh is there any real commonality among them well that doesn't
(37:26) seem entirely obvious so take uh what you know you might think of what you might call physical organs below the neck metaphorically speaking meaning not the ones we call metal uh say take the circulatory system and the digestive system visual system and so on these are organs of the body in some reasonable sense viewed abstractly uh and that's a normal way to study any complex system uh the study of these abstract organs does fall together at some level we assume presumably at the level of cellular biology but it's
(38:03) not at all clear that there's any other level that is that there's some kind of organ Theory at which these systems are unified maybe but it's not obvious well the brain of is scarcely understood but to the extent that anything's understood about it it appears to be an extremely intricate system heterogenous with all kind of subp parts that have special design and so on uh and there's no special reason to suppose that the mental organs are unified in some kind of mental organ Theory above the level
(38:33) of cellular biology that is above the level at which they may fall together with the circulatory system and so on uh if there is no intermediate level no such unification then there is no cognitive science hence there was no cognitive Revolution uh except for similarities of perspective which could be quite interesting in fact uh well there are various speculations about this question in fact they go right back to that 1956 meeting uh one General line of speculation is that the mind is what's called modular uh that is that
(39:06) metal organs have special design like everything else we know in the physical world uh the other uh the other approach assumes uniformity that there are what are called General mechanisms of learning or thinking which are just applied to different domains they're applied to language or to chess and so on uh and as say these differences they didn't exactly surface but they were more or less implicit at the 1956 meeting the paper on generative grammar took for granted modularity that is a rich specific
(39:41) uh uh genetic endowment the language faculty special system uh and no General mental organ Theory uh the new assignment approach uh study the logic machine that took for granted the opposite position that is that there are General mechanisms of problem solving which are quite indifferent as to subject matter uh in their case theorem proving but equivalently chess or language or whatever and you can trace these different intuitions back quite a way quite back hundreds of years in fact uh they're very Lively today in the
(40:16) discussions about connectionist work for example uh my own view is that the evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of the highly modular approaches uh there are only a few areas where we have any real insight and these invariably seem to involve quite special design possibly there are some unifying principles but about these if they exist nothing much is understood again that's a minority view but um can only tell you the way it looks to me uh even internal to the language faculty there seems to be quite highly modular design so let's
(40:51) distinguish roughly between what we might call grammatical ability meaning the ability to produce properly formed expressions and conceptual ability that is to produce Expressions that somehow make some sense uh and pragmatic ability that is the ability to use expressions in some way appropriate to the occasion well these capacities have been discovered to be dis dissociated developmentally like one can develop and the other's not and selectively impaired under injury uh and their properties are quite different uh and they seem to be
(41:27) radically different from what we find in other cognitive systems so even internally just at the most gross look we seem to find modularity and when you look more closely into subsystems of language they just seem to behave rather differently I don't see why they should surprise anyone it's exactly what we find about every other biological organism so why shouldn't it be true of the brain which is maybe the most complex one around but it's considered a very controversial position again I stress as far as I know all the evidence
(41:56) evidence supports it and it shouldn't be surprising uh well on the other how just how modular is the language faculty that's an interesting question it doesn't seem so special that it's linked to particular processing systems uh here study of sign language in the last in the last decade or so maybe 20 years has been quite interesting uh rather surprisingly it seems that sign language um the normal language of the deaf uh sign language is localized in speech area of the brain in the left hemisphere
(42:28) not in the visual processing areas which you might expect since you see it you don't hear it uh that's shown pretty well by Aphasia studies and again Erp studies uh also turns out that children who were acquiring sign language in a natural setting go through steps at least in the early stages which have been studied that are remarkably similar to the acquisition of spoken language and timing and everything else uh they even override obvious icon IC properties of visual symbols so pointing is overridden and given a symbolic
(43:02) interpretation uh furthermore acquisition of sign language turns out to be quite different from acquisition of communicative gestures uh there's even one case on record of spontaneous invention of Sign Language by three deaf children who had no environmental model and no stimulus at all as far as anyone can be determined that's the perfect experiment uh the system that these three kids constructed has very standard properties of natural language natural spoken language and the developmental stages also appear to be similar uh that looks
(43:36) like about a pure expression of the language faculty unaffected by experience uh and it suggests that however modular the system may be it's not so modular that it's keyed to a particular mode of uh articulation or input what's now known suggests that the language faculties simply grows a language much as other organs of the body grow and it does so in a way largely determined by its inner nature by properties the initial State uh external events doubtless have some kind of an effect like I'm talking English
(44:10) not Japanese uh but a rational Martian scientist who is looking at us would probably not find these variations very impressive uh and the language that grows in the mind uh appears to be at least partially independent of sensory modality well at this point we're moving toward serious inquiry into modular architect architecture of mind and brain in some of the few areas where it's possible to undertake it and with some surprising results well one last element of skepticism about the cognitive Revolution uh has to do with just how
(44:46) much of a revolution it was uh in fact to a far greater extent than was realized at that time or is even generally recognized today the shift in perspective in the 1950s recapitulated and rediscovered some long forgotten ideas and insights from what you might call the first cognitive Revolution uh which pretty much coincided with the Scientific Revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries now the Galilean Newtonian revolution in physics is well known the cartisian revolution uh and its aftermath and Psychology and Physiology
(45:22) is not very well known but it was quite dramatic uh and uh it had U important effects uh important consequences it developed some also developed some of the major themes that were taken up again since the 1950s primarily in the areas of language and vision which are perhaps the most successful branches of contemporary cognitive science as well uh now this first cognitive Revolution uh though it had a great deal of interest and there's much you can learn from it uh in uh it did face barriers and in fact they were insuperable
(45:59) barriers so for example in the study of language it came to be realized soon enough that human language is somehow a process not just a dead product it's not a bunch of texts it's some process that goes on furthermore it's a process that makes infinite use of finite means as Bill Hol put it in the early 19th century but no sense could be made of these ideas and the inquiry aborted uh aborted for well over a century uh by this Century the formal Sciences had provided enough understanding of all of
(46:33) this uh so that many traditional themes could be productively engaged uh particularly against the background of other advances in science and engineering and anthropological Linguistics and one could understand quite well what it meant to make infinite use of finite means well let's turn to a quick look at some of the kinds of questions that arise and some of the kinds of answers that can be offered with respect to language specifically uh so take something that everybody knows something start with something really trivial very simple so
(47:07) take a simple phrase like say brown house uh you and I have generative procedures which are more or less similar and these generative procedures determine what we know about this expression for example we know that it consists of two words uh we know that those two words have the same vowel for most speakers uh we know also that if if something or other if I point to something I say that's a brown house uh what I mean is it's exterior is brown uh if you if somebody paints a house Brown uh we know that they painted the exterior Brown if
(47:42) they painted the inside Brown they didn't paint the house Brown uh if you see a house uh you see it's exterior so we can't see this building as a matter of conceptual necessity if we were standing outside we might uh and the same is true of a whole mass of what are sometimes called container words like box or Igloo or airplane uh you can see an airplane for example if you're inside it uh but only if you can look out the window and see the wing or if there's a mirror outside which reflects the
(48:13) exterior of the airplane or something like that then you could see the airplane otherwise not uh the same is true with invented Concepts even impossible Concepts so say take a spherical Cube if somebody paints a spherical Cube Brown that means they painted the exterior Brown not the interior uh so all of these house ET set and all these things are exterior surfaces which is kind of curious to start with however they're not just exteriors so suppose two people say John and Mary are equidistant from the exterior regarded as a mathematical
(48:48) object suppose they're equidistant from the exterior but John is outside it and Mary's inside it uh we can ask whether John the guy outside is near the house or whatever it is and there's an answer depending on current criteria for nearness but we can't ask it about Mary we're not near this building no matter what the criteria are uh so uh it's not just an exterior uh it's an exterior plus something about a distinguished interior however the nature of that interior doesn't seem to matter very
(49:21) much so it's the same house if you say take it and fill it with cheese or something like that you change the exterior it's the same house hasn't changed at all uh on the other hand uh and similarly you move the walls around and it stays the same house on the other hand you can clean a house and not touch the exterior at all you can only do things to the interior uh so somehow it's a very special combination of a abstract though somehow concrete interior with an abstract exterior and of course the house itself is perfectly
(49:53) concrete uh uh same is true of my home that's also perfectly concrete but in a quite different way uh if a house is a brown wooden house it has a brown exterior surface but it doesn't just have a wooden exterior uh it's both a concrete object of some kind and an abstract surface as well as having a distinguished interior with weird properties well proceeding further we discover that container words like say house have extremely weird properties uh certainly there can't be any object in the world that has this combination of
(50:28) properties nor do we believe that there is uh rather a word like house provides a certain quite complex perspective for looking at what we take to be things in the world uh furthermore these properties are completely unlearned uh hence they must be Universal and as far as we know they are they're just part of our nature we couldn't we didn't learn them we couldn't have learned them they're also largely unknown and unsuspected take the most extent ensive dictionary you like say the big Oxford
(50:59) English Dictionary that you read with a magnifying glass and you find that it doesn't dream of such sematic properties uh rather what the dictionary does is offer some hints uh that allow a person who already knows almost everything uh to pick out the intended concept and the same is true of world of words generally and in fact the same is true of the sound system of language they they are largely known in advance in all their quite remarkable intricacy uh hence they're Universal a species property uh
(51:29) the external environment May fix some details the way the Oxford English Dictionary can fix a few details uh but uh language acquisition and in fact probably a good deal of what's misleadingly called learning is really a kind of biological growth where you kind of fill in details in an extremely rich predetermined structure that just goes back to your nature very much like physical growth or as I think we should say other aspects a physical growth uh well if you look at the structure of more complex Expressions uh then these
(52:02) conclusions are just reinforced again let me take pretty simple cases to illustrate so take the sentence say John a an apple and drop out the word apple and you get John 8 and what that means everybody knows is John 8 something or other so if you eliminate a phrase from the sentence you interpret it as something or other John 8 means John 8 something or other more or less uh take the sentence a little bit longer but not much uh John is too stubborn to talk to Bill well that means John is so stubborn that he won't talk to Bill and just as
(52:37) in the case of John Aiden Apple dropped the last phrase bill and we get John is too stubborn to talk to and by analogy or by induction if such a thing existed people ought to interpret it as meaning John is so stubborn that he won't talk to someone or other however it doesn't mean that John is too stubborn to talk to means John is so stubborn that nobody's going to talk to him John somehow it all inverts if I drop the last word uh suppose you make it a little more complex John is too stubborn to expect anyone to talk to Bill well
(53:11) that means John have to think maybe a little bit here already John because parsing is not easy and quick uh John is too stubborn it means John is too stubborn for him John to expect that anyone will talk to Bill now drop bill again now we get John is too stubborn to expect anyone to talk to and reflect for a moment and you'll see that the meaning shifts radically uh it means John is so stubborn that somebody or other doesn't expect anyone to talk to him John everything shifts uh now all of this is inside you nobody could ever learn it
(53:49) nobody could possibly learn it none of it is mentioned even in or hinted at in fact even in the most comprehensive grammar books it's known without experience it's Universal as far as we know in fact it it better be Universal or it means there genetic differences crucially among people uh it just grows out from our nature a huge variety of material of that sort has come to light in the last 30 years or so uh as a direct consequence of something new namely the attempt to actually discover and to formulate the generative
(54:21) procedures that grow in the language faculty of the brain virtually without experience that had never been done before it was always assumed that it's kind of all obvious you know how can how could there be anything complicated here if you go back say to the early 50s the problem about language acquisition was supposed to be why does it take so long why does it take so long for such a trivial thing to happen why do children need so much exposure to material to do this simple uh process of habit formation as soon as
(54:50) you try to describe the facts you discover that it's quite the opposite uh there's extremely in at things that are known even in the simplest cases uh there's no possible way of picking them up from experience uh and uh consequently they're Universal they're part of our nature uh these are just part of the general generative procedures that the brain determines well what do these generative procedures look like apparently they look something like this uh a language can be looked at as involving a computational procedure
(55:24) and what you can call a lexicon a lexicon is a selection of Concepts that are associated with particular sounds uh the concepts appear to be pretty much invariant they're things like house let's say and they have very weird properties uh which means that they must be invariant because if they have very weird properties they've got to be unlearned which means that they're going to be invariant just part of our nature uh the sound variety also seems quite limited on the other hand the association between a concept and a
(55:57) sound looks free uh so you can say tree in English and Bal in German and so on so that tells us what one aspect of language acquisition is it's uh determining which of the given set of concepts with all their richness and complexity is associated with which of the possible sounds with their limited variety notice that that's pretty trivial task so you can you can imagine how a little bit of experience could help fix those concept th those associations if the concepts were given and the structure of the sound was given
(56:32) well the Lexicon also contains what are sometimes called formal elements things like inflections like tense or plural or case markers of the kind that you find say in German or Latin and so on and languages do appear to differ quite substantially in these respects however that seems to be mostly illusion at least the more we learn the more it looks like illusion so for example take say cases Eng English doesn't have them you got to memorize them when you study German and Latin but that looks ucer it appears to be the case that English has
(57:02) them fine in fact exactly the way Latin has them it's just that they don't happen to come out the mouth they're not articulated they're in the internal mental computation and their effects which are quite ramified are detectable but that part of the computation just doesn't happen to link up to the vocal tra so the computation is running along but where it gets spelled out of sounds it just didn't Happ to look at this stuff uh well that's another aspect of language acquisition that is to
(57:32) determine what aspects of the computational system receive an external articulation there are also some differences among these formal elements that also have to be fixed uh but they appear pretty narrow notice incidentally that if you have a very intricate system uh with just a few possible differences in it which could be sort of right at the core somewhere mod making those changes May produce something that looks phenomenally quite quite different just look at it from the outside may look radically different even though it's
(58:03) basically basically the same thing with really only trivial differences and that's pretty much what languages seem to look like well uh what about the computational system that's the Lexicon what about the computational system it's possible that it's Unique that is it's invariant there's just one of them uh there's nothing at all to be learned uh it's not certain but it's at least possible in fact plausible uh if this picture is on the right track notice we're very close to concluding that
(58:32) there's only one human language uh at least in its deeper aspects uh and inly going back to this rational Martian scientist that's what he would have guessed in the first place uh otherwise acquisition of these highly intricate systems on the basis of fragmentary experience and the uniformity of the process would just be a miracle uh so the natural assumption is well there's basically only one of them and it's fixed in advance uh if in fact acquisition of language is something like a chicken embryo becoming a chicken
(59:05) or humans undergoing puberty at a certain age then it's at least within the realm of potential scientific understanding not a miracle uh and that's the way it seems to be the more we learn the more it looks like that uh more precisely there does seem to be a certain variety of languages apparent ly a finite variety that is it does seem to be the or it's a good guess now that each Lang each possible language that the language faculty makes available each possible language is fixed by answering a finite number of fairly
(59:39) simple questions uh you can look at the system as being sort of like a the complex wired up thing which is just given uh with a switch box associated with it and a finite number of switches you can flip them up you can flip them down uh you do that on the basis of the answer to one or another of these questions and they got to be pretty simple questions uh if we could understand the way that works bits and pieces of it are understood if suppose we could understand it then we ought to be able to say deduce Hungarian by
(1:00:10) setting the switches one way and deduce Swahili by setting the switches a different way uh the questions must be easily answered for empirical reasons children do it highly efficiently uh and very fast with very little EV evidence pretty much the way they grow uh it follows that languages are learnable uh uh that is uh if this is correct it follows that as I mentioned before languages in fact are learnable which is an empirical Discovery and a pretty surprising one uh uh uh no reason why would have had to no biological
(1:00:49) reason why it would have had to be true but it looks that as though it may be true partly because largely because because the variety is so so restricted uh well assuming that to be true uh we now have the following situation languages appear to be learnable which is surprising but languages appear to be unusable which I don't think is surprising at all uh what that means is that only scattered parts of them are usable and of course those are the parts we use so we don't notice it uh now actually this unusability
(1:01:19) property may be somewhat deeper than what I suggested uh since the origin of modern generative Linguistics there have been attempts to show that the computational system is constrained by certain very general principles of economy which have a kind of global character to them and there's some recent work that carries these ideas a long step forward it's still pretty tentative in fact it's unpublished uh but let me sketch some leading ideas that indicate where things might go uh suppose we think think of a linguistic
(1:01:56) expression something in something like the following way uh the language faculty selects a certain array of items from the Lexicon that's what it's going to talk about and it begins Computing away using its computational procedure which I'm now assuming to be invariant across languages it it computes in parallel just picks out these items and goes Computing along with them uh it occasionally merges pieces of the computation so you bring them together then maybe it picks something out and starts going in parallel again uh at
(1:02:29) some point in the computation they've all been merged uh it just keeps Computing uh it proceeds Merrily on its way in other words at some point at after they've merged uh the system the F language faculty decides to spell it out uh meaning to provide instructions to the articulatory and perceptual system uh then the computation just keeps going on uh and It ultimately provides something like a representation of meaning which is probably to be understood as instructions for other performance systems well proceeding in
(1:03:04) this way the computation ultimately proceeds uh two paired symbolic Expressions two paired outputs instructions for the articulatory perceptual apparatus on the one hand uh and instructions for language use uh what are called sematic sometimes so these are the two let's call them interface levels the language faculty the language faculty seems to interface with other systems of the Mind performance systems at two points one having to do with articulation and perception the other having to do with uh with the things you do with language
(1:03:40) referring to things asking questions and so on uh roughly sematic uh the uh so let let's say that's what happens looks like it does now of these various computations only certain of them uh have converge in a certain sense the sense is that the two kinds of outputs the phonetic instructions the articulatory perceptual system and sematic uh actually yield interpretable instructions like they might compute along and end up with an output that doesn't yield interpretable instructions in that case if either one of them fails
(1:04:18) we say that it doesn't converge uh now looking just at the convergent derivations the convergent computations those that yield interpretable paired outputs uh some of them are blocked by the fact that others of them are more economical that is they involve less computation now here you've got a Define amount of computation in a very special and precise sense but it's not an unnatural sense uh well if you can do this it's going to turn out that many instructions that would be perfectly interpretable just can't be constructed
(1:04:53) by the mind at least by the language faculty because the outputs are blocked by more economical derivations uh what is a linguistic expression then well a linguistic expression is nothing other than the optimal realization of certain external interface conditions a language is the setting of certain switches and an expression of the language is the optimal realization of universal interface conditions period uh all the work would now be done by special properties of the nature of computation and very special Notions of economy
(1:05:30) which do have a kind of global character they have a kind of a least effort character but of a global sort well it turns out that quite a variety of strange things can be explained in these ways in terms of a picture of language that is really rather elegant uh it's Guided by conditions of economy of derivation with very simple and straightforward operations uh they're not only elegant but they're pretty surprising for a biological system in fact these properties are more like the kind what one expects to find for quite
(1:05:58) unexplained reasons in the inorganic World well these economy conditions as I mentioned they have a sort of a global character to them though not entirely uh they have a tendency to yield High degrees of computational complexity uh that would render large parts of language unusable well that's not necessarily an empirical objection uh we then turn to an empirical question are the parts that are rendered unusable the parts that can't be used we know there are plenty of parts that can't be used so if uh uh turns out that parts of
(1:06:32) language involve computational irresolvable computational complexity irresolvable by a reasonable device uh and those are the parts you can't use fine that's a positive result not a negative result uh well uh what we might discover then if this continues to look as promising as it think it does now what we might discover is that languages are learnable because there is isn't much to learn that they're unusable in large measure but that they're surprisingly beautiful which is just another mystery if it turns out to be
(1:07:04) true thanks understand there's some time for discussion so if anybody feels like there's a couple of mics up here um can't see should I go ahead oh okay do have Mike go go ahead okay um you sort of touched on my question with your last couple of statements do you think um how well do you think think the um what we
(1:08:08) want to express maps with what is expressable through language do you think there are are maybe easily computable things that that can't get through and does this do you think this has some implications for other forms of expression music well that's an interesting question the question is how much of what we think you know can we articulate in order to have an answer to that question we'd have to have a way of getting at what we think that's independent of what we articulate so we'd have to have a way of getting at
(1:08:38) what we think which is independent of language and that's hard uh there's really no way to get at what we think other than what we can articulate somehow now you know just if you intros nobody knows anything about this so your guess is as good as anyone else's but if you introspect about it just you know to the extent that introspection means anything it looks as though the kind of thing you're talking about happens all the time so it's a common experience at least whatever it means uh for in a
(1:09:06) conversation for you to say something and realize that's not what you intended you know and you try it again you know and you listen to that one and maybe it was a little closer but not quite and then you try it again or maybe somebody suggest something finally get it out uh and yeah that was what you intended well it's hard to make sense out of that experience unless there's something going on in there that's not expressed linguistically some kind of thought or something and you're trying to figure
(1:09:35) out a way to articulate it however what that means nobody knows because we don't have any way of getting at the thoughts other than by the articulations if you could figure out a way of doing it that would be interesting uh Phil yeah uh well the question I I just talked about yes I will I just talked about speech and hearing I also talked about sign and seeing uh but the question is well what about writing uh that's obviously an input doubtless I mean we you know it's it's not it's it's
(1:10:17) whether it's a natural system is not so obvious there isn't as far as I'm aware there's no evidence correct me if I'm wrong but I don't know of any evidence that children can learn language from writing they can learn it from sign clearly and that's just like speech uh they can learn it from hearing uh but as far as I know learning from writing is always secondary that is it's mapping some visual sign system or some auditory sound system into another mode of representation however and learning
(1:10:53) it is not so simple simple I mean take some work uh but once it's acquired yeah you can presumably it I mean it does feed the same systems as far as we know so it'll be left hemisphere represented and so on and so forth I mean you can get you know you get left hemisphere phasia that'll cause writing problem sometimes right right that's absolutely true writing gives you all sorts of options that speech and sign don't give you because you going look back back and you can think about it and you can make much
(1:11:26) more complex expressions and if you look at what's in writing it has much more complexity than what would ever happen in a left to right system which I mean both speech and sign are restricted by the fact that it's left that time is linear you know it's left to right processing so all kind of memory constraints start to enter and all sorts of other computational constraints a parser for speech and sign has got to be left to right a parser for writing can you take your time you can p pour over a sentence for a long time uh and try to
(1:11:57) figure it out sometimes you even can sometimes you can't depends who you are you know like if I read a text in postmodern literary criticism I can look at the sentence for about a year and I still don't understand it but uh presumably you can at least figure out that it's got some grammatical structure uh and uh there there are some interesting questions about it's it's been there's some work actually suggesting that the um creation of writing systems may have had an impact on even maybe on language
(1:12:29) change and allowing certain more complex options to be developed and so on I don't think that's impossible you should really ask other people here about that because they know a lot more about it than I do including some of them have worked on it uh but another point that ought to be mentioned is that there are invented systems all of you know them when you study at MIT you're learning invented created systems all the time now those things are called languages like say the language of mathematics or
(1:12:55) something but that's just a metaphor I they're very different from languages uh even the language of ordinary scientific informal discourse is radically different from language when you begin to look at its properties all of these weird complex properties of language like what I mentioned about house uh when you develop a system that you want to use for understanding the world you know science you try to divest the concepts of all of these strange properties of natural language so for example when you study uh I don't know
(1:13:27) the other day I I can't say I read let's say I looked at a paper in science uh on the granular structure of matter you know I was asking whether a heap of sand uh is a liquid or a gas and or is it some other form of matter you know something or other well I couldn't understand the article but I could see what he's talking about uh but the point is you know the author of the article didn't care how the term liquid is used in English you know or in any other language that didn't come up what he
(1:13:56) cared about is the special technical concept created in the course of this effort to understand the world which may have the same sound as the English word liquid but is going to have very different properties so these things that are constantly created are sort of you might say they're accretions to language and they're typically intera the interactions with them are typically in written form uh but they're very different systems I expect that they're created by totally different faculties to the
(1:14:29) mind if people would like to come up to the mic it be a little easier uh one of the Japanese Phil philosophers said uh uh the cerebral physiology the physical uh study of brain uh shows to some extent the uh physical uh computational processing of uh languages is very different of of what physical computation processing of a processing of language of computer is very different from our physical uh that of our physical brain and he also said uh it's safer to for us to call a machine uh computer rather than col machine
(1:15:20) Artificial Intelligence on the other hand I'm I'm sorry I didn't entirely understand the there's if you look at the computer processing of language yeah it's the way the computer works is simpler than the brain uh the computer processing the system of language is different different from the way the brain does it yeah yeah that doesn't really mean anything I mean see it's like saying that if you build a bulldozer it's different from a person digging a ditch yeah I mean people are going to use if
(1:15:53) you if you write a computer program to do something whether it happens to be like the way humans do it is kind of you know may I mean if it it depends what your purposes are if you're writing a computer program to simulate some aspect of human thought say translating English or something then it better be like the brain otherwise you're you're just doing the wrong thing it's like creating a model for some other physical system and getting it wrong uh on the other hand if you're building a computer program to do
(1:16:24) something cuz you just want the thing done well then it's like constructing a bulldozer dig a hole you don't care whether people do it that way or not and on the other hand uh some current theory of syntax is uh too much care for the two uh some uh theory of current theory of syntax is uh care too much for the computational rationality rather than uh to se for the de state of our brain and sorry I didn't understand um somebody understand who can somebody say it again so I'll understand it that just shows that the generous
(1:17:11) procedures aren't always identical you know okay then oh the the theories of language or the computer theories words in other they care uh you know they can apply the grammatical Theory to the computer uh they put Priority the application of the computer rather let me see if I understood there's three different things here one is what is what the brain is actually doing a second is what some linguist is claiming the brain is actually doing a linguistic Theory a third is a computer program which is doing something or other now
(1:18:00) they're going to be the we hope we want the first two to be alike okay if they're not got the wrong Theory uh and you go back to the drawing board uh when you're working with a computer program you just have to decide what you're trying to do if you're constructing a if you're trying to simulate you're trying to give a model you're trying to understand what the physical system you're interested in is actually doing then you want your computer program to uh to to identify processes and states
(1:18:31) which are real uh uh for example youd want the program to fail where the person fails uh if a person has a parsing failure you want your parser to fail and so on uh there's no issue of rationality that I can see I mean a computer program and the brain and they're not rational any more than you know the legs are rational when you walk I mean they do what they do you know the brain is designed to do what it does a computer program that's trying to capture aspects of that uh will to the extent that it's
(1:19:03) correct you know do what it does the right way but the issue of rationality doesn't arise okay the another question is uh in your Curr current C of uh syntax you assume the modules or principes and uh I wonder what is you assume there exist such a kind of system in actual uh in reality Yeah in our brain right so when you construct the theory of syntax you assume I mean you assume you're probably wrong like when you're doing any kind of science but you make a guess that says I hope I'm right you know and then you check it
(1:19:44) out and see where you went wrong and if somebody can make it better and so on but you you certainly are like if somebody writes a paper in you know some Journal they are if they're serious claiming look this is the way it works this is the way the brain really works probably they're wrong because we usually turn out to be wrong but you try to get better the next time around on the other hand you certainly are claiming that's the way it really works same if you construct a theory of organic molecules or anything else
(1:20:11) you're claiming yeah that's the way it really works I know I'm probably wrong but I'll claim that that's the way it works and then I'll see if I make some progress um I really enjoyed your comment about uh when you said that there was one human language and uh you also indicated that if we were Martian and we came to the Earth we would sort of hear one sound in a sense so I was wondering with all of the diversity that we have in the world today uh and historically with Asia being one way linguistically and
(1:20:50) Africa another Europe another and and with inflectional languages that we've developed from Indo-European uh influences and the utina of languages that come from Africa and the Creoles from the Caribbean area in in the future say 100 years from now could you comment on which tendency would you feel that we would more likely be to go in that of one human language for the Earth or diversity with many see when I say there's one language I don't mean that we should try to sort of all speak esperado or something uh what I'm
(1:21:25) claiming is the actual diversity even the possible diversity you know there's a lot of possible languages around that just haven't come along for historical accident but if you cons consider the possible diversity what I'm saying is a rational Martian scientist who looks at us the way we look at frogs uh would say well there's only one of them it's true like if we look at frogs they they're all frogs you know I mean uh um if if a frog looks at frogs they're all wildly different from one another in fact a
(1:21:58) frog would just take for granted that every reasonable thing is a frog and wouldn't even ask any question about what it's like to be a frog a frog would presumably be precisely different interested in whatever minuscule difference there may be among frogs that tells them you know you act this way or that way to them they don't worry about the fact that they're all frogs that's taken for granted or if you're doing a genetics experiment let's say you pretend that all the fruit flies are
(1:22:23) identical I mean if somebody really asks you you'll say yeah this one's they're a little bit different here and there but they're basically identical for all I care uh and whatever is different about them I forget about uh and again from the point of view the fruit flies the world may look quite different now we're no different from any other organism I presume I think we're part of the natural world so we take for granted that anything around is a human being I mean if other people use the word house
(1:22:49) with this weird collection of properties that we we use we don't even notice it that's just like breathing uh because that's just the way any reasonable creature is on the other hand if a martian were to and and if you go over and you hear somebody speak swah or something uh that looks wildly different on the other hand I'm suggesting that if a martian were to look at us or if we were capable of looking of looking at ourselves as we can you know you sort of abstract yourself away from being human
(1:23:16) being and you try to become a science you can't get out of your own skin completely but you try you know look at us the way we would look at frogs or flute fruit flies and I think what you discover is we're remarkably alike uh that all of this diversity is really pretty superficial uh it goes back to very similar structures in fact so similar that this diverse range of languages may very well have only one computational procedure uh and only slight variations among it and the set of concepts with all their richness and
(1:23:47) intricacy most of which is undreamt of nobody even knows what it is uh that probably is going to turn turn out to be alike now of course there will be differences and in our lives as human beings we'll be very much interested in the differences but in our lives of scientists will'll say they're all the same that's what I mean I see what you mean in other words were you saying that at you made the example of the container the container nouns and yeah I believe you said if we look upon it from the
(1:24:15) exterior then well we have a very weird way of looking at containers a way which is extremely complex so comp in fact that there couldn't be a physical object that has any of the properties that we I mean that has the collection of properties that we assume when we talk about them well it doesn't mean we're confused or anything like that it just means that the language resources we have for compel us to look at the world from a very strange perspective and we all do it that way because we're human
(1:24:44) frogs do it their way because they're frogs uh now there are also slight differences among us like English and Swahili but they look slight now about the diversity of languages chances are it's going to move towards uniformity but that's for completely other Pro reasons that's CU a lot of people get murdered and you know power spreads and that sort of thing so languages are in fact disappearing but that's like the way biological diversity is being reduced thank you that's the question I want to ask
(1:25:17) you about the future of language um I talk to people from other countries and I ask them what they listen to on the radio in terms of music and it's all english-based pop music uh the publishing industry seems to be going in the direction of English language Universal throughout the world uh there are countries that have set up organizations to protect their languages I know the French government has such an organization uh particularly when uh what was it pinball machines in France became Le flipper um are we going toward a future
(1:25:55) where English will be the universal language well you know that's a question at a different dimension altogether that has to do with that's a question of power you know and that's a different set of issues arise my guess is not I mean in some respects the world's becoming more diverse for example I I I don't have any statistics maybe somebody knows but I wouldn't be at all surprised if the number of say scientific papers being written in German and Japanese is increasing not decreasing you go back to
(1:26:24) say 19 early 50s they're probably be wrting writing in English because the US is so overwhelmingly dominant if you're not writing in English you don't exist but that's prob I tell I'm sure some of you know maybe Phil knows or something but I suspect it's more diverse now uh and if uh real development takes place in other places I would expect it continue to be diverse in that respect uh also you know while there is a tendency to I me take say the European Community or take Europe all together
(1:26:54) while Europe is in a way at one level unifying it's also splitting all over the place uh not we read about it in Eastern Europe where you know there a different country emerging every village by now but it's happening in Western Europe too I mean Scotland is moving towards you know there a big pressure towards independence actually it's even happening in the United States I was giving some talks in Alaska a couple of weeks ago and I discovered to my amazement that the governor of Alaska was elected on an independence ticket
(1:27:23) apparently everybody thinks he's a total crook but they voted for him because he was calling for Alaskan Independence and that's what they want they want to get away from this business down here uh so I think one also finds you know very disintegrating factors in the world system towards people trying to identify communities that they can belong to you know or feel part of or something like that and that leads to uh there's been a lot of Revival of languages that have that were dying I I think it's awfully
(1:27:51) hard to predict that depends on complicated economic and social and political processes that we don't have any at least I don't have much understanding of I heard a report of evidence on brain waves that if you're hearing in English uh or seeing in English a table your brain wave pattern is different than if your natural language is German is that because we always give them an oral element or is it a difference in visual element or what causes this difference well I don't know those results but uh if there's
(1:28:31) anything like that I suspect it would be picking up something about the input system it's extremely hard to believe that I mean I don't first of all I don't think there's any technology or understanding around that would enable you to identify the conceptual structure of English versus the conceptual structure of German in anything like say electrical activity if you can I don't know maybe again I'm sure some of you know much better than I do but if there's anything uh involving say
(1:29:03) electrical activity of the brain that is distinguishing a German word from an English word it's probably picking up the the the uh physical input like the articulation which of course are radically different yes this was con this was these were experiments in which both they were asked mentally to think think about something but when you think about something but when you think about something so you can't think about something without you know beginning to get your uh motor system working try try to think about a word without saying it
(1:29:36) to yourself I'd like to ask two questions um the first one is um Alona Church said once that prinkipia Mathematica was as much a part of the English language as Paradise Lost now speaking from my modest personal experience uh I can report that uh in an hour of an average mathematics seminar one is likely to hear more metaphors than in a month of uh Iowa poets Workshop uh your Distinction on the other hand between language of Science and natural languages uh seems to turn around uh the um prescriptive ideal that
(1:30:21) a scientist supposedly sets for his language uh I would like to ask to what extent uh actual empirical data about uh linguistic competence of speakers of languages of science uh has been Incorporated uh into the uh the the conclusion that you make Well it can't be studied because the notion languages of science is just a metaphor it's like asking how much evidence about airplanes flying has been incorporated into the study of eagle it's not a meaningful question when scientists construct the system that
(1:30:58) they're working in they purpose I mean they may not think about it but what they're actually doing is divesting the system of many of the complicated properties of natural language and they're also adding to the system other properties that natural language doesn't have so for example take principia Mathematica or let's say go back to Fraga which kind of starts the thing off uh the systems that say Fraga beginning of modern philosophy of language and so on philosophy of mathematics the systems
(1:31:29) that he created which of course he called languages but that doesn't mean anything the systems that he created had properties stipulated properties that language probably doesn't have at all in fact presumably some quite critical properties like a fraan system the kind that is then developed say in principia Mathematica uh that has a property of reference that is words refer to things okay so the numeral three refers to the number three period it's just made up that way well that doesn't seem to be
(1:32:01) the way natural languages work they don't have what are called logically proper names back I don't know 40 years ago or so philosopher Peter straon talked about what he called the myth of the logically proper name uh pointing out and I think accurately that languages just don't have them they have other ways of carrying out the act of referring but if you tried to use the language ways in mathematics or in physics it would just be a total screw up so what you do is create systems which have properties like reference
(1:32:34) between a symbol and a thing uh and which of course pick the things to make some sense you know you pick the things so that they're going to be part of the natural world natural language doesn't care whether they're part of the natural world or not you just do it the way you're you're you're create you're constructed to do it in a certain way way and whether the uh well take say the case of liquid that I mentioned before uh you can't help using liquid with the natural language connotations when a
(1:33:02) physx of principia Mathematica is radically different than the syntax of language at the most Elementary level I mean every formal language for example like say the language of principia mathematic it begins with a distinction between well-formed formulas and not well-formed formulas there's no reason to believe that any such distinction exists in natural language I mean from the start you just make up new systems with the goals that you know with with which had which which are an attempt to come to an understanding of nature
(1:33:36) natural language was not you know is not a system which is sort of given to us with the intent of coming to an understanding of nature anym than walking is uh that and that's you've got to keep taking your intuition you've got to keep trying to overcome your intuitions when you do something science I mean you look at the sunset every evening you can't help but seeing the sun set you know you can know all the astronomy you like and when you look at it you see the sun set you know uh there's no other way to see it that's
(1:34:04) just the way you're constructed but in so far as you're a scientist you try to you know take yourself out of your skin I don't want to see the sunset I want to see relative motion and so on and so forth and it's the same in constructing these so-called languages whether it's Fraga or principia mathematic or anyone else uh so there's no there's no meaningful question about are they you know are they like natural language no they're different they may use some of the I mean it's perfectly true as you
(1:34:32) say that if you go to a math class people are going to math lecture people are going to use metaphors all over the place similarly in a math open the Journal of math American Journal of mathematics and the things that are called proofs are not proofs in anybody's sense they're hints that a smart mathematician could use to make up a proof I if you tried to construct a proof every issue of the American Journal of mathematics would be as big as the Library of Congress or something like that you can't do that you know uh
(1:35:00) so of course you use metaphors and hints and you appeal to people's intuition and understanding and so on but that's just because you're a human being trying to do science when in so far as you're doing science you will very consciously often diverge from properties of common sense or natural language which are just biological capacities just say you'll try to diverge from your perception of the Sun and setting perhaps I was calling for a more descriptive rather than prescriptive notion of proof and analyzing the
(1:35:31) language of mathematics but uh I would like to ask you something that well see there's no there's no issue look there is no such thing as a descriptive there is no descriptive study of the practice of the American Journal of mathematics it's just not an interesting topic I mean you do it the best you can with the least effort to make sure that people who understand more or less what you understand will get the idea you know that's kind of the way you do it are you saying then that uh uh the relation of reference is radically
(1:36:02) different in natural language or perhaps even non-existent well it appears to I mean this is a very controversial issue again and I don't want to be glib about it but my own view at least is that the relation of reference which is stipulated for formal languages doesn't even exist in natural language thank you uh I like the metaphor about setting switches my switches were obviously set to English uh I tried to reset them and and reasonably well to Japanese and and found that quite different I wonder if
(1:36:34) if your studies have given any insight into second language acquisition and and perhaps ways to facilitate it mine haven't there are people here who work on second language acquisition uh Suzanne Flynn for example and the uh U is a person who's done interesting work on secondary language e acquisition and her work suggests that you know there there are certain parts of the system that are just fixed and Universal than there's other sort of peripheral parts so you got to set the switches and her work suggests that among that at the
(1:37:04) adult level uh this the distinction is still there so that when you're learning Japanese as an adult you're still using the see you might assume that it all just gets assimilated once you set the switches it's just what it is and you can't distinguish the switches from the principles anymore but it according to her work you probably can distinguish so that's interesting on the other hand how people learn second language that seems to vary all over the lot like say take our department you know little small
(1:37:30) Department over at MIT with half dozen eight faculty members we happen to have in the department two people who are at opposite Extremes in the human race in their capacity to learn second languages one is me who is at the extreme of total incapacity the other is Ken hail who picks up second languages the way a child does and so like a miracle and how this happens nobody knows you know nobody has the slightest idea people just differ you know I suggest I suggest we take one last one okay and give you a break I hate to be the last question I
(1:38:05) hope I don't disappoint anyone um I was wondering if there's some practical difficulty with constructing a theory about language that that requires language to articulate the theory is it self is that some sort of contradiction using language to talk about language is there a problem I don't think so I mean you know you can get confused it it allows for confusion but if you sort of keep your head straight there isn't a real problem for one thing when a linguist talks about language a linguist
(1:38:33) is doing something like a chemist talking about the world that is you're making up other systems uh which are going to have special properties that scientific systems have I mean you're going to use English words but of course if you go to physics class they also use English words well like they use the word I it's kind of like you know a physicist will use the word work and energy but you're supposed to understand that they don't mean what you mean out in the street when you say it's too much
(1:39:02) work to finish my homework or something you you don't mean that you mean some other thing and that kind of problem does arise and you're right it does arise in a somewhat greater form when the thing you're talking about is maybe your own language but it's mostly a matter of you know just one of those extra burdens of possible confusion that you have to try to sort out there's no intrinsic difficulty thank you very much
