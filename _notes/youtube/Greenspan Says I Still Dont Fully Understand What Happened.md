Transcript:
(00:00) dr. Greenspan I want to start with you you were the longest-serving chairman of the Federal Reserve in history and during this period of time you were perhaps the leading proponent of deregulation of our financial markets certainly you are the most influential voice for deregulation you have been a staunch advocate for letting markets regulate themselves let me give you a few of your past statements in 1994 you testified at a congressional hearing on regulation of financial derivatives you said there is nothing involved in
(00:40) federal regulation which makes it superior to market regulation in 1997 you said there appears to be no need for government regulation of off-exchange derivative transactions in 2002 when the collapse of Enron led to renewed congressional efforts to regulate derivatives you wrote the Senate we do not believe a public policy case exists to justify this government intervention and earlier this year you wrote in The Financial Times bank loan officers in my experience know far more about the risks and workings of their counterparties
(01:19) then do bank regulators and my question for you is simple were you wrong it would be sure the mic is turned on up partially but let's separate this problem into its component parts I took a very strong position on the issue of derivatives and the efficacy of what they were doing for the economy as a whole which in effect is essentially to transfer risk from those who have very difficulty of great difficulty in absorbing it to those who have the capital to absorb losses if and when they occur these derivatives are working
(02:06) well let me put it to you very specifically so you don't think you were wrong and not wanting to regulate the derivatives it depends which derivatives we're talking about credit default swaps I think have serious problems associated with them but the bulk of derivatives and indeed the only derivatives that existed when the major discussion started in 1999 or those of interfer interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk let me interrupt you because we do have a limited amount of time but you said in your statement that you
(02:46) delivered the whole intellectual edifice of modern risk management collapsed you also said those of us who have looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholders equity myself especially are in a state of shock disbelief end quote now that sounds to me like you're saying that those who trusted the market to regulate itself yourself included made a serious mistake well I think that's true of some products but not all I think that's the reason why it's important to distinguish the size of this problem and
(03:20) its nature and what I wanted to point out was that the excluding credit default swaps derivatives markets are working well well where do you think you made a mistake then I made a mistake in presuming that the self-interest of organizations specifically banks and others or such is that they were best capable of protecting their own shareholders and their equity in the firm's and it's been my experience having worked both as a regulator for eighteen years and similar quantities in the private sector especially ten years at a major
(04:08) international bank that the loan officers of those institutions knew far more about the risks involved in the people to whom they lent money then I saw even our best regulators at the Fed of doing so the problem here is something which looked to be a very solid edifice and indeed a critical pillar to market competition and free markets did break down and I think that as I said shocked me I still do not fully understand why it happened and obviously to the extent that I figure out where it happened and why I will
(04:53) change my views in the facts change I will change you had an ideology you had a belief that that free competitive and this year your statement I do have an ideology my judgment is that free competitive markets are by far the unrivaled way to organize economies we've tried regulation none meaningfully work that was your quote you have the authority to prevent irresponsible lending practices that led to the subprime mortgage crisis you were advised to do so by many others and now our whole economy is paying its price do
(05:29) you feel that your ideology push you to make decisions that you wish you had not made well remember that what a knot ideology is is a conceptual framework with the way people deal with reality everyone has one you have to to exist you need an ideology the question is whether it is accurate or not and what I'm saying to you is yes I found a flaw I don't know how significant or permanent it is but I've been very distressed by that fact but if I may may I just finish an answer to the question previous you found a flaw in the reality
(06:09) more in the model that I perceived is the critical functioning structure that defines how the world works so to speak in other words you found that your your view of the world your ideology was not right it was not what it had it precisely no I that's precisely the reason I was shocked because I have been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well
