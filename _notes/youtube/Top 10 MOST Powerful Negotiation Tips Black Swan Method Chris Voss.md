(00:01) now let's dive in number one is now a bad time to talk now we're going to give you several no oriented questions in a row because they're awesome and they help get you an advantage right away but one of the things i'm going to underscore on these no oriented questions is the issue of decision fatigue now look everybody's got the same problem we all suffer from decision fatigue you suffer from decision fatigue what does that mean what that means is there are only so many decisions you can make in a
(00:34) given day there are only so many decisions any human being can make in a given day that's one of the reasons why if you're in prison and you come up for parole you want to come up for parole in the morning instead of the afternoon because in the afternoon they're going to give you no decision they're not going to be able to make a decision you're more likely to stay in jail this is not parole and parole board issues this is human nature issues there are only so many decisions only so much
(01:03) gas anybody has in a tank to make decisions on a given day and that's going to be a result of you know how much sleep they get the night before what uh what their diet is what they ate that day whether or not they ate carbs where they are in their circadian rhythm everybody hits a circadian low roughly about 3 am and about 3 pm just part of being a human being decision fatigue issues however we found in a black swan group through practice and application and people are capable of saying no at pretty much any time of the day
(01:44) i had an intern a number of years ago only wanted to ask me how and what questions because he was horrified about making a mistake middle of the afternoon he'd be asking me how and what questions and i just didn't have the gas in the tank to answer them to be able to engage in that deep thinking as danny kahneman would say so consequently i'd say like i don't know don't bother me leave me alone instead of giving them an answer finally i said look don't ever ask me a question after one o'clock in the
(02:13) afternoon the answer isn't no because i could say no and i can think through the next several steps and give them guidance we've used this on a regular basis you got to get into practice using no oriented questions and number one is the flip side of the most common thing you're saying on a regular basis which is wrong actually it's not that it's wrong it's just not great is have you got a few minutes to talk now i know you mean that respectfully and we're not throwing respect out the
(02:48) window here the blackstone method is actually extremely respectful it's now a bad time to talk test drive it use it on a regular basis build you know oriented questions mental synapses and experiment with the sort of answers that you get you're gonna like them and as a side note i would say to you anybody that would say yes to that do you really want to talk to them then at that moment when they've actually said yes to that no you know right number two is it a ridiculous idea use this in place of is it a good idea
(03:28) for all the same reasons that i just gave you you got to get your practice in number three are you against xyz whatever it may be instead of are you in favor of again you've got to use this to get into practice we had a woman at a in a uh hospital services company once who was a little skeptical of our no oriented questions approach walked out of the room during the training and reached out to the head nurse in a hospital about a program that she'd been trying to get the head nurse to accept that the head nurse had been rejecting
(04:11) instead of saying do you want to agree or would you like to do this she said are you against and then ask the question the head nurse immediately said no they came to an agreement and they implemented the program she came walking back in the room and said you guys are not going to believe what just happened i've been trying to get agreement on this for weeks and i switched from a yes question to a no question and cut the deal got gotta get your reps in number four have you given up on x whatever that x may be
(04:49) this is context driven what's the context it has to be something they've already started on otherwise you're using a black swan skill as a manipulative trap which is not what we advise they have to have already started on this now when do you use this you use this when they are ghosting you they've gone silent on you this will restart your conversation 999 times out of a thousand don't let the fact that it stops one or a thousand times stop you scare you nothing works all the time this works
(05:26) more than anything else does and what makes it work well you gotta keep this in mind your system is perfectly designed to give you the outcome you've obtained if they've gone silent on you you've been doing something to contribute to them going silent on you you've probably been explaining you've probably been pitching you've probably been educating going to stop all these things restart the conversation with this one shot restart and then your very next move is you got to get a tr out of them what's a tr
(06:09) that's right how do you get a tr how do you get that's right you got to summarize their perspective particularly their reservations the reasons for not doing it what they're up against the difficulty of what they might be facing and then go dead silent you do not go but here's why those aren't good reasons you got to go dead silent and get it that's right out of them if you can't get it that's right out of them at that point you've got to say it sounds like i've left something out that's a bonus
(06:48) response for you to use here which is not on our top 10 list but helps you get farther in your conversations number five and we're going to get into the category here with letting out know a little at a time a person that i consider a good friend and i'm really impressed with ned coletti former gm at the los angeles dodgers we were sitting around talking about negotiation one time ned is a phenomenal negotiator and he told me the phrase i like to let out know a little at a time this is a great attitude you do not
(07:22) want to let people get blindsided by you suddenly saying no you've got to let it out a little at a time and the first way is letting out know a little at a time in a highly collaborative way is how am i supposed to do that now many of you know this is one of the most famous lines with the black swan method and it's pretty much the opening story in the book never split the difference how am i supposed to do that and we originally conceived of this as a way to passively say no even passively aggressively against the throat cutting negotiators
(08:02) that are really trying to kick your backside and what it is in many other ways is it's an implementation question how questions are about implementation it's designed to let the other side realize that there's some implementation issues here this also falls in the category of what brandon voss is labeled forced empathy it forces the other side to take a good empathic look at your situation we use empathy because it works and we use empathy because we want to get it in return you're going to use empathy because it
(08:43) works and you're going to use empathy because you want it in return and how am i supposed to do that is a great starting point for that now what happens if they turn around and say well that's your problem will they put it right back on you which will happen occasionally once i had a woman say i used how am i supposed to do that and it didn't work because they shot back right at me and told me how i was supposed to do that well number one the fact is it's not that it didn't work the fact is is
(09:13) that it's giving you a better clearer picture of the situation they throw it right back on you they're telling you they're not interested in showing you any empathy that's an interesting clue that maybe you don't want to do business with them all right i'm going to give you two ways to subscribe to the black swan groups negotiation newsletter which is free doesn't cost you anything i had a colleague with the fbi that used to like to say if it's free i'll take three here's how you subscribe to the edge if

(10:58) i'm afraid that just doesn't work for me now here's the beauty aspects of this you mentioned generous you want to encourage generosity on their part that's a good thing for you to throw into this statement second part it just doesn't work for me that removes the problem of external criteria now my academic brothers and sisters like to talk about well let's agree on an external criteria why should you agree to the external criteria maybe the external criteria is okay and appropriate in a neutral
(11:40) situation or in situations other than yours well why should external criteria apply to you in many cases it doesn't you want to remove an agreement on external criteria from the conversation because they're only going to agree to external criteria that works against you and you don't want to put yourself in that corner this is a great way to come back with a much stronger no one of the students in our class at georgetown said they use that phrase your offer is very generous but i'm sorry it just doesn't work for
(12:14) us and he said the people on the other side of the table looked at each other and then looked back at him and said you're right it is high now that's an interesting response because you want to have an impact on what you say what you say and what they hear you want them to get across in their brain this stuff doesn't work there's a pretty good chance it's too high you don't want them to feel backed into a corner when you're letting out knowledge a little at a time and this is a great way to do
(12:50) that don't back people into a corner they will disagree even when it's not in their interest to disagree taking away their autonomy is a bad idea and that's what happens when you back people into a corner now number seven this is another counter-intuitive response and you use it for when somebody calls you and says how are you today instead of saying fine you know how are you or my back hurts or it's a wonderful day when they're calling you and saying how are you today what are they really trying to find out
(13:30) well they're really trying to find out are you in a mental place to talk about what i want to talk about so here's how you short circuit this conversation in a way that builds rapport that they appreciate gathers information and preserves your most precious commodity and theirs which is time it sounds like you've got a place you want to start they are going to love this of course they have a place they want to start they've thought about it before they called you now every now and then somebody's going to say to you
(14:10) yeah i do have a place i want to start but i really want to know how are you today cool then engage in the conversation and then you can get back to the place they wanted to start everybody wins number eight another counter-intuitive response and this is how you should respond to questions when you're asked a question so the first way to respond to questions and number eight on our list is what makes you ask just like that now when somebody asks you a question what's more important is the question behind
(14:54) the question what makes you ask for two reasons number one most people are not good at asking questions that question may be a result of a committee decision you know uh how good a committee is well let me give you an example a giraffe is a horse designed by a committee so committee decision questions are going to be off on number two what's really driving at what make them ask is far more important than what they actually asked so you got to find out and this is not disrespectful they're going to be happy to tell you
(15:34) and if they're not well that tells you a lot about them too and how can you respond if they say just answer the question your response is i want to make sure that i answer what you're really asking me i'm just trying to dial in to what you're really after more respect if they don't like respect from you that tells you a lot about them and whether or not you should continue to be in business with them now what happens if some of the afternoon their decision fatigue they're having trouble coming up
(16:09) with an answer it's too in-depth the alternate to great calibrated questions and what makes you ask is a calibrated question you want to ask an alternative label an asking label if you will and so number nine on our list is the alternative to what makes you ask and that is it seems like you have a good reason for asking that or it seems like you have a good reason for asking that i give you both inflections there make sure you shut the front door right after you use that label what does that mean go silent count thousands to yourself if
(16:52) you have to let them break the silence you won't get past three be prepared to count to ten and wait respectfully this is a respectful dynamic and respect is one of your best choices finally number 10 on the top 10 list of black swan negotiation bullets you're going to use this when the other side is failing to perform when they're not living up to an agreement what do you say it seems like you have a reason for not doing and then whatever it is that they didn't do x y perform finish the contract finish the
(17:41) work call me back they're gonna have a reason they're probably afraid to tell you this is the best way to re-engage a collaborative approach to whatever the problem is so that they feel safe and respected always the keys to a long-term relationship so these were the 10 most powerful negotiation bullets of the black swan method share this video across your network share with the people that are on your side remember if you want to go fast go alone if you want to go far go as a team and let the black swan group continue
(18:31) to help you up level your negotiation skills
