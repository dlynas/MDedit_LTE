Smart Talk: Is Georgism Relevant today?
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vaMj8AQgxg)

## Transcript:

welcome to smart talk where we speak
with leading academics and other
thoughtful persons on the important
challenges facing the world today
my name is edward dodson i am a long
time member of the faculty of the henry
george school of social science
our guest today on smart talk is
nicholas tiedemann
he has taught economics at virginia
polytechnic institute and state
university since 1973
joining the faculty of virginia tech
after an appointment as an assistant
professor at harvard university during
which he took a year out to serve as a
senior staff economist at president
richard nixon's council of economic
advisors
professor tiedemann earned his
undergraduate degree in mathematics and
economics from reed college then a
doctorate in economics from the
university of chicago
one might say that he was born to pursue
economic research and to become a member
of the discipline
from the 1890s on
members of his family over four
generations have been strong supporters
of the movement for economic reform
initiated by henry george
nick learned about henry george's
thinking from his father who said to him
when quite young
isn't it strange that some people think
they can own land
nick has been a leading voice within the
economics discipline urging his
colleagues to examine with objectivity
the role played by land market dynamics
and the private appropriation of the
rent associated with locational
advantages
during the 1990s he played a key role in
an effort to convince the new regime in
russia not to follow the western pattern
of allowing the nation's land and
natural resources to be privatized
i was fortunate enough to join nick on
one of the many trips made to russia in
this effort
sadly those we worked with in russia did
not have the power to implement the
reforms necessary to change the course
of russia's history
the list of nick's writings on important
economic social and political issues is
too long to try to list
smart talk reviewers
are directed to his university website
and to the many other papers readily
available by a simple internet search
i'm anxious to hear from nick what he
has to say about the state of the us and
world economy today
and about his ongoing research interests
nick welcome to smart talk
thank you
it's really great to have you here
we've known each other for a long time
and
i've always valued your input on some of
the
real important issues of our day
but
today i'd like to ask you to start off
by sharing with the smart talk audience
something of your family's involvement
in the single tax movement and how this
brought you to economics as your chosen
profession
well
my
great-grandfather sven
came to the united states from sweden
knowing no english
and he went to chicago where there were
lots of other swedes and he asked
another swede what would be a good way
to learn english
and that person replied that he should
read henry george
and that's how it happened that
my family
has been interested in henry george's
ideas for four generations
uh
i believe that's somewhere on the web
perhaps on your website
one can find a copy of my great
grandfather's book radicalia
that is exactly true
my grandfather
left
school at the eighth grade to support
the family but nevertheless became an
electrical engineer but taking courses
at the ymca
he became chief
electrician of the city of chicago
and was
one of the founders of the henry george
school of social science in chicago in
the early 1930s
my father studied electrical engineering
at the university of illinois
but then
left electrical engineering to work for
his brother-in-law at the henry george
school
in chicago and then revived the henry
george school in san francisco
so
i'm
from a long line of people who have
taken an interest in henry george's
ideas
and how early in your life were you
interest introduced to henry george and
were you asked to read progress in
poverty at a young age
i don't believe i read progress in
poverty until i graduated from high
school
but
my father
explained to me that the factors of
production were land labor and capital
and that their returns were went rent
wages and interest when i was about
eight years old
and i remember another lesson in
economics when we were riding on a
streetcar in san francisco
and
as we passed the chicken parts
store
i asked my father how can they survive
in business don't people just buy the
drumsticks
and he took the socratic method and
asked well suppose you ran the chicken
part store and you noticed that you ran
out of dumpsters and everything you had
lots of anything else can you think of
anything you could do
to make sure that things would run out
at the same rate
and he gradually extracted from me the
idea that there had to be a set of
relative prices at which the parts would
be bought by customers at just the
ratios at which they were found on the
chicken
so that was my first lesson in economics
oh my goodness at such a young age too
yeah well
you know obviously the the early lessons
stuck with you uh you went on to pursue
a degree in economics and you've taught
it for all these years
so i guess
the follow-up question i would ask you
is
as a professor of economics
over all these decades have you seen the
level of interest in henry george's
proposals and his analysis
shift
either for the betterment or
you know is it
is henry george still
in your mind part of the sort of
underworld of economics
well i think that
40 50 years ago
there was more knowledge of henry
george's ideas than there is today
i encounter young economists who have no
idea that land might be different from
capital
uh whereas
uh in 1991 when i was circulating uh the
letter to gorbachev suggesting that they
retained the rent of land for public
purposes in russia
there were any number of prominent
economists in their 60s and 70s
who
were quite familiar with the idea and
supported above it
so i think that
it it has declined
but it might possibly be coming back
i think that people are now more ready
to think about the possibility
that there is a common heritage in
natural opportunities
well that may be encouraging i i think
certainly the the kind of attendance
we're getting at the henry george school
in terms of the lectures that are
provided online is pretty encouraging
and even in my own teaching in senior
adult education elsewhere
i'm finding a significant increase in
the level interest in alternative
explanations for how the world works
that there's general dissatisfaction
with what's being
told to people by the media and by the
media economists that we you know often
hear
so perhaps uh we are on the
beginning part of an upswing in an
interest in
and hopefully that means that uh
your writings will get even more
attention as the next couple of years
come come and go
well
i'm reminded of that
quote from sinclair lewis you might be
familiar with it's hard for man to
understand something when a salary
depends on us not understanding it
and i think that if one substitutes
wealth for salary is even more
understandable
i think that
uh
just as
people who call themselves owners of
slaves
couldn't understand why slavery was
wrong
people
who
uh
put their wealth in the form of net the
ownership of land can't understand why
that could be wrong
or have a hard very hard time with it
it i think you're you're on to something
there that those of us who achieve a
level of perceived expertise in whatever
our profession is
we have a hard time accepting that we
might have missed something very
critical to the
analysis of the work that we do
and it does take a
big person to admit that
i often wonder
in reading henry george's science of
political economy where he takes on jon
stewart mill very seriously and
over many many pages
what mill's response would have been had
he been still he still been alive
well i think
that
among economists who are specialists in
public finance
there's no
uh
questioning of the idea
that
a
tax on land doesn't have the deadweight
loss the excess burden the inefficiency
of other taxes
but it just don't find that
worth
uh attending to
they don't seem to see it as part of a
systemic reform
yes
well if they begin to think about it
they think
it's so politically impossible to
imagine succeeding in that direction
that it's not worth thinking about yeah
well certainly those of us who've been
advocates for land value taxation over
many different decades have experienced
how difficult it is
to find a political
voice for the idea and then even when
it's adopted adopted to keep it in place
as occurred in in the city of pittsburgh
in pennsylvania
unfortunately
but uh
hopefully that that will that will is in
the process of changing and hopefully
your work will help contribute to that
in the political arena but
but let me ask you then
as you you know you
as you went through your degree program
as you study mainstream economics and
you had this background understanding of
henry george's analysis of political
economy
what did you see
as different as a as a philosophical
foundation within the george's paradigm
that persuaded you that george was
really on to something
well
the
philosophy profession has come closer to
providing a foundation in the economics
profession
in philosophy
there is a emerging tradition known as
left libertarianism
and left libertarianism is really
uh
a fancy way of
describing henry george's perspective or
something very close to it anyway
there are various flavors of left
libertarianism but the fundamental
assumptions of left libertarianism are
first that people have rights to
themselves and secondly that all people
have equal rights to natural
opportunities
and
that it seems to me is exactly what
henry george was saying
so i think that left libertarians
recognize henry george as somebody who
was one of them
i uh i i obviously came across a term
that equates somewhat to left
libertarianism and that's cooperative
individualism
and as you may know the history of that
term comes from
the
founding documents of fair hope alabama
and i first heard about it from paul
gaston
giving a lecture in fairhope at the time
he was
professor of history at the university
of virginia so
i i
immediately
grasped that cooperative individualism
was what henry george was aiming for
how do we how do we maximize individual
liberty
within a cooperative societal framework
and
perhaps
perhaps the left libertarians will
eventually realize that the cooperative
individualism is is what they're really
aiming for
uh
when did the term cooperative
individualism arise or you in the
founding documents of fairhope which was
really the 1890s or so correct
now of course
whether or not uh i don't know i haven't
traced the origins of the term itself i
don't i don't know if eb gaston and the
other founders of fairhope came to it on
their own or
came to it out of you know some other uh
knowledge that they had
but
but i i
found it as a term that's relatively
easy for people to understand
and hopefully
uh will eventually grasp
the significance of this idea of of that
henry george has provided to us of as
you say we have rights to ourselves and
we have rights to
uh
natural opportunities
so
your your
most recent uh writing and research
activity
have you been focusing on the
philosophical implications of george or
are you are you
focusing more on the technical
implications
well
i'm concerned equally with both i think
i think that
for many people
uh having a well-developed
philosophical foundation is an important
component of what makes an idea
understandable to them
and at the same time
there's
an important question of
whether it's feasible i think there are
many people
who can't imagine the possibility of
separating the value of land from the
value of improvements
and so
demonstrating that there are
reasonable ways of doing that is
part of what needs to be done
so i
on the one hand i understand that
assessors have been doing it for
generations perhaps centuries on the
other hand i think it's interesting to
explore
new ways
that
markets might be used
to
identify the separate value of land
buildings
can you expand on that a bit
okay
well
one way to
determine the value of land is just to
have the assessors go out
and

buy some properties remove the
improvements and then auction them off
under terms to specify that the value
for tax purposes is going to be
whatever the they sell for at auction
and uh
through this process one can imagine
developing a land value map through the
idea that land values are continuous
and yet there may be places in the
downtown areas where it just isn't
cost effective to
find
places where you can knock buildings
down
or
where you would like to know
what a property would be worth if you
could get a whole square block when it's
divided up into separate properties and
you might want to ask how can you be
fair to the owners of the separate
properties
while also
requiring them to
uh
take
responsibility for preventing somebody
from owning the whole block and if that
is the efficient way that it could be
owned
so i
developed the idea of an options market
where you have people who would like to
redevelop land specify
how much they would pay for an uh
a plot of given size
uh as a function of location in in the
smooth
in terms of a smooth function
uh and then also
uh
allow people to
uh
have tax bills that are less
than the
uh
value on in the option
uh if they're prepared to sell at a
lower price so i i work out this
this idea of a kind of a game in which
different people play different roles
and what emerges is
uh
a land value map
and a set of tax bills
uh without having to knock down any
20-story structures in order to find out
what what the
value of the bear land would be
and in that simulation
do you expect that there would be a
robust market reaction
in in favor of adopting that those
that those measures
or you haven't gotten that i think i i
have to plead um comparative advantage
i don't have a
the particular skill of
uh
marketing ideas uh i i develop the ideas
and leave it up to others to market them
okay fair enough
yeah i mean
the challenge of course
you know land value taxation is such a
beautiful idea
because it can be implemented over time
and so every year that you change the
rates you shift the rates off of
buildings and on to land values
you you can see the
the market reaction whether or not there
is an increase in investment
in new construction and property you
know rehabilitation
but the difficulty always comes to that
point
when the
annual tax payment on the land value has
reached something close to its full
potential rental value and now the
system has to revert
from the the use of assessment capital
assessments to
a a land rental assessment
would you let me comment on that yeah
okay
a land value tax could be a tax on the
sale value or on the rental value
and uh as you indicate um
if you tried to collect all the rent
from a tax on the sale value the sale
value would go to zero so where's your
tax base
on the other hand
it's rather difficult to observe land
rents
i spent about
10 years trying to figure out what land
rent
was from a theoretical perspective
when you have a land piece of land where
you would do something different with it
each year depending on when it was
vacant and ready for reconstruction
uh how do you decide what the rent is
with it when
you'd use it differently
depending on when you started using it
after
pondering that for many years i realized
that the answer was rather simple
that the rental value of land is the
opportunity cost of leaving vacant land
vacant
now let me elaborate on that
you could ask if you had a piece of
vacant land today
what is the present value for all future
time of the opportunity to use that land
that's the sale value
now you can ask
suppose that you have it vacant today
but somebody says wait i'd like to use
it for a parking lot per year and then
you can have use of it
by what amount does the dollar value of
the use of it fall if you have to wait a
year before you start using it
that is the rental value of the land for
this year
but that's the only rental value that
makes sense
in that when you have that definition
the rental value for all the future
years adds up to the sale price
so it was a great revelation to me to be
able to specify what rental value is
but then there is another important
insight
which is
that there's no upper limit
on the
tax you can have on the sale value let
me
you might think that the a tax of 100 is
as much you could have but
if you think about it a tax of two
percent per year is 200 percent per
century
so you are
it's
you have to specify the time period
before you know
really what a a tax on the sale value is
and if you can have a tax
of two percent per year you can have a
tax of two percent
per
a month two percent per week two percent
per day
two percent per hour
in the limit as the interval over which
you collect two percent goes to zero
you collect
something that approaches mathematically
one hundred percent of the rental value
of the land
so if you're content to collect only
99.99999
of the rent you can do so by a tax on
the sale value
you just have to collect the rent often
enough
you have to collect a share of the sale
price often enough
so
i think that we probably don't want to
collect absolutely all the rent we want
to have the land have some
sale value so the people will have an
incentive to
uh
clear
uh the derelict buildings
off of it if buildings are no longer
useful
um
and
it's interesting that henry george
didn't specify exactly what kind of a
share of the
sale price he was
thinking of in terms of a tax on land
value
so
i think that a tax maybe 20 percent per
year would be about right so a a
piece of land would sell for a five
years rent
and
yeah i mean would that be sufficient to
uh curtail speculation in land well so
if
let's say that the interest rate is five
percent
if the interest rate is five percent
then the tax of twenty percent per year
will collect 80 of the rent of land it's
20 over 20 plus five
is the ratio of the rent that it
collects
and i think that
if there were attacks collecting
80 percent of the rent of land there
would be very few opportunities
uh to speculate land that would would
pay
you you'd find people uh always looking
for some way of disposing of land rather
than
pay the tax on it when they couldn't use
it
well i think that's really useful
analysis and i hope that that we'll find
some
some elected officials who are concerned
about tax policy listening into this
interview
and our discussion
let me mention another thing that this
reminds me of
uh many people are concerned about
the possibility of driving
business people into bankruptcy
by requiring them to pay a land tax when
already paying a mortgage
and that has led me to embrace an idea
that i learned from michael hudson
which is
that we should regard the holder of a
mortgage
as the collector of the rent
and the person to whom we should go to
collect the tax we want to collect the
rental value of land for public purposes
so i would say that when there is a
mortgage on property
if the value of the mortgage exceeds the
value of the improvements
then the mortgage holder is declaring
himself to be the rightful recipient of
the rent to that extent
and therefore the rightful recipient of
the tax bill
if we want to collect the tax for public
purposes
well as a as a former mortgage lending
officer in the banking community
uh
i have
some concerns about about michael's
proposal
and
you know without getting into a long
discussion we could have a whole hour on
this particular question alone i think
um
what always bothers me is is the fact
that the primary beneficiary of the
proceeds of the sale of that property
are no longer involved in this
discussion
um you know so the mortgage lender or
more appropriately the mortgage investor
because in most cases the loans that are
made by banks and mortgage brokers are
sold into the secondary market
to
you know some private holder pension
fund or it could be fannie mae or
freddie mac etc
so
those
investors have to go into the credit
markets to acquire the funds in order to
uh purchase the mortgage loans
and yes i i would uh well so did you i
would regard the intermediaries as
intermediaries and capable of passing
the rent bill on to the people for whom
they borrow
so uh to elaborate no i understand you
have a special sensitivity on this
matter but nevertheless
to elaborate on my proposal
uh i i would say
that
uh it's
suitable
for rantiers people who are trying to
get a return on their investments
without any risk at all to say that they
are going to be disappointed that we
found a way to require them to
contribute
to the
financing of public activity to the
extent that they are counting on
receiving the rent of land uh
as
an investment return
so
the title holder uh would be responsible
first for
the taxes on the land into the extent
that the
tax represents
a levy
on
debt
the
uh owner would be
allowed to
uh use his tax receipts
as
a payment for his loan obligation to say
look this is really your tax bill and i
paid it for you see here's the receipt
and then the intermediary intermediary
receiving that receipt would be to say i
know you were expecting uh a
an interest payment on that obligation
we have but it turns out that the that
interest is being taxed and we paid the
tax and here's the receipt to prove it
and this would go on and on uh to the
ultimate recipient
of the
uh
the income
well i suspect there'll be a number of
very thoughtful people
who who will view and listen to this
interview and think about what you've
just told us
um i i need to think more deeply
about the possible uh
outcomes and and impact on on various
participants in that in that whole uh
okay market level perhaps we can discuss
this more offline yes or i could i'd
love to read a your paper that that
really describes it in detail and
perhaps others would as well
let's okay so so we've talked about
basically the real estate market and
land value taxation
but henry george
has written about rents as in a much
more broader sense and certainly you've
had an interest in how this analysis
applies to copyrights and patents
so i i'd like i'd
like to hear
your take on
what if any limits there ought to be to
the protections that individuals receive
under the law under copyright and patent
law
and do you think current laws are fair
or should they be revised
i think it's interesting to look at
henry george's
developments of ideas on the subject
in his initial uh writing he thought
that both copyright and patent were
unjust
and then he changed his mind decided
that patents were unjust but copyrights
were not because they didn't
infringe on the opportunities of others
to do what they were going to do
from a mathematical
perspective
you might say that a copyright
has
zero measure
with respect to how
much it reduces
the opportunities of others now i'm
inclined to think that that isn't quite
right
i'd like to illustrate my ideas first
with the song happy birthday
now
it's not surprising that in the culture
there will be some song of people seeing
to commemorate happy uh a person's
birthday
and it just happens to be that it's the
happy birthday song that we all know
now that song began as
a tune
written by a
texas teacher to the words good morning
to you good morning to you good morning
dear teacher good morning to you
and was that song copyrighted
well this question's about that it
appeared here and there
somebody claimed the copyright to it
but eventually
in the last 10 or 20 years
course decided that the person who
thought he had a copyright had only a
copyright to a particular arrangement of
the song
and that the tune itself was in the
public domain and all the
uh
royalties that had been paid by
restaurants who had their staff sing
happy birthday or and all the public
occasions where
happy birthday was sung and the royalty
but was paid were
legally incorrect
that there was no royalty that needed to
be paid on happy birthday
so
i think it is important to
reward creators
of
uh
copy as well as creators of ideas that
are patented in in some way because we
do greatly
benefit from their efforts
but i think that monopoly is the wrong
way to reward them
uh
i think we should have prizes for people
who come up with
valuable ideas
and
prizes for people who come up with
uh
works that are
widely
downloaded
but
i think it isn't necessary to give
huge awards to the lucky few
who uh happen to land on something that
they that's worth a lot more than they
could have imagined
i think that we would be better off
uh if we
made
the creation of
ideas something that
wasn't a
a
treasure hunt so much as a way of making
a reasonable living if
you
produce something that others find
valuable
benjamin franklin seemed to have that
idea that that these good ideas should
be shared with the world
he never never attempted to
patent
any of his inventions
um
it there's the logic that i've read and
i think it it's a fair logic that you
have teams of people all over the world
working to solve
very important significant problems and
we reward the one who got there gets
there to the finish line first
and maybe only by a few minutes before
the second person
and so how do we how do we
i remember hearing the story i wish i
could verify that it's true
that as alexander graham bell walked out
of the patent office having just filed
his patent somebody was walking in with
another phone telephone to be patented
it seems to me that
patents
even under the existing rules are given
much too often for things that are just
ready to be invented by anybody
and
we
we really don't need to create more
monopolies
all these monopolies
interfere with
productive
advances in our
technology
with regard to copyright protections
what what's your view about the quote
fair use doctrine that's pervasive with
material that's shared on the internet
i think it should be
greatly expanded
i think that
uh
it makes sense to me
to
uh
limit the capacity of people to simply
publish what somebody else has already
published
but
for making individuals who want to make
individual copies it seems to me that
that
ought to be
allowed
and
similarly
i think that if people want to build on
somebody else's copyrighted work
or to alter it in some way
i remember reading that the
writer of waiting for godot has
specified
that it can never be performed in
in a setting in which roles are taken by
people with
gender other than specified in the
original text and it seems to me that is
giving the author just too much control
that we should be allowed to take these
ideas and play with them in whatever way
we want as soon as they are out there
it is a rather complicated issue
particularly today with the you know the
internet and the ability to download
material i mean i do it every day all
the time
yeah
and i my
feeling is particularly with with
articles and papers
that while the author might find an
original publisher and have a limited
reading
that by putting that material online
elsewhere it's giving the author a much
larger audience than the author would
otherwise
reach yes
i think that when we publish things
as we now do
it's an
inefficiently expensive process
there
is
a worthwhile activity of curating
of
uh identifying things that's worth
reading
uh
and it it seems to me that we have to
get away from combining that
with uh
putting them down on pieces of paper
that we should find some way to do the
curation efficiently
uh without having to print in order to
do it
well another really important you know
uh
topic with a lot of legal implications
and
you know one one i would love to move on
to if if i can with you is to talk a
little bit about the implications of
tax policy necessary to deal with the
climate crisis
particular
the big debate over whether or not
it makes sense to have a carbon tax
or is the carbon trade
market
a suitable substitute
well
uh
let me
postpone that for just a couple minutes
while i answer a prior question okay i
was reading in the economist recently
that there are
people who say that the carbon tax will
never do the job that it can't possibly
substitute for
adding the new technologies that we need
and i believe that the economist correct
was correct in saying that
it's possible that that's true
but
even if it is true that
carbon taxes won't do the whole job
it's important to add them to whatever
else we do doing other things does not
uh relieve us of the need to do
something with carbon taxes
and here
i'm willing to
begin by assuming that either carbon
taxes or a carbon trading market uh
could do the job
it seems to me
pretty clear that either one could do
the job uh part of the job
what the part is part of it part of the
job the part yeah the the each could
contribute to
efficient redux
reduction
in
carbon emissions
uh
the
and
one could make them
pretty much
equivalent
uh
but
there's a tendency to take
to construct the carbon schemes
in such a way as to give rights to the
people who have been
uh doing the emitting in the past
and it seems to me that that's
generally not
uh justified
it would be justified if the people who
are doing the admitting
come from
competitive industries have been only
making normal returns on their
investments
and there was no way that they could
have known
that
their
emissions of carbon dioxide had
uh social costs
and
so they they suffer losses as a result
of the imposition of carbon taxes
but i think that uh anybody who's done
any investing over the last 30 years
should have known that they didn't know
that they were
harming the environment and they were
getting away with something if they
didn't have to pay for it
so
on that basis i would say that the
people who have been doing the meeting
do not deserve
a special dispensation in
working out how we're going to reduce
our carbon emissions
furthermore
systems of trading
depend on quantitative constraints we
decide we can afford a certain amount of
carbon and no more and no less
whereas
uh
carbon taxes
have prices
and
it turns out that
if you do things efficiently
the amount of carbon you emit
from
one year to the next will vary with the
economic cycle
you'll
emit a lot when conditions are good and
emit much less when economic conditions
are bad
and
it's unreasonable to expect that the
people who would be in charge of this
would be able to figure out what the
right quantity was for any particular
time
now we have a hard time figuring out
what the right price is but at least we
have good reason to believe
that whatever the right price is it's
the same from one year to the next
so whatever
error we're making we're
not
uh making a large error uh one year in a
small area the next year where
uh
we
we can
uh
confidently say that the price ought to
be stable
now
i've come up with a device for trying to
figure out what the right price is
and that is
a futures market of a sort
well economists sometimes call it a
prediction market
so
we have
uh 30-year bonds
so 30 years seems like a good time to
think about so we could take the year
2052 30 years from now and say that
in the year 2052 we will
hold
an academic conference
at which we'll try to figure out what
the right
price was for 2022
uh and
if you're wondering we want to go that
far out nick
yes yeah
given the the forecast that we have
about the impending consequences of
current policy no
let me explain if you want to admit
today
you buy
a
well you you put up a deposit
uh of
something like
a hundred dollars a ton for emitting
carbon dioxide something at the upper
limit of the economic estimates of what
the damages are
then
in 2052 30 years from now we will make
our best guess as to what the price
should have been and give the holders of
these certificates to change
meanwhile anybody wants to admit today
can sell his receipt to anybody else or
whatever
that person
will pay for it
and the market for those receipts
gives us today's best estimate
of what the estimate will be in 2052 of
what the price should have been in 2022.
this seems to me is the best device i
can come up with
for
setting a carbon price today
i i guess
my reaction was based on the fact that
some of the entities that would be
willing to do that
may be thinking in that their long term
is not that long
in other words
uh
they may not have that long uh of a of a
well existence
but
people do buy 30-year government bonds
and this is just that's like
yeah even today we still think you know
most of us still think we'll be around
or the where the
or the economy and our society will be
around and intact and functioning in 30
years yeah
so as long as we can sell 30-year
government bonds we can sell 30-year
pollution certificate pollution
pollution refund certificates
okay well that's that's something again
thank you for for giving that to us to
ponder and think about and and maybe
you'll get some feedback from some of
our viewers and listeners here today um
i i i guess i would like to you know
sort of finish up our conversation with
with a rough
assessment from you on where you think
we are in the
the 18 and a half year cycle
that many
uh quote georges
believes strongly in and with if we took
it if you look at
2010 as the trough of the last cycle
then somewhere around 2026
some of our colleagues
believe we're going to have the next
really serious systemic downturn and it
could be
perhaps the most serious we've had since
the great depression of the 1930s
um do you have any thoughts on on that
well it's a subject that i haven't
studied
i have uh seen uh
some of the
uh past work and it looks impressive to
me i think the year was 2008 rather than
2010. so that when you add 18 years you
do get 2026
and uh
i'd be cautious about being long in the
market in 2026.
okay
good evening
um
any last asked
issues you'd like to bring bring up that
we haven't covered that you think would
be good for people to know about
no
can't think of any
wow
well uh in that event i
all i can say is thank you so much for
your time and for the
insights and the wisdom you shared with
us
and i um
i hope that
you know maybe in a year or so we can
revisit and see if see if some of your
ideas have
taken
fruit
um
so
with that i guess
that's uh it for this edition of smart
talk
