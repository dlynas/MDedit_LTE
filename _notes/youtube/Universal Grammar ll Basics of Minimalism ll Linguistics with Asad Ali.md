## Transcript:
in this video
i am going to talk about the very very
very interesting
concept that how a child acquired a
language
in a society whenever he is born
what are the circumstances that involve
in acquiring the
language acquisition according to the
norm chomsky
and he has postulated that every
individual every human being that has
borne
in that has bought and andy and he comes
to in this world
he he or she is endowed with
some image potential
in the faculty in a device
what a chomsky calls that is the
language acquisition device
and this device and this device
actually he said that this device
regulates
the acquiring process of language
whatever the language
actually and nom chomsky want to stay i
want to say that
there is a one particular uh
portion of human mind that control that
control the inputs of language and
output of language
and here uh in in the johnson concept
he has said that
one thing that is the uh competence
and the other thing that is the
performance and
he says that every human being
has the uh has the in innate
world in his or her mind
that regulates his or her
linguistics ability when the child
is exposed in the society
when the child is born
then after that he he came to society
and in their society he has
he has his mother his father
his family grandpa his grandmother
and all his relatives and all the
unlisted these are the
uh these are the the things these are
the
environment that that gives the child
the input of the language basically
this is the atmosphere that gives the
chair the child
the input of the language the child
takes
the inputs from that society that
environment and after that what is the
child doing
here the point is that what the child
doing the child
is only taking input from the
surrounding and what is the surrounding
of the child
mother his father his uh
brother his sister his family his uncle
his grandpa his
grandmother and what whoever
around the child talking
even though to him the child is
observing all the phenomena and he
and after observing that phenomena child
develops his only grammar and that is
the
competence of the child that's the
competence of every individual
and and what is the performance when the
child
uses that that acquiring that
phenomena in in concrete form
that is the performance when the child
is using that data
and he arranges the data
and uses that data
while speaking whatever language the
child is
acquiring that is the
core point how the child is acquiring
the language
i have told you that how
a child acquires language for acquiring
he does not know all the things but he
has one thing that is in and that has
installed in either our mind
and that is the one portion of his or
her mind
and it operates the acquiring of the
language
this is the whole process that involved
during the acquiring
language in the natural way whatever the
language we are acquiring
in that acquiring a language the only
one process that
has been followed in every individual
mind that is whatever i am starting to
use
that in jumps in term that is every
individual
every every human being when he or she
is born
he is endowed with one particular
thing that chomsky called the genetic
this is the part of the human genetic
makeup
that ensure the learning
acquiring of language
and the child acquired the language he
only
takes the data from his
or her surroundings and he after taking
data he observes
what the data is what type of data
is being provided to the child he only
observed the data
and then he uses that data and
and his mind process that data after
that one stage comes when the child
became
the fluent speaker of one particular
language
and that particular language will be
called
a language that will be our language and
before
acquiring that there is no our language
there is only language what you
call that this is the universal grammar
