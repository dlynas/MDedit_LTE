The Stag Hunt Game and Minimax Explained
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQHPDLfbIK4)

## Transcript:
all right in this video i'm going over
minimax
and the stag hunt game in game theory
and there's kind of a relationship
between these two that i'd like to
at least tell a story about so just to
give you a preview of where we're going
minimax is going to be a different
strategy for solving these games
depending on sort of a person's approach
so you might imagine
some people are really strategic and are
going to be thinking ahead
other people might be motivated by by
other factors such as fear
such as worry about different types of
regret
and when you're playing a game with
someone you have to leave open the
option
that they may have a different thought
process
um when they come up with their
strategies then nash equilibrium or then
than you have
and minimax is sort of one of those
thought processes for thinking about
strategic games and it's going to be a
thought process that's going to be more
common among people who are very risk
averse
or who are afraid of the worst possible
outcome
all right so to get there it's helpful
to start with the stag hunt
game from game theory so now we're back
in
classic nash equilibrium mode and the
story here
is you can either collaborate with your
tribe to hunt a stag
or you can go off on your own and hunt
rabbits
and of course you're gonna get more meat
and better meat if you hunt a stag
but if you hunt rabbits you don't have
to worry about other people following
through with a collaboration
so i actually prefer this game to be
framed as group work versus individual
work would you rather have a group
project
that has a higher probability of payoff
or an individual project
where the success or failure is entirely
on your shoulders
so let me just reframe this whole game
okay so here we have if you work
together with your team there's going to
be a higher payout
for teamwork because of course you know
collaborative efforts
have more potential more potential for
specialization more potential for
creative ideas to interact and
so the highest possible payoff here is
is going to be
up in this box and if you actually solve
the nash equilibrium for this particular
game
what you're gonna find is
two nash equilibriums so one nash
equilibrium is
both people work on the team project
together and another nash equilibrium
is each person works separately and of
course
nash equilibrium means if we end up in
this box both players will say
given what the other player said i'm
glad i'm in this box and same up here
but when we look at the two nash
equilibriums we can automatically tell
which one is better so this is
a much better nash equilibrium so you
would think you would always end up
in the teamwork scenario and if both
players are nash equilibrium thinkers
or if we have this repeated game where
we can play until we
end up at this nash equilibrium then
then we're going to end up up here
because nash equilibrium
even if it doesn't happen on any
individual round
as people repeat games they tend toward
the nash equilibrium in the long run
so that is nash equilibrium and um
this is a fairly simple situation but
um what i'd like us to think about is
what if we change the scenario by
looking at the worst um payoff in the
table which is the zeros
right here and what if we changed that
to negative one
did that change the nash equilibrium
well no
as a matter of fact we can change this
to negative 10 and it still will not
change the equilibrium
in fact we can put any negative number
here and it's not going to change the
fact that these are the two nash
equilibriums
at all so let me put a really um low
number in here
okay nash equilibrium has not changed
but does this change how you interact
in this game well okay so we know that
the best possible nash equilibrium is up
here
both players can tell this is up here
however
if for whatever reason your partner um
went with the individual route trying to
achieve this nash equilibrium
you're you're in a really bad spot
so if you're at all worried about your
partner's way of thinking
um changing this sort of off equilibrium
payoff might actually increase the
chances that we end up down here
especially in a world where
people behave sometimes in erratic ways
and people have different
ways of thinking about the game as a
matter of fact
one strategy here would be to think a
lot about what is the worst case
scenario
and just try to avoid the worst case
scenario
possible and that's where we get
minimax so minimax is a different
approach to thinking about these games
where the motivation isn't if i end up
in this place will i have regrets about
what i did
that's the nash equilibrium view the
motivation is instead
what is the worst case that could happen
if i chose each of these options and
looking at those worst possible
scenarios and choosing the best
among them so player one can look at
these options and say okay
if i choose team the worst that could
happen
is i'd get negative 100.
if i chose the individual pro uh problem
the worst that could happen is that i
would get one
and in this case the minimax thinker is
going to just look at those two what are
the worst case scenarios and say okay
this is the least bad worst case
scenario
so i'm going to choose individual and of
course
that player 2 is going to do the same
thing as well player 2 says if i choose
team
the worst that could happen is that i
get negative 100
if i choose individual the worst that
could happen is that i get one
so um they're going to recognize that
the one is the best
of the worst scenarios so this is why
this is called
minimax it's of the minimum options
the worst case options which are down
here
what is the best possible of those worst
case options
and i mean you can think about people
who might approach life this way
they're sort of constantly going through
the worst case scenario under any
different decision tree they look at
and they're so afraid of all those worst
case scenarios that and they're so
focused on those worst case scenarios
that they just choose the best option
among the worst ones
so this is a different strategic
approach it's not a wrong strategic
approach it's just
um one way of thinking that different
types of behavioral
people are gonna take so let's actually
look at a more
at a bigger tree a bigger game and see
how this works in that scenario
okay so here we have two players playing
a game they each have five strategies
run hide play dead fight or freeze and i
just sort of filled the table in with
some
payoffs and the approach here is for
each player to look at
each of their their own strategies and
to say
if i play this strategy what is the
worst possible thing that could happen
so if i run
they focus on what is the worst of the
outcomes so
eight nine five four and eight the worst
outcome in this thing is the four so i'm
going to just put four
over here and then they go through the
rest of their options in the same way if
i
hide what is the worst thing that could
happen
and it looks like the worst is going to
be the one
that i only get one same with the rest
of the strategies
so for player one we see that the
the worst possible thing that could
happen under each possible strategy is
listed over here
and we see of these minimums
the maximum of the minimums so second
part is max
is the four so their their minimax
um choice is going to be to run
and then we're gonna do the same thing
for player two
so for player two player two says if i
run
what's the worst i could possibly get
and they look at all their payoffs the
player two payoffs
if they run and the worst is two
they ask themselves if i hide what's the
worst that could happen
and that's to get zero
and so for player two there's actually
here are the minimums for player two and
there's actually
two possible minimax solutions here
um the best the maximum of the worst
case scenarios is two
and there's two strategies run or play
dead that lead to that payoff of two
so the minimax solution to this game
there are actually two minimax solutions
one is for player one to go run player
two to go run
and then the other is for player one to
go run and player two to
play dead so let me write that out
so the two minimax solutions here are
run run
and run play dead and that's simply
based on each player
overthinking how how fearful the worst
case scenario for each of these
strategies is
and making the decision based on the
best of those worst case scenarios
that's how minimax works that's how to
think about it it's a very useful
concept and you might think about like
what types of people
are more likely to use a minimax
strategy as opposed to
a nash equilibrium strategy or some
other strategy
and it's going to be people who are
risk-averse people who think a lot about
the worst case scenarios
