Black Women Writers at Work

## Transcript:
hi good evening Imani how are you I'm
good how are you very very good I'm
really excited to talk with you black
about black women writers at work I know
it's a book that both of us really
really enjoy and are really excited
about this
um reprint that's finally back in print
after so many years from Haymarket books
and I am
you know part of what I love about the
timing of this is that we're just last
week you published that gorgeous piece
about The Sisterhood oh thank you
writing group
um and you know I think
in some ways because both of us are
attentive both to sort of the legacies
of black women's writing and also black
women's history that the sort of the
combination of those two things are so
present in this book They're writers who
are historically concerned and it's now
also a historical artifact so
um yeah I'm really excited to be in
conversation with you yes I wanted to
start with asking when did you first
encounter this book
you know I have such a good question and
I don't remember I mean it was a long
time ago I am I didn't know Claudia Tate
well but I knew her some
um from sort of like the world of black
women Scholars of the 19th century and I
was a 19th century person
um when I came through graduate school
and so I you know read all of her I mean
I I read her her book about 19th century
um literature domestic allegories of
political desire really really carefully
as a scholar and then this book
in the 90s right but this book was was
the book that was sort of more
um the heart book you know and the sense
that this is really about
I felt like a testimony to
what it meant to sort of live in the
world of of writing and ideas and um
you know
while holding like close to the truth of
the truth of what it means to be a black
woman
um
what about you
um I heard about this book from a
fantastic
um writer named Jamie Hatley
um who's a really beautiful fiction
writer and also writes for I believe she
writes for p-valley now
um and uh I had gone to a writing
conference with her I went to breadloaf
with her which is um If you're sort of
unfamiliar with that space it's sort of
like a like a very I don't know that
they would think of it this of
themselves but people perceive it as a
very sort of like gatekeeping space for
literary writers and we were there and
um bread both I think at that time when
we were there was sort of going through
a transition of figuring out how to
become a space for all writers including
black writers
um and so while we were there we talked
a lot about all this stuff and she was
really sort of like passing this I don't
know if it was while we were there maybe
afterwards she was like you need to read
this book you have to get this book
um because at that time this was
probably like I don't know 13 years ago
now
um survival conversations that are
happening right now in literary circles
about like craft in terms of writing
about the interiority of black women
like those conversations were happening
but they were happening
um interpersonal in between ourselves
and um there was like a real hunger for
books that spoke to that craft question
um because I think a lot of us were
experiencing being in either grad school
or in writing groups
um uh like predominantly white writing
spaces and oftentimes the work of black
writers sort of being assigned Tony
Morrison has a great phrase where he
talks about it being like a sign is like
broccoli like here's the thing here take
it like just read it
we're not going to look at
our we're not going
to look part of a longer tradition it's
just here it is drop down the syllabus
for you
um we're only going to talk about it in
a certain way and we're not going to
talk about like the artistic choices
that this person made and that this
person was an actual artist forming it
and sort of like the subtext being like
when black women write it's somehow
coming from this space that is not
mediated through craft or history or
conversation or anything it's just sort
of like drop down like an alien
um and knowing that that's that couldn't
possibly be true we were sort of like
all really hungry to find these texts
where we could trace the actual craft
that these women were doing like how
these women thought about language how
they thought about storytelling how they
thought about plot
um how they thought about and then you
know Claudia Tate is such a brilliant
interviewer she's also asking about how
do you think about writing community and
this question that is Paramount to Black
writers of all genders is like what do
you owe or what are your community ties
and your work
um and she asks them that very plainly
and people and they and they answer in
sort of like very great details so all
those questions that were animating so
much of our work and that um
I think if you're we are continual
questions that come up whenever you're
writing something but definitely when
you first like are tackling a project
feel really pressing
um felt like there were guide posts in
this book to sort of at least spur
thinking about it and for me this book
has been so important because I think
another thing that often happens
um if you are a black especially black
fiction writing
um is it's really easy to fall into the
fallacy that like because you haven't
seen it before no other black writer
before you has been thinking or feeling
or or talking about these things
um and the larger I think public
publishing World actually rewards you
for saying that right like it's easier
to believe that than to sort of say like
people have been talking about this for
years and years and have been actively
shut out of like that discussion going
further
um so for me this book is actually
really valuable because it it reminds me
that so many of the questions and
debates that we have have currently are
part of an ongoing conversation that's
been going on for at this point like
almost 200 years in terms of black
writers in this country
um and that's actually something really
rich that this is a verdant ground where
you can have a 200 year long
conversation about these questions yeah
um so yeah that's where I found the book
and and when I came to the book it had
been out of print for many years so you
had to buy like really search for it I
think a copy cost like 45 or something
like 50 bucks sometimes 75 really took a
lot to find them
um which is another reason why I'm so
happy that this is in print again and
like accessible in a really real way for
people I think that's oh it's so
absolutely true
um is there do you have a um
one or two essays that particularly
resonate for you in the volume or
interviews conversations yeah I mean I'm
super basic so the ones that I always
come back to are the Tony's um Tony
Morrison and Tony caribambara
um and uh the Toni Morrison one in
particular like I I come back to the
passage where she talks about the type
of language that she's using because I
feel like that's really important for me
as well she talks about
she calls it parabolic language so she's
talking about
um choosing to use words that have
fallen into cliche words that we assume
we all know the meaning of like words
like love or peace or happiness and that
her job as a writer is to place
construct a sentence and place that word
in the sentence in a way that the reader
is tripped up and finds that word Anew
and that that word they're forced to
reconsider how they would Define that
word
and so for me that's like super when I
first read that as a like writer
starting out that was just revelatory
you know because it's like what do I
actually have to work with like you know
there's a school of writing fiction
where you sort of like go for the most
obscure most crazy phrase possible and
that can be very beautiful you know like
when you're reading a book and you're
like I have to stop and like look up a
word and kind of like figure it out but
it made me sort of rethink like what I'm
actually doing on the page to set a
challenge like that to set a challenge
like that around a word that people
assume they know the meaning of
um and having and writing in such a way
that would force not force but invite a
reader to rethink the definition
I just really love that yeah it's
gorgeous I mean it's interesting because
one of the going back to something you
said just a few moments ago
is this thing for me this this
formulation that Nikki Giovanni has
about experience and black writers and
the question of craft and she has this
um paragraph on page 94 where she says
of the new edition she says you know
about
the assumption that black women's
writing and bright writing generally
comes from experience and she says you
know into Zac is naked on that stage but
not because she's writing from
experience I resent people who say
writers right from experience writers
don't write from experience though many
are hesitant to admit that they don't I
want to be very clear about this if you
wrote from experience you'd get maybe
one book maybe three poems writers right
from empathy we actually made anything
written when we consider it an
experience right because if it's in
someone else's experience we don't have
to take it seriously we really don't we
could say that's what happened to him to
sake it isn't that a shame
not that's no that's not what happened
exactly I don't know whether it did or
it didn't that's not the point the point
is that's what happened that's what
still happens and I
and I
the for me this resonates so deeply
because there's a way in which what
you're describing the way that people
reduce black women's writing so often to
this sort of representation of
experience as opposed to a grappling
with the truth
um of the world the truth of history and
the truth right
um is both both a kind of
um
both both find its way into craft but
also into the sort of philosophical
disposition relationship to the to the
work of writing and I think you know
it's one of these many gems throughout
the book where
there isn't this
avoidance of the embodied experience of
being black women
and there's also a refusal of a
reduction of that experience to
something less than profound less than
you know complex less than
um
uh you know Nuance I mean there there's
also you know I love this sort of
movement between
the particularities of life right so
they talk you know and this serious work
of writing so also in the Tony essay
when they say you know where do you find
time and she was like well you know I
don't go out that much I don't do a lot
of stuff and I was like oh okay that's
you know sort of these moments where
they or or there's a moment when
um Maya Angelou's is like you know oh
you know give up this posture of like oh
this long-suffering writer you know you
just you do everything in life you make
love you you know you cook some food you
take care of kids and you write right
and I think
there's that like the very real
experience and then there's also these
serious rigorous thoughts about
about craft about ideas yeah you know
yeah yeah I mean I think it's it's such
a um
I just really appreciate how much
Claudia Tate
um you can see sort of like
I guess I think about it a lot because I
do a lot of um interviews in in my day
job and I think about what a difficult
um job it is often because you are
having to like really listen to
um
understand the conversation and to let
the conversation go where you discover
something new instead of like just
following a particular agenda or what
you thought when you were coming into
the conversation so
I'm just also always when I read it I'm
in awe of Tate's sort of like
questioning and her following the intent
of each of these authors
um and the space that she makes for each
of these authors to
um really like Define themselves I guess
in a way that sometimes when you're
reading interviews with artists they're
not always allowed to because the
interviewer sort of has like their own
agenda or their own idea of what the
work is and I think that's sort of like
another like on a sort of like meta
level of what this book is too I think
it's a really wonderful piece if you are
interested in critical writing as
particularly like Arts critical writing
it's a wonderful
um uh template and understanding of like
how to do that work how to be an art
critic how to have those conversations
about art and creation
um that I think it's I think it's a
dying art I don't think a lot of people
know how to do it anymore so it's really
fascinating to me to see
Tate's questions on the page and how she
shapes the interview sort of in in
response to what people are saying to
her do you think that that's that I
think that you're you're absolutely
right and I I hadn't actually thought
about that
um
would you think that it's because it's a
kind of
respect for the writers that allows that
I'm just I'm I'm really intrigued by
what it is that allows that that Tate
sort of had in terms of her disposition
to allow the space to open but also that
they trust her yeah
you know I think I think it's probably
to me like off the top of my head I
think it's her training as a literary
scholar and I think it's um when you are
a literary scholar you're working
literally with what's on the page you
can't really deviate from that right
like you have to work with the words on
the page you can't work on like what you
assume somebody says or like The Vibes
of the room or like what you hoped
somebody meant by something like you're
working literally with what the words on
the page are and what those words those
people chose not what you hope they
chose or what you think they should have
chosen and said or anything like that so
I think because she's coming from that
perspective whereas I think
I don't know I think we're in a current
moment where we're kind of at a crisis
in terms of how to talk about art and
that it's oftentimes people are talking
about what they wish something could
have been or who they wish an artist
could have been and not actually who
that person was or what they actually
produced
um and you know sometimes it's pillaring
people from the past for not doing the
things that we really wish they had were
doing right now
um and other times it's like grossly
misreading an act or event or action in
an artist's life because you want it to
have been meant something that maybe it
did not mean to the artist at all right
and I think that's absolutely right and
it even
and it extends to a refusal to take a
work on its own
terms right I mean that's the thing that
you know they have said like I'm really
interested in um
you know there's people who she who
she's interviewing who are in some ways
not maybe not necessarily at odds but
like the Margaret Walker interview and
the Gwendolyn Brooks interview well
Margaret Walker is clearly was
experiencing some wounds about feeling
overlooked in relationship to Gwendolyn
Brooks
and and and and lots of folks I mean you
know I think that in some ways that's a
key part of her story and I'm really
looking forward to a biography of her
that should be coming out later this
year next year sure of Gwendolyn Brooks
or Margaret Walker Walker okay
uh uh by Mary from Miriam mcram
um but
there's a way that that even that could
have been played very differently by
someone who wasn't inclined in the way
that you described to paying attention
to what's on the page to asking the
questions about the particular what the
particular artist was sort of putting
together and what and and you can see
that there's a kind of that they're
contemporaries and they're trying to do
some similar things with form and I and
and the politics of Blackness and have
similar intellectual genealogies in our
to in in Crossroads and and you know
comparable
um communities and that's one kind of
relationship and then you have you know
Tony Morrison and Tony Cade who have a
very intimate relate listen you see
these different kinds of
relationships between the you know these
sort of these in between the
conversations
um
I don't know that I think actually is a
testament to the to the point that
you're making like to take the take the
writers take their work
on their terms as opposed to
well don't you think you know because
you could have easily intervened and
said well do you think that you know
Gwendolyn Brooks was competing with you
or you know she said you know I mean
that's not the posture they sort of
stand as these kind of you know pieces
in conversation but not in contestation
I guess I like that yeah yeah I'm
thinking of the Alexis Devoe
um if I'm pronouncing your last name
correctly interview as well where she
says something really revealing because
because she is a black lesbian writing
about black lesbian experiences and she
talks about how it's easier to place her
work with non-black journals that black
journals at the time when she's trying
to place work
um talk about her work like undermining
the black family like this larger
political project which has like a whole
other thing going on there and and
Claudia Tate sort of like allows her to
just like put all of that out there that
that like very painful
trying to like parse through thing
um and doesn't necessarily like comment
on it but allows her enough space to
like give I think like a pretty good
context of like why in that particular
moment that would have been happening
and I think about that moment a lot too
because it's so
fascinating and interesting to me and
for me checks I think some like rose
colored glasses on some sort of like
Black Arts past that I think oftentimes
I know if you didn't live through it you
can often feel about that time because
so much was done there was so much
energy all these sorts of things but
also it was a political project which
means some stories were adamantly like
not allowed in and some stories were
more allowed in you know and so like
that those sorts of things complicate I
think too what what
um particularly uh I think is a true a
trap for
um marginalized writers is to look at
communities in the past and really sort
of like
um idolize them and assume that there
weren't those divisions really like
rough divisions and revisions
um that did exist then and and I think
having to Grapple with that helps us
trying to figure out like in our current
moment how to do that as well
especially since so many and those those
even that that's a question that is
still
I mean it's still I mean I mean it's
less crudely stated yeah but but the
kind of you know the right queer
antagonism is still a recurrent theme
and no
um black creative communities without
question yeah yeah
you know I so
I mean sort of related I was I've been
thinking a lot about how they talk many
of the writers talk about gender
and black communities and it's really
fascinating too because it it also is
really
the kind of when it I think it's the
newest no one's conversation but people
don't have the same sort of
interpretations like I there's this and
I could go to the text but there's this
sort of
several of them write about okay so
often black male writers they're writing
about a kind of confrontation with
Society like this sort of structural
forces and writers are more likely to be
writing about kind of
the interior and you know that which is
sort of like long tradition but then you
know the distinction that Morrison is
sort of doing both at once and then
Sonia Sanchez chimes in and says well
but if you talk about the poets there
isn't that clear gender distinction
right yeah just it and so even that
conversation
pushes against I think our tendency to
read
like sensibilities of a time period in a
simplistic way see that so much like
sort of people did this in this period
people thought this and this and there's
actually no there's actually a wide
range of the ways that people were
experiencing
um even in the midst of the sort of
blooming of black women's literature
what people were experiencing it as
substantively buried yeah you were
talking a little bit about like the
interiority of how much
um sort of black women fiction writers
in particulars like interested
interiority and um this morning for
another project I interviewed
um Colleen Smith who made the movie dry
long so that came out in the 90s yeah
and it's getting a restoration by
Criterion it looks gorgeous
um I hope it's gonna come out soon
um but I was interviewing her this
morning and she and and if you don't
know that movie it's it came out in 1998
um it had a sort of like was really
praised when it first came out but of
course it's like in this period of time
where distribution is really difficult
there's no streaming
um she worked really hard to get it onto
video cassette and then a year later
DVDs were all the rage so it like never
really took off but it's about a young
um black girl in Oakland in the late 90s
and she's doing this art project where
she's taking Polaroids of the black man
in her neighborhood because she's
worried that they are going to go and
extinct because they're sort of like
they're they're living under this sort
of like oppressive violence there's
there's all these uh killings happening
around them
um and it's beautifully shot absolutely
beautiful shot anyways
um and and the movie itself this is
where it comes with this the movie
itself the plot is a mixed one of the
reasons why um she's had trouble finding
distribution is because the plot is a
mixture of like a coming-of-age story
but it's also a thriller but it's also
like a deeply strange art piece like
it's a it's a mixture of all things at
once and she was talking about how much
she relates that to
um black women's interiority does not
follow these sort of like storytelling
um conventions that much of art does and
so that's like an additional
um like way that your work can often be
misinterpreted because
our narratives often don't fit any sorts
of um like like boxes
um and or or an amalgamation of all of
that and so oftentimes they're sort of
misread or just like not
able to be categorized and because it's
not able to be categorized of course it
can't be sold and so then it doesn't
really have like a larger sort of like
value quote unquote and like this art
Marketplace that we have
um but that's sort of like a Hallmark of
many people's ways of mining
um black women's interiority is like
this this inability to be within a
particular category and I just her words
really because I think a lot too about
how many of these artists in this book
worked across disciplines you had
um poets who felt really comfortable
attempting to write novels you had
novelists you had like Tony capabara is
an excellent example a novelist who also
became a filmmaker and like felt really
comfortable switching mediums this
interdisciplinary way of
um attacking the artistic impulse that I
think
feeds into attempting to explain the
interiority of black Womanhood in like a
really specific way that I think all of
these writers are getting at at least a
little bit in these in these
conversations I think that's so true and
it for me I think this it just I just
sort of realize this but I think this
book is a part of
you know for me so much of my sense of
life mission is to insist that people
understand
black women artists are also
intellectuals and that you know so often
there's that sort of division into
you know genre or sort of category
actually serves to
um erase a large part of the
intellectual work that goes behind
artistic production and the way in which
people move across on these categories
and I and it also made me think about
and I'm just thinking about this mostly
for the um
for the people watching because it just
occurred to me that dry long so is a
word that's actually no longer in
popular parlance and you know that it's
it it is a word you know a word from
black English that is sort of like you
know how Gwendolyn Brooks said living in
the along it's like sort of the everyday
like the way you go and that is the way
you know you live
these questions right and they're part
of the everyday and you move and you
move through them and that's that's a
piece of why
you know you look for different modes of
expression right and this is
um you know there's all these Testaments
to them and then it's not just different
looking for different modes of
expression and wanting them to get them
out but actually thinking deeply and
working on making
these sort of artifacts or pieces that
become these vehicles for us to you know
contemplate the questions or the ideas
in the long term
yeah when it's so funny because when I
when I first was reading about the that
movie I was like I know that word
and growing up I know that word
um and then realizing like I hadn't
heard that word in like 20 years I was
like
it's like that it's like you know like
britches people don't say britches
anyway yeah
(Laughter)
we can still say britches in my house
but yeah slacks oh my God tennis shoes
oh Fashion words yeah but
um I'm wondering if you can talk uh I
guess a little bit about
um if there's any writers who are
included in here who you feel like are
are ripe for a rediscovery like there's
the the names that I think everybody
would recognize on the front like Audrey
Lord and all these people but are there
any sort of like overlooked writers who
are excited for people to discover when
they read this book
um well always Gail Jones because this
is obsessed with Gail Jones and
um
and even you know and and I wrote a
profile of her but I still feel as
though
because so much of her work was
published in relatively obscure small
you know so she has novels that are out
and then Paul Morris just came out and
um
oh gosh I'm sorry I I my brain I keep
losing language because I just two two
months out of covet
um but but there's all these beautiful
short pieces that are um that are right
for people to sort of ReDiscover and her
um in in the interview her real sort of
deliberateness and how she talks about
the relationship between everyday
language and craft is really important
especially because you know so
with Jones people like you know
Tony Morrison and June Jordan and Maya
Angelou were all like show because she's
transforming black women's writing and
but but really unless you're in
um an academic program where you're
studying black women's literature or
African-American literature in the late
20s you're not likely to encounter Gail
Jones frankly I mean she's largely as
sort of an act a writer that you
encounter in formal education maybe
that's
so I so I'm thinking that maybe people
will be intrigued by this discussion and
sort of be you know want to read more of
her work and you know Chase down her her
um her short fiction her critical essays
she was also a scholar like person like
um so many of the others here and then
also Shirley and Williams who I think
ensures the final
um interview and I
I don't know if I've sort of even have
read anything that talks about Shirley
Ann Williams work in the past 20 years
and she wrote you know Dessa Rose which
I think is one of the most powerful you
know novels about
um about slavery but also about sort of
the question of love in the context of
being enslaved and how to pursue how
people pursued it and how people created
conceptions of the self and black women
in particular in that and so
yeah I think both of them but really
everybody I I mean even
I think there's a
the re-encounter that with Audrey Lord
that can happen through this interview
because she's sort of the mimified yeah
drought and this isn't you know she's
really reflective here
um
uh
uh Gwendolyn Brooks who is so
historically significant but who I think
is sort of fallen out of Faith but
there's a great new documentary about
Nikki Giovanni that I think this
interview is like a great entry point to
wanting to see that too which is oh
wonderful I didn't know there was a doc
by about her yeah
yeah yeah
that's great
um
I guess oh and I also wanted to say to
you if you are watching we please
questions from the audience as well we
would love to hear from or what you're
thinking or that sort of thing as well
um
let's see
I I can ask you a question I was asking
a lot
um so
um
I'm curious about their sort of a
um
I guess this this question about
politics and writing that appears in
multiple places
um here and even
um like Sonia Sanchez has this form has
this part where she talks about
um you know there was this decision by
some people in African-American studies
to distance themselves from the movement
and I'm wondering if you think that that
it all resonates with questions today
about the literary and the political
um and sort of if there's something for
us to learn from them about you know how
to navigate about those questions right
of both of both art but also the urgency
of the moment in some ways we are in a
comparably urgent moment although a
distinct one you know yeah I mean I I
think for me it's a reminder that like
the idea that you as a black woman
writer are inherently that your work is
inherently Act activism is is a fallacy
I think that is very easy to fall into
and I think these writers here because
of the particular political moment that
they were writing in and the particular
circles that they ran in like understood
perhaps better than many of us do
the distinctions between active actual
aims
um and I think
I don't know I feel like it's very easy
to sort of slip into I'm always a
pessimist so I I feel like it's really
easy for writers today to slip into sort
of like self-congratulatory like to
write is enough or somehow to write is
doing the work when it's not like
they're not the same thing at all like
um what you're doing as a as a writer
and the
um intricacies of of making a book and
Publishing it
have very have nothing to do with um
political organizing work and they're
not the same thing and and
um and they don't have the same impact
and that is okay
um and the sooner that we can like
understand that and stop subbing one in
for the other like the further we can
get
um because I think
I think it's really it stops the car
right now we're in a really weird place
where
um sort of like elevating the writer as
somehow political actually like stops
the political conversation in like a
really weird way where it's like it's
just enough to write the screenplay or
you know write a poem about this
um and it's it is not it never will be
I mean it's interesting because in some
ways because because Sanchez raises this
point why she's saying well some of how
the writers who get elevated
writers get elevated in order to detract
attention away from Liberation movement
so she identifies Liberation movements
all over the world and in some ways
that's
still true right so that if you know if
we as writers say okay well we are this
is our activism and then there people
are talking about us as writers and this
is our activism while there's a whole
bunch there's a lot of activism that's
actually it actually takes up space yeah
and it's collaborative in a way that
writing never is
writing is is intensely about the cell
yes
um and activism cannot be by definition
intensely
you know actually kind of you know you
have to mute the self in order in
community with people who may think very
differently but you're but you're trying
to get free yeah
um collectively absolutely yeah should
we take some of these questions yeah
um somebody asked can you elaborate more
on this crisis of literary criticism is
this a crisis in the academy or literary
criticism in current literary magazines
or larger online cultural magazines
um I was talking more about larger like
um I guess like mainstream publication
criticism I think
um part of that is just the death of
newspapers we actually don't have book
reviews really anymore
um and because of the politics of book
reviews most of the books that are
getting reviewed there you get a
description of what the plot is and then
you either get this was fantastic and
you know the second coming of James
Baldwin
um or very very rarely you will get like
a really mean pan but um there's nothing
in between because people will click on
either one of those extremes but people
will not click on um let me do like a
measured understanding of the themes of
this and taking it on the writer's um
uh terms and
um threading it into a larger history of
what it may be in conversation with
that's not going to get a click so
um because those are the economics under
which literary criticism is currently
being produced
um we don't have those sort of like or
the spaces to have those longer
discussions about literature are very
rare and we don't you know alternative
newspapers died 20 15 or 20 years ago it
used to be that you had something like
the Village Voice or
um you know and other other of these
spaces um Regional and alternative
newspapers where people would have these
discussions on pages over years you know
people be writing thing calm dueling
calms back and forth working this out
maybe not working this out but having a
a public conversation
um and that simply doesn't exist anymore
so
um I think we lose we've we're we've
lost a lot of that in our current space
this is where we could have that are
engineered by people who are not writers
who are you know um you know like Tech
enthusiasts and they have created those
spaces to reward
um sort of like the easiest simplest
most enthusiastic or most revolted take
on a piece of work which means the
actual work of criticism
um
It suffers imagine it I think that's
right and I just something that you said
which just I was like you know ding ding
I wanted to like ring a bell is the the
sort of the second coming of James
Baldwin formulation right but it's also
this that it's like every writer if
they're you know it's either this is
Tony Morrison or this is James Baldwin
and part of what's so I think important
about the reissue of this book is that
it's a reminder that
they had contemporaries many stop right
like that it's not obviously people
should be treated as
you know writers on their own terms
doing their doing what they're doing but
also that there's always been this kind
of robust
black intellectual artistic Community
that's operating with distinctions that
need to be recognized in the genealogy
of how we write about people right like
so one of the things I do when I
interview I'm almost almost always
asking people like who are the writers
who have shaped and influenced you and
invariably they include people who don't
get cited all the time in the major
Publications yeah
100 and and like you know I was a huge
nerd as a teenager so that's actually
how I I learned about writing was
reading reading the Village Voice
reading
um the Boston Arts papers reading I mean
Salon was when it was like a literary
site way back in the in the late 90s I
was the nerd who read that and I and I
bought their they they put out like a um
one of those like it was like an
encyclopedia of all living writers or
something I think came out like 1990 or
19. I got it in high school and I would
just go through there and just read all
of the writer's side and it was famous
people like Salman Rushdie and then it
was like lesser known writers or
whatever and it was an infographic you
know totally according to the taste of
whoever the salon editor was so like a
little bit wonky but whatever it was a
place to start and it's like a place to
understand and just to understand that
you could follow connections from
artists to writers and also to just make
myself this reading list and I think
those spaces
I don't know that they're more difficult
to find but I think there's more
difficult but I don't think they don't
exist but I think it's just a little bit
more difficult to
um find those spaces and definitely if
you don't already know that they exist
it's it's like that much harder to get
them because what used to happen was
you're walking home from school and you
pass a you know newspaper box and you're
waiting for the train and you just grab
it to read it that doesn't happen when
your algorithm is a for you page that
has already decided everything that you
may possibly be interested in you know
what I mean so absolutely and it's so
funny you as you said that I always
think I just remembered the first piece
because my first book was about hip-hop
the first piece of hip-hop criticism I
ever read was in the Village Voice yeah
15 years old and I was like oh
you can write about this yeah yeah I
mean that was
that was it yeah
yeah
um this question is from
um oh wait okay uh let's see
Janine de Novis asks as black women
writing today what does the community of
black women writing ones in this book
and other books and ones in real life
afford you or offer you oh
gosh I mean I I
um
it's for lack of a better word for me
it's it's breath
um
in the sense that
um
no it's a sort of the the
there is something about
and this sounds really basic but I think
it's huge about being recognized fully
as a human being and as a as that that
as a precondition to actually
for me to be in in writing Community
um and that that is not exclusively but
often
much more accessible in the community of
black women writers right that so that
we don't come to the conversation and
this is evidence in the book assuming
that we have
the same priorities are trying to tell
the same story are assumed to have a
kind of two-dimension like the fullness
of
what you're undertaking is one piece and
then the other piece is like and also
the constraints right the the
limitations the the responsibilities the
you know the ailments all of those
things simultaneously I like being in a
community of of writers who I who I
don't have to worry about whether they
presume that there is some kind of
deficiency inside me or that they know
my story and so that's part of what and
you know so I think
it's evident in the book but also in how
I who I talk to as I'm as I'm writing
yeah
what about it
um I think for me it's like twofold it's
it's a community of which to ask craft
questions to around
um to understand the limits some places
where my own writing or understanding
might be responding to a white gays or
white criticism or internalized
anti-blackness all those things it's
just good to have somebody to check that
against because we all have that inside
us we you know live in this larger
culture that tells us these things and
you and even if you read and surround
yourself with all these sorts of things
like those things come up oh wow yeah so
it's really great to just have other
people to read and to talk about those
things with and then like in the
business of being a writer
um you know someone to just be able to
understand some of these like you know
a larger I guess we would call them
today like microaggressions but also
just like what it is to make a living
doing this thing that it can be
difficult and can be really hard
um and then that other question that is
like what what do you owe to your
community which is a question that is
I think it's actually a real privilege
that we as black writers get asked that
question much more than
um white Writers Do I have to think it's
because I think it's a fantastic I think
everybody should be asked that question
actually personally I don't see it as in
like an insult I think that's a
fantastic question to ask any writer and
I wish more white writers were asked
that question
um but uh I think it's and I think it's
a question that for for whoever you are
isn't has an evolving answer
um and it's a question to like
continually check into and it doesn't
always dictate what you're writing it's
not always the like moral compass or
guiding North Star but it is a useful
question to have in your pack of
questions to ask yourself as a person in
the world and as a writer
um so yeah I think having that um
conversation is is really helpful
something that you that you just said
made me think of this um question that
I'm always or or like talking point that
is always frustrating me that really you
know that what you said just resonates
deeply with this so sometimes I'll
people ask questions and they will say
it's usually
white people who will say this like I
know this wasn't written for me but and
I'm always like I why do you think like
the writing is for everybody right the
concerns may be particularly with
Blackness but it's not that I'm not
writing for you but I am writing
right with a particular set of
experiences and history that animates
the
um that animates the work and I I do
think that you know what you just said
about sort of checking in with
community of writers but also thinking
about responsibility right writing
so when I say like writing for black
people doesn't mean only writing to
black people but actually Four like
black people in terms of the larger set
of questions of community and and
responsibility
um yeah yeah because like for me the
question of like your responsibility to
your community is like another way of
thinking like what are the what are the
things in my community that I want to
write about that I'm noticing are are a
thing which my community is struggling
with thinking about testing whatever and
that is a question that no matter what
your race or gender sexual orientation
is going to be pretty pressing if you're
an artist because like that's the bread
and butter of what you're doing as an
artist you're trying to see the things
that other people won't see can't see
refuse to see don't want to talk about
so I that's how I find that's how I
interpret that question and that's how I
find that question
um really helpful someone I just want to
address really quickly someone asked
about resources if you are a
black fiction screenwriter outside of
formal education
um if you can through your library or
um through your University if you can
get a
subscription to both canopy and to
Criterion Collection Criterion
Collection actually is like working
really hard to get a lot of black
Independent films on onto their both
shorts and feature length and from
across the world
um if you can follow Ashley Clark on
Twitter and I think he has a sub stack
too he works for Criterion he writes
extensively about black film Criterion
also puts out regularly essays from
people on different black films they're
like a fantastic research resource I'm
not like a shield for them I promise but
they they I do want to give them
Pro what they've tried to do they heard
the criticism that their catalog was
very very white and like they are
actively trying to
um really find like fantastic films like
just a whole They just added more to
their after futurism collection they
just really think wonderful thing around
jazz on film
um they have a great hip-hop collection
hip-hop film collection just like
they're a great resource and most
libraries most University libraries you
can get them that into there somehow get
that email we'll have a subscription to
them
hmm
um yeah I asks if writing is to both
labor and craft
what conditions can we create or call in
to reinforce the ability of writers to
thrive and produce work
that is really
um
for me sort of a drum that I think I'm
going to beat for the rest of my life
because I have never gone on I've never
been on a writer's retreat
I like a sort of formal one is that it
is really important to create
child-friendly writing retreat
yes
you know just it's like a lot of people
people don't
a life condition where they can go away
for three weeks without kids and it is
such
a kind of
it's not just I mean it's it's gendered
but it's also classed
um this idea you know sort of think
about experimentally how do you have can
you have spaces where there's Community
chalk or you have spaces where people go
away for a succession of weekends they
think things like that and funding
um
and not just funding when you're at the
point
at the precipice of sort of some kind of
recognition but actually funding for
people to be experimental to explore to
try different forms I for me that would
have such a huge impact on
um on the world of writing and art in
general if there was just more more
space for and Community you know
community space right Open studio craft
writing spaces on weekends where
everybody can just be there and there's
you know people can use computers and
there's canvases and the kids can run
around and there's food like those kind
of spaces which I feel like were sort of
imagined and hoped for
that did not for a previous you know for
previous generations that we either have
not sustained or not been able to create
those are the kind of things I think we
really do need
yeah 100 and I'll just go along with
that in addition to like having those
spaces I don't luckily I think
um places have stopped asking for this
as much because I think during the
pandemic people said it was too much but
um the idea especially as as black
artists oftentimes fellowships for us
are attached to community work or to
teaching work
um and oftentimes you're asked to sort
of like do this really intense Community
work that leaves no time for your own
creative work and you're essentially
just like a teaching artist being
brought in and and that model can kind
of work maybe for visual artists maybe
for a spoken word it does not work for
um like fiction writers it does not work
really for poets it does not really work
for
um Scholars
um doing a teaching workshops is its own
skill set that not every writer has and
not every writer should have and
oftentimes especially when you're a
black writer the assumption is that you
can come in and like teach a writing
Workshop to five-year-olds I've done
that I enjoy doing that I'm good at that
but that's because I've done that since
I was like 15 years old so I've been I
only have like 25 years of training
that's why I'm able to do that but if
you are do not have that and are not
inclined to do that you shouldn't be
asked to do that to get a 5 000 Grant to
be able to do your work so I'm happy to
see like the trend in literary circles
there's people are starting to like
understand that and decouple from that
and we just need to keep that energy
going because I I it's really I I see it
all the time where they're like here's
this grant you're like great and it's
like you're agreeing to teach for 35
hours like crazy like whatever
yeah
um can we at this question that that
Janika asked about the relation the
interdisciplinary impulse or she asked
you spoke about the interdisciplinary
impulse I'm deeply interested in the
relationship between black women writers
and visual artists are there any visual
artists that inspire you and I will just
say
um both Leslie tsar and Sonya Clark in
recent years have been deeply
inspirational to me in terms of thinking
about gender and embodiment and history
and the relationship between
are like our our body how our bodies
exist in the world and have moved
through time and I and and ideas so I
visual artists and also um Twain Ogio
odutola like there's a there's a lot of
artificial artists who provide direct
inspiration to me yeah 100 uh Faith
wrangled uh Carrie James Marshall
um so many visual artists and that is I
I will say if you are a writer in here
and you're like
at a stop for inspiration or you need
something to like reset your mind
familiarizing yourself with that work by
um you know black visual artists is so
key so important I can't tell you the
number of times where I'll be stuck with
a scene and then I see like a Carrie
James Marshall image or another image
and it just makes me rethink things or
feel like I can sort of like get some so
I following all of that is like part of
my artistic practice and I think is like
a really can be a really fruitful way to
um make sure that your work is
constantly overturning itself I guess
yeah it was in fact I in in a book that
I wrote on gender Theory it was Julie
Moretz paintings
sort of the way that I would it gave me
the path to how I was going to talk
about remapping
um gender relations right it was just
sort of sitting in front of the pieces
that yeah so yeah yeah and then you know
like so many
um black visual artists their work is is
like beautifully narrative like I'm
playing like Carrie May Weems like just
really
evocative and and feel like they are
stills from a film or feel like they're
from you know some documentary project
or something and so that's always really
generative too so
I think that we're
coming up and these were beautiful
questions thank you everybody
and I just want to just say as I always
say Caitlyn I am I really so deeply
appreciate your work and I still am
always in disbelief that you're no
longer the baby in the in the carriage
and you're this incredibly brilliant
beautiful writer thinker and so it's
just a joy to talk to you yeah everyone
should know it Mani has known me since I
was literally in diapers
she was not much older but she's just
asking me sitting in a stroller drooling
away so how far I've come
here all right everybody yes please if
you haven't already beautiful collection
right thank you

thank you
