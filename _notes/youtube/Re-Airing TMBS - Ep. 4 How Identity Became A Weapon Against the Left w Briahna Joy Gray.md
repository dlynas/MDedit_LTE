welcome to the michael brooks show we're
broadcasting live in brooklyn
i'm michael brooks along with super
producer matt luck
hello matt hello michael
super producer david slavic out of
studio holding it all down hello to
everybody in the twitter world
hello to everybody on the discord chat
part of our patron crew on today's
program
brianna joy gray she's going to be
joining us later to talk about her peace
and current affairs
how identity became a weapon against the
left we're going to be talking about
pseudo-intersectionality
and how to synthesize dealing with the
inequality crisis
with a critique of structural racism and
sexism while
we take aim at the pseudo woke neo
liberal center
plus we are going to be debuting a new
segment
called retire and we're going to
be focusing on one particular person
that needs to retire urgently
a zombie idea of a unity ticket which
never goes away an obscene
story about ice continuing border
checkpoints even as hurricane harvey
will most likely hit texas incredibly
strongly
and ruthlessly putting immigrants lives
at risk
and we also have sound that definitively
proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that
donald trump is gone if he ever was
of this world and islamophobia in
australia
find out who i throw in the pyramid all
that
and so much more on the public version
of today's program that's before we get
to the post game
take your calls and ims and brianna
is going to be with me the whole time
plus your story picks
from discord but we need to start with a
zombie idea that will not die
and that zombie idea is that there is a
unity ticket
between two preferably wealthy quote
unquote
centrist read center right
traditional conservative white male
republican
or quasi-democratic candidates that can
come together
in unity between elite class interests
with
a dollop of fake social moderation
and save this country from politics
and the answers are usually always
austerity
deregulating corporations giving the one
percent what they want
the latest iteration of this idea
dropped today on friday
august 25th when we were recording this
we're broadcasting it for you watching
or listening live
there is a rumor that ohio governor john
kasich who flailed his arms and
occasionally said some slightly moderate
things while running for president
in the insanely vindictive bizarre
netherworld of the 2016 republican
primary
and colorado democratic governor john
hickenlooper who is
a pro fracking center right leading
governor
are considering a 2020 unity ticket now
a couple things here out of the gate
that of course are not surprising at all
one of course kasich will have the top
of the ticket because
obviously being a weak
pseudo-centrist right-leaning democrat
hickenlooper of course is going to
immediately
cede the primary power to kasich
obviously
so this unity ticket already starts with
a far right-wing governor
because let's not forget yes kasich
supported the medicaid expansion under
obamacare
he has occasionally said things that
would maybe lead one to think
that he acknowledges that poor people
exist and it maybe should be helped
versus sort of like publicly fed to
wolves but this is a guy that
cut and gutted planned parenthood he is
a strong opponent of public sector
unions
he is in fact a going back to the
gingrich congress in the 1990s
a advocate of top-end tax giveaways
and really one of the architects
of the rightward drift of america and in
between his time in congress and being
governor
he had stints on wall street and fox
news
in no rational world is john kasich
anything other but an extreme far-right
republican
john hickenlooper is a fracking advocate
he has never proposed anything bold or
innovative or strong
to counteract crises in terms of
inequality or
the environment but this idea will never
die in 2012 there was the no labels
fantasy
all too much of the quote unquote
resistance discourse
just simply gets reduced to a basic and
obvious human understanding that of
course
donald trump is a dangerous and
disgusting human being but not a
structural critique
of the system and why we must
change it now there's very little public
appetite in the country
for a center-right civility unity ticket
but there is always a big appetite for
it in the corporate donors
and green rooms of cable news which is
why
just as the mike bloomberg fantasy had
traction
just as why no labels got an
extraordinary amount of money
and ferreted around jon huntsman and joe
lieberman
to talk right-wing dull nonsense this
story will get traction and it will get
interest with all of the elites the
chattering classes and the corporate
donors
but of course no normal voters and the
other reason that this really matters
is because say we as democrats are able
to
actually nominate a actual progressive
say bernie sanders is the 2020 nominee
for the democratic party we overcome
the elite structure and the money base
of the democratic party
and we elect a genuine central left
candidate
like bernie sanders do you think that
the plutocrats
in this country who have jeopardized
every
aspect of our economy culture safety net
environment
and every other facet of american life
do you think despite their high-minded
rhetoric
that they will unite with a genuine
left-wing challenger
to the trump regime or whatever
republicans have put in place to
continue their reckless agenda
of course not you saw mike bloomberg
reversing himself a couple of months ago
from all of his heated rhetoric against
donald trump
and saying he wanted the president to
succeed i doubt very much that mike
bloomberg would ever say he would want
a president that would implement a
genuinely progressive tax code
to succeed so it's funny it's a good
case study
of the insularity and delusion of the
establishment but it's also a danger
for those of us that need to and
recognize the urgent necessity
of electing an actual progressive to
govern this country and save us in the
21st century
and that is why it matters
now i'm going to do a brief piece
of just sort of housekeeping or it's not
even housekeeping it's basically just
what is this matt this is promotion
yeah this is shameless promotion this is
a shameless promotion
does my mic sound weird to you it
doesn't sound weird to me why oh it
might be my headphones never mind
really okay no it sounds fine to me
so uh first and foremost
i want to thank we now have 580 patrons
this is incredible this is allowing us
to do the public show this is allowing
us to do those idea primers i don't hear
the music if you're playing it
this is allowing us to do those idea
primers the third way
um turkey's neo right uh
neo right wing social media strategy and
this weekend corey pine and i are doing
a deep dive
on silicon valley fascism next week
a bonus interview with steve cook on the
lobbying inside washington that
surrounds the gulf crisis with qatar
the uae and saudi arabia and we also
break down
the doubling down of insanity with a new
troop surge
in afghanistan there's also starting
next week going to be a daily brief
for patrons as well plus you get the
post game which is a lot of fun
last week sam sax was in studio we broke
down steve bannon you got to hear my pod
save america impressions
so look for a brooksie that's eight
bucks a month you get all three shows
you get access to the discord you get
the daily briefs that we're starting
for a comrade level of 21 a month you
also get a monthly
phone call with me in addition
everything else show crew you get
all the premium content plus a custom uh
impersonation phone call voicemail
whatever you want
and uh you know we're doing a lot to
build out um we're still working
uh with an animator there's a lot of
stuff that we have in the pipeline
to build out and sustain and expand
even beyond what we've done out of the
gate now really quickly
for getting new eyeballs new ears on the
show tell everybody about the youtube
channel
and then write us a review on itunes i
have a beef
with the 91st review that we've gotten
uh
i can't go too hard on this review
because this is apparently a patron
but i do want responses to it four stars
and by the way this is like one of two
we had 91 reviews
and we have like 89 five star reviews
right out of the gate
i'm feeling a little salty about this
and cheese lady writes
love the primers that's the third way
the silicon valley fascism so she is
indicating that she is a patron
uh just a few issues with the program
the calls are mostly the same guys yes
mostly guys young guys who call to the
majority report okay
i'll see that one i want everybody who's
calling in to keep calling in but i want
new people to call in as well
and you know who you are uh there's
plenty of people out there who are
starting fresh on this
also do not say nuclear she doesn't
appreciate the way i say
nuclear to which i say sorry
not sorry uh and then and this is where
i think the itunes reviews need to have
a strong response what the hell is wrong
with you she says
right-wing mandela is overrated get the
out of here
that one has been exhausted i expect to
see at least ten
five-star itunes reviews talking about
how great right-wing mandela is
your rachel maddow needs work but your
susan collins is great
well thanks for being a patron cheese
lady
but we're gonna need some heavy
responses to you and
just and again really thank you
everybody who supported the show this
way and
sharing it and getting the word out
speaking of
this sort of third way centrist
madness that we have been engulfed by
i predicted just give me one second
before we get to that
great music
so i said during uh the french election
that it was uh you know in in the first
round i would have voted for harman who
i thought was a genuine social democrat
and uh i certainly preferred mel and
sean overall to macron
obviously and i obviously preferred all
three of them to
le pen who's a neo-fascist and then i
said unfortunately look in the runoff
um we need to be reality based and just
as we needed to
in my view support hillary clinton over
donald trump we obviously needed to
support emmanuel macron
over marie le pen he won and i also but
i did say at the same time
he is going to be extraordinarily
unpopular his poll numbers will plummet
the austerity agenda the attacks on the
french social model are not going to go
down well
and if the socialist party
or if melanchon's party are not
centered into french politics with a for
real robust
restoration and continuity of a serious
21st century social democratic model
then fascism still lurks in france and
this is the political dynamic we see
in today's world but you know of course
the people like
in our mediocre center
they clung to him like a adonis that
they were grabbing onto but really
it was all a mirage and his poll numbers
have plummeted
even faster than i would have predicted
and now
we have a new emmanuel macron
scandal and that is now i am ready for
the stereotypical french music
emmanuel macron who has said that he
wanted to be jupiter-like
understood anna and your presidency
to the french and us that he wanted
france to be a startup nation
and by the way he's only 39 years old
has been
busted for spending 30 thousand dollars
on makeup i'm gonna read that again
manu macron spends this is a cnn full
cnn headline
macron spends 30 000 on makeup as
policies stall
thirty thousand on makeup you ask well
i'm gonna read now from cnn
there's no covering this up governing is
hard
emmanuel macron who's been president of
france for just over a hundred days has
been ensnared and yet another
controversy
after the magazine le pent reported that
he had already racked up a bill of
26 000 euros or 30
700 his representatives said the
spending was a result of an emer of a
quote unquote
emergency situation and that future
makeup cast would drop significantly
however the episode underscores the risk
facing macron a newcomer who was elected
to
office who uh who elected to office who
built a political movement around the
promise of remaking
france's economy a summer of scandals
has caused his popularity to tank and
jeopardized his
and i'm going to use air quotes here
reform agenda
and now i'm skipping ahead this is
faster than i predicted
mccrone's approval rating has been has
plummeted from 62
after he was elected to 36 according to
a recent poll conducted by ifop for the
newspaper la figaro
his predecessor francois hollande had an
approval rating of 46
at the same point of his presidency even
worse only 23
think of macron as changing the country
for the better and there we have it
yeah oh i totally knew that that timing
was happening
i just need to find uh my show grid
um let's uh we will actually just take a
brief interlude here and take just one
phone call
uh we don't plan these but sometimes
if you drop in to the top half of the
show
you can sneak in and then
we have some donald trump sound which
really is just sort of extraordinary but
i will take this you're calling from a
832 area code who are you where are you
calling from
hey uh this is josh formerly from
houston now in dallas because i like
wi-fi and running water
so oh okay they don't have wi-fi
uh well no oh right right in a few hours
okay right yeah
hurricane's about to hit us yeah tell me
what's happening so
yeah uh so the flights really so the
flight here was really interesting so
i'm sitting behind
um i i splurged and got like uh early
um early boarding on a southwest flight
and i'm sitting behind a man who seems
really really familiar and um
after googling his face to make sure and
listening to
some sound of his voice to confirm i
realize that i am sitting directly
behind
daryl isa daryl is
yes okay california yeah california the
congressman yeah what is he doing there
um i think it was for some energy
conference of course sounds about right
um
so um and so
if this was any other situation i
probably just would have uh yelled at
him left his best and ran away but
i'm on a plane i can't exactly do that
left is best smash the fast
hashtag tnbs right yes
but instead i asked him hey can we talk
a little bit
and for the duration of an hour i spent
an hour talking to daryl isa
did you book him for my show
i unfortunately did not oh man
so no so what did you find out that's
interesting go ahead
so so so he believes that in terms of
the debt ceiling that congress will pass
another continuing resolution
uh december okay stalling off a little
bit more he thinks that huh um
but then we got into a little bit back
and forth over the electoral college he
was like oh
so do you not believe in states rights
and i'm and my response to him was do
you not believe
in voters rights right and so that kind
of was a
he was like oh so you know why are you
against it and he made this point that
like
america's you know like a republican not
a democracy in the direct vote doesn't
matter and i said
well technically the reason donald trump
is president is that the
popular vote in three states got him
there
right so it's this weird system where he
was like well
we don't need to have a popular vote
system there's nothing in the
constitution that says that
but 48 states do that so it's kind of
moot um so is there any other any other
anything else that's cool i mean i guess
credit where credit is due
if i would have made some type of
passing joke about a perhaps a
history in the uh car theft racket
um i'm not saying anything but i would
look up a new yorker article about daryl
isa
that has a very interesting history
about how this guy made his money
uh there it is it's good i uh very
interesting circumstantial evidence
about this guys i will say genuine
entrepreneurship
but uh definitely worth reading hey i
appreciate i i mean you're and you're
safe and sound i mean do you have
i gotta jump in like 30 seconds but do
you have anything specifically about the
storm though
uh no it's just about to hit you some
but no the most important part is
so i kind of get a little debate a
little bit back and forth two things
he uh recommended for me to read atlas
shrugged it was very hard for me not to
throw my backpack at him did you laugh
did you say i read dianetics and it's
better
no i did not but i did get a joke i did
get a joke in um
he so he mentioned that you know he
wanted to get out of houston because the
hurricane was coming
and i said why would you why would you
fly away from the hurricane you can just
climb on top of a building and hide from
it
i appreciate the call man thank you
thank
all right everybody i just want to
actually touch on this briefly and
hopefully you know
if you're watching this live we'll find
out if you're listening to this later
on patreon itunes or watching on youtube
hopefully this storm will not cause the
type of damage
that it could very well cause but
this is an important story i wanted to
flag and sort of
this week's sort of highlight of
grotesque inhumanity with regard to
immigration reform
enforcement alex emmons wrote a piece in
the intercept border patrol text points
in texas will stay open
as hurricane evacuation is underway
an evacuation as evacuations are
underway for hurricane harvey the border
patrol is continuing to operate its
immigration
checkpoints forcing undocumented
immigrants to choose between staying put
and trying to withstand a hurricane or
risking deportation the hurricane is
expected to be the most powerful storm
to land in 12 years in other counties
near the southern coast of texas have
ordered thousands of residents to leave
according to nbc
jim burns a spokesperson for the custom
customs and borders protection
told the intercept that the u.s border
control patrol will check
points in the path of hurricane harvey
in texas will close as the state highway
closes so in other words as long as the
highways are functional for evacuation
the border will operate checkpoints this
is going to put
many lives in jeopardy and
in the past certainly the obama
administration
uh made adjustment adjustments in
similar situations this is the
grotesque and disgusting and sustained
result
of this administration's ice policies
and assault
on immigrants and now we have sound
of uh donald trump
and you know matt a lot of people have
picked through this speech this was of
course the
meltdown uh that trump had in arizona
meltdown 16.0
right let's take a minute on this how
at what point i mean when you look at
mainstream media
there is this incredible delusional
sort of pinball effect where it's like
you know maggie haverman at the new york
times so's
you know during trump's
abysmal afghanistan speech where he just
basically
in his own information-free way doubled
down
on 16 years of failure and threatened
pakistan
and she and she cook took his one line
about
the united states doesn't we're not
imperialists or something like that
effect and said this is him that is
strongest
like is it i mean just just this
incredible
sort of well transparent beet sweetener
too transparent beet sweetener and
relentless refusal to acknowledge
reality and then on the other hand
these i feel like these same contingent
of people are continuously surprised
when he comes back out
and reconfirms again and again and again
and again
like i'm crazy i'm insane i sympathize
with nazis
i have no relationship with the
terrestrial world
i have bizarre desires for my daughter
i see that this office is basically a
personal vanity project
we know all of this so any rate if you
were
you know had any functioning awareness
nothing about what he did in arizona was
surprising except for this
matt super producer matt
found a moment in this speech
where donald trump's disconnect
from reality really
clearly has just gone up to a completely
different level this is terrifying
obstruct that's all they do
their word is we resist they don't
resist they obstruct
it's all they're good at it's all
they're good at that's all they do
on health care they have 48 democrats
we got no votes we got no votes
and it would have been great health care
and by the way would have been great
health care for arizona would have been
great
so the democrats have no ideas
no policy no vision for the country
other than total socialism and maybe
frankly a step beyond socialism from
what i'm seeing
so the democratic party
of which nancy pelosi could not even
come on record
and say that she supports single-payer
she can't even respond to a question
from a so a college student who's
excited about democratic socialism
about the inherent problems of
capitalism with anything other than a
sort of like
weird vague praise of how corporations
operate in the 60s
and affirmation of their capitalist
affirmation that the democrats are
capitalists
trump goes out and like maybe it's even
further
i know the stages of socialism i know
what comes next
what comes next is because christine
gillibrand is a fabian
and bernie crazy bernie's a marxist
and chuck schumer he's sort of a lenin
londonist vanguardist allison's a muslim
please allison's a muslim which is
obviously the same thing
i mean but this is what it is
right this is when you have like
that is that is the mind meld though
that donald trump has with his audience
which is another thing that i think
people are still getting their heads
around right like that he
is literally those people
he is the crazy guy watching alex jones
he is the information free who
watches fox
he's the fox news viewer and not pundit
he is the foxy's viewer now pundit
and it also you know it also i mean
how what like not to bring up
like relitigate anything but like why
did the clintons hang out with this guy
right like what what was appealing
about this panting buffoonish racist
to the elites of our society why was he
on
meet the press why was he on charlie
rose i mean
donald trump is the perfect
petri dish for everything wrong about
who we are
and everything that touches him should
immediately be tainted
and done on association and now i
admit that that was not a very nice
thing for me to say
and this leads us to a we're going to be
experimenting with
several new segments over the next
couple of shows and
some people might object to the name of
this segment which is retire
and uh look if it bothers enough people
we might change the segment
if those people who are complaining
about it become patrons because i am
totally bribable uh you can bribe me
into political correctness any day
or out of it we could do like a bidding
war but it actually came from danny
devito who i'm
a fan of and danny devito um
i don't remember the exact date but he
quote tweeted antonin scalia
a story about antonin scalia before
scalia passed away
uh and he wrote retire
and uh i think that there was a lot of
truth in danny devito's tweet and it
just
applies to almost
anybody that we can think of in public
life
but i wanted to do one a person that
probably and also these are people that
we i mean i don't know matt can we
commit a hundred percent like
we almost certainly will never talk
about these people again
unless they like go on a shooting spree
or something unless they go on like a
shooting spree
with some of them it's possible with
some of them it's totally possible so
like as an example yeah i mean
unfortunately we have to talk about
stephen miller even before he does that
because he's in a policy making position
well that's why we can't tell him to
retire because we're not ready to
retire him
exactly but these people and so michael
kinsley
is a guy that i'm not particularly
familiar with but i have heard the name
he's edited slate
he's uh was uh also a guy who was on
a crossfire back in the day on cnn
and you know you could say look this guy
is not in the center of any kind of
public conversation
he's pretty irrelevant and that's true
but he does still get new york times
real estate he does still get vanity
fair real estate
and i just noticed this recently
somebody flagged this it was part of a
recent article in current affairs
that critiqued false civility and i
missed this at the time
and it is so atrocious and so
breathtakingly stupid that even if mike
kinsley apologized for this
which he has not as far as i know he
would need to like
fly to the birthplace of the buddha
meditate under the bodhi tree and then
retrace
like jesus's steps in the desert
then go on a hodge then do a sweat like
he would need to do every type of
purification and penance
imaginable to make up for this calm that
he did in the new york times
and i'm going to quote now from
this is a piece in current affairs we'll
have a link in the show notes
in may this is may a couple of months
ago
the paper which is the new york times
began running a nauseating column set
called
say something nice about donald trump
in which the president will be praised
semi-weekly by career pundit michael
kinsley
kinsley whose prior resume spans the
worst entities in political media
see slate the new republic cnn's
crossfire began his first
column with a plea to be nicer to trump
does he deserve all the criticism
does he never do anything right say
anything wise
or all of his schemes to reform this
agency or abolish that regulation
utterly misguided the venom the
obsession
the nice twist knife twisting are hard
to understand
even a stop clock is right twice a day
and though even donald trump can't be
wrong all the time we're looking for a
few positive words about the president
we're asking for your help
this is not about trump the family man
it's not another forum for debating the
issues it's a place to point out
positive things that mr trump has said
or done from the viewpoint
of the new york times and its readers
i don't know if this is still going on
i could not find recent editions of this
column and maybe it was quietly killed
from shame and delusion
um this is a way
it it's a door into
the generations of pundits
that first sort of define that
neoliberal center and it was people like
michael kinsley
that helped get us into such a state
of delusion and learned helplessness
within the democratic elite
because those were the two tracks with
the democratic elite there was
the selling out of the core democratic
constituencies whether they're labor or
poor people or people of color
under the clinton era to curry favorable
corporations to throw people off of
welfare and all the rest of it
no question but then there was this
bizarre obsession with
civility and institutional respect and
finding fairness and equivalencies where
none exist and you can see a through
line quite literally a direct through
line with a column idea as stupid as
this by kinsley with the same people
that look at the world as it is today
and are more worried by antifa than
anything else
it's this bizarre desire to find
something that isn't there
when one practically the right would
still just as easily call michael
kinsley a communist
and never reciprocate this kind of
weakness and delusion
and then an order of affairs that
favors power privilege and oppression
and that's you know it's
there and i think it was a marcusa who
was quoted in this piece
uh from the frankfurt school said can
you really have
a open exchange and a commitment to
broad openness of ideas
that allows for everybody when one side
is advocating for civil rights
the other side is advocating uh
white supremacy in the ku klux klan and
maybe in a generic
broad sense everybody can sort of say
what they want
but from a broad societal functional
sense in terms of what we accept and
what we propped
obviously both of those things cannot be
given equal airing
because one is a demand for rights in
space and the other is a negation of it
and that's how this discourse gets so
warped and abused and you'll see even
this weekend in the silicon valley
fascism primer
going back to the 70s of people talking
about the real danger
and the real lesson of hitler's germany
was not a genocidal quest to murder all
jewish people to murder all gypsies no
no
no no that wasn't the issue the issue
was
there wasn't free speech in hitler's
germany
and that clampdown and i kid you not
open exchanges of ideas
so in this column even though we missed
it at the time
michael kinsley has given himself a
permanent
pay stub to retire
forever
send us your tweets send us your
thoughts if enough people become
patrons who object to the name of that
we'll change it to something else
uh there's also pasture sell by date
and there's also oh my god please put
us out of our misery what are some other
ones we're thinking about for that
segment matt
you know there's a few others i don't
know i think leave forever
leave forever or yeah i don't know
goodbye
please jesus christ just go you
forever maybe you forever
um we're actually gonna continue on the
you forever beat and
get to um another
piece of sort of neo-liberal whinging
and that is uh mark lilla and every week
i i actually i want to just just say
there's a couple of other segments
that we're considering integrating as
regular features in both
the public show and the post game and
another one
uh that we're working on is going to be
there's a sort of serious one that we're
focusing on that would probably just be
a regular documenting of things like
civilian casualties and
sort of areas of kinetic activity
whether they're in yemen or somalia
or certainly even like the saudi
travesty that the united states and the
uk are backing right now in yemen which
if syria wasn't sucking up so much
oxygen would be
absolutely understood as the sort of
preeminent human rights crisis in the
world today
steve cook and i went in depth on that
in our interview
um and then another called the uh
shockingly woke moment in tv of the week
there's a couple of these that we're
going to be experimenting with
um on both regular show and post game
but one
that we will be continuing to do
and is very important in light of
today's show because
brianna and i are going to be talking
about how
uh pseudo-wokeness is used as a weapon
to undermine a serious conversation and
a serious approach to inequality
but there was another response
to the travesty of trump being elected
and that leads us to
this week's pyramid
every week we need to lock somebody away
somebody who has either abused the
public trust
been a massive just terrible
person or made a bad argument
and this week's pyramid is a bad
argument by a professor named mark
lilla who teaches humanities at columbia
university as author of a new book
called the once and future liberal after
identity politics
mark lilla wrote in the new york times
after the election of donald trump
the fixation on diversity in our schools
and our press
has produced a generation of liberals
and progressives narcissistically
unaware of the conditions outside of
their self-defined groups
and indifferent to the task of reaching
out to americans in every walk of life
at a very young age our children are
being encouraged to talk about their
individual identities even before they
have them
by the time they reach college many
assume that diversity discourse
exhausts political discourse and have
shockingly little say about
such perennial questions as class
war the economy and the common good
and he said recently upon the release of
his book
that by the 1980s identity politics had
given way to a pseudo-politics of
self-regard
and increasingly narrow exclusionary
self-division self-definition that is
now cultivated
in colleges and universities the main
results he
said he writes has been to turn young
people back into themselves rather than
turning them outward toward
the wider world now this might sound
like something that people like us would
say
because we want to reorient a marxist
analysis
and a serious class assessment into
politics but all lila is really doing
here
by belittling the struggles for social
emancipation
and grossly inflating the importance of
silly college campus fantasies
is playing into the types of politics
that bill clinton deployed in the 1990s
when he was doing things like
the sister soldier moment with jesse
jackson where he shared a platform with
jackson and publicly humiliated him
where democrats triangulated
on race and gender issues
there's no contradiction between
rhetorically
speaking to and attesting to social
emancipation
and synthesizing it with a broader
message
barack obama actually did this very well
rhetorically he just didn't match it
with the kind of robust for real left
politics we need
so lila is not doing what we're doing on
this show
he's just being a grouchy out of touch
professor who's inflating his narrow
read of the election
and his own complaints about his
relatively irrelevant campus culture
with a national crisis that includes
issues
such as inequality and race
and that is why mark lilla
is in the pyramid this week to
the pyramid which is not a safe space
for you
mark lilla did you ever read that guy's
columns
that guy's columns uh that was the first
one yeah
that was the first one i've ever heard
over it did you read that one uh no but
i saw it shared and
kind of gave people a bit of a side eye
because i felt like it was maybe the
first thing they ever engaged with on
identity identity to politics
and it is something that you know
despite
having a critique as we're about to give
on it it's something that
you can tell when people are a bit too
quick to dismiss it where they're coming
from
yeah i mean he he quoted in his original
piece he kind of said
you know even even the way he framed
like he said black lives matter has put
issues on the table that every american
of conscience could consider and reflect
or you know something to that effect
every american would care about but
the notion that a structural issue which
also can totally be read through a class
lens
because you can also go into the
statistics on terms of
you know it's primarily race but it's
also very much class distributed and
some of the
highest police brutality states are very
racially homogenous so it is certainly
a intersectional issue in that sense
it's race
and class very much
connected um
but the way where he just sort of
notates it
as like yeah and there's this nice thing
going on with black lives matter is if
it's
ancillary see that's the the sort of
distinction
what we're arguing for is both and and
everything to synthesize and expand
so that we're addressing the crises at
once and that's a
messy process it's a challenging process
and sometimes it will take the argument
that i will make i really do center
class
i could be right i could be wrong but
what he's doing is he's sort of
subtly shifting out like okay look black
people are along for the ride gay people
are along for the ride but now we need
to get
back to this sort of mushy national
discourse
and what is the default in mushy
national discourse
i think we all know the answer
now we are going to talk with brianna in
just a few minutes she's on her way up
but before that
i'm very pleased to announce
that in addition uh to his uh
contributions on the majority report
with samantha cedar
uh right wing mandela has agreed to do
some cross promotion with us
the origin story of right wing mandela
for people new to the show to the
michael brooks show is this
a couple years ago when nelson mandela
who
really sort of kind of like last
unequivocal heroes that we sort of had
on earth
passed away um we were in the office
and the first joke was that uh chris
matthews had been begging obama to get
give him an interview and mandela passed
away and so they preempted his interview
so it was sort of like mandela being
like haha chris
you got cocked and then
and that was sort of funny and whatever
honestly just probably joking around
because it was so
depressing to be honest it was quite
depressing for me uh
and then mark rick santorum went on bill
o'reilly and compared the struggle
against obamacare
to the struggle against apartheid which
still is up there in a donald trump
world as one of the most
obscenely stupid things i've ever heard
in my life but it did give birth to
rick is quite right we were struggling
against
subsidized health care for mind workers
in the
african mines so that is the origin
for those that have been asking me and
without further ado earlier today
right-wing mandela or mandela i should
say had a right-wing mandela had a
a really heated um probably more heated
on his
on his side but very interesting
exploration of comedy political
correctness
race judaism terrorism and islam with
comedian andy
kindler let's uh no i don't think that's
mandela's intro music
uh and uh and he's agreed to allow us to
play it uh his radio show is going to be
appearing fortunately on our show
uh from time to time and here it is uh
right wing mandela with andy
kindler but seriously andy we do have
some
questions to get

welcome back to the show soon we'll be
getting to the
of the week and also your calls
including fred
in seattle whose wife left him but a
woman
will explain why all that check out my
sacred masculinity pills
at mandela show dot com
slash marketplace but joining us now
is a jew who would not engage in a free
and open exchange of ideas if it met him
on the street
blew him and gave him 50 shekels
comedian
and sjw andy kindle is with us
wow you know i don't know you intro do
you always introduce people by their
religion
well uh usually i find that it's good
and the paranoia about being introduced
by your religion is really a form of
political correctness that shows that
you are the one that would have the
problem
well in other words so it's politically
is it politically correct that i refer
to myself as a jew
or is it politically correct and correct
that i
object to being called a jew i would
call it politically transparent
that you refer to yourself as a jew
globe emoji global emoji
globe emoji but seriously andy we do
have some
questions to get to before you look over
your bank account
i'm sorry mr mandela yeah i did not mean
to laugh at you
no that's quite that's what that's right
look i am not a snowflake i can accept
yuma
let's get to the question i love the
snowflake who came up
mr mandela who came up with snowflake
the snowflake was
a something that we came up with during
the struggle during apartheid because
what we were doing was objecting to the
apartheid
regime's practice of safe spaces in the
minds
this is really going back to the
earliest days of the anc struggle this
is not the way i heard the history of it
well it has been distorted by the
liberal media and that's hollywood and
that's invictus
and it's a travesty which we correct
every day you have fake news
did you have fake news where in your
hashtag fake news i remember when oliver
tombo called it fake news i said this is
a tremendous slogan
but andy share this question
you're a comedian you'll make a living
telling jokes as do many others of your
tribe
but now there are college students who
don't like
and jokes anymore not to
mention great airplane you mud as
practiced by jetty seinfeld the funniest
man
in the history of humanity and i do mean
man because of course
having a woman do a comedy is like
having them drive
bad results so in addition to your love
of islam
why do you want politically correctness
to choke comedy
well um the thing is is that i think
that's exaggerated by
i think that that's part of a propaganda
movement
there's nothing wrong p the kids on the
college campuses
they're totally progressive but they're
not with this
you know it's like you're buying into
the right wing uh
uh media so you admit that that the
children are they are progressive and
they don't want a free and open exchange
of ideas so in other words
if charles murray goes to the college
campus and he says
the brain sizes is disproportionate with
the penis and look i'm black i could say
this myself
so therefore there is sexual and brain
and cranium types it's science
the kids don't want to hit it they shut
it down jetty seinfeld goes he does this
amazing routine about a french
king eating cupcakes
that's like a gay guy eating cupcakes
dynamite humor
the kids don't like it either and but
they should be shut down
why well i i don't know i think that
there's a lot of
exagger i'm telling you i think you're
buying into a lot of exaggerations
i think that uh well one exaggeration
you're buying into
first of all i don't know if the
exaggeration is correct but uh jerry
seinfeld doesn't he doesn't even play
colleges
yes because he has been run out by the
children but look
getting on to the other topics i think i
think we all know what's going on right
now
if an islamic terrorist a member of an
islamic group a terrorist a muslim a
terrorist who was practicing islam
by observing their true faith by being a
terrorist
if they would no well that's not the
truth okay all right okay well then well
we we
applied yeah let it slide for now we
will stipulate it before you defend your
favorite religion in the world
say that a islamic terrorist practicing
the islamic faith as described in the
hadiths
and in the quran i have a thought
experiment for you
they were to strap some dynamite and
yell and shriek
allah akbar when they blew up the
florida delicatessen retirement home
that
say uh babala anti lived in
would your first reaction be to
apologize to the suicide bomber
or since he was dead and you couldn't
apologize to him
perhaps send out a tweet to care
saying we should let muslims build a
mosque
on the washington monument what would
your first response be
okay well first of all i would check on
my uh my aunt
my aunt bubba my aunt who's ever in the
home
i would see who is there oh delicate
yes delicatessen retirement home
i would find you know first i would tend
to the first responders
but then once i recovered i would say
i understand well he see is he still
alive or is he dead
well he is dead but you maybe you could
you might want to apologize to
probably the lead out of his group or
something like that yes i would say the
least my daddy is still alive you would
like to apologize to him
i would just say i say look i understand
where you're coming from
i don't agree i don't agree with your
tactics
no one's tried that reasonable route at
least andy if you are nothing if not
honest about your sjw tooth but it is
obviously your attitude
which is destroying comedy destroying
western civilization and going to lead
us into a gay islamic apocalypse
but we're running out of time you have
the final word

well the thing is a lot of people
don't i don't there's a victim
thank you for joining us on the mandela
show you have to find a word
thank you so much come on mr mandela
i am outraged that you would not let me
give me a proper form within which force
which
to respond well you can join us again
perhaps after
i get an estrogen injection from sam
cedar
or larry murphy drags himself out of a
bob's burgers recording
or eugene merman has the balls to face
me in a free
and open forum none of you are as funny
as jerry seinfeld
and i'm like gavin mcguinness you
forever
it's fine no more friends for me thank
you thank you for the opportunity though
mr mandela thank you

i abby

welcome back to the michael brooks show
that was
uh from right wing mandela's new radio
program interview with andy kindler
uh brianna actually wrote the script for
that so thank you i appreciate that
any time uh joining us now is brianna
joy gray she is a writer analyst
host of the what's the name of your
podcast again someone's wrong on the
internet swati
swati someone's wrong on the internet
that's true
i like how you named your podcast after
a truism
yeah she's going to be hanging out with
us through the rest of the public show
and
into the post game but we have to start
with a piece that you wrote
for current affairs called how identity
became a weapon
against the left make the case i mean
this is a very receptive place to make
the case but you outlined it
i think in a way i think
to sort of set the table a little bit i
think that in some ways there's
a lot of things that get conflated in
this debate there's actually a high
level debate
that i think if it was actually taking
place would be a really worthwhile one
which is kind of like a marxist versus
intersectional debate and what do we
center and what do we value and how do
we synthesize
and then i think there's an emotional
intelligence debate there's some people
that i
totally agree with analytically but the
way they
talk and the way they address certain
issues it's like
whoa you're absolutely just not
communicating with awareness right and
then there's like a tremendous amount of
political opportunism and cynicism and i
think that
you hit these threads really well
so why don't you outline the piece and
we'll break it down and move from there
so basically i felt compelled to write
this or some version of it
since the months leading up to the
election
where i was met with a lot of
incredulity every time that someone
became aware that i was in fact a black
leftist
right and this often happens on twitter
where despite one's avatar
people make or it's easier for people to
make presumptions about who you are or
who you aren't
um and so what you would find is that
you would get into ideological
disagreements with people and they would
pull
the i mean i want to trivialize it by
saying this but like they would pull a
kind of a version of a race card on me
um it would usually be um a white
centrist who would tell me
uh you could only have those views if
you were a privileged white bernie bro
you must be a 19 year old living in your
mother's basement
et cetera et cetera right to which i
would say
check out my avatar and the response i
found
troublingly was often that they would
completely back down
and it would confuse me because my
position was i'm right
because i'm right not because i'm not
white
so there's this complete and total
marriage of uh
political opinion or how much political
how much credit you get how much
credibility you have politically
with your identity which even when it
benefits me
troubles me greatly especially as
someone who
just as an individual as a human being
whose identity doesn't always match with
um you know racial expectations and
that's a that's a freedom that
you know white people have
and that other people of color often
don't and it's it's been kind of um
exacerbated in this political arena
where there's a lot of uh
um political gain to be had
by leading with identity um which has
the effect
at times of marginalizing economic
arguments and as someone who is a strong
believer
in some of the economic arguments that
were raised by sanders
with a prominence that we haven't seen
in a long time
it was particularly disheartening to see
members of my community being swayed
by arguments um that weaponized their
own identity against them
right so and and we'll get to the sort
of specific political examples of that
because i think that i mean
the other thing that it also reveals is
that
the comfort in at least our
circles roughly speaking which are
coastal educational
broadly i mean i think one of the things
that's actually great now is we really
are seeing that like
we don't have the same politics there's
radically different politics within
what people generically call the left i
actually encounter that when i go and do
media with
you know say center right or centrist
people and they expect me to come with
this whole
kind of agenda which i you know i
actually probably i agree with but they
expect a whole
mode of discourse and way of framing the
world which i don't
and because they've that sort of broader
brand of what the left is has been so
distorted
um but they're kind of the two specific
examples of how these arguments got
deployed and let's start with just the
real nitty-gritty of the cynicism before
we get to some of the actual merits on
both sides right
so it was amazing and you know we're
probably like
roughly-ish the same age so we didn't
exactly like i mean we were alive during
bill clinton but we
probably were not like you know super up
on it i wasn't
in the country for any of the clinton
years oh wow you're so repulsed by bill
clinton you're out of the country
talk to my mom about it wow okay i got
you actually where were you
uh we were in saudi arabia from uh oh
that explains it
there you go see this is another part of
the islamic marxist conspiracy
i'm had again all sam harris trolls
hit us up you know what it is you know
how hard it
like the commitment that we have to wage
jihad that you're not in a burka right
now is like amazing
uh i bought i brought it with me if you
want me to do a quick change well no i
not while we're on the air because we
gotta keep
well it is but i understand that we're
doing deep cover work so of course
um no i appreciate it i mean obviously
once we leave
and i will get i will get appropriately
tired as well but
the no but so but we know that bill
the the irony is is that the clinton
the third the first third way kind of
dlc
model that the clintons operate out of
which was
exemplified in bill clinton in 92
actually relatively
center lefty on economics when he first
ran for president
not as bad on those issues terrible
on exploiting racial divisions making
sure to people need to look up ricky ray
rector he went
while he was running for president and
signed the death warrant of a
literally mentally lobotomized black man
a guy who before he was executed asked
what his next meal would be or rather
he wanted to save some of his final meal
for later
right this was before he's going to get
executed this is bill clinton and then
in 1996
to the right on the economy and then
incredibly socially reactionary politics
as designed by dick morris and then you
know
so that's and hillary clinton was
totally on board for that
so to what and then in 2008 all sorts of
bizarre
i mean there's no doubt that rumors
about obama's heritage and stuff like
that
had roles in the clinton's campaign
somali garb yes
well and that's what i will be changing
into so
you know it was extraordinary with just
a tiny sense of political awareness to
watch that the clinton campaign's
response
to bernie sanders unexpected success was
going to be
we are woke and i knew people on the
political spectrum i knew i was
well to their left but i also was like
they're sophisticated enough that they
cannot possibly fall for this because
this is also like
this is somebody who came out for
marriage equality two years ago and this
is ridiculous and then
all of a sudden that's what it was so
you know get
more and then that leads us to the
discourse around kamala harris right
so that was the uh proximate cause of
writing
this article right um because
i i have felt in the court like
particularly i feel like uh
irritated by the um the
optimism surrounding her partly because
i uh kind of run in a
lawyery liberally lawyers of color
circle that is particularly enthusiastic
about her
um you know yes yeah i went to law
school with her
niece i mean she's been a name that's
been in my life for a very long time for
other reasons
and what what was particularly
troubling was that i i my instinct was
to root for her right and i think i hope
that comes across
in some small way in the article that i
wasn't here to just completely drag her
you know
um but when we've just come off of an
election like we've had
and we see the democratic party lining
up behind someone who has so many of the
similar failings that ended up
tanking hillary clinton when you have
someone in
a social climate where black lives
matter is potentially
the most you know visible and um kind of
easily identified
uh movement on the left to have someone
who's a former prosecutor who's been her
career bragging about how many people
she can put behind bars
who specifically advocated particular
policies that are
especially draconian in nature the
criminalization of parents with truant
kids
i mean this is the kind of person that
we're supposed to all rally behind
without even a moment of pause and what
i would hope
is that an article like this and
criticism of her
would lead to her
self-evaluating and making some attempt
to
pivot do what she can do to try to
reevaluate who she
who she is because i feel like a lot of
politicians in this
kind of new new bernie world where you
it seems you can maybe do it without all
the fundraising maybe you can do without
all the political compromises that we
thought were a matter of course might
make different decisions and might be
able to find some integrity
buried deep down somewhere um
but instead any criticism is taken as
you're you're racist or you're a sexist
because that is the line that
hillary clinton really um
formalized uh and really specialized in
and that's the mindset that people can't
seem to shake it was epitomized and i
want to get because i really like
because i've been sort of trying to
thread this needle because i
don't think it's productive for people
on our side to
i think we should have the confidence to
be able to come out and say to somebody
like kamala harris who
is an appealing political figure in some
ways like look we have the blue map we
have the blueprint for you
work with us we should have the you know
not be
out with this sort of immediate like
we'll her and all of it i think
that that's where
you know people on our side of the
equation can get
insular and dogmatic which when it comes
to electoral politics is just
not how you operate i mean if i operated
like that i have
you know bernice's things about israel
that annoy me you know what i mean like
we can all play this game right i'm not
saying an equivalency bernie is
way more progressive than kamala harris
but you know what i'm saying
but i think you know just to really
underscore
i think one of the moments where the
dynamic you're talking about
really came alive and was really
the formalization of this split
was in one of the democratic debates
where hillary clinton
in response to you know and bernie's up
there working his arms and
wall street you know oh man that
my shoulders up even doing that
impression
i got to do some yoga maybe he needs to
do some yoga but you know he was doing
it and he was doing his great spiel
and everybody know i mean wall street
and you know those are those like 70 80
issues and obviously donald trump was
able to get some traction on a
scam version of telling that same story
and she looked back at him and she said
you know
solving wall street won't get rid of
racism right and that was an applause
line and i mean
the multitude of how
shockingly stupid and disingenuous that
was was
i mean it literally took my breath away
because i mean first we start with the
obvious which is that
wall street running amuck has incredibly
specific implications for people of
color which i would love for you to
elaborate
but then second it was like that's the
new like what's she gonna say like i'm
not gonna sign a new
salt treaty that won't solve racism like
what the like
it was because that to me is the kind of
broader
thing that also shows up at kamala
harris there's this bizarre
like if kamala harris becomes my
token of emotional political redemption
that also becomes this extraordinarily
bizarre racialized discourse in and of
itself
and even there you're basically saying
like hey people of color can't have
any policy sets on anything
including by the way in that instance
one that does have a disproportionate
effect on people of color but that would
be like you know
yeah why why do arms control yes why
sign a new you know whatever yeah
someone on the internet uh tweeted at me
at once
uh oh you're concerned with economic
equality that's so privileged it's
something that you know
only well a white person would have to
deal with that i you not like
economic equality is such a white
privilege thing to care about
okay that's interesting yeah i mean
so yeah as you've pointed out first of
all
the wall street failures
disproportionately affected the black
community i think it
stole something like 40 percent of black
wealth and
black wealth yeah and we're already
something like a nickel to a dollar
of white family wealth um so
you really can't overstate that direct
harm
secondly as you said it's like this
incredible logical fallacy
um that curing racism not only is should
that not be a metric for pursuing any
kind of policy
but it's not as though the democrats are
offering any uh
alternative that will cure racism i've
yet to see the
the dnc's 2020 platform for elimination
eliminating all
uh discrimination right well that yeah
that was the other thing that i wanted
you
to touch on and i guess i guess it's
emotionally lethargic to relitigate some
of this stuff
but i remember when and and reparations
like
that's just literally well i mean it's
not a conversation we're having now we
can have it that's fine
but the thing that struck me when
tanahisi coates wrote his critique of
bernie which i you know i
i mean i'm not gonna lie i wasn't overly
impressed with it i thought he had a
totally valid point
i maybe i'm enough of a political
operative to be like
okay that's an interesting time to
intervene in this primary
but what really got me was like
when you're going to deploy and just to
be clear china hissy quotes wrote a
column saying bernie opposes doesn't
want to touch reparations because he
doesn't think it's politically viable
but every other part of his political
message is on challenging what is
politically viable and
the one thing i will say operationally
is that
i mean tanahisi quotes is totally right
on the merits of what he's saying in
terms of the actual argumentation but i
think what
bernie is saying in a more opera kind of
more operational senses
expand what is politically viable in
terms of issues that you can get
70 80 of the american population on
whether we agree with that approach or
not
that is what he's talking about he's not
talking about
finding more you know he's talking about
what's an issue set like everybody has
health care
wall street stops robbing you of your
home yeah that pretty much everybody who
isn't doing the robbing can agree with
but anyways
what struck me was it's a fine critique
but watching hillary clinton's people
post i was like
i didn't see the marcus garvey section
of hillary clinton's campaign website
what the are you talking about
yeah i mean so i mean what was that
like to see these critiques aimed at him
from ostensibly the left
to aid the right-wing candidate it felt
like
being gaslighted right i mean i
i futilely tweeted at tah and you see
coats
over and over again imploring him to
please because he he said right that he
he very reluctantly admitted that he was
going to vote for sanders
even though he said he wouldn't endure
sanders and i was like i don't even know
i don't even know that that's supposed
to mean you're on a public show and you
say you're running for somebody that's
an endorsement it's an endorsement yeah
um but it was troubling to me because
especially in the world of twitter where
i know that you know disagreements can
become outsized and
disproportionate there's so many
black twitter voices that a lot of
people were listening to
that basically traded were parroting
that same kind of a line
um you know if not if it doesn't cure
racism it's not worth doing
anything that is not an explicitly race
first message
is an anti-black anti-poc anti-lgbt
message and we shouldn't trust it
and it was it was fascinating to me
because there was this argument that i
heard
um that went along the lines of after
the primary
the majority of black people voted for
hillary clinton
therefore those who would continue to
support bernie or
progressive policies are
disenfranchising
black people right so so to vote
where that leaves me i don't know well
you're disenfranchising black people
apparently
thank you i mean as a bernie bro i would
like to thank you
because obviously sort of origins i
remember
studying reading about like the
anti-apartheid struggle and thinking
like is there a way that we could get an
old jew that doesn't want black people
to be empowered
that was the formation of my politics
yeah
yeah so i mean i i found myself arguing
with people trying to get them to
engage on a policy level right um and
they refused i
you know back earlier during the primary
i tried to get people to engage
with the idea that just because hillary
clinton's a woman
it doesn't mean that she's necessarily
the best candidate for women
and i was you know appalled when she
picked uh tim kaine
as a vp choice given that he is someone
who had a
tragic record on women's issues in
virginia who advocated
um to get like require parental
signatures for
um you know juveniles who were seeking
abortions and
abstinence only education and all the
things that if any
other white man had kind of allied
themselves with
it would have been it would have been it
do you think that part of this
problem is bernie was the first
you know major candidate i
as far as i understand maybe i guess
besides potentially in some ways jerry
brown in 1992 or jesse jackson in the
80s who
was running like a decommodified
campaign he was talking about
actual material issues and everything
else
we've been even in relatively trivial
you know primaries like it's it's very
much a brand preference you know like
howard dean i mean
you know iraq was important but like
there's no policy portfolio difference
between john kerry or howard dean it's
do you want a guy who kind of mixes it
up or do you want
a kind of you know taller more sort of
whatever
yeah and that there is a whole
generation of people of which we are but
somehow we
escaped that is simply trained
to just filter politics as a personal
brand proposition so that now with
kamala harris because the the other
thing that's bizarre is like
i have one friend who's totally in this
like hyper liberal
you know identitarian category but thing
that i appreciate about him
is i'm just like dude look like run
barbara lee
and i would totally strongly consider
supporting her right they don't like
that
well he does so to his credit he's with
it and he gets it
but besides that it's like the it's like
what is it that
it's an yeah why don't they like that
and what is this politics that continues
even after the debacle of 16 where it's
just it's a brand so it's like this
intense emotionality but it also feels
like
i'm debating puma versus nike with
somebody oh i thought you're gonna bring
up puma as in uh the hillary clinton
pumas
oh no i wasn't gonna get back to those
people
jesus man i remember that i remember
supporting obama then
and it was really hard because obviously
as a as a sort of young socialist i
didn't want a black president
obviously of course but yeah of course
not but i was
you know but a woman i mean jesus i have
my limits so 08 was very hard yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that was
difficult
um what i get from people when uh
alternative
uh progressive candidates of color are
proposed is that it's a pretext
they just don't they don't trust it um
there because there was a lot of
oh i don't like hillary but i'm going to
vote for jill stein right
and i think that that
kind of started to make people uh
distrustful because they didn't see jill
stein as a legitimate candidate
they thought well you're only putting
her forward because you know that she
has
no viability right and you're just
trying to cover the fact that you are a
birdie bro
and that you're a sexist i have yet to
see someone respond
um with any kind of sincerity i so kudos
to your friends
well it's hard i mean for me like i i
voted i voted for hillary clinton
i totally was like look we're in the
general this is oh you didn't i didn't i
live in new york yeah i live in the west
village who cares you can vote for who
you want to vote for in the west village
but jill stoint
jill stein annoyed me a lot yeah i
planned to vote for jill stein but then
she annoyed me she just said
one too many stupid things she does a
lot of stupid things but she also was
the only one who was out here with
reparations on her platform and like
there were there was something well that
was the real problem i had
i couldn't resist that call back yeah no
but that's exactly right she's the only
one and that one and the argument
against her was it like to me
even beyond like i do genuinely think
she was
just like i had i got to a point where i
had
actual problems with her where i
couldn't have like a pleasant protest
vote
but i do think that like you know that
yes this notion it wasn't just like hey
look this isn't electorally viable
and it's pretty important to stop clown
fascism vote for hillary
out of here with jill stein it's
this emotional
enraged like how dare
anybody be and and but it's so odd
because it's an emotionality that is
devoid of
policy it's like it's like i think of
like i get more in that mode when i'm
doing like
jay-z versus nods you know
i i think it i mean it's part of the
it's her turn phenomena i think i think
for one there's a great um interview
with um
anoa anoachanga yeah i had her on she's
part of crew of the show she's a regular
okay well she's brilliant i don't know
who she was arguing somebody
yeah hapless and awful um but she did
this amazing job
um basically pushing back so the person
she was arguing with
it was a kind of a an older a
middle-aged white woman
right and what became really clear in
the course of this discussion
was how much there was like this
generational
um schism that was contributing to
people's inability to see things the
same way
so that there's this like an older white
female voter
who really did internalize that notion
of its return and i want to give some
respect to that because i
i do understand this whole like ruth
bader ginsburg generation this glorious
dynam generation
who really can't wrap their mind around
things beyond representational
politics because they're just in this
kind of second wave mode that was
legitimate and important at a time right
um
but we're in a more third wavy choose
your choices kind of a place
and and we're also in like uh you're not
going to be able to feed yourself
because we're in a 21st century feudal
late-stage capitalism kind of place
and do we really want a politics that
ends with
you know the first openly gay member of
the supreme court rewrites
indentured servitude if you can't pay
your student loans
right but that i mean people were not
receptive to that and we got
gloria steinem saying the female women
who liked bernie were just doing it
because they wanted to be with the boys
um on on of all places the bill maher
show
yeah right he really brings out the best
in people that's one of the great like i
can't wait to go on bill maher and be
like it's it's because people are
irrational about muslims
you know what i'm saying yeah yeah yeah
um but yeah so i do think that there was
just kind of like a cultural
um gap uh where there were people who
just really were invested in the
symbolism of what was happening
and weren't able to shake it and i tried
to reflect about what
how i would have felt in 2008
if there were a more um
politically aligned non-black candidate
right
right um who i mean it's hard because
if you're gonna go for representational
politics obama really knocked it out of
the park
i mean he did a really good job just
being
the what did joe biden say the the
cleanest most articulate black man
that you could find god damn right
(Laughter)
got that shine uh
but i would i would hope that that
wouldn't be enough and as a woman
certainly hillary clinton being a woman
wasn't enough do you have it
and i think it's very important that we
frame this question carefully
and not just because i'm a white guy but
just
analytically like when we talk about you
know like
the assumption that the
black community would be to the left in
america
to me it's just a faulty assumption
right like and even
the way if you have any sense of like
internal dynamics of different
communities like the caribbean politics
of where i live in brooklyn is very
different than
like harlem right like there's real so
you know and obviously the age gaps in
terms of bernie and hillary tracked with
everything else and i you know in terms
of young people of color voted for
bernie and
older people voted for hillary generally
speaking and now i think even with
kamala harris like i think
one of the things that actually is a
sidebar i think will be tricky for her
just from observing her i think she's a
very appealing candidate in a lot of
ways but i don't
i think obama through
a really unparalleled charisma was
obviously
he is a harvard law graduate he is
incredibly
you know of a certain professional class
and training but
it was very down to earth and very kind
of
globally relatable that i don't see
kamala harris
having that's just more of a kind of
stylistic critique but
my point being is like it's faulty to
assume
that people of color would necessarily
be to the left or
that some communities wouldn't
internalize neo-liberalism just as much
as
everybody has internalized it but that
said i mean
what not from the community as a whole
obviously but from a leadership class
perspective what does it
mean that
the pivot even from figures like i don't
know is with all their flaws jesse
jackson or cornell west or angela walker
or
angela davis or bell hooks who had like
they have actual politics
yeah these are people with very serious
politics and they do see things in a
synthesized way
and they did name check poverty in class
not just to include it in something to
index because they understood it
and now we're emerging with this very
that that representation in terms of
of power and what's given a platform is
becoming
quite center-right and actually not only
you know centering race which is one
thing but actually saying like you've
been saying it
it is antithetical you know a manigani
like
it's sexist to support single-payer
healthcare which by the way negates all
of barbara lee's work
in getting rid of the hyde amendment
right yeah but
wow that kind of reactionary step
is pretty extraordinary from people that
are at least publicly branded and
presented as you would represent a
perspective that is a little bit more
attuned to the needs of most people
i i think that uh so
identity politics is an operation but so
is respectability politics
and i think that respectability politics
plays a huge role
in communities of color i can speak
particularly to the black community
um even though we have had figures
historically
with a lot more um political meat to
them obviously
right there is always this um feeling
that well
this isn't going to be a real thing
they're not really credible they're you
know
jesse jackson can run for president but
he's you know whatever bill clinton
however brooklyn poo poo'ed him like
that was the general
um feeling you know even when obama
started his run
no one really in the black community
took him particularly seriously because
we
are used to a history of kind of
disappointment in this realm
and i think that when we see a candidate
that seems actually viable
you know someone who does have that
harvard law degree or whatever else
people are crediting
it's it's irresistible in a way
that you know to credit the community is
i think it has a bigger draw on us than
it would
for a white voter simply because we
don't
have those opportunities as frequently
and i don't want to say that there's
zero value to representation in the
world i think that
the its value is dwarfed by obviously
like
genuine political representation but you
know there are
obama was a symbolic victory obama did
teach some people that black people
could be clean and articulate obama did
inspire some little kids somewhere that
they could shoot higher than you know
that whatever their public school
teacher told them
to do and i think for so many you know
we learned with obama that
that was an achievable goal right and
now maybe someday
a different kind of progressive
candidate of color will come along and
teach us that we don't have to
compromise so much
on our politics to also have uh
pride and a sense of um simpatico with
our leaders
it's a final question before we go to
the post game and thank you for hanging
out yeah you're gonna be able to take
calls and ims and you know
mess around a little bit more do you
think that
i mean i i think that there's fluency
that's kind of very broadly
even you know in ways that it can be
kind of easy to make fun of like you
know here's the buzzfeed listicle about
like the 10 ways that the third season
of game of thrones like
you know like let down women or
something right right um
and i'm not saying those conversations
aren't valid but i'm just saying like
there there is a
very broad discourse with regards to
gender and race
there's no discourse on class and
there's no discourse on class as
either a category like for me i hit the
gender you know skin color jackpot
uh sexual orientation jackpot but i grew
up
really poor that absolutely strongly
influenced
my perspective my experience and
orientation to the world and
there's not even a semblance of
recognition of the need for that kind of
perspective
in public discourse and then secondly
the other way in which class
is not just and this is where i think
the intersectional analysis kind of
falls a little bit is that class isn't
just like another
category of identity it's literally a
function of how economies are designed
and it's literally a way of thinking
about
how profits are made and how things are
commodified and who benefits and who
doesn't structurally regardless of what
people's
you know brand preferences are whether
they drink beer or wine or anything like
that the terms that we like to think in
so i just think that if we don't center
class
we're not going to be not at the expense
of anything else but get people to
understand the class discourse we're
never going to be able to
achieve the types of things we're
talking about and
what do you think is the method by which
we can get
that discourse out there i think about
this
a lot yeah um because it has become
apparent to me
after years of kind of being that person
who says
don't place my language and i can say
mansplaining and all of this kind of
stuff
i've come to the place where i don't
think it's constructive and that is not
a popular
no that is not a popular view and i'm
still workshopping my feelings on this
so uh i'm gonna reserve the right to
revise
my opinion here but i i was thinking
just this morning about
um the ways in which we
talk about race this is i'm gonna answer
your question
there's no rushing take your time we
have a very bright audience
they're interested in your thoughts okay
good yeah
um i've been thinking about the ways in
which we talk about race
aren't necessarily aligned with what our
end goals are
so i might think it's appropriate to say
you are in fact mansplaining to me and
mansplaining is a legitimate phenomenon
that exists and it's a thing
right it is overused but sometimes it's
properly applied
but if the result of me saying it to you
in that way is for you to feel
like you want to shut down and not
engage in the conversation and not
understand where i'm coming from
then it has marginal utility so i've
been thinking about how we talk about
race and identity politics
and how uh white identity politics right
the kind of things that we saw in
charlottesville a couple weekends ago
isn't characterized as such but it
absolutely is but it is absolutely the
same thing absolutely
and how there are these kind of
parallels between how
uh liberals talk about race and
conservatives talk about
race and we we so so we'll say things
like
they hate us and they just voted for
trump because they don't care about us
and they like
either expressly want us to like die and
genocide and like leave the country
or at very best they're indifferent to
us and on the other side we hear
oh they hate us they want to destroy our
lifestyle they want to genocide
us um everything is about how white men
are terrible
and so why should i care about them
and liberals it's not the same i
obviously don't
believe um that each complaint is valid
uh or similarly valid but i do think
that democrats saying things like
oh they don't have like they're coming
from nowhere they're coming from pure
it's just racism
and it's who they are and it can't be
changed isn't constructive
to to having the kind of conversation
that both sides can listen to
which i think is where economic um
arguments
have so much benefit and the resistance
that liberals have
to not leading with race i think is
well founded you know we come we have a
history of uh
political movements um ignoring the ways
that
you know effects of social programs are
disproportionate and those
are are relevant but we've lost sight of
the extent to which okay yeah the new
deal was
poorly distributed was it better than
not having a new deal
and you know i don't think it has to be
all or nothing but i do think that
changing figuring out how to talk about
economic
justice and talk about racial justice
without either seeming
like that's what you're doing is the
only way we're going to bridge this gap
where we live in a world where we've
been
we've we've been told these things are
mutually exclusive
and in truth to make something seem like
a racial justice argument
does make it seem actually unappealing
to a certain segment of the population
it's the let's not leave with a
reparations argument you know and i also
think that regardless i mean to me
i think that we have to be like
a vast majority 98 like people talk
about this i was talking to this german
journalist the other day and she was
like so who
are these people that voted for trump
and i said they're republicans there's
nothing complicated about this
that's how he won right like and
republican
is the white identity party and he won
on white identity politics and the only
reason that's complicated is because we
have idiots like michael kinsley who i
talked about earlier who need to retire
but that said
so i have no interest in catering to
those people
or pretending that their beliefs are
otherwise but that said
the correct moral case and the
machiavellian strategic case that
marginalizes that is economic right and
any answer to that
from liberals that not only
delegitimizes that
also is not serious about
making sure that jeff sessions is never
attorney general again
because there's this other bizarre kind
of liberal like oh well i'm willing to
lose
and it's like well you know i'm not
because i know people that are actually
quite
deeply affected by all aspects of this
in fact
across the spectrum we talk about
whether it be class race
gender anything else we must win these
things and we must
implement an agenda that addresses all
of this simultaneously in a synchronized
way
but we're not moving out of this like
the pro the human project
is not going to keep moving the irony
was that that uh
that's the argument that was used
against us in the primary right like
you're willing to take the whole thing
you're a burning bro you don't really
care about the people
and there was no consideration of the
people that are suffering under the
status quo
none and then and actually telling
people that they're doing just fine look
america is already great jesus christ
people still ask me i have to be nicer
to hillary clinton i told people
to vote for her for god's sake
i did i did tutorial i could have been a
better spokesman
my main hillary for spokespeople comes
from the amount of time that we spent
arguing with burn your busters
account that trump was super nice to
black guys at a casino
and i think he doesn't want war not
seeing a look
i wake up reliving those calls
yeah that was the worst
oh yeah you can get into a real skewed
uh youtube world
okay thank you the first 580 members on
