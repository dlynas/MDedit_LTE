# Video
An Economic Model of Love and Kindness
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wEeHlkHaTs)

## Transcript:
i'm going to build a model of love and
kindness in this video because someone
on my other channel requested a
valentine's video and i just thought
this would be really fun so i actually
have not built this before i'm starting
the the camera so i haven't i don't know
where this is going but
i i would like to show you a few times
the process for building an economic
model now i have another video that sort
of gives the steps here i'm just going
to build one in front of you so first up
of course is what is the choice variable
that we would like to model
and the choice variable i'm going to
choose is your kindness to your partner
like how frequently do you do random
acts of kindness to them
how how kind are you when you're kind of
in a bad mood and they're kind of being
annoying but
you still try to act with respect and
kindness toward them it's just how kind
are you toward your partner that's the
choice variable now i'm going to set up
the optimization problem so kindness
towards one's partner i'm going to
define that as k
that's the choice variable in which case
we're maximizing an objective function
by choosing kindness
so we need to figure out what are the
benefits and the costs and if you can't
come up with any costs or any benefits
then
then it's not going to work as an
economic model but here you actually can
so here
so here if you're building an economic
model you're going to have at some point
a brainstorming table of benefits and
costs
um so benefit of course is the
relationship quality
the joy of your partner that's going to
be the altruistic part of your choice
here relationship quality of course is a
little bit selfish because you benefit
from having a high quality relationship
establishing a quality character in
yourself is another benefit here
now what are the costs the costs are
going to be effort obviously
this kindness probably takes time
and i think that's enough for now
now i'm not going to put all of this in
there because you want to keep models
somewhat simple you're sort of
simplifying to the most important costs
and benefits i'm going to put
relationship quality as one of the main
benefits i'm also going to put joy of
your partner in there
because i'd like to build in an altruism
thing and of course altruism can relate
to character and the effort cost i think
is going to be um the biggest cost that
i can think of
so now of course i'm going to build in
the benefits
now you noticed that i placed an
importance weight in front of the
benefit joy for partner and the reason i
did that is this important suite is a
good way of modeling altruism
so i've set up a basic model on kindness
toward your partner
now of course you might set up a model
because you're trying to actually think
through
why is my partner being unkind to me and
you want to think through some problem
so that's when you might start to add
exogenous variables that would be
interesting
so in particular i'm worried about the
times when my partner is not kind in
which case i'm thinking about what kinds
of things actually increase
effort of kindness
and i'm thinking how annoying your
partner is
how moody you are like if you're in kind
of a bad mood it's a lot more effort
to be kind so maybe how often you're in
a bad mood is something that you would
like to build in
and i'm going to call frequency of your
bad moods
be and of course that's frequency of the
bad moods of you which is the person
whose model this is from but you also
might want frequency of your partner's
bad mood because when they're in a bad
mood it's much much more difficult to be
kind to them
so i'm going to have b 1 and b 2. and of
course where do those fit in this model
will they fit in the effort function
so the effort you have to exert is not
only a function of how kind you are to
your partner but it's also a function of
how frequently you are in a bad mood and
how frequently they are in a bad mood
and those are of course exogenous
variables so that's just a fun model
it's a valentine's day model now of
course kindness isn't the only um choice
you're talking about when you're talking
about love and relationships so i'm
going to do another video on
communication in relationships and a lot
of times that means communicating when
it's hard when there's difficult things
to talk about including what kinds of
bad moods do they have that make it
really really hard for you to put forth
the effort to be kind so i mean i i just
wanted to do a different video because
kindness is this positive thing but
relationships aren't healthy if there's
if there's no such thing as working
through conflict and
sorting through differences and that's
of course a hard part of relationships
and it can be modeled using an economic
model so that will be my second
valentine's day video
