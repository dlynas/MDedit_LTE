Christopher Alexander and the Nature of Order (HD)

## Transcript:
i think artemis has finished dismantling
the the moon soul
so that this discussion is about
christopher alexander nature rewarder so
for us don't know
so he was born in vienna but um
one of his parents was jewish and so
after angelus in 1938 to britain quite
sensibly so he grew up in the uk he was
about two
he was educated at cambridge harvard at
mit he taught at berkeley for
a very very long time
and he just passed away just quite
recently and uh yeah there were
obituaries about him in all the major
newspapers and all the architectural
christ so
who cares i mean you know
lots of people hang around and say
clever things
uh so i could say he's one of the
leading critics
of both the theory but especially the
practice you know the actual built form
of post-war architectural mainstream
there are a lot of those i think it's
one of the earlier ones
and it was very influential
i think if you look at any
urban design or architectural movement
that is not in the corporate mainstream
post 1945
they will all be very aware of
christopher alexander and very often be
inspired by some of his work so things
like the new urbanism and so forth
they're borrowed heavily from from his
earlier work
now the point i'd like to make before we
get into the details is you don't have
to agree
with everything that christopher
alexander says or has said or wrote to
think is he's interesting i think he's
one of those characters that
was quite pugnacious and and
i think sometimes even a bit adversarial
to the mainstream a bit of a contrarian
and so sometimes some of the things he
said or did were a little bit quirky
nothing nothing offensive but you know a
little bit quirky um but he he's very
very interesting because of the way he
looked at architecture and built space
i think because of the reasons he looked
at architecture and built space
so and and and the approach that he took
to analysis so it's much more empirical
in his work and much more uh given to
conciliates i'll talk about these things
than most theoreticians most designed
theoreticians just write some stuff down
and say this is the way it is
you know and they may give you one or
two examples but they don't really
justify it
in a way that
an engineer or even a social scientist
would find satisfying they don't offer a
lot of data he did
um
and also he was very uh interested in
the humane side of design basically you
know it's a biophilic is it does it make
people feel good is it you know is it
something that makes you happy and
that's something that you know was
considered kind of a visible
consideration by most people
in most fields after world war ii it's
very technopathic right people like it
who cares what do they know right
so his uppermost goal was to build in a
way that created a feeling of
satisfaction and contentment so that
already makes him a bit of an oddity
because the idea of art post you know
certain course world war one but i would
say mostly 1890s is the you of rupture
or questioning the idea of of of you
know feeling satisfied or contact
um and and so you wrote about this a lot
and it's not an obvious thing i think a
lot of people i was speaking to someone
about this who's not
an art historian or or that you know
involved in design history and so forth
and and they said well doesn't everyone
do that
you haven't been you obviously haven't
paid attention
no that's the opposite of what most
people do
uh i mentioned conciliate so concilius
this is the dictionary definition is the
idea that
you can borrow methodologies and um
whether there are you know hard
technology
and and
numerical methodologies or even just
approaches
to analysis from adapt from a number of
different fields and bring them together
to reach
a more solidly based conclusion
so you study architecture but study also
maths a lot that's why you started as a
math
guy transportation theory he did a lot
of computer science i think a lot of i.t
people
some of the design of languages and meta
languages borrow from some of his work
he was one of the world experts on
vernacular building and the culture of
building in
in all kinds of societies
anthropology design systems blah blah
blah
and again that's not something you can
say most designed theoreticians most
design theoreticians went to
you know studied art history or went to
design school they got a degree and so
they're experts
but they really haven't studied any of
the other fields that could impact on
that
um we'll talk about some of the evidence
of empiricism in his work but i think
one of the best ways to see how
dedicated alexander was
to getting things right and basing them
on data and evidence is the fact that he
constantly revises his own work his most
influential work his most best-selling
book this one was published in 1977 and
i think most people that published a
book i think he still sells roughly like
30 000 copies a year
um that's it they just spent the rest of
their life defending how you know the
fact that it's flawless and perfect and
wonderful and everybody must buy it they
don't spend years revising and rewriting
and bringing out lots of other books and
it's a very unique quality that he had
so some exhibits in the case of why we
should care about christopher alexander
roughly in chronological order
so one of the things that really
endeared me to mr alexander long after i
was familiar with his work and
interested in his work but i started
actually looking at his life history
mostly for this presentation uh but
was that we share something from a very
early age he was fascinated by the idea
of beauty which i think a lot of people
that are aesthetic are
but specifically as to whether
there was some kind of
information or formula or or objective
set of data that you could apply to
beauty as well as just say i like that i
don't like that
okay you have a different opinion great
you know um you know was there something
deeper and and more complex but but also
more reproducible in that and so when he
was at cambridge and he was a
scholarship student he was not well off
his parents you know basically had to
leave everything behind when they moved
to the uk the very rich people he spent
his own money to hire an aesthetics
professor as a tutor to sort of just to
see whether he could get
you know a better understanding of the
field of aesthetics it didn't work out
for
for reasons i think you'd be familiar
with if you saw my last presentation but
you know the fact that he did that i
think is extraordinary
um
i think that um and now i'm referring to
some of the
topics that we covered in my
presentation i did a few months ago the
one about the potential
aspects of objectivity and aesthetics
he he pursued a sort of classical humane
concept of beauty as opposed to a
romantic or
individualized concept of beauty
and and here are a couple of quotes
which i think
are again very good at illustrating his
way of thinking
um
he felt that as an architect or as a
designer everything around us either
makes us raises our spirits a little bit
or or doesn't
and the job of a designer is for things
to work obviously so the
ability shouldn't fall about your ears
and they should be affordable but they
should also do this they should lift
your spirits a little bit that runs
contrary to
i think the mainstream concept of what
all of that should do um especially in
the practice not so much in the theory
but in the practice
and and my favorite part about his
approach to design is that he wants to
make a building which is like a smile on
a person's face not just bring a smile
to a person's face but like a smile
and if you have if there's anyone in
your life that you care about and they
genuinely smile at you
you know what that effect feels like
right especially if it's a child or
someone who's maybe you know in a
difficult situation
and the smile at you you know that
that's a he wanted the building to feel
like that
so i very very quickly covered some of
the ground that we covered a few months
ago about different views of beauty
there are lots of theories but the two
main ones are the classical theory which
is canonical either are rules to it
however difficult they may be to uncover
their objective rules they're universal
they're not they're not dependent too
much on where you come from or what your
name is or how old you are and they
apply to large numbers of people so
they're collected the more
contemporary uh i think uh romanticist
viewer beauty is aesthetic music which
beauty is contingent it depends on your
background it depends on what you've
learned or you've been taught it's
subjective
it's cultural so you know we may find
something beautiful other people find
very very very ugly and it's very
individual it's very personal and so
they both have i think a role in modern
life and so this is an example of
something that is rule-based and
producible and this is a painting by by
roth uh which has plot colors i i
searched for a while to find a lot of
painting because they painted all kinds
of colors and that's
that's much more unique and in a very
neutral sense of the word it's arbitrary
it's it's roth's view of what is
beautiful uh you know it doesn't it's
not trying to tell us that you should
stick as beautiful as what you thought
was
or or at least valid or interesting
um
now what i mentioned hutchinson before
in relation to alexander you might
remember from the presentation francis
hutchison was a 17th century philosopher
and i think probably one of the best
commentators on on this fusion of the
different ideas of beauty and aesthetics
and and you know he wrote a lot you
can't really knock it down to one
sentence but but one sentence that
recurs was uniformity within variety so
if you look at a wood you know it's not
symmetrical it's not perfectly
geometric right it's it's it's eagle the
piggledy you know one flower is zero and
trees there and and each flower is
slightly different from the next star
the trees but there's some rep there's a
lot of repetition right they're not
completely random you know they have
triangular tree next to it they have a
tree that's atomized and so forth and
and the same is true of most
architecture created through most times
that's got lots of different sometimes
contrasting elements
and and details and this vary from from
building to building from time to time
from place to place but there's some
recurring aspects you know uh doorways
tend to be clearly marked and then have
some kind of hierarchy of structures and
messages and so forth
and and you might remember at the
conclusion that was my conclusion my
opinion which i think alexander shared
that uniformity within variety in a new
adaptive sense
balances the need that we have for
stimuli to the sympathetic system
especially to the parasympathetic system
and so the beauty can be defined in lots
of ways but essentially it's something
that mostly mostly not only but mostly
reassures and delights us and there's a
great deal of validity to challenging
and and questioning but perhaps it's not
right to conflate it and use the same
word it's something else it's not beauty
so that's the quotes again um
so that's his background that's where he
comes from this is his first major work
when he was like
when he was 26 he published his
dissertation in 63 it became a book
short book
it was very well received the american
institute of architects basically
created the price for research because
usually they only gave prices for
buildings or or or designs of buildings
so they created that so they could give
them this price and they've been running
it since because it's just a research
project it says nothing about specific
building
and
it's quite complex i haven't read it
i've read you know sort of synopsis of
it
but it basically used set theory which
was very popular at the time to come up
with an algorithm that would allow you
to reduce
the number of design criteria
based on how strongly they're
interrelated with each other so that you
could produce a hierarchical decision
tree and this is a hyper simplified one
imagine you
you are designing a kettle you want it
to work you want to be affordable so
that breaks down into a number of other
sub-categories and so on and so forth
and so you may have 21
design things you you you take all these
boxes you meet these criteria you meet
this bacteria and you have a good kettle
and you know it's a lot more complex
than that believe me but that's the kind
of thought there is to reduce complexity
to where it is tractable
while taking into account design
criteria
so you know very high profile again i
think most people would have just
saddled with that and just riffed on
that for the rest of their career
but that wasn't him
um
before the book was published and after
the dissertation he went off to india he
was just interested in indian culture
he's a bit of a i guess he called a
little bit of an alternative guy
and he went to live in a village in
gujarat
and he used some of the methodology that
he developed for his dissertation to
study the patterns of usage of
of the time of the buildings and also
the patterns of construction okay
and uh and that's fine and so he does
that for for a bit of time then he goes
back to harvard
um someone in the government of gujarat
uh found out that he that he created
these uh
yeah he created these diagrams and got
in touch with him because the government
was going to create a new dam he was
going to flood that village and so they
needed to build a new one where they
moved all these people to a safe
location and they thought well you can
help us design it
and because he was very interested in
doing things evidence-based he thought
you know i could do this very badly you
know kind of so pseudo anthropologists
i've parachuted in for a few weeks and
now i know everything about how people
in gujarat live and i designed their
village for them
right and he didn't do that
now if any of you have ever met an
architect or went to architecture school
or anything like that you know there's a
there's one in 10 million architects at
that age that would have the ability to
say i don't know enough to do this so
i'm going to screw it up so our refusal
right
especially right
absolutely same with economists and and
and but but especially i was like yeah
i'm a genius right i'm going to make the
best damn villages i've ever seen so
refused to do it he hated himself
because i hated myself for it but i
couldn't do it but what he took away
from that is that okay maybe i shouldn't
know enough to do that next time
somebody asked me so he spent quite a
bit of time
while the book was being edited studying
the anthropology or vernacular
architecture you know why you know why
did we have this kind of shape in one
place and a different shape why is the
door here in one culture and he was
looking at
you know very vernacular architecture
the way they intended in the 60s and 50s
which was usually architectural what
they used to call primitive people so
like non-rich people about you know
houses in westchester county but you
know
tribes and that sort of thing uh and and
it it occurred to him that there were
clearly rules at work everywhere it
wasn't just what was available in terms
of materials
that's important but there were rules
that were being followed and there were
rules in the sense that there were legal
requirements no one's going to arrest
you if you built your your roof in a
different way but they arrived at these
patterns over a period of time and so i
thought okay this is interesting and
also
if we have to discover what these are
when we build something we have to
involve the users you know from from day
one which again is something that people
give lip service to but they don't
really do
and he came up with this phrase which as
you can see obviously endeared him to
the architectural profession
so most of the wonderful places in the
world were not made marked as they were
made by people you know none of these
buildings were designed by
a high ranking or even an architect
and the way they can they
i've done a little bit of research in
this type of building arrangement it's
actually quite an interesting set of
mathematical properties to it but you
know people that didn't didn't look at
this formula
they just had a number of rules like you
know you obviously can't build your
house you know stick in front of mine so
because you can't get out the simple
things but also they angle that to each
other
and doors you know shouldn't be right in
front of so that we will have a door
open we can't see through two houses
right supremacy and so on and so it it
generates the shape
and almost naturally
and so in 1965 he wrote a book basically
saying you know the book that got the
prize in 1961 1963 it's wrong if you're
talking about cities and neighborhoods
in urban design the city is not a tree
you know
these requirements are not purely
hierarchical they interact
so if these requirements were like this
this is set theory they were all nested
within each other then you could draw a
decent tree and you can draw a tree with
some overlap but in reality salt these
some of these
relationships are are too complex
to conceptualize in this way
and so he believed and he said this in
this piece of work that
both in terms of the layout the
organization the design of built
environment but also the decision making
and in his opinion
the actual political and administrative
ruling of a built environment a city or
neighborhood should not be centralized
it should not be decentralized it should
be distributed
now how you run a city on a distributed
government system i don't know i think
everyone ever found out so it never
happened but certainly if you look at
street patterns right
this kind of street pattern
consumes a lot more flow you know it's a
nightmare if everybody have right if
everybody that goes from here to here
has to go to the middle and come back
out that wouldn't work right
uh and this also is kind of way so if
you have a packer like that it works
better so
that was the idea um
got a lot of slides i'm not gonna spend
a lot of time on this one but
this approach of
trying to meet different requirements
without necessarily saying this one
comes before this one and this one comes
before that one has some interesting
um
um repercussions even if you're looking
at just two requirements which is trying
to not have intense too intensive ground
coverage so you have some trees
uh but also people be able to move from
one place to another
uh in a way that that is very you know
so in a building this size um like built
like this
you know you can go up and down at this
way not that way which for instance in a
security of safety issues
is problematic right
if there's a fire
the stairs better be fireproof right now
but also uh it creates all kinds of
issues that you know
um
you're never gonna go outside to see one
of your neighbors ever
right and so you put a lot of different
and so his view was for instance that a
medium rise medium coverage pattern on
average for residential work better for
a number of reasons
i'm sorry that i'm really glossing over
a lot of these things i mean you could
make a presentation out of just this one
slide and the work that he did for it
but i wanted to give you a bit of an
overview
having done a lot of this work he
actually did get involved in some builds
and and you know like the one in peru
was interested because not only did they
move he and his team moved to this place
in peru uh but actually did some of the
work that people there did so if a guy
was a carpenter he did you know they
kind of helped him they followed him
around and did some of the work and so
the idea was to really get into you know
into what people were living their life
experience and how they were designed
and they designed it and built it
together
um all of this led to uh three books
which were published in a funny order
the order in which you should read them
is this one you can see they were
published in the opposite order
um
the most influential is a pattern
language which is this book
and i'm going to pass it around if you
want to take a look at it
it's a quirky book the way the
illustrations are done the way he writes
about things is halfway between whole
earth catalogue which by the way was
inspired by this word and very
hippie-ish and there's some quite
technical stuff in there as well
and the idea was that
he after years of observation and study
he identified 253 patterns which we
thought were recurrent
at the level of organizing a whole area
a region a town a neighborhood a street
or square a building or a room
okay and the idea was that you have to
try to
implement as many of these as possible
to generate
a live a lived environment a built
environment that that was
conducive to people enjoying it and
having it working well for them
if you'd like to know i won't go through
253 of them i'm just going to give you a
couple of examples
number four agricultural values now
if you you'll see the article each
chapter has a fair amount of explanation
and sometimes
they often refer to papers and research
so it's not just aphorisms you should do
this because you know i'm christopher
alexander and private you should do this
so explains it better than that but the
basic idea of this pattern for instance
is that the areas the bottom of valleys
or near rivers are are should be
privileged for agricultural or open use
and and you know you should try and
build away from them so either upslope
or away from the rivers among other
things that don't get flooded as much
uh which like across the land gets
flooded
not almost ideal but it's better than if
a house or
neighborhood gets flooded and so you
know this is something that seems you
know nowadays in planning is universally
applied and i can tell you that well
actually in this country so much but uh
you know but
there was a time when this wasn't
universally applied and people did find
out that you know
they're ruling a lot of very cultural
land it was easily reachable land at a
reasonable slope and so on and so forth
identifiable neighborhood so they said i
got an idea that's kind of very widely
certainly amongst new urbanists but i
would say almost all planners and they
think that okay if you have a large area
that's not a village
it's a good idea to subdivide it
conceptually administratively
potentially and certainly in terms of
build space with the subunits that have
some cohesion
where the main roads are on the outside
of the unit so you can reach all the
different ones easily but they're not
sort of penetrating that bit and that
have a certain size you know now people
talk about a five-minute walk
uh diameter
this was his approximation
so that kind of size
that's an example of another pattern
another pattern is the idea that we
should have public outdoor room
uh i picked this pic i took this picture
i picked this specifically because
whereas
this place and the one i showed you of
the other town in italy these are world
famous relatives famous beautiful places
right so it's okay taking your examples
like
from really well-known lovely places we
can't all build like that this is a very
ordinary town in portugal that no one
that doesn't live next to it has ever
heard of it's not a famous tourist place
okay
but it has a lot of characteristics that
he was talking about it's like a room
this is mostly enclosed it's not just a
big open plaza windswept and so forth
uh it's mixed use you can actually get
there by car so you know if you you
don't feel like walking for 500 yards or
you can't some people can't you can get
there but it's not car dominated it's
not just big highway huge parking lot
it has mixed you know it has houses and
shops it has cafes and he thought having
something like that in every
neighborhood a certain scale it's not
some nice thing to have because it looks
cute you know it makes your life better
it means you can spend some time around
your neighbors or pastors buys or
visitors
in a way that that is that is socially
another practical language so remember
they go all the way down to
shapes of rooms right and in retrospect
i should have picked patterns that are
more based on individual homes because
something that we're all familiar with
right we all have a place to live in
hopefully and we've lived in houses
none of us i think has designed a whole
neighborhood but we maybe decided we
wanted this house rather than that house
or maybe done some work on our house but
sorry so this is the lowest um
radiant one i've done roofs you know you
think a roof
it's kind of a matter of personal choice
i like it like this you like it like
that and you felt that no no there's
lots of research and lots of great
reasons to think that a roof should be
place a psychological role not just a
structural role to keep the rain out and
it should be roofie i.e i should have a
slope uh and it shouldn't be
just kind of
this roof according to him would be a
very very bad roof it just kind of melts
into nothing it's barely noticeable it's
just there
this one's got a better pitch
but
it's not strongly marked and it doesn't
have much of an overhang one of the
things the roof should do is overhang so
you know it doesn't rain down your
building it's actually from a from a
purely practical point if it makes a lot
of sense
and and he also felt that that as as you
get close to the entrance the roof would
be lower or there should be another roof
as you as you have in this case so in
this view there was a an objective
difference between this roof design
which is a pulling this one which is
trying but it doesn't quite get it and
this one which whether you like the
house or say statistically or not is a
good move
so that was that was the idea
and this book like i said has been
tremendously influential um
if you i would say if you if you buy it
or borrow it or take it from the library
don't do what i did don't start from you
know how should we design the south of
england start from the back
he did it in in order in diminishing
order of size but since none of us again
you know are or the prime minister or
the minister for the environment start
from the back start from like you know
things a room should have windows like
this so there should be different types
of chairs and blah blah blah and you
know it's just quite interesting again
you don't have to agree with everything
or do everything i disagree with some of
his patterns or some of his observations
but it was it was quite useful piece of
work
buddy wasn't happy with that because
because as time went on he noticed that
there were lots of architects and
planners that you know that he met that
he worked with that were genuinely
trying to use as many of his patterns as
possible you know within the constraints
of real life and real world and what the
client wants and what's allowed right by
by the zoning regulations and the
building regulations
and even some of the work that he did
because obviously he built you know he
designed the built-in buildings he felt
that you know
following these patterns
created buildings and streets and in
some cases
by this point you were having some even
some neighborhoods that were began to
they're beginning to
um
take his you know take his theories into
into account
they were very usable people liked them
but he felt they did not have and that's
that's almost a straight quote they
rarely achieve the elegance
of long-established architectural idioms
and this really got him into trouble
because he very often refers to
vernacular and traditional architectural
shapes
and so a lot of people a lot of
contemporary architects felt that he was
regressive that he was reactionary he
was saying that we should all build
buildings like they did in the old days
i do personally he didn't
he didn't like he said i don't know
let's build completely new buildings
differently as long as they are
satisfying as those right so if we can
extract if we can distill some of the
things that made those buildings in lots
of different countries in lots of
different periods and in cultures you
know instinctively obviously satisfying
then you know knock yourself out you
know we don't have to build but but but
the label kind of stuff
and so you thought they don't have that
kind of sense of rightness of wholeness
and i'll explain later what he meant by
wholeness
uh and and so he went back to the
drawing board and he wrote four books
2 300 plus pages i don't think anyone i
think there's nico salingaros who's
probably his main
follower and an architect and designer
has written some very good books
maybe he's read it all i don't think
anyone else has read at all
but the one that i think
that um
so the title of all the books together
is the nature of order an essay on the
art of building the nature of the
universe
and so what he was trying to do
and in this it was partly inspired by
some advances in in applied mathematics
in the 80s
and 90s
to create a generative grammar
for building and what we mean by
generator grammar is imagine you're
talking about language okay in philology
in in in a language you have a bunch of
nouns you have some rules right the verb
goes here then you know
you conjugate it you have adjectives you
can't just have centers made of lots and
lots of adjectives i mean you can do
that but it won't you won't be very
successful in communicating so typically
you want at least
a verb and a subject you know and so on
and so forth but then what you can write
with those words and those rules is you
know it's infinitely varied right
but you generate with this relatively
simple set of rules you can generate a
lot
and the idea was that
the reason
that all a lot of work including work
that he had inspired didn't
didn't really fit and didn't really
create the sense of natural elegance was
that he had described
things that he observed in successful
build space he was describing the
symptoms he wasn't examining the causes
and the causes
are
he felt uh was what was a morphology
that is innate to to nature the universe
and if it is there is a morphology that
is innate to nature in the universe
context though it may be
that's what we're used to that's what
we're evolved to like you know um most
people don't have to be taught that
flowers or or or tree in summer is
beautiful we just kind of perceive that
because you know since we were you know
sort of hairless monkeys in the savannah
you know that's what we've been used to
and so there is a great deal of research
most of it post alexander suggesting
that a lot of the things that people
tend to like and again it's a it's not a
black and white thing you know it's not
like we must all like this thing but
people tend to like certain aspects like
you know they like open space but with
some kind of enclosure at least on one
side and so on and so forth
are are evolutionarily derived right so
they're neuro adapted and he felt if
there is an underlying order
organization of morphologies in the
universe
build space that
mirrors that some degree is naturally
felt to be satisfying elegant
it's like a smile on someone's face
and so
you remember mandrel brought this
mandrel ball set in fractals now
the patterns we identified were mostly
not fractals i only mentioned fractals
because it's something that i think most
people including myself who are not
mathematicians have some awareness often
so this is a type of uh this type of
cauliflower as you know that's a section
of a shell
so on and so forth that's a purely
invented thing but the point is that
the the rules
that make this kind of shape are three
or four they're really really simple
rules and yeah it's a really complex
shape
it has variety
but there's also a recognizable pattern
like hutchinson said right
it's not just it's not random it's not
just noise there's more to that than
noise but it's not perfectly predictable
it can't tilt that way and if you buy
three of these they'll never be
identical right
um like snowflakes
now
the concept of fractals that's most
basic is the repetition of skate the
repetition of the same shape or the same
rules at different scales okay and now
when you do fractals in a laboratory you
do perfect practice
in real life there are all kinds of
constraints there's a mountain there a
valley here blah blah blah so we don't
develop pure factors but there's
definitely evidence of fractality this
is a temple in india okay
in the sense that the shapes
this shape is repeated in the smaller
parts and lots of elements at the larger
there are the three or four scales at
which they are repeated or in a city
this is a
paris i did you know and this is the the
plan of the open spaces these places
that you can traverse that a bird could
fly across with a smacking or something
you know you have the sand right then
you have some of the major roads then
the smaller roads and subsidiary roads
and so on and that develops kind of
natural right you don't have you know
but
it's possible
especially you know with modern
technology for engineering to plan
something that that says okay you know
for a large area we won't have that you
know okay that's fine but it has
repercussions it has repercussions there
are traffic of all the places how
walkable it is how it feels to be in it
uh whether we want to hang around that
part of town or sometimes
always never
so that that was part of the things you
identified so if you take a spinski
triangle you know that's the one that
was
called one and it obviously started like
triangle that's three and so on and so
forth right
and
his view was that some of these shapes
are mirrored they're not perfectly
increased but they're mirrored
in a lot of traditional architecture and
traditional design
and and that may be a reason why
we tend to look at it and find
a certain sense of rightness about it
so his point of view and this is
slightly metaphysical that the order of
space is prior to the question of
function because the function stems from
the order
you cannot create
a function a useful intelligent
non-perverse function that is outside of
reality and what works in the universe
and so the shape is also part of that so
they have to go together you can't say
you know
i'll just this you know i'll come up
with a function that disregards the
natural morphology of reality you can
make this case obviously psychologically
they come up with an ideology that goes
against who we are as human beings it
typically doesn't pay off very well
because
and so the human says you have a
generative grammar
you know a relatively basic
very relatively simulated set of
naturally arising dynamics which work
with and also against each other they're
often conflictual right you know one
thing pushes you one direction another
requirement pushes another direction
that's what happens in nature right
know for some things it's good to be a
very large animal but if you're very
large animal it's just difficult to
dissipate heat you need a lot of food
and so on and so forth so there's
conflicting demand
that happens also in degenerative
grammar
and
he thought he identified 15 properties
and i'll warn you they're labeled in a
very pithy way so without explanation
they look a little bit kind of arbitrary
but these properties
if you take this into consideration you
are designing your building in the way
that the universe works and the way that
the shape of snowflakes works and
they're not like that randomly they you
know that they work like that because of
physics and chemistry and
and you know
thermodynamics
um and so similarly you can do the same
with buildings so these are the 15
properties
um
again i
i don't want to keep you here until
three o'clock in the morning tomorrow so
you know i won't talk about all of them
or explain them in very great detail
because they are quite deep so you look
at something like levels of scale is the
idea that
scale
should be repeated at more than one
level so essentially if you have one big
giant wall
that doesn't reproduce anything that we
find in nature
or or let's say nurturing nature maybe
like a huge vast salt flat is like that
but everything dies in a huge glass salt
flat you put that you know we grew up in
dappled shade
basically with trees and grass and so
forth and also lots of different types
of scale three's a typical example right
it's a big tree and there's smaller
branches and smaller smaller smaller
plates and they're repeated they're
always it's a pseudo-fracture so that's
how you have levels of scale and so on
and so forth i'll give some examples so
one of the patterns to talk about strong
centers and the idea is that
to tie together a building or an area
you need some kind of focus
it can be just kind of random
uh it's disorienting and so the space
the center can be an empty space and
that's a very famous uh building in
tunisia the mosque of parihuan
you know it's a very well defined space
it's not completely you know you can see
the arcades so it's it's permeable to
the to the eye to the person
it also has
secondary foci you know these big towers
smaller one and a big one so there's
this sense of centeredness
but in a very small building like these
traditional houses there's a
small place in
a tiny bit of puma where they built
these
these houses and it's become i think
quite famous certainly in italy but i
think most places uh because they're so
unique and in this view the center was
this big here
from which the whole roof seems to kind
of originate
right it's clearly a focus you know
you can't look at this building without
your eye and going to that little bubble
at the top
um
and so he felt that this big visual
focus
organized our thoughts both as a as a
inhabitant and as a designer for how to
develop this
the other one is the another property
talks about is alternating repetition
you know sometimes you need big
buildings you know if you've got a big
bank or a big big office or a factory
you need a big building and a big
building needs a lot of windows now you
can just repeat the same identical
window over and over and over and over
and over
but the way he explained that that was
collapsible information
it's
you know
you're not adding any anything more you
know it's just a lot of the same thing
and so his view was that
the there should be
some contrast in the repetition so this
is also a building that has a lot of
windows it's used for the same purpose
as another building it's of a different
period of a different time but there is
a variation between these windows and
these because these are framed by
columns and columns appears or or
columns
and then they're different on each floor
so there's variation along both axes and
this which is
many near classical buildings don't do
but this one does because impediment is
triangular and round or regular and
round and triangular so the idea was
that because you do need to repeat
elements in the building you do right
you can't set one window in the building
that size or one gigantic window you you
know it helps if that repetition is
somehow punctuated essentially
local symmetries that's another one then
at the beginning it kind of takes a lot
to decide what he's talking about
so the idea is that
symmetry again is something that helps
us divide and understand and
perceptualize but this building has one
symmetry along this axis and then it
just repeats endlessly okay um
simples
has lots of symmetries and they're and
they're local in the sense that they're
not absolute symmetries right so along
this axis it's not symmetrical this bit
is longer than the bit of the back you
can't see it there but you'll remember
but this section is symmetrical this is
obviously symmetrical the whole building
is symmetrical there this is our radial
symmetry these elements individually so
the idea i guess is tied to the idea of
scale of different levels
it's not just one big symmetry but lots
of symmetries nested into each other
and so if i could just summarize
and these are more my words and this
word so apologies if i'm misrepresenting
mr alexandria but
nature manifests some morphologies which
seem to be repeated they're fairly
universal they work on many different
scales and they interact and they're
regular
and so the result of that because
they're so complex and they interact
it's very very complex
complex to the point where it's almost
chaotically generated but it's not
arbitrary or random and there's a
difference both mathematically and i
think conceptually
so order is not simple a bleak
simple thing is not ordered or rather
it's an order as such a simplistic
collapsed scale that it's not satisfying
maybe you could say it's too easy
to make it orderly by it's a little bit
like the old it's not engaging it's the
old thing that you know
if you were political you could say it's
the idea that a disorder being too
simple is a bit like what seneca said
they make of the romans conquering
saying they make a desert and call it
peace like it's easy to keep the peace
to kill everybody you know
proper piece so what we wouldn't well we
wouldn't interpret a species people
living peacefully together not like i
kill everybody that else peace you know
right so similarly order should not be
bleak or sparse order is complex we are
adapted to recognize this complexity and
to find it satisfactory so in some way
it should be mirrored in what we
designed especially large things so if
you're designing a social seller okay
fine make it simple i don't care it's me
but you're talking about a building or a
neighborhood or a street you know it's a
very large thing which people are forced
to see by the way if they live there or
near there and so it should it should
have some of these characteristics
and that and that appreciation of order
in this complex
generative order emergent order is what
you could say that's what we perceive as
beauty especially in large conflicts
settings
so that's a treason example of national
order
and this could say this is a capitaline
building wrong could be an example of
man-made order
and i would argue this is neither order
nor it's obviously not natural this is
my name
now some critiques of alexander first of
all he took a very highly moralistic
tone
and you'll see that in this discussion
he had with that with another architect
you know uh you know he has a moral
obligation to implement this property as
well
i think in our idea to tell somebody you
have to do this you know not not like i
do it but in your own way but you have
to do it otherwise you're you're
breaking some kind of moral code
you know in social sciences we tend to
avoid that kind of topic it's not it's
not done and so i think you know these
were like puget and morris you know i
mean i think he argued with
eat lots more evidence usually just set
stuff you know my opinion you should do
this okay thank you you know but you
know he's a lot deeper than that but he
has the same tone you know that everyone
that does something different he's a bad
person
and you know that's i think i think that
in some ways didn't help him you know um
the other part is that yeah you know
he's he's um you know
vernacular buildings where he's
influenced certain and so people kind of
simplistically said also we should build
like little old houses like they did you
know in the middle ages you know how do
we build like bridges spanning like
large areas
and i think it's a bit unfair but this
idea that it was regressive is a very
common critique
and just to see just how pugnacious and
and and easily wild he was there's a
infamous debate that again in 1982 with
peter eisenmann who well not a very
famous artist a fairly well-known
architect and i think
it was a little architectural critic
uh and you know alexander has kind of
kind of lost it and became rude and used
rewards to him which you don't do in a
debate in a university between two you
know two professors
um you know um
it tends to
okay so so what alexander says what i'm
quoting that's in green and azerman is
in that nice orange there
so
as i'm going to say look postmodern
structuralism
i won't bother you with the definition
of course moderate factualism
something happened there yes

it's been doing this recently i don't
know why
do you think i can think of us to
research
um has anyone uh seen the buildings the
huge tower blocks uh on the way to
instagram park or uh the uh the modern
tower blocks and victoria bridge road
yes
um my father was involved in the
construction those in which he deeply
apologizes
because they're bloody awful right they
have been actually
a total failure
in croatia the first um block of flats
was ever built and it was
it was an idea of a reactionary against
you know small houses okay so okay wait
okay so what happens um so eisenmann
says look postmodern structuralism also
challenges some of the simplifications
of early modernism and so you know
they're saying similar things to you
and he and he makes a very important
point he says look i don't care what
they're right on these
slightly obscure dense pieces of paper
look at their buildings and if you tell
me that oh yeah i'm also seeking balance
and music and complexity but what you're
building is a lot of blank walls or just
sheets of glass as far as i can see
you know that's nonsense so let's look
at the actual building so that already
starts being a little bit
confrontational and so it says look
let's talk about a building we both like
everybody likes shock cathedral it's
interesting you guys says actually i
find the truck i think they're boring i
went to shark i went to the restaurant i
didn't go inside the cathedral once you
see one gothic cathedral you've seen
them all
so you know he's taking acting also
quite a strong
ideological maybe doctrinaire view of
things
uh and so he's like you know so so
alexander says okay it basically implies
you're just great
you're sick i mean you know
who doesn't like shark cathedral you
know i get to give you lots of reasons
why people like it but okay
uh i'm surprised so they finally find a
building they both like
which is palazzo kirikati by palladio
and uh
and they say things about it and
interestingly eisenmann says is that
what he finds is that
it's not such an emotional building it's
more of an intellectual building and
this is a direct quote this is not a
typology of sameness or wholeness
it's a topology of differences it
apologies transgresses wholeness and
contaminates it first of all i i don't
see how where he sees that personally
i've seen no breaks no contamination
no differences that are
breaks with there there's innovation
there is there's changes you know this
gym
we all use the same language we
construct different sentences but it's
not gobbledygook but anyway he likes it
because of that reason and then he goes
on to say
he went to the grotto and there is a
town hall by rafael monreal and what he
really liked was the fact that the
columns are really really really thin
and greedy
and that overhang is very very high so
it doesn't do what overhang is supposed
to do which is shade a lot of the
building or protection from rain because
if there's any wind at all given the
overhang is that high you will get wet
down here
and the columns look wrong you know
because i think so he said i like that i
like that sense of separation and
fragility and you know that that's not
sort of somehow the right proportions
and and that's what
it says so you're trying to produce an
effective disharmony
on purposes yeah it says okay so i'm
going to that's when he loses this i
feel incredibly angry because he's
 up the world
you know he's making bad things i mean
people feel bad why is he building
buildings you know and i mean he's got a
very long quote but what he keeps saying
is
do you think people are not alienated
enough that people are not unsettled
enough the people are are so oh yeah
everything is great everything is
wonderful i have no sorrows or problems
in my life please bring them into my
life you know really ugly building like
you know what planet do you live on so
but you know he got really really hated
i heat it up
and so you know at one point he said you
know that that eisenmann was screwing
things up anyway
so that's why one of the reasons i think
he became controversial even though i
think a lot of his ideas whether you're
with all them or not i think are
interesting and worth studying and worth
knowing about
but he had this chart uh this is mr
eiserman and anka
i'm not inviting you to judge
these buildings of his or or i'm going
to show you a few buildings or alexander
as good or bad you like him or don't
like him though you will obviously
because you know you have your own views
but i just point out where how they say
rub up against some of the pageants
that that um that alexander talked about
so this is a house by azimut
here it doesn't have a center it's not
clear the fact that it's not clear where
the front door is maybe on the other
side the boundaries are fading they're
not thick batteries like thick
boundaries but they're really kind of
aligned almost into the surroundings um
there is no symmetry obviously and there
is an inner attention there is there
isn't a sense of like you saw one thing
you know there's funny angles at each
other and you know windows or maybe a
wall should be so
it certainly doesn't conform to
you know what you may not like it but it
doesn't conform to certain alexander
like
what that was good there's another item
on building there's there's one scale
essentially i mean there's a little bit
of detail with different stones and
glass but basically it's just one large
object it's not really broken up it's
got a very funky shape which is you know
also expensive
uh but uh there's no obvious center uh
the boundaries against a bit fading the
shape is not very definite and there are
no symmetries
a scale again no center too smooth you
talked all about roughness this point
was that nothing is smooth you know if
you got a microscope and you go closer
to this this is actually quite rocket so
the idea was that a small thing can be
smooth but if you have a huge thing in
the sausage booth
you know there should be some
um some contrast some some depth to it
and and it's separate uh you know it's
very separate from its environment
this is i'm not sure what isomine was
doing here it's obviously not a building
it's a but it's a lot of very similar
concrete blocks
i think as a tank okay
so first a person will be about this big
yeah yeah yeah yeah so
a person will be about this tall that's
right so
which you know again because when you
think of the holocaust where all these
happy thoughts right no right i mean i
think we realize that the holocaust is a
you know
possibly the worst single
process in history you know and the way
he thought it made sense to memorialize
it is this way and you know obviously
people agree with him um you know other
people may have taken a different view
but anyway so
it's very single
it doesn't have lots of scales and so
forth so alexander would have been
against this kind of thing and as a man
for different reasons
liked it because it was you know this is
kind of angsty i mean right and the all
cost is a terrible thing so i guess he
was trying to communicate that you know
i know all the all the you know
uncounted that you know this is just you
know this horrible thing that happened
and you know i guess maybe that mirrors
that
i don't know that's more eisenman
and more
what about christopher alexander or
rebuild okay i don't think he was a
great architect personally um i don't
find his buildings
that satisfying
but what i find them is very humane
again i think they're more follow the
patterns that than this later
they're not very beautiful
but they don't make you they don't make
me feel like running away screaming i'm
like eisenmann's
so this is one of the very early things
it's a house you built from some rich
person in california
every quirky architect the first few
things to build is some persons as nutty
as they are says build me a house i got
money it doesn't matter right so that's
how it starts so it's built it's it's
it's
the plots there are very difficult
because they're built on quite steep
hillsides
and so you've got to have all these
different levels
and you know there's a rich american so
obviously you wanted i think there's a
pool somewhere you know basketball bit
whatever there's lots of bits and bobs
i don't i don't think it's fantastically
beautiful house really but it looks
quite livable um this is some later work
that he did
this in japan he worked quite a bit in
japan i think that's in the uk
um that's also in japan that's probably
the nicest building it's a sort of like
great hall for meetings and things in
this university in japan
um
he's got a couple of buildings very
similar to this and they were built for
one is a homeless shelter in in
california and the thing that really
struck me about it is that usually when
people build something like a homeless
shelter
i don't think they do it on purpose i
hope they don't do it on purpose but it
seems to communicate you are really a
marginal human being okay so we're going
to house you into this kind of building
because you know you're not in prison
right yeah pretty close to it
and this building you know you may or
may not like it but it doesn't
communicate that to me
you know communicates that like hey look
you know people like a bit of grass nice
windows
you know you can have one
sorry human skin it's human scale has
repeated scales lots of things that
would meet this pattern so that's it
that's right

um one of the reasons i joined the club
was to make friends and engagements i
think tonight you've done something for
me which i've not been able to to
conclude when i walk around
going abroad with him on seeing
buildings and stuff because i've never
been able to synthesize what all this
means and you've just done it before for
christopher isaac yeah
but thank you very much for this uh the
only thing i would ask and i don't think
it's been done before is please can you
send me the presentation yeah absolutely
absolutely because i would just like to
put all this together in the world so
thank you very much for doing the
presentations it synthesized all things
in my head
now i know where the intellectual
direction is that i can go in and have a
look myself thank you
thank you well i'm
touched
to be on a contrary point
christopher alexandra has probably done
the greatest damage to programming evan
because christopher alexander was
instrumental in the design patterns book
which was influenced heavily by him
which came up with what's called the
singleton pattern which i strive against
to this day
can you tell me a bit more about that
because i've i've read that that in i.t
some people took some of his work and
translated into i.t but i don't know
anything about it so okay can you sort
of explain a bit more what it is um we
might choose to take offline because
okay
um
he was involved in the uh a civil
engineer and in the early 60s of course
there's a renaissance in your brutalism
in london and the idea is that they try
to kick back on it with the things we
park buildings and the ones um
along victoria street bridge road and
they tried to introduce the stepped
approach uh to reflect on for example um
a roman athlete theatres or um greek
elements to them yeah and greek
amphitheaters also handle the light
pattern
well it was actually anti-therapy but
and they use brick rather than concrete
to try and make it give a better texture
and not give it the range stains needed
from the uk
national theater which is actually meant
to be pristine white but they used a
low-grade cement
and this needs to look pristine white
like greek
uh green color names and so forth but
the the big problem was is what they
found is the scale was dehumanizing and
what they found is massive violence
i'm not a i'm not a material determinist
i i you know the the the
um
the barbican
is
hyper brutalist not just in the
construction of the materials but but
the but the layout right so you have
this giant car tunnel and then it's very
confusing system of walkways i mean it's
really punishing design
but it works fine because it's full of
people that are you know civil servants
and city professionals and people like
that apart from the fact that there is a
serial killer in the bible okay but i
mean i don't think there have been a
number and their current serial killer
is as yet unknown
i don't think it's a barbecue that makes
people kill people i think i think that
it's like people but most of most of the
very ugly buildings were inhabited by
people that have a choice and on average
on average right this is without
justifying crime on the basis of social
conditions but on average if you take a
bunch of this people that are
comparatively less well-off and compared
to be
less
privileged you will have you know
private evangelism in chelsea
that's right
and i lived in north peckham and the
aylesbury state which had nightmares
okay i was born in denford they swept
away all the nice artists to build
to build the stuff that our context all
that we deserve and i have to tell you i
lived in peckham the dance britain
rattle okay and i was delighted when i
moved to the a gate right but very
quickly you suddenly realized what these
places were there were traps you were
stuck there like some sort of utopia
this is where you're gonna live this is
where you're gonna work you're gonna
walk to work you're going to have this
that's a you don't want to live
in a place like that it's
nightmare okay and i was glad to get out
of it and only enough money
however you know this guy okay it was
all really well for you to say oh you
look some beautiful place
but basically he did nothing for the
common man did he what did you do for me
what do you do aesthetically to the
people who are basically only 25 grand a
year okay can't afford to live in big
houses in america who kind of thought
that pillars of colleges and all that
stuff what they got they got nothing
when you talk about cannabis the
cannabis they were walkways where you
got robbed and mugged and raped that's
what you got and that's what these
people did they put us in places where
in jeopardy and it was dangerous nothing
about what this man did or any like
norman scott even none of those did
anything did anything to help the normal
person all they did was help the people
afford it and they deserve this
beautiful emphasis to do what my
granddad was one of the first people
when when they redeveloped the barbican
they built roman house my granddad
worked for arthur anderson he's one of
the first people to work for him and
became very famous in fact in that
company very wonderful stuff however he
took a picture of the barbecue built and
all you saw was blocks blocks of offices
and that's what architects do they build
 houses for people like me who earn
less than 200 grand a year okay and they
they build offices that which are
functional not be not aesthetically
lovely like the romans did all the
people did in the georgian times where
you had lovely flowing columns and all
that stuff where are they nowhere
they're just flak
some unsophisticated works of art which
appeal to people like that and as far as
i've said that man and people like that
are below are beyond contempt they did
nothing to the working classes and the
working classes people
kept that man in business and that's a
fact
sadly it's the case he showed me us the
mosque that's not that's wrong
all mosques are based on roman
impluvium three completely greek and
then the greeks
the greeks but the point is that's why
you have the square from the open
garden
i think one of the
most ugly things which is happening
raised in london are these
flat
roof extensions which you see absolutely
everywhere which are absolutely ruining
the london skyline and these aren't done
by architects or the upper classes
they're done by these sort of apple
working-class households
so if you're talking about
attacks on the aesthetic nature of

um
i don't think we could have
a more
destructive example than the way that
one was skyland
um are they built by the people
as alexander was saying earlier on those
were the best examples
you have to build black roots on the end
of the cherished houses the light you
can't build a picture or any sort of
roof being behind a building it has to
be a flat surface so the people next
door have got light otherwise that will
block the light out and then you would
never do anything i mean people put
these extensions because they think
they're putting thirty thousand of their
houses


one thing in here which reminds me of
the writing of i i'm deliberately going
to paraphrase it reminds me particularly
the writings of ted kozinski otherwise
known as the una bomber
in 9 park in section 22 we have
suggested that the fabric of society is
threatened by the mere existence of cars
