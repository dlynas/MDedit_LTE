Naomi Klein and Yanis Varoufakis | THE WRONG LESSON FROM HISTORY | Podcast 2 - YouTube
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yhz0RWJxRyg)

Transcript:
(00:01) this podcast accompanies the acclaimed new docu series in the eye of the storm which follows the remarkable journey of Maverick Economist politician and whistleblower Janis veracis both the series and podcast explore the connections between power democracy capitalism and the deepening crisis of  civilization the series is available to watch now details in the description enjoy the conversation well look maybe I should just say at the start the sort of the idea of the podcast is to explore in Greater depth the themes of the
(00:46) documentary that we're launching about janis's political Journey at at the same time um and one of the key themes is the rise of the far right and and the Spectre of fascism and I think that overlaps you know quite significantly with a lot of your work um and your recent book so I thought perhaps you could begin by kind of giving us a state of play as you see it in in North America in terms of the rise of the right and have things got worse in recent years and and kind of the possibility of Trump's return how are
(01:17) things looking um not good yeah I I can't remember an election cycle as Grim as the one we're entering in 2024 um with the combination of an unfolding genocide in Gaza uh being waged with the full partnership and Beyond just support but but true Partnership of the Biden Administration um and and Trump coming back with full force repelling every criminal investigation I think determined to to seek vengeance uh coming back in a different mood you know I think it would be a real mistake to imagine a second uh Trump term after
(02:10) this internum um as just a sort of seamless continuation of the first um he's just been marinating and rage this whole time and of course there's a huge irony in uh the way that Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner um set the table for the situation um uh that that led up to October 7th right with the the Abraham Accords with moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem and and then and Trump has just been watching this whole thing unfold and and is going to reap the benefits but yeah I think it's it's
(02:50) really a brutal situation and it has to do in part with I think a deep failure of understanding the nature of fascism of understand it in an extremely exceptional way um where it's like all it is is a sort of one toone Recreation of Hitler and musolini in the 1930s and 40s and we fail to see the omnipresence of the the fascist project in colonialism and imperialism in Jim Crow and in you know earlier Colonial genocides and and so because we turned it into something really you know I say we like in the imagination of the allies
(03:31) and in the sort of traditional Holocaust Education that I grew up with I think we fail to recognize what many um you know deep left thinkers recognized at the time in the 40s you know I'm thinking of Walter Benjamin who saw uh barbarism as the flip side of the civilizational project as he wrote you know shortly before his death um or or web de Bo and Ms Cesar who were saying that that this was imperialism coming home to Europe and that nothing that the Nazis did had not been done to the so-called you know darker Nations so
(04:11) I think we didn't understand it in that same way and so now you know the Democrats are poised to do this hit you know Trump equals Hitler you know vote against Fascism and you have a whole generation going we see fascism in Gaza we see we this is genocide now and so it isn't like a lesser evil because what's more evil than genocide so I you know I I I think we have been we are in a corner we have not been in before you know and I think I think we need to recognize when we when we are in a kind of a rupture right because there's such
(04:43) tend I think we need to learn from history but I also think we need to have the capacity to be flexible enough to see what is different you know and this is not like this is not this is not the election where you know we were it was like Bush carry you know um where it was like okay you have two pro War candidates both in favor of the war in Iraq um you know but one of them waged the war and the other you know the other just kind of tacitly supported it or actively supported but you know this this is different what Biden has done
(05:14) you know in partnership with wi with with Netanyahu is very different and and so that that old Trope right that the Democrats are always able to deploy of like well do you want us or fascism how does that work when we are seeing um we're seeing a we're seeing a fascist genocide a new iteration of it in Gaza I mean I just want to say yeah it's the same situation in the UK very much with starma backing to the hilt Israel as they carry out this genocide um Janis I wonder if you could respond to that and perhaps bring in the idea which you
(05:53) also talk about in the series which is the collusion between the far right and the center ground and the fact that they're continually feeding off each other especially electorally before I get into that I need to thank Naomi cin once again for her work particularly Naomi the fact that you mentioned genocide side three or four times uh for for someone like you to be doing this given your background your Jewish background um it is it is of central importance it is um um exactly what we need now because let's face it uh those of us who dare
(06:31) question the the activities let me put it very blandly and comically the activities of the IDF in Gaza I reply branded anti-semitic and of course you are being branded branded self- haazen Jew but it is crucial that we maintain the fight against anti-Semitism uh with exactly the same within the same project as uh maintaining the criticism The Rage Against the genocide which is happening and so you know people like you like Elan Papa like uh Gideon Levy like uh ofer CIF like our comrade in in Berlin it is heits um I think you are the the
(07:16) greatest the greatest contributors to a modicum of humanism in this present juncture so thanks for that now regarding the the rise of the ultra right and what you said Raul the the connivance between the or collusion between the authoritarian Center or the radical Center and the radical old Tri I wouldn't use the word collusion because you know the the worst aspect of it all is that there is no collusion I have no doubt that Biden hates Trump and Trump hates Biden with a passion I have no doubt that macron considers himself to
(08:03) be a true liberal whose job in this world on this planet is to fight against the alra right of Leen but it doesn't matter because they are caught in the walls they are caught in a dynamic in an infinite uh negative reinforcement Dynamic whereby what one does reinforces the other and vice versa at infinite so it really doesn't matter whether they like each other or whether they talk to one another I mean so there's no conspiracy here that's a point I make but let's face it Biden would never have been president
(08:43) if it wasn't for Trump and today Trump wouldn't be there even being considered as a POS possible president if you didn't have Obama and Biden immediately after the great financial catasto 2008 you know bailing out the bankers and condemning the masses to austerity that is what gave rise to the malignancy which Trump then represented so if they knew better Biden should have um a a picture of of trump on his bedside table with a nice golden frame and he should be sending him blowing him kisses every night before he goes to bed and Trump
(09:30) should have bidens similarly between Leen and macron macron would never have been president if it wasn't for Leen and Leen would never have been able to capture the uh the hopes and the fears and the anger of the many in France if it wasn't for the austerity policies that people like macron have been implementing for all those years uh one no your your latest book is um by the way I think it's one of what that and that's saying a lot it's one of your most insightful books and uh I have to
(10:05) say that I enjoyed it immensely especially the you know this um dialectical approach you have to um unpicking the manner in which genuine genuine feel emotions of uncovering the truth amongst rtists which is of of course Very interspersed with conspiracies and so on and so on nevertheless the the the worst aspect of it is that they have authentic emotions a lot of those emotions are Justified you know when Trump in his inauguration talked about Carnage he was speaking the truth about a large segment of the population you know the deaths of
(10:53) Despair I mean how can you as a left Winger not acknowledge that and of course the trick in the tail as they say about what Trump is doing and people like Trump is how they can weaponize these emotions in order to uh secure the authenticity of their alternative facts in other words their lies to capture the power of the public that supports them on the basis of genuine discontent go into the White House and immediately appoint somebody somebody from gold sax to be the treasury secretary and to pass legislation on behalf of the top
(11:37) 0.001% which would be absolutely lethal electorally for anyone to propose unless they've already caught up the imagination and the pain of the people who have experienced the Carnage but that is not new because as Naomi said we we we are we are going through um a retake on the mid War Peri when I was writing a book what 10 15 years ago I spent a good year it wasn't actually a good year it was a very bad year um reading almost everything that gbls had written and if you read gbl's texts especially his pamphlets and his
(12:17) speeches of the 1920s not the 1930s the 1920s before they were successful when they were at around three three and a half percent the national socialists the nais all his talks and his pamphlets and his articles um comprised 500 Words almost exactly 500 Words the first 250 words were brilliant you know I I I endorsed him it was a fantastic critique of finance of banking of capitalism of exploitation of austerity of this of that and the other right of the elites printing money on their own behalf and jeopardizing the middle class and
(13:02) the petty bua um savings and so on and then of course on around World 250 so we have to kill the Jew I mean you know the nonse secutor and then then the rest you can imagine there's no point in reading the other half but this you know the the Steve bannons of the world and the uh you know even Boris Johnson who is not as much a buffoon as he's being presented if you hear hear him speak some occasionally when he's not intoxicated um you know they are simply secondary versions of gbls because a lot
(13:39) of what they say resonates with reality and as GBL said every large lie has to be built on many a myriad of small truths and small truths that affect people and destroy their lives so this is what we're having and it's nothing new except that you know it's not second time is not as f as Marx would put it uh but it is a just a second rate version of what happened the you know the first time around and the first time wasn't the first time I mean this is what what I think is so important about understanding even the significance of
(14:19) the South African case against Israel before the icj where you have um all of these Western Powers lining up yeah for for Israel including Germany saying you know whatever whatever the result we stand with Israel um and then Namibia steps forward and says excuse me um you know Germany is it's just because you've committed genocide several times doesn't make you the Arbiter of what is genocide like how about listening to some of your victims including the the n and Herrero people who you know are recognized as
(14:56) the fir the victims of the first genocide of the of the 20th century which really gets um neglected where there's almost a not almost but really A a white supremacist way of of of sort of ranking genocide and so it's it's it's sort of like it's illegal to compare I mean increasingly actually illegal in Germany to compare the Holocaust to any other genocide right so it gets lifted out of history and and it gets treated like you you know you can't trace anything that led to it or any you know any of the the
(15:35) methods the the practices that like that you and and Hitler was explicit about this you know he said I didn't invent the concentration camps the British did um and of course the Germans ran uh horrific death camps um uh uh on Herrera territory and and and conducted medical experiments that you could draw a straight line to not only the medical experiments in awit but the race theory that animated the entire Pro uh project I mean they were measuring skulls so we we can't actually see that this as the
(16:11) second time you know we're in a loop here and we need to know one of the things I write about in in doppelganger is is my own you know I think bad Holocaust Education I went to a Jewish school a Jewish Day School and we learned you know the statistics of the Holocaust um like they were they were mathematical tables just drummed into us and a friend of mine who's one of the founders of Jewish voice for peace which is an extraordinary um you know uh uh Jewish anti-zionist organization that I've been
(16:44) a part of now for 15 years um cessily said there's that that we grew up not with remembering the Holocaust but with retraumatization that this is a culture not of remembering even though it's called like you know the the Holocaust remembrance and so on but it's actually a a a um a practice designed to keep the descendants in a heightened traumatized state right so we get it gets reenacted right like you know we would like think about the Holocaust museums where you put on to to cattle cattle cars the
(17:21) ideas to get a bodily experience and so so this is a kind of a dismemberment right in a way way it it's it's not a remembering because what remembering does is it tries to put the kind of traumatized pieces of the self back together again because what trauma does is it splits the self um and we have we we we have so-called leaders in the Jewish Community who want us traumatized to want us afraid right which is the opposite of leadership and so this is why I think this historical work is so important because what what's
(17:54) actually happening is real remembering and that this event that has been lifted out of History and that we're told we can't draw we can't we can't trace the lines that brought that that created it and we can't look at the lines that that that happened afterwards we have to just see it as this rupture in time and space we now have generations of young people who are you know the black lives matter generation who are you know the people who um you know LED roads bu fall you know who who have done the sort of
(18:26) digging about the colonial histories of Their Own countries and they are seeing the patterns and their Elders are freaking out because they actually have educated themselves and you know as you know Yannis you know you're a teacher what do we want from students we want them to be able to think critically to recognize patterns not just to memorize you know like a like like a rule don't be mean to Jews no that's not the lesson the lesson is don't commit don't don't don't don't practice othering don't
(18:57) create an in-group and an outgroup um you know and and and and all of these other principles and this is why I always say Germany is a terrible student because they learned a rule but they didn't learn a principle so now they're like okay well we're just the rule is stand with Israel but we're going to transfer all of these similar sort of patterns of thought and project them onto Muslims and Palestinians and immigrants and and so um yeah so anyway that's just a bit of a tangent but I think it's really important that we that
(19:29) that we that we get out of the practice of thinking about just a repetition of that particular kind of fascism I think we need to see this as a kind of it's a kind of a fascist constellation or uh a recurrence and and that we are in a process of of REM of truly remembering so that we can get out of the loop if that makes sense absolutely absolutely uh as I'm preparing to go to Germany uh with we are going there supp OS ly to uh promote this documentary but also I'm I'm doing some electoral work
(20:05) because as you know we have European Parliament elections coming up in June and our part is running in Germany our German comms are running in Germany under very difficult conditions we are having our you know the venues are being canceled on us simply because we mention genocide um because it seems to me that in Germany these days uh you can only mention genocide if you are supporting it not if you are opposing it um what I mean by this is that if you talk about the river to the Sea uh from an Israeli point of view that is you
(20:42) know um that's the standard nany line that's fine in Israel but if you talk about equal and Universal rights from the river to the sea that is considered to be genocide so if you oppose genocide you're being um defunded and barred um you know even within our own movement Naomi it was very difficult to make the arguments that you're making even within our own movement you know our own comrades people on the left  who intellectually agree with everything that you just said emotionally they have been essentially
(21:25) trained conditioned to use the very justifiable and Justified Collective guilt over the Holocaust in order to justify anything that Israel does in other words you know I I I I asked some of my Comer how far does the genocide of the Palestinians have to go before your Justified guilt over the Holocaust no longer prevents you from saying no to the continuation of the genocide the Palestinians and the answer was infinitely I mean they they didn't actually there's no but it was clear that there is no quantity
(22:12) of Palestinian blood that needs to be shed before they would say no this is this is this is unacceptable that this is genocide itself um and and I really like what he said about the adoption of a rule without uh the Conquering of a principle that has been my um it's been my experience U since 2014 2015 has always impeded any proper Democratic discussion across Europe when the tra was saying to us here in Greece but this is the rule and you questioned first ly whether it was a rule because they were making
(23:01) up these rules as they were going along they were very adaptable rules and secondly okay even if it is the rule why should we have this rule are we here to serve the rules or are the rules here to serve our principles our principles of humanity our principles of you know not letting people starve when it is unnecessary for them to starve like we had during the the the depths of the of the Greek crisis and the response was but these are the rules and why are these the rules because they are the rules so it was a toy that went round
(23:33) and round and round and I see exactly what you mean through that prism well I I mean when I was watching r i you're wonderful documentary I I think it's going to be so it's going to be so powerful I mean speaking about education like just to have this um you know it it's it's a profound document of such an important moment in our history and it really is I'm convince the moment that brought us to now um and to and and it's one of the things that I least understood about the about the horrific
(24:08) and punishing austerity that was imposed on southern Europe and Greece in particular by Germany because like the rule that I learned growing up as a you know a Jewish kid about the sort of cocktail that created the Holocaust was you know when you punish people when you you know create economic conditions they look for a scapegoat and they you know they found us they found the Jews and to watch a German chancellor you know recreate the conditions and I remember being Greece you know in in 2013 and which was just
(24:43) when Golden Dawn was was emerging you know was pre pre yanis in government you know it was it was that moment when it was pretty clear you you guys were already the the opposition um You' gotten very close but golden was starting to really really gain ground I remember you know talking to comrades and Athens and and they were really scared about this and it was just that feeling of like okay it's it's really us or them I mean this is the thing you know that what I work with in the book is this idea that what the
(25:14) right is is a warped doppelganger of the left right this is why the centrists can't beat them it's only the left that can beat them because they are taking the the the the rage and the the the at inequality and Injustice that is rightfully the terrain of the left and they're doing a bait and switch with it but the weaker the left is the the and and the more the left betrays its own principles um the the the the more of an opening they have and that's you know it's that sort of triangle between the
(25:45) center the the right and and the left and that's why I hate the kind of horseshoe theory that tries to create an equivalency between you know the uh the the left you know the quote unquote far left and the far right we are the only ones who can beat them um because we actually have real answers uh um and real solutions to the real pain that they are speaking to whereas all they have is um you know the ability as Giannis was saying to tap into it um and then to Pivot over to you know um go after the Jew The Immigrant uh you know
(26:22) whoever the scapegoat of the day is but yeah I mean watching that moment you know when when Merle steps in I mean how can we how can we pretend Germany has ever learned these lessons if there I mean they learned it at home this is why they have a strong welfare state but then they go and create the crisis elsewhere but of course that crisis has now bitten bitten them oh sure it always comes home because yeah the austerity that they imposed upon the rest of Europe caused a massive diminution in investment a complete failure to invest
(26:59) in green technologies and green energy complete failure you can see now that the green party in government is opening up L night mines again as a result of that failure to invest in green energy for 15 years now because of the austerity they imposed upon us but you see somebody like sh who died last December who an ideologue you know I mean he believed in austerity and deep down the reason why was imposing it on us was because he wanted it to be exported from Greece to Ireland to Portugal in order finally to return to
(27:38) Germany and within two years of the 2010 bailout of Greece and the austerity package here he imposed it on his own country as we speak as we speak the German government of the social Democrats the greens and the fre and the Liberals the free Democrats are imposing an austerity Budget on the people of Germany so at the time when we have an energy crisis there is a war in Ukraine natural gas is being switched off instead of investing on the things that Germany even the capitalist class of Germany requires you know the
(28:12) industrialists instead of doing that they're imposing austerity upon themselves as if as the far right is as is surging and having and having secret they the only opposition massim deportations yeah right because if you have the social Democrats introducing austerity they right are going to be the only ones who benefit in the end it's like a compulsion what is this like there's like a compulsive repeating of history that is truly bizarre and it's happening around the world if I could just jump in um yeah first of all I want
(28:45) to say thanks to Naomi for for kind comments about the series and and I'm getting a kind of really interesting refrain and I think really important one about realizing that none of this is new and it goes back a lot further than many of us um are taught the horrors of genocide and and this sort of cycle of violence and imperialism but I think there is something which is new about this moment and it's the accelerating pace of technological Advance which is really outstripping the pace I think of resistance
(29:21) movements we're constantly behind you got this like exponential development of tech which is constantly weaponized sometimes consciously and sometimes simply it's a byproduct of capitalist Dynamics whereby you're trying to optimize for time on site and that ends up meaning um you know playing to our fears and our insecurities and and and all that sort of thing so it's something you've both written about yanis with techn feudalism anomi in your recent book so I just I just wondered what your thoughts were
(29:55) this relationship with kind of the emerging and rapidly changing changing technology and these same patterns of of domination and sort of divide and Rule maybe Naomi we could go to for that yeah I think it's a tricky moment um because you know I'm not a fan of these Technologies I think they've played a huge role in um  shredding the left culture uh I I want to say like not the left but a kind of a way of being with one another a kind of a comrad liness um I don't want to overly romanticize uh um obviously the
(30:39) left has always had lots of fighting and and and and sectarianism and and and and intermural mural cruelty but I think the extent to which it is just a Pastime is has been massively augmented by these Technologies what I will say and what I you know deeply agree with Giannis on in his really important analysis in techn feudalism around that this is another phase this is a whole this is this is a one of these ruptures where we have to understand that like what is new about this and it is an enclosure of our very
(31:15) selves right so if we think about the enclosures of the commons um it what what is enclosed by by these um by the privatization not just of our Communications with each other but of our faces with with facial recognition technology of our friendships of our political movements with sort of the hashtagging of politics it's um it it it is I want to say the final frontier of the of the neoliberal project in in many ways but I think it goes beyond that because it can go it can go a lot further with the D you know with with
(31:49) with AI and the and the creation of these these doubles of of ourselves that we don't have control over and so on but I it's a bit of a complicated moment because these companies wouldn't have grown in the way that they have as quickly as they have the social media companies if they weren't fulfilling a need and also entering into the the the Gap created by corporate centrism right which we also see in the midst of genocide in Gaza because the mainstream press has failed so spectacularly to to
(32:23) tell us the truth and to get their cameras in to get their people in um so it is these heroic you know Instagram uh uh you know and and and Twitter accounts of Palestinian journalists on the ground who are the main reason we know what is that that is happening um so you know I don't think that that redeems the project but I think it it points to the fact that we need an actual Commons um for our our our communication and we need to De privatize our very selves and our relationships and I do think that we are
(32:59) in such I you know one of the reasons why I appreciate Progressive International is that it you know it's kind of a a return to a more you know it uses these digital tools but it's a return to a tradition of actually getting together um as opposed to just as individuals kind of screaming at each other online I think that if it if if we didn't have that kind of Escape valve to be able to spend our days doing that we probably would be getting together more and strategizing more and organizing more so I think it's sort of
(33:34) this double edge that that these Tools H are helping in in some ways to just let us know what's going on but they're also hurting our organizing abilities by distracting us I don't know does how does that map sound to you Yannis sure absolutely absolutely look for me the technology is never the culprit uh suppose that you know a engine was invented in ancient Egypt it would have made no difference you know the Pharaoh would have it in his Palace and show it off to his visiting dignitaries because it was so much slave
(34:11) labor to build the pyramids and to plow the lands around the Nile and to create uh you know Harvest and so on so the technology on its own means nothing means nothing has not a great impact what happens is when the social relations of production are so Advanced or ADV are sufficiently Advanced for a new piece of technology to come in and give enormous power to the owners of the technology like the steam engine in the you know late 18th century early 19th century then it became uh an instrument that facilitated
(34:52) along with the enclosures of course before that and the creation of the working class and the commodification of the land it creat the factory and once the factory was created you created you know this monstrous power of capital of privately owned Capital what is happening now with big big Tech that's why I'm I'm irritating irritating a lot of of my comrades on the left by talking about techism as opposed to you know some kind of digital or platform capitalism is that the technologies that Naomi is referring to uh that poison our
(35:30) conversation that create the enclosure of ourselves Within These algorithmic spaces uh which are essentially digital fifs ruled by people like zukerberg um and Google and so on and so and basers in order to extract gigantic grants from both us as a new kind of surf Cloud surf I call us now uh as well what as capitalists who you know now have to pay 40% of the price they receive from us when you buy a pair of binoculars on amazon.
(36:06) com 40% of that this is huge gigantic rent goes into the bank account of Jeff basos for doing nothing he doesn't produce anything he's produced a digital fom so we have a new form of capital Cloud capital I call it it's what lives inside our various screens and appliances and it's very different from every other kind of capital we had because every other of capital we had was a produced means of production it was a machine that was built in order to produce other stuff this Capital Cloud capital is significant and it creates creates a new
(36:38) phase as Naomi put it uh because it is not a produced means of production but a produce means of Behavioral modification for the first time in in the history of humanity I mean we always had prophets and authors and orators and musicians and advertisers and marketeers and politicians trying to modify mod by our Behavior but they were human beings we could see them you know look at their face and recognize or try to recognize their motivation and so on and so forth now there is an algorithm and that algorithm is in a infinitely D
(37:12) dialectical relationship with us we train it to train us to train it to train us to train it at infinum to put desires into our heart and to modify a behavior in a way which is maximizing the probability that Jeff basis is going to get another dollar out of the people who sell things to us while we are replacing replenishing for free his Cloud Capital that reproduces itself and his power to do that that is that's what I I I call techn feudalism and you know those algorithms when it comes to the Public Square to the
(37:46) conversation they are primed to poison the conversation between us there's no doubt about that but at the very same time uh we need you know we can't we can't turn the clock back so just like with you know Gutenberg and printing which was an instrument in the hands of the Catholic hierarchy uh to produce the Bible and to produce the uh you know the propaganda of the church well we produce pamphlets as well so we need to use those Technologies against their owners and um that's you know a very old story
(38:24) it's nothing new um uh but at the same time to imagine a world where algorithms are cooperatively owned and then they are very very different things so compare and contrast just very briefly what happens when you call an Uber today with what you could have had if we had um a kind of participatory socialism so today with Uber um for me to use Uber on my phone I have already to have begged my banker to prove to to Uber who I am through my credit card or debit card so I do not own even my own digital identity I have
(39:05) to get go to Wall Street to get them to subcontract to me my capacity to prove to Uber who the hell I am and then I call for an Uber car and that immediately divests a lot of or invests or vests huge amounts of data about where I am where am I'm going what mood I am in where I'm going to Uber Uber exploits the data while exploiting the driver who's driving me okay they don't even need to own a car so that's that's techn feudalism today but imagine a complet different world in which we own
(39:41) our data by law and we own our digital identity and we don't have to have an app for anything or an app belonging to any conglomerate and you can simply say on your phone to a an app which is communally owned like H hctp is owned you know communally it's a Commons HTTP is the the protocol by which we visit websites we don't pay for that somebody produced it and put it out there we don't even remember who it was and it was given away for free so imagine there is such a Commons app that you use and
(40:13) you say look my I'm I'm yanis I'm on the street corner between Sixth and whatever and I'm going to the airport who wants to take me and lot you know cooperatives cooperate atively run taxi services or even the mun Municipal bus service can they can send me an email and or a message say you idiot there is a bus next to you that takes you to the airport you know for free and very quickly now that kind of algorithm is a very different Beast to to the one we have with Uber so the answer is not you
(40:46) know switch off the phones and throw them in the bin the answer is take over the means of communication so yanis I mean I what one thing that came back to me also while watching Ro's film is is just the Lost opportunity um of of the rupture of 2008 of the moment of of global Uprising afterwards of of of just the indisputable evidence that this system is rigged and failing and and then you know having these hope and change candidates come to uh power in different countries um uh and have them just continue the status quo I mean that's
(41:33) the story of of of Greece it's the story of the Obama Administration and it could have been otherwise right but those moments those ruptures right are those M they are the they are the like this is what I learned from studying the shock you know what I call the shock Doctrine is like the right has been ready in moments of rupture and um and in recent decades the left has been not has not been already and has not had the the nerve to be bold right I mean I remember meeting um with cyas before he was you know he was in
(42:07) power making the case to him this is your green New Deal moment and he said oh people don't care about climate change now you know like like look we just and it's like we actually can do multiple things at once we can we can go big um so so I think listening to you and just like the the scale of what you're describing and how far gone it seems I think it it will only change in a moment of rupture of some kind of rupture some kind of Crisis so is it coming how do we get rupture ready that's that's my question for you it's
(42:44) exactly I I keep rul has heard me heard me say this before I keep using the metaphor of a surfur the surfer cannot create the wave but the surfer has a duty to be ready to jump on it when uh you know when it comes and and if you miss it you have to wait a long time so these waves for people like us for the good people who occupied Wall Street or the city of London or the indignados in Spain or theak in Syma Square in Greece you know that comes around every 20 30 years um even if that and we need to be ready and that is you know now I mean since
(43:25) 2010 or so all I've been doing and I'm sure it's the same thing with you is trying to get ready whether this is the green the European Green New Deal that um we tabled in the European Parliament elections 2019 with your help as well um or uh the program that we're putting forward now for the European Parliament election for June 2024 uh our program here in Greece uh what the work we're doing with the progressive International uh but I have to confess to you that the reaction you got from Cyprus is not uncommon
(44:05) today I mean it's it's waned people are far more aware of the how how how crucial uh you know the climate catastrophe is and and and and also that it gives us opportunities for shared prosperity and new kinds of jobs and reconsidering and and recreating and re reenvisioning work and reenvisioning what it means to be well off uh but again the left has not coton on to the extent that it should have cottoned on so we have a major major job uh to do in combining the demands for let's say you know a basic income with the demands for uh um
(44:53) reconstituting corporate law uh taking over or changing altering radically property rights over means of production distribution and communication uh and how does that fit in with a green U deal that is we are not ready we're far from it so we better get cracking hopefully it will be a few more years before the wave comes and we will be ready but we cannot do what we did you know with Occupy Wall Street which is to gather in a square and have endless discussions about whether we should sell sandwiches you know or not uh amongst themselves
(45:31) there has to be a better plan this time around and we need to engage uh disaffected members of the big Tech Community and disaffected members of Wall Street and there are they were in 2008 we just didn't engage them there were Financial Engineers that could have helped us unpick particular cdos and bring the whole system down if we had acted together by you know targeted stri um payment uh strikes of particular utility companies for instance and so on uh this is a a very um um big issue but we need to develop
(46:12) new new new new types of colle collective action and we need to to change the the cost benefit balance of collective action because so far anyone who participates in Collective action suffers a huge personal cost for tiny expected personal benefits so only Heroes and heroins participated since the 19th century in Collective action because the cost was so much so great personally um we need to change that we need to redress this and I think Technologies can help us if we deploy them for subversive purposes I mean it's such a
(46:51) big frame that we have but I just wanted to put on the table that perhaps it's I mean I agree with everything both of you have just said but perhaps we need a bigger frame still for this momentous historic um phase that we're living through um so let me try and articulate it and then I'd love to hear what you think there's been this Dynamic going back for thousands of years of new technologies and Innovations being introduced to our species very slowly at first but radically changing everything
(47:23) about our social lives the way we relate to each other governance ET Etc all the way going back to the plow but in recent decades crossing a threshold at 19 in 1945 when we developed the technology to destroy ourselves that rate of change has just shed up and it seems exponential now we are acquiring as a species the power of small gods modest Gods you know with synthetic biology um with the impact we can have on on ecology just through externalizing the costs of the economy um through weapons and drones and and of course AI at the
(48:06) center of it which can is like a threat multiplier um it can be weaponized to just accelerate and deepen the threats in all these domains I just wondered how we can incorporate you know us being of the left and the concerns we have into this sort of unique historical moment where technology is about to cross this remarkable Thresh show with AI and and all the um implications of that Naomi perhaps I I think you're right that the frame needs to be very large what we need most I is synthesis um and you know
(48:42) this is what what what Yannis was saying about this feeling of like oh well like we're still acting as if there's a sort of scarcity of of of of care around like how you know what what what can we focus on right now what well if we're focused on on war if we're focused on uh on fascism then we can't be focused on climate right um and I think this is part you know or if we are cons you know if if if we're focused on AI then that has to be like the main frame so and I think this is a product of of the way
(49:17) our Behavior has been modified and the way we've been trained by the algorithms and the machines is that it it it it biases towards very compartmentalized sort of small issue areas and um and against a sort of enlarging of the framing these these tools actually really cannot handle synthesis they cannot handle connecting of the dots they handle very sort of pointed interventions and so we're trained to do that very well and we're losing the muscle of like what what are the common threads um and how can how can we have a
(49:52) much more expansive understanding of what connects um the willingness to let people die in Greece um after the economic crisis with the willingness to let Islands drown in the Pacific to the willingness to let Palestinians starve in Gaza and also what is the alternative to that kind of necropolitics you know um so it's big story time I mean part of it is narrative work and and part of it is that really specific kind of policy technology work that Jana has been talking about but we need I feel like we really need both um what do you think
(50:32) Anis look when I wrote techn feudalism in at the heart of my hypothesis was that look folks don't worry about what artificial intelligence is going to do to us it's already done it my whole point about the rise of cloud capital and this transformation into a kind of Neo or techn feudal order this has happened on the basis of the algorithms that we already have I don't fear you know Terminator movies worry about the singularity when the machines you know become s senent and start attacking us I'm not worried about that
(51:16) that will never happen and you know what and why do does it need to happen if there is a drone today and there is a drone today that can come into this room in into this house of mine and with special recognition find out who I am and autonomously kill me do I care that it is not sensient I don't give it D it's already happening uh as for you know the your point that our intellect grows much slower than our capacities technological capacities again I'm not worried about that I'm worried about the shock of the old not
(51:52) the shock of the new uh remember we had cop 28 this year right and the head of cop 28 was the head of an oil company now you don't need modern technology to destroy us that on its own is you know pushing us beyond the point of no return as a species on this planet um with or without AI even if you know big Tech become all very nice guys and El musks becomes you know an omline supporter and an environmentalist you know the fossil fuel industry is going to destroy us anyway um so it's you know it's old
(52:28) fashioned work that we need to do with new fangled technological means uh you know and also understanding that we that they are you know if if if we had one reason for appropriating and socializing the means of uh the technological means of production distribution communication so on now we have aund reasons to do it so that doesn't change you know finally since Nomi said let's not be sci-fi or you fear that you're going to be scii I am going to be sci-fi because I need to confess where I got my idea for cloud
(53:10) capital I got it from 1969 and episode of Star Trek called the cloud minders and which was such a precient episode because it's all about people living on a cloud you know the ruling class living on a cloud whereas the trites everybody else was working in the labyrinths of the mindes on the planet so there you are that's that's my you know my illusion to to science fiction that's a good one um I I I'll I'll end with um with something a little little little more recent which is the Matrix where you know I think the part
(53:53) of the reason why the the imagery of the Matrix is so um sort of omnipresent in the culture like the idea you know the red pill the blue pill um and you know so much of so much of that imagery has stuck is is that model right of of of the reality being the simulation and humans being machine food right underneath the reality humans just being in these in these in these pods with no just life but no life uh and all they are is just is Just Energy for the machines that they created through what they that they created yes it's a Dr Frankenstein story
(54:40) too there yeah yeah I mean it's not a new story but I think we feel that we have become machine food because we have become machine food and that and and and and that's part of The Liberation project and I think that that was the whole point of Mark ma is D Capital the whole point about Max capital is that technologies that um have the capacity to liberate us we have become we have volunteered automat it's not a machine's fault we have chosen through particular social relations between us uh to serve
(55:14) them those machines and to reproduce them and you know the beauty of the the marxian story is that it's not just story about the bad capitalist and the good workers because the capitalists are also Absolut absolutely destroyed by their subjugation to Capital because they go to bed every night you know um absolutely worried about bankruptcy so they never enjoy their Surplus value they never enjoy their capital gains they always have to constantly feed the machine so you know that's that's nothing changes in other
(55:50) words accept everything I just want to say Naomi thank you so much for making time for this podcast it's really such a pleasure to get the chance to talk with you and and to listen to you engage with yanice um and as always Yan is fantastic to to hear your thoughts and all of this um I hope audiences enjoy listening as much as I did thank you I'm deeply honored by having armi here today tonight or today for you and of course the documentary that you did r i mean what can I say I'm I'm almost embarrassed
(56:27) well congratulations to both of you and and lots of gratitude I know how much work it was to make it as strong as it is but it's going to be a great tool for our movements uh and to stop being machine food um and uh thanks for the excuse to to chat um I I we need this thank you much love take care thank you if you enjoyed this podcast please like And subscribe to our chn Channel
