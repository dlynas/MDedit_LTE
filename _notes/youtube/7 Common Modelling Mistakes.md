7 Common Modelling Mistakes
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE00fkt0P4Q)

## Transcript:
i would like to talk about five common
mistakes people make when they are
building economic models
and this video is just an overview of
the five mistakes and then i'm going to
post separately a video that sort of
goes through an example of each one and
how to fix it
but first i want to say why do you need
to learn these common mistakes that i
see when students build their own models
and the reason for this is if you want
to actually use economic modeling in a
powerful way to sort of develop your
thinking and think carefully through
problems
and do the kinds of thought experiments
that economic modeling is designed to
help us with
then you need to practice actually
building your own models
and i generally recommend that students
start out by
building models of just stupid little
decisions you make every day like how
long do you wait in line at the
cafeteria before you go do something
else or how many friends from high
school do you keep up with or how many
times a month do you call your parents
just basic decisions that you make every
day practicing modeling those will get
you used to the structure of modeling
and once you've got a handle on that
then you can go on and model more
substantial problems but
um but i think that's the best way to
learn microeconomic modeling in which
case after you've built a potential
model you need to check it for mistakes
so here i have a model we've got a
choice variable benefit and cost
the choice variables in both of the
benefit and cost functions and we've got
a couple of exogenous variables so what
are the most common mistakes
the absolute most common mistake that
students make when they're learning
microeconomic theory is to think that
they are maximizing their choice
variable and this is a completely
understandable mistake because you look
at this and the fact that the
maximization sign is clustered with the
choice variable makes you think you're
maximizing your choice variable that's
absolutely wrong you're not maximizing
the choice variable you're maximizing
the objective function by choosing the
choice variable
and this will absolutely get you in a
ton of trouble if you want to logically
understand models
because if you want to maximize the
choice variable
that's really simple you just set it as
high as possible like if when i build
models of time spent studying you
maximize grades minus opportunity cost
by choosing the time you spend studying
well if someone reads that as maximizing
time spent studying then you just choose
to study 24 7 and it doesn't really make
any sense that's just not how models are
set up so absolutely banish this kind of
thinking from
from your thought as you build models
you never ever ever maximize a choice
variable
the second common mistake is that you
have the wrong sign plus or minus on a
cost or benefit and i think you'll
probably need to watch the video i do on
this to fully understand that
but the basic idea is the sign here is
just um going to determine do you like
this or not like it
so classically we have a benefit that's
a wonderful thing like happiness or
money
earned or whatever and we have a cost
that we don't like such as money we have
to pay or things we have to give up
and that's the classic form
but sometimes you have something where
your choice variable by increasing your
choice variable that's going to decrease
a bad thing in which case those are the
cases where students will oftentimes get
the sign on this wrong
so when you're checking a model just go
through and ask yourself is this a good
thing or a bad thing and does the sign
in front of it match whether this is
good or bad
and that will help you fix that mistake
the third mistake that i see a lot in
student models is that when they define
variables they'll define the variable as
increase in something
rather than the thing and of course that
is wrong because increase in that's
associated with the derivative
so if your benefit is health
then you want a situation where changing
your choice variable will increase this
um not um increase an increase in this
rate that's sort of the second
derivative rather than the first
derivative
so if you're hoping that by exercising
more if exercise is your choice variable
you will get greater health you just
want to define this as your total health
and
this is going to be the thing that
contributes to that total health so you
never want to define a variable as
increase in health
and it's easy to fix that one you just
get rid of increase cross it out and
whatever the thing is if it's health
that's how you should define your
variable
the next common mistake i see in student
models is that they'll have a variable
that's endogenous in other words it's a
function of the choice variable
when
if you think about it logically that
variable should be exogenous and an
example of that might be um if you have
something that's like extraversion
that's a feature of a person's
personality it's probably not going to
depend on your choice variables so if a
student had a number of parties you
attend per month
and
they had extraversion as a function of
the number of parties that you attend
that doesn't make sense because
attending more parties does not make you
more extroverted extroversion is sort of
a fixed personality characteristic so
extroversion should be an exogenous
variable that's going to influence
something else like joy from partying
where this function is going to be
higher if you're extroverted and
checking for that basically when you go
through checking a model you're going to
ask
when i increase my choice variable does
this thing change and if it changes in
response to you increasing your choice
variable
then it is endogenous you're good if you
think about it carefully and you realize
when you change your choice variable up
or down
this would not respond
then that really should not be an
endogenous variable it should be an
exogenous variable and you're going to
need to rearrange the variables in your
model
and then the last common mistake is the
reverse of that it's when you have an
exogenous variable in your model that
really should be
endogenous and this one i almost did not
include on the list because sometimes
we'll make a variable
exogenous even if it's really endogenous
just to quiet some of the complexity of
the model
and to simplify and zoom in on one thing
that we want to focus on
so it's actually not true that
every exogenous variable in the model is
truly exogenous in the real world
having an exogenous variable just means
you want to play around with that
variable in certain ways using
comparative statics and it's not the
the motivational forces that you're
focused on
um in which case like when is this
actually a mistake
i think this would be a mistake if
you're not doing it intentionally so if
someone looks at your model and they're
like wow that should be endogenous why
isn't it endogenous
you should have an answer to that
question
and if you don't then you just haven't
thought through your model carefully
enough now the sixth mistake i see
commonly in student models
is that they have a choice variable
that's not something the decision maker
that they're modeling can actually
choose
and sometimes it's something that nobody
actually gets to choose so when you're
building a model make sure you think
about whose perspective is this from
whose decision is the choice variable so
the most common choice variable i see
that fits this mistake category is like
voter turnout
where there's no individual that
actually chooses voter turnout and
obviously this this also falls under the
category of number one um that's
something you want to maximize but voter
turnout is
sort of the culmination of a bunch of
different people's decisions
where each person is deciding for
themselves do i go vote so voter turnout
is not going to be a viable choice
variable but if you want to model that
you can model something like um how much
effort am i willing to put forward to
vote so effort is an individual decision
there's actually a choice maker who has
control over that
and then the seventh mistake that
students make is they'll have a benefit
or cost that's fairly unresponsive to
the choice variable
now this is different perhaps than
the benefit or cost
being an actual exogenous variable it's
really where
it's really where the derivative is
about equal to zero which is associated
with drop in the bucket problems so this
isn't necessarily wrong as a matter of
fact it's an important part of modeling
when we're modeling collective action
problems and
public goods problems and whatnot
but sometimes students will have just
one benefit in just one cost where
there's almost no
where the elasticity of
benefit with respect to the choice
variable is almost zero and the most
common place i see this is with
recycling models where you're choosing
how much to recycle and you're choosing
it because by recycling you have a
positive impact on the environment
and of course the cost might be effort
costs then but the problem is you kind
of know that your personal decision
about how much to recycle has almost no
impact on the actual environment
um now of course collectively
everybody's um collective choice that
the group's choice about
um how much to recycle that could have
an impact on the environment but not
your one little tiny decision that's a
drop in the bucket
so of course you need some other benefit
some other reason people are recycling
this could be social it could be status
it could be you're not going to be
judged by your neighbors you would need
to build in something else that doesn't
have an elasticity about equal to zero
so that's just a few common mistakes i
see in student models
