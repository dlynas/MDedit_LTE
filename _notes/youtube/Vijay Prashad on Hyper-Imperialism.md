Case Of Imperial We Have
Decided In Our Text Hyper
Imperialism And I Have Little Post
Card To You Can Have Letter Ch A QR Code
To Go And  Read the text on Hyper
Imperialism in Spanish Portuguese
English And so
on We use the term Hyper Imperialism to
capture some of that brutality as you see The
thing about Hyper Imperialism led
by the United States is that it is
dangerous and it is
dozens of dangerous  And
Decado Getting Into The Alternative Because I Think It's
Very Important For Us To
Reign Is The Danger And
Decado Imperialism Hyper Imperialism Is
Dangerous At 75% of the Share of Global
Military Spending Is Spent by the
United States Its NATO Allies and
Its Close NATO Allies  Like Japan and South
Korea, 75 percent of world military
spending is spent by the United
States and its Allies Comrades and
Friends I Want You to Think About What
People Say Well China is a Threat When People Say
Russia is a Threat What Are They Talking
About  China is a threat That's how Russia is a threat How
is Venezuela a threat How
is Cuba a threat There is only one threat
to the planet now And that threat is hyper
imperialism A structure led by the
United States and its close European allies The
threat is the only terrorist  What we have on the
planet Earth is the US Government and
its close allies including Israel that is the
terrorist that is the only terrorist that is the major
threat to the planet that we face today but it is worse than that that is dangerous and what we
call hyper imperialism is dangerous but
it  Worse Than Just Being Dangerous It's Much Worse Than That It's Also Dead It Looks Dead
At People Leading the
West Joe Biden Olaf Schul Rich
Sunk Inul
Macro Not One of Us Without the
Respect of the People Anyway in the World
How Is It Possible  These Countries with their Immense
Wealth Cannot Produce Even One
Intelligent World
Leader How is it Possible Every Single Leader
of the Global Nothing is Medium
People Who Are 80 Years Old 90
Years Old Extremely Loose It's Not
About Us It's About Donald Trump Brutal
Manner Their Lot Of Brutal People In The World They
Don't Like Donald Trump It's Not
Like Olaf Schultz Who We Don't Even See Olaf
Schultz Comes On A  Stage It's Almost Like a
Shadow Only a Dozen Even Exist Artists
Angela Merkel Had a Personality
Olaf Schultz Even Had a Personality
Inul Macro Come On What
Is How France Produces Inul
Macro The Country of the French Revolution
The Country of the Paris
Commune The Country  Of philosophers like Jan Paul,
Europe does not produce philosophers
any more, there is no Google in Germany today, there are
none in France, there are no real
intellectuals to be produced in the United
States,
age of by the luck of personality of Olaf
Schul, the problem is  They don't have a
project They don't know what they're doing They don't understand the elements of
humanity They don't understand how you need to
transform poverty They don't understand what it means to have a
real project to educate our
children for health in the world we're in
Cups of the Global North During the Covid
Pedem But Before the Covid
Pedem After the Financial Crisis of 2008 From Which They Have
Never Recovered in a Long
Third Depression  They
don't have a
project They don't have any fresh
ideas in this sense They are dead They are
not only dangerous but they are dead Hyper is dangerous but they don't know how to
build bridges any more
It doesn't as
well they can blow up the bridge they don't know how to
build it
Build Schools Anymore They Don't Know What
Education is Anymore They Don't
Understand Health Care The Dead Aspect of
Hyper Imperialism is Very Important for
Us It's Important for Us Because They Are Wrong
To Why The World Is What You Have Now Is What You Will Have For Nothing Can Be
Improved You Should Be Lucky To Have What You Have Now Because It Can Get Worse Still
Austerity Still
Cuts You Got School You Should  Be Happy You Have
School Tomorrow They May Be No School Isn't a
Future That Might
Even Be a Giant Uturn to the
Past It's Because They Don't Have a Project The
Dead It's Because They Don't Have a Future
to Offer For  People It's because of that there is so
much hopeless in the world There is so much
toxic energy So many movements of the
right wing Movements of the right wing grew
in an
environment where there is no project for the
people For
both of us  Believe in the People Do of
Us Who Believe in the Possibility
of the Future It's Not Enough
for
Us to
Just Criticize  We Are Very Good at
Criticizing We Are the Best Anti Capital
Critics We Know How to Say No We Know How to
Fight
Them We Know How to Say No to Them But If We Want to
Build the Biggest Movement Around the
World We Have to Have  Something to Ch People Can Say
Yes We Need to Have
Project We Need to Have People Feel
Optimum We Need People to Be
Optimistic Not Only
for the
Future But We Need Them to Be Optimistic
in Our
Project They Need  To believe that socialism is
possible and necessary

A Piece Of Paper I Don't Need These Papers
This Is Not Revent If We Don't Put These

Look at Some of the Points What Has Been
Forgotten and
Give Us Feedback
And once we have a plan we are proud

So That People Look At  This document and they
decide there are two forces in the world there
is the
force of decade needed all that they have

regime of sanctions the regime of cosig
measures datchi
s concrete way to reject the deadness  Only
Reject Decadence But
Embrace Socialism

cliff if you don't have a parachute and if you
don't have a
paraglider You can't jump off a cliff without a
paraglider This comrade is a paraglider We
