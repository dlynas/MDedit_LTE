## Transcript:
other bad things happening doesn't mean
that you can just like stop me from
complaining about this one bad thing
that's happening number
two okay that's actually as a joke
that's fundamentally not a bad
joke like that actually was surprisingly
not that bad of a joke I can't believe
I'm admitting
this obviously because like it's not
the receiving end of the joke is not the
pro
Palestinian uh students or or activists
but instead how shitty LA
traffic
is what they did notice was this that
you have to be pretty dumb to think that
the way to bring people around to your
point of view is to make them late to
pick up their kids from
daycare and that's what most normies are
thinking I have a kid I have a job and
yes I'm sure there are injustices on
both sides in the Middle East as there
are injustices all over the world but
I'm going to be late for work something
you protesters on the bridge seem to
have the luxury of not having to worry
about which seems kind of
privilege isn't it funny that the dudes
who are saying This and like
chirping literally don't have not had
like a real
job in four
decades it's like Don Lem man one you're
literally job you right now don't
even have the professional Big Boy job
that you once did which was already
pretty comfy to begin with and
you up the
bag and it's like now now you do what I
do you and I are doing the same
thing don't act like you speak for the
Common Man by being like yeah
that's
right like you your commute is not a
real thing okay especially among people
from the region but social justice
Warriors for a lot of them it seems like
it's more about the warrior than about
whatever the cause is if you really
cared about a pared so much which Israel
does not actually
practice
oh hey this guy hates religion by the
way hey have I told you guys how much
Bill Mah hates religion all
religion all religion okay he hates all
religion unconditionally why is it
there's so many of these dudes who are
always like I hate all
religions I'm just chirping about all
religions they never have that smoke for
the religious
fundamentalism at the
heart
okay at the heart of of the Israeli
State the do you mean you literally
just defended the ethnos
state the ethn state specifically
designed around one ethno religion
Judaism it's actually not Jewish at all
for Israel to exist in the way that it
does but it is rather
strange because he doesn't feel
that way about
Muslims this is a guy who
constantly constantly constantly talks
about how Isis is representative of all
Islam and that sort of
behavior so on his own moral boundaries
he should be finding Israel to
be an horen
stain by his own supposedly atheist
framework Arabs their vote they serve in
Parliament they sit on the Judiciary
wouldn't you start with this with the
hundreds of millions of women in the
world who live under a true apartheid a
gender apartheid of the most brutal
kind bro
what is Israel doing to people that wear
the
hijab under its apartheid regime which
you claim does not
exist all matter of right-wing religious
fundamentalism that exist in majority
Muslim nations is also an unfortunate
byproduct of Western
imperialism also you just said Israel
doesn't have a gender apartheid when
like 40% of the parties in the
knesset are talking about how much they
want to cover the women and how little
they should be learning to read the
do you mean
bro women must not read party
I'll
wait are you really speaking truth to
power or do you just think you look cool
in a
cafea which is really just the new Shay
Gua t-shirt another historical figure
you never researched and so think as a
hero but was actually a sadistic racist
monster fighting for bro
bro Chay
Gara literally first of all he's using
the Heritage Foundation which I love for
this uh project sheay
gavara okay before I start with shara's
own personal history I just want to
mention something really funny here
aren't you anti-canc
culture aren't you literally anti-canc
culture you're chirping about a
dude and what he wrote in the Motorcycle
Diaries when he literally spent
the rest of his life fighting for
panafrican nationalist Black Liberation
directly in
Africa hey dumb
you are older than he was and what
the have you done with your career
you're still
racist what an insane take
dude what an insane take he's literally
like yo have you seen what Chay had to
write about black people back in the
day time to cancel them please do not
look at the Cuban
Revolution and what it did for for black
and brown indigenous Cubans what it did
um what it did in terms of emancipation
for them please don't look at what
chavara did for the the rest of his
( __ )
life post Cuban Revolution
please bro pulled up all
tweets it's
crazy yeah students have not done their
research the research the Heritage
Foundation
communism the worst form of government
ever but these are small
matters
when now is a good time to explain uh
yeah by the way Bill Mah the public
n-word user by the way being like Chay
gavara is so racist H you haven't done
the reading he is such a
arrogant piece of I despise him so
much because I'm not a Radley by any
means right as you guys know I get mad
at rad Libs all the time
especially when people talk about like
white mediocrity or whatever but like
Bill Mah
is a thing that cannot exist as anything
but a white man an old white man okay
he's not funny he's not
intelligent there is no version of Bill
Mah that is any other race any
other background okay they get packed up
they might get opportunity you might be
like a mediocre white lady for example
okay and then boom you'll get packed up
eventually No
Mediocre arrogant shitty unfunny person
has had this much staying
power with the exception of Bill Maher
you cannot be like a black man and be
this
mid and have this much of a career in
Hollywood just doesn't happen so he is
in a way
unironically the perfect representation
of white mediocrity and white supremacy
in that
regard it's just so
bad and as years have gone
by his quote unquote comedy has only
worsened he is just basically repeating
Prager you videos
now also he's calling Chay racist
remember his comedy sketch was shred up
just anti-arab islamophobic garbage yeah
he loves anti-arab sentiment he
doesn't consider it to be racist he
considers it to be a A Brave and Bold
political
statement sh was so racist he went to
Africa to fight in the dec Colonial
struggle
I think this tweet was made for you and
scream if you love

y bro stop stop showing me LeBron James
right
now small matters when activism merges
with narcissism less about the cause and
more about me look at me oh dude what
are you doing you're literally
on student protesters who are
getting brutally beaten down by the
police right now for saying things that
you are too terrified to say because
guess what if you were to say those
things you wouldn't have a job anymore
that's right you are a cowardly little
piece of you might genuinely
believe that Israel is awesome
personally but you know damn well that
if you were to say half of the
things that those student protesters are
saying about how Israel is a genocidal
State about how Israel is
committing uh a genocide and isn't a
partid regime you would be canned
okay because that goes against the
American state Department's
interests that's it because you have
nothing else you have nothing else to
offer other than being an old arrogant
talking about narcissism yeah
it's so narcissistic that these
18year olds and these 19-year-olds are
literally putting their goddamn
education on hold getting suspended
getting arrested get getting brutalized
getting
doxed to do what is
right how dare they have morals this is
the problem with so many
Americans we are so selfish ultimately
we are so hyper individualistic we are
so materialistic we are so hyper
individualistic that like we are so in
it for our own self-interest that we
cannot imagine a world where some one
does something for other people we
cannot
comprehend that a human being can see
the
horrifying images coming out of Gaza
images that we paid for with our tax
dollars and say this is wrong this is
immoral we have to put an end to this so
all of these other protesters must also
be grifting
if they were grifting why are they on
the side that has
no international support from
governments why are people grifting on
the side that the media is regularly
bastardizing and lying about and calling
Hamas supporters and and uh Iran
supporters and islamist fundamentalism
supporters
ridiculous I despise this freak
so
much you alcoholic piece of watch
me and if you like the way I'm fighting
Injustice remember to like And
subscribe like And subscribe to what the
counter protesters literally have media
accounts they are trying to unironically
make a media career out of this
situation it's the zionists that
actually have their own
personal they have their own personal
accounts the student prot tors hide
their faces Bill why do they hide their
faces bill they hide their face because
they get doxed

bill in February a sad confused man even
lit himself on fire in front of the
Israeli Embassy and in his last Facebook
post he said many of us like to ask
ourselves what would I do if I was alive
during slavery interesting cocktail
question sir and I guess the right
answer is kill
myself but it wouldn't have actually
fixed the problem if General ulyses
srant had ulated himself and his last
words were hey Lincoln are you using
that log wait is he saying that Aron
Bushnell instead of engaging in a
radical Act of protest as an
Airman should have just violently
destroyed the nation state of Israel
somehow is that what you're saying
Bill are you going to give us the guns
Bill what's happening would you be on
board if people actually rose up in
arms is that what you're
advocating for anything that you do in
the ter in forms of protest is actually
guess what because you're not
nuking Israel so it's okay man
thanks
the are you
saying does he believe anything that he
says I don't understand
it yeah he's like why are you protesting
join the alasan brigades
now and then last week another sad
confused man set himself on fire at the
Trump trial in New York so you can tell
yourself you're a martyr for the
Palestinian cause but it's a lot less
special when the next guy does it for
Stormy
Daniels I don't want to diminish how sad
it is that someone would take their own
life for any reason but maybe from now
on before anyone commits an act of Civil
Disobedience they should ask themselves
a few questions like is the most
important thing in my life something I
hadn't heard of six months mon ago do I
even
know do I even know what the I'm
talking
about once again the assumption that
like the people protesting against
Israel's genocidal apartheid
regime they just simply don't know
because if they did
know if they did know how complex it is
if they did know how complex it is then
you know they wouldn't be protesting
they would be like me making fun of the
protesters they would be like me trying
to boast sides the genocide they would
be like me actually not even both siding
because I don't think he both sides it
at all I think he just is
unconditionally dick riding
Israel oh if only you read if only you
read the book that I've read that says
Israel's genocide is good actually and
totally
valid you
know then you wouldn't uh you wouldn't
be protesting against 15,000 children
being ruthlessly slaughtered with
American tax dollars and American legal
and political cover under the
international um under the International
Community as uh as Israel gets to do
that with our weapons that we paid for
am I really here for the cause or is the
cause here to bring you
me hey if it makes you feel good to
cosplay is this literally falls
apart this falls apart instantly when
you realize what's at stake for these
protesters like this is the same energy
of being like dude you're a leftist
grifter you're a leftist
grifter you don't like what I say can't
you
comprehend that if you don't like what I
say then there are plenty of others who
don't like what I say I could be saying
something else if I was a
grifter nobody griffs to the left nobody
protests an issue like this
because they're going to get anything
out of it they do not get anything out
of it which is extra ironic because a
guy who is getting something out of his
unconditional loyalty to this apartheid
regime is ascribing his own
guilt and his own resentment for his
actions to those who are actually
putting their bodies on the line
for what they believe in
that's what's funny about this entire
process is that bill
Mah
is a phenomenally mediocre person like
an unimaginably mediocre
person and he's so
arrogant and he's such a smarmy
know-it-all even though he
is devoid of any kind of knowledge on
the situation and the things that he
does know are just propaganda talking
points that he spits out like oh there's
Arab members in the knesset yeah that's
cool man that's super
sick can um can a can a Christian or a
Muslim citizen of Israel marry a
Palestinian Muslim and give them
citizenship inside of Israel or do they
get
downgraded the answer might shock you
ladies and gentlemen maybe he didn't
read that book though I guess
oh no I'm Palestinian
Israeli Palestinian citizens of Israel
can't live wherever the they want
they literally have housing
discrimination that is codified
the state that he's defending has
literally written the rules that Israel
is a state for the
Jews Israel is supposed to be a Jewish
State think about that there is no other
world in which this level of exclusion
is even remotely seen as permissible we
all know exactly what it is but when
Israel does it it's like well H what are
you going to do
sorry I have to defend it
not a leg to stand down for this
that's why he's like oh I'm
imagining a world where the students are
actually just like
me
mercenaries a person who once made one
Brave statement in his entire
life an out- of pocket statement in the
immediate aftermath of 9/11 and was
punished for it so I spent the rest of
my life suckling on the boot that's
right Bill Maher
in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 said
you know who's
Brave dudes with box cutters that took
over a
plane and directly landed that plane on
the towers you know what's not
brave you know was not brave lobbing
cruise missiles at their family members
from thousands of miles
away he said that and he was of course
understandably immediately taken over
the air why are you saying lsf d ass I'm
not saying I said that he said that oh
USF USF USF Assan please move on he
sucks bro Hassan listen to the K dish
track please K dot is back it up please
go so
hard oh my God this dude is out of
revolutionaries knock yourself out burn
yourself out just don't drag Gaza into
it also throwing stuff on paintings is
just

stupid no one sees mashed potatoes on a
Monae and thinks he's got a point I
should recycle my
cans last week Google employees staged
the sit in to protest their company
doing business with Israel their t-shirt
said googlers against genocide but they
could have just just as well said look
at me see me and Google did see them to
the

door wait
what doesn't this completely go against
the narrative that he was presenting
that people are doing this for selfish
reasons they got
fired why are these
cheering
when you ask Zionist why Israel is
allowed to discriminate against people
who aren't Israeli they say it's
perfectly normal that when you tell them
the US grants constitutional rights to
doe process to All Peoples within its
jurisdiction regardless of residence or
citizenship status they move the
goalpost and say yeah well Israel has to
do it because is Terrorism
yeah because the Israeli attitude even
inside of Israel proper is identical to
Jim Crow South if you ask the
white man of the Jim Crow South why
there is segregation they would say oh
we have to do
that we have to do it it's separate but
equal but we have to do it otherwise
these black people are going to come in
and up our institutions our
establishments we just literally have to
do it
The Vibes are incredibly in both
of those circumstances and they're
operating on the same boundless
racism that caused them to hallucinate
half the goddamn time about perceived
enemies I think people arguing against
you on this point would just say yeah
it's still segregated though
dude yes it is except the circumstances
for black American an now while there is
still much more room and much more
economic segregation and much more uh
white supremacy to tackle in the United
States of America having said all of
that the situation for the Palestinians
in Gaza and in the West Bank is still
unimaginably
worse and I will argue against any
chatter black white doesn't matter who
says that that is not the
truth I have on many instances I have
brought up the fact that if
Palestinians in the West Bank and
Palestinians in Gaza especially but the
West Bank as
well lived in the Jim Crow South
regardless of how unimaginably
violent Jim Crow South was if
Palestinians in Gaza
specifically if Palestinians in Gaza
lived as
though they were black people living in
the Jim Crow South that would be a
positive
step for their current
existence that's how this is not
to say Jim Crow South was great for
black people of course it wasn't this is
just simply to show you how unimaginably
up it
is in Gaza that's precisely why you also
see many black people also offer unless
they're like you know famous and on
television or whatever but many black
people also see this on the same
boundaries that we all see it as they
see it as uh Another War of white
supremacist values and they're not wrong
you're going to get clipped good
luck I mean I've I've talked about this
quite a bit I don't have an issue with
this being clipped at
all I forget who said this but I think
it was like in the
50s a point was made and in the ' 50s
about would you ever swap places with a
black person as a white person and many
white people said no no matter what they
would
not because of white supremacy and the
conditions that black people were
subjected
to I don't think any black person in
America will swap places with someone in
Gaza right
now yeah if they were Rich yeah no the
question was if you were to be a rich
black person in the 50s would you do
it
anyway who was that author that went to
the West Bank and said I know exactly
what this is uh it was um
tanesi coats it's actually really
interesting story tanesi coats talked
about reparations about Germany and
Israel's uh relationship and use that
experience as a positive example when
talking about how reparations should be
given to black people in America T HEI
coats then went to the West
Bank and boy did he
it shook his world okay it shook
his his world to the
core came back from the West Bank and
was like I am so sorry I have done
something unimaginably
wrong yeah Daniel de DS is another
person 2005 Daniel de Lewis my king my
goat went to Gaza help build some uh
some of the homes that were destroyed by
Israel
is
horrifying yeah t e Co literally was
like I could not I knew exactly what it
was I walked through a checkpoint and in
the process was stopped where people
started asking me if I was Jewish or not
people started asking me if I was Muslim
and I knew right away exactly what the
is going on
yeah he wrote a
piece on the war crimes committed by the
Israeli aparti State via its occupation
forces
Farley here let her out let k out let k
out
please let her out and also uh can you
let her out to PE real quick too
yeah she's bar he's barking because
marat's
here
what they fired all 28 of them the next
day yes Koney award coming to you guys
next
year
but maybe the question that today's
protester needs to ask themselves more
than any other is why do I care so much
about this part particular cause North
Korea starves its people China puts them
in concentration camps Myanmar
brutalizes The rohia Boo Haram kidnaps
whole Villages
of bro what are you
saying we're
one
one other bad things happening doesn't
mean that you can just like stop me from
complaining about this one bad thing
that's happening number
two we well with the exception of North
Korea which we are directly responsible
for the famine there by refusing to
incorporate them into the global
Marketplace but
we are funding the genocide in Israel we
our tax dollars are
you have to be literally a
baboon to look at this argument and go
yeah that makes a lot of sense why don't
you care about all
genocides first of all you don't know
that you don't know if I have covered
all the other genocides or not and
secondly can you imagine a world
where let's say somebody is stoling uh
stoling somebody is stealing the purse
of an old lady and you see it okay and
you say stop and you start chasing after
that person and the guy goes hey have
you not considered that wage theft is
the single greatest
threat to uh the American workers
actually why are you stopping me it's
like you're stealing from this old
lady I'm seeing it right now the is
wrong with you yeah sure there's like
other evils out there but well you're
still doing the evil
these guys are so dumb this is just
simply the this is simply the all lives
mattering that's it women the president
of Burundi says gays should be stoned to
death because they quote deserve it
nothing
Ukraine maybe if these Google employees
had the slightest idea what kind of
fundamentalist oppressive
they're supporting Hamas the houthis
Hezbollah the IR revolutionary guard
they might take it a little easier on
the world's greatest monster genocide
Joe genocide by the way is when you want
to wipe out an entire people which is
what Hamas said and Hamas did that's the
stated goal ofas that's what from
the yeah Israel kills 40,000
Palestinians over the course of the past
seven months with American weapons and
American tax dollars and American
political cover I sleep
call the students say from The River To
The Sea whoa yo that's genocide
yo hey yo words are
violence every single one of these
reactionary pieces of every single
day of the goddamn week love and
I mean love chirping like the most
mentally ill multiple cat having rad
Libs cackling like hyenas
the moment Israel is a part of the
conversation they go oh bodies in
spaces bodies and
spaces you're not listening to the to
the framework of of Jewish people who
want to do
genocide that's right it's
anti-semitic I don't care that there's
Jewish people on the other side saying
that they're anti-zionist it's
anti-semitic anyway
there's nothing wrong with having cats
okay calm
down think about
that like he's saying words are violence
dude I thought you were anti-woke what
the happened my man is anti-woke
only when it comes to but when it comes
down to it he loves cancelling
Chay
gavara quote mining Chay gavara not
going to look at what he did
for like most of his life by the
way and saying the real actions
that are unconscionable here are
students saying from The River To The
Sea Palestine will be
free an emancipatory slogan that is the
real violence
here not the mark 84 laser guided jdam
missiles
ridiculous Riv to the Sea means Hamas
would do that to Israel but can't Israel
could do that to them but doesn't and
you
know but doesn't they're clapping
they're clapping for it oh my
God these people are such
scumbags
oh my God Israel could do that but
doesn't oh so grateful we should be to
the holy state of Israel for
not for taking their sweet time with the
ethnic cleansing you know what I
mean thank
god
oh 75 years of this but but he
doesn't think it's an apartheid anyway
because he doesn't know anything the
only thing he has learned is to say the
right things so he does not come
across as contentious to anyone in
actual power ever again for the rest of
his life that's why under the Trump
Administration he constantly CH CHP
chirp about Donald Trump and under the
Brandon Administration he's literally
taking the exact opposite
stances to the things that he claimed he
cared about that's why these people
constantly talk about
wokeness has he seen the leveled
buildings where nothing is left I don't
get it it doesn't
matter it doesn't
matter
okay he doesn't
care he much like
dorelli much like the entirety of rworld
news
is just operating on pure islamophobia
and might is Right politics that's why I
always say every conversation with a
dick writer of Israel devolves into two
talking points one m is right
two Muslims are barbaric monsters who
only understand force and must be
made
servile that's it and he did both of
those things
and you know how you could find that out
Google
it and then he's going to do like orange
man bad blah blah blah blah blah shut
the up you're just as monstrous in
a genocidal piece of as Donald
Trump is at least Donald Trump is
chirping from one perspective
he's just as narcissistic As You Are
but you're a fake Donald Trump
supporter you hate Donald Trump you just
love everything he does when he's not
the one doing it I have no I do not want
allies like this I think you are a piece
of you are a monstrous scumbag and
I would much prefer an honest racist
Republican to a dishonest racist piece
of liberal like you okay because at
least I know that motherfucker's a wolf
okay you masquerade as a
sheep and then you turn around and stab
everybody in the back you
portray yourself as a liberal and then
regurgitate Republican
propaganda I'd much rather you openly
admit what your position is and wear
that Clan robe and burn that
goddamn cross instead of sitting there
talking like you're some goddamn liberal
some goddamn Progressive while
regurgitating Fox News propaganda to a
te
animal if there was any Justice
in this planet his liver would have
given out many many years ago okay his
kidneys would have failed but
godamn it unfortunately as a mediocre
white man the perfect Beacon of white
mediocrity as a matter of fact he gets
to be in this position and make millions
of of dollars and get the best
kind of Health Care possible despite the
fact that he's constantly combating his
organs
with this ridiculous amount of alcohol
consumption and uh not to rub it in but
you know who all this posturing For A
Cause reminds me of this um fat guy from
Florida
oh Trump is so totally bad dude Trump is
so totally bad dude what difference do
you have in the way that you analyze
Islam and Muslim people and Gaza than
Donald Trump nothing you and Trump are
identical you and Trump are also
identical when it comes to vaccines by
the way his perspective on vaccines is
identical you and Trump are identical on
vaccines you and Trump are identical on
Gaza you and Trump are identical on woke
culture and these annoying protesters
you and Trump are identical in the way
that you want to deal with these
annoying protesters why are you still
voting for Joe
well Joe Biden also is identical with
Donald Trump in many of those issues
that's probably why he doesn't give a
and wants to vote for Joe
Biden who's always pretending that he's
all about the cause of making America
great again when plainly he's simply
History's Greatest attention he's
always finding some new Injustice from
Obama's birth certificate to rig the
elections learning nothing about it and
making it personal so chew on that my
warrior friends the person you most
resemble is the guy who looks like he's
always jerking off two guys at once
there it is I got it in
