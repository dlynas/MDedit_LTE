## Transcript:
hi it's chris with implied music and i'm
on my front porch today it's a beautiful
um
spring day
here in
berkeley
berkeley is the home of a
renowned university the university of
california at berkeley and for many
years
was the home base for the
architect and architectural philosopher
christopher alexander and i'm here to
talk about his
amazing book a pattern language

so alexander just passed away he'd been
living in england in his mid-80s
he's responsible for a real change in um
architectural philosophy and what does
architecture have to do with
music well
in my mind a lot
but we'll put that aside for the moment
his book
a pattern language was the first of
assume it wasn't the first it might have
been might not have been the first in a
series of books that outlined a way of
thinking about
city
community
building
residence and commercial spaces that
really has transformed
some
architecture around the world
i said in my video
yesterday or the day before yesterday
feed your head well i try to feed my
head with lots of different kinds of
input and
it's a wide range of interests that i
have certainly the arts
theater dance
but also for me cosmology mathematics
history
various kinds of design and for me one
of the most interesting kinds of design
is architecture
here in the bay area we have it's the
home of the arts and crafts movement and
just over the course of this week i was
in buildings and structures designed by
bernard maybeck and julia morgan these
buildings
create a mood they have an impact on
my experience and the experience of
others
now
david byrne in his book how music works
makes a very good case that the design
of the rooms in which music was played
affected the composer's choices can you
imagine i'm sure it's true
the design of the rooms
either it has reverb or it's dry
you're close to the performer you're far
away it's going to affect the composer's
choices
well it's not just that but it's also
the experience of living and being in a
space and this is why i think a pattern
language is fascinating because
alexander
posits
what he calls a timeless way of building
that examines the actual
human experience of being in the world
and tries to build off that
the book itself and i'm gonna actually
just read a few things
um
contains
from macro to micro
ideas about how to shape the spaces
we're in
and in that sense it has a kind of a
fractal
sort of a fractal
kind of reality
for instance just opening the book at
random we get
a page that looks like this
a basic idea a statement an assertion
and then a proof
it's a lot like composing a piece of
music
this is pattern 45 and it's one of the
more macro patterns
necklace of community projects and his
assertion a local town hall will not be
an honest part of the community which
lives around it unless it is itself
surrounded by all kinds of small
community activities and projects
generated by the people for themselves
on the face of it it's
so sensible right
i love it
going on and just skipping into the book
a little bit further we're diving down
into micro and more like local personal
your own space type of patterns pattern
142 and i'm just opening these at random
142 is called sequence of sitting spaces
and the assertion
every corner of a building is a
potential sitting space
but each sitting space has different
needs for comfort and enclosure
according to its position in the
intimacy gradient
so
the pattern goes on he like makes a
statement and then there's at the end of
every pattern there's a therefore okay
if that's true what should we do
put in a sequence of graded sitting
spaces throughout the building
varying according to their degree of
enclosure
i need privacy not everyone does
deep deep into the pattern he starts
talking about really simple things
pattern 212
columns at the corners
how satisfying it is to see a building
with columns at the corners
pattern 225
frames as thickened edges
well if you're a composer or a creator
you've probably started to think about
your own set of patterns you may well
have
ideas about how you go about doing
things
and those ideas form a kind of a syntax
they are the
the grammar of your creative life
and very few people have been as
rigorous in their codification of that
as
alexander and his compatriots we should
also um
mention sarah ishikawa and murray
silverstein with a few other
contributors
what's interesting to me about this is
that while it has great rigor
it has a scientific openness and a
willingness to accept that any number of
things might go a bunch of different
directions depending on who they are
if you live in a diverse world if you
live in a world where you want to
support diversity it's really important
to accept that that pattern may not be
for everyone
a pattern language
well i hope this has been useful
like and subscribe and ding the bell
you'll be notified when i do my next
video
meanwhile from uh northern california
i'll see you next time

you
