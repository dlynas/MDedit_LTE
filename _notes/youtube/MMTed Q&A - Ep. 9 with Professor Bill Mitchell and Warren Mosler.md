## Transcript:

well hello and welcome to another
episode of mmt ed
q a thanks for joining us
and thanks to all of those who keep
submitting questions
we're trying to get to them as best we
can
tonight my special guest is warren
mosler
and i caught up with him from syncroy in
the virgin islands
okay warren here's a question from troy
and it's a u.s centric question warren
mosler tells us that if you pay your
taxes in cash at the irs
office the inland revenue service office
they give you a receipt and shred the
crash taxes don't fund spending per se
is the implication but what happens if
an irs
agent instead of shredding the cash
carried it across the street and handed
it to another government agency
for spending say for say the
environmental protection agency
can you explain the difference if any
from an accounting perspective
okay well from an economic perspective
there's no different than if they had
and then by the way they don't shred
themselves they send it to another
company that shreds it
right it would make no difference if
they shredded it and then
took which they do and then take fresh
bills off the
you know a different pile and use those
for the other agency to spend
so the accounting is exactly the same
everything's the same
when the treasury spends the fed uh
debits account credits the other
person's account if they
they don't spend in cash but they could
uh first the treasury would have to
buy the um uh cash from the fed
the fed would deliver all this cash to
the
office of the treasury to a car i guess
armored car
and then they would debit the treasury's
account reduce the balance in the
account
and then the treasury would deliver it
to whoever was going to get it that
person would presumably put it in his
bank account and so the treasury would
then increase
the money in that person's bank accounts
yeah but they
accounting is just after the back record
keeping it's how they keep track of it
has no
effect on the economy or whatever it's
just how the government keeps track of
things
for posterity yeah i get a lot of emails
from people saying oh yes but
uh the central bank has these uh
constrained by processes where it's all
very well to say they're typing numbers
into bank accounts when governments
spend
but the reserve say the reserve bank of
australia has
legislative processes where they've got
to have numbers in another account
for example tax the tax account before
they can put numbers in another account
doesn't mean doesn't that mean that
taxes fund government spending
yeah look they also have to wait for the
clock to turn over let's say they're
allowed to spend on tuesday it's monday
they can't spend today they have to wait
till tomorrow so they're all following
instructions all the time
yeah and that's that's a whole different
thing than um
being what i call operational
constraints it's not like they go to
change the number in the account to get
an electric shock or something
it just gets knocked under risk for
making a mistake or violating a policy
so yeah sure government has constraints
they have budgets they say we're only
going to spend this much on the military
we're only going to spend this much on
public health that doesn't mean they
don't
not able to spend more if they decided
to that's very different than having to
ask somebody else for them
now the other thing about spreading the
money
you know i made that point and the point
was made to show that
the government is different from the
rest of us
it's not to show that you don't need to
tax anybody to be able to spend that
wasn't the point of that got turned into
that
but when i originally came up with it i
said look if you don't think there's
something different going on who else if
you give them some money will send it to
a shred
not your local government okay not your
grocery store
if i give you you know hundred thousand
dollars in cash you're gonna throw in
the shredder no
but the government does so the point is
that there's something very different
going on government
and the difference is they're spending
first and then collecting the money and
then throw it away now the place that
actually does that would be the football
stadium
they sell you a ticket might be worth a
thousand dollars to the game
you walk up to the gate give it to the
guy and what does he do he tears it up
why would he tear up a thousand dollar
ticket well it's used up it's gone
everybody knows why he tears up the
ticket
for the movie theater so it was just to
make that point the difference between
issuer and user
what the government does require are tax
liabilities
without is the tax liabilities that
cause people to
become sellers of goods and services
labor
in order to to work to get the money
okay now the government can
hire people pay them and then the
tickets the dollars are returned to the
government and taxes so that the actual
payment of taxes is
kind of the last part of the chain first
part is the government wants you to work
for the government so they put a tax
liability on it
they create unemployment they create a
person now who needs paid work and can't
find it
because the government's the only place
for the money to pay taxes
they then go to the government they get
paid and then they can pay their taxes
and it gets thrown away so it's just
looking at the cycle right way around
instead of wrong way
right that's good so troy i hope that
answers your question
okay that's it for tonight thanks very

questions
and hopefully some more interesting
answers
