## Transcript:

this past weekend
in washington dc the far right
white nationalists they had a failure
they were totally outmaneuvered
outclassed out organized and out
humanitied of course
by counter protesters in that city who
turn their
attempts to replicate the
horrors of last year in charlottesville
virginia with a protest that actually
turned into
something much more uh analogous or much
more in reality of protesting of the
trump administration's
white supremacy racism savagery
inhumanity and cruelty
and a lot of those people who are
the harbingers of modern racism
of the 2018 version of ethnically
cleansing america whether in the policy
manifest those that come out of the
republican party or the filth that
emerges from internet
chat forums and seemingly everywhere
else
the wine track version of those people
talk about something called
western civilization in fact even
so called moderates are constantly
talking about the unique gifts of the
west
and this rhetoric usually overlaps with
being things
like i don't know classical liberals or
with
commitments often unfortunately fake
commitments
to things like free speech and open
societies things that we
actually do support here on this show
and in a broader
humane socialist project and the reason
i say so-called west is because
the west by any rigorous historical
geographic or intellectual definition
is a fiction and i say that because
the west conceptually from its
foundations
has never been a clear thing as an
example in antiquity
and scholarship for a long time
considered greece to be a part of the
east
or what was then called asiatic and only
very recently has been absorbed inside
what we call
europe some in greece that were
considered to be
important greek thinkers and
philosophers were actually in libya
and other parts of north africa as but
another example of this sort of
geographic fluidity
of the concept and the sort of disputed
nature of what is and is not west
the idea of the west is used to imply
that
it the sort of has been a fixed
static metaphysical reality that has
gone back
from greek times but we know even going
back to the disputed nature of greece in
the beginning
to the fact that islamic and arabic
societies were the sort of containers
through which
greek philosophy was held at different
points in history as an example plato
and aristotle
and those ideas were transmitted and
physically contained we know
that the moors were actually
a moroccan group that stretched their
influence all the way as far as
ireland so that this concept of fixed
geographic boundaries is even in
antiquity inaccurate in modern times
west of course doesn't include and
didn't include in colonial eras
uh colonized spaces in latin america as
an example which is geographically
pretty far west
the united kingdom and other great
empires
scoured the world and engaged in
colonialism and imperialism
in africa and asia stole resources
administered colonial governments and
disrupt
local forms of economy and governance
however
as we know from scholars like amartya
sen who's probably my favorite liberal
scholar
those concepts by which we are
strong and profound supporters of things
like holding power accountable
open exchanges uh systems of
intellectual rigor and accountability
across the society can actually be found
in traditions globally there was
traditions in china for public
accountability
traditions in india in african societies
there was
deep sort of cooperative decision-making
frameworks in the modern era
people in africa and asia and latin
america respond to colonialism and
imperialism often through marxist
thought but marx's thought
that grew and transformed in local
conditions and made marxism a
genuinely global tradition go back and
listen to the conversation with bill
fletcher jr
on the black marxist tradition so we
have three
core areas here one there's no
geographic or
historical continuity of the west
the west is an invented concept and
a lot of the people that people would
refer to as the sort of founders of the
west
were in fact uh libyan as an example and
greece was not
in europe conceptually until rather
recently
then we have a global expansion of
imperialism and colonialism where
countries in this periphery literally in
the economic periphery as we've designed
our modern world are subsumed into
western systems
and assigned as other outside of the
bounds of history progress democracy
science and accountability
and that was a political project the
political project that lives on today
through
global extraction of resources western
corporations world bank and imf and
trade agreements that are written
to not favor poorer and vulnerable
nations and three
concepts like accountability
like a need to intervene in history
to promote democracy human welfare
and overthrow every type of shackle
whether it be economic or religious
is something that either can be found in
traditions traditionally broadly
speaking with regards to
power accountability and public
discourse and specifically
in the battles against colonialism and
imperialism
systems of thought like marxism which
people might lazily call western
were indeed made actual global
traditions
with cuban vietnamese south
african and various other variations
the west is a fictitious concept it's a
way of making the world
neat clean and orderly in a way that
doesn't reflect reality
but does give a wine track version
of the types of simple categorizations
and efforts that supremacy
that we are fighting against every step
of the way so whether we are
overcoming some jackasses that come to
dc and need to be made fools of
or people who do
open exchange of ideas youtube
videos
question the very concept of the west
because history geography and global
philosophy
don't care about your bigoted fantasy
life
guys jump in here griscum you're
chomping at the bit on this one
recovered from the injuries i i keep
teasing this
i was shocked when i watched this video
we're gonna play later we'll have to
we'll have to save that
it's gonna happen right before your
economic update buddy i'm sure
everyone's going to enjoy that very much
they are my family and loved ones not so
much
but uh you know the the concept of of
the west is
one that is pretty funny because when
you start to ask people about which
nations are included in the west
and you really start to push them and
they start talking about countries like
um australia or south africa right you
start to
become very clear by what they mean by a
western tradition right
which is which is a white tradition and
you know i would just i would just add
that
especially with this idea in like in
philosophy it's something that's always
really funny when people start talking
about western philosophy looking at the
interventions
um that places outside of europe had
into like what would be quote and quote
um western philosophy to think that
someone in england
reading or actually even better think
about somebody in detroit michigan
reading hegel right has some kind of
more like claim to this
history of philosophy than somebody in
algeria is is pretty hilarious
right this idea of a kind of uniform uh
western tradition i mean we could talk
about western tradition as you know
beethoven
or uh i don't know problematic faulkner
right something like that but you're a
big fogner fan
bruce come really likes fogner yeah we'd
be careful with that one but uh he loves
it
but uh you know but it's also but it's
also kfc and like reality television
shows and it's just like the continuity
between these concepts is so
vast that to try to like package them
into this nice
kind of very you know academic veneer
that a lot of people do when they talk
about western
culture western cultural values which
are under attack
is and then just like as a
final point you look at things like when
when people like the most liberal the
most progressive people when they talk
about western values they're meaning
like liberal capitalist democracy
right uh well let's look at one of the
most western european nations spain
which throughout the last hundred years
was basically run under military
dictatorship
right well a nation like uh you know
japan had an actual democracy here
south korea had a democracy yeah they've
transitioned into those kind of
traditions
particularly south korea pretty robust
democracy and after that
of course of course breaking through a
horrible military
dictatorship as well but to try to with
this kind of backing of the united
states of course
exactly exactly so try to making this
continuous claim about western tradition
western values western cultures you know
it was really erroneous in the first
place so we should be careful about it
um because it it not only implies a
unity but it implies a fairly dangerous
unity
um of uh you know of of white supremacy
of colonialism and imperialism which
at least for me whenever i use that
tradition uh western tradition that's
typically
is more of what i'm drawing from what
i'm talking about in a critical way talk
about
western tradition substitute super
producer brendan finn
he's a scholar he's a very well read
gentleman
he has a thought on many things usually
which he
whispers fengali like in the background
but he's on mike today on tnbs
brendan your thoughts folks i'm just
going to start this off by saying that i
am no matt lek
oh stop it no no lucky in insights from
me
but i do recall and i don't want to
sidetrack this so just kill it whenever
you want but
i remember recall uh angela nagle
actually
pointing out that like while we do have
to
take these western chauvinists at task
and say like oh you guys are basically
just dog whistling for white supremacy
or something
to that extent racial superiority there
is a series of events that are going to
happen where
the western cultures are you know kind
of in
like going away and like they will be
outnumbered we will become a global
community and the question then becomes
like
how do we remember these histories these
people that aren't going to be here
anymore and
the fact of the matter is western
cultures are very bad at maintaining
others you know cultures or anything of
that sort
yeah let's see what we can do for
ourselves
i also think that one of the reasons
it's so important
i'll just say really briefly martia sen
wrote a piece called a book called the
argument of indian
and he took the task two arguments in it
one was this thing called the asian
values
uh argument in the 1990s which were
governments like in singapore and
malaysia and they would say look
we cane people and we beat the out
of you for spitting because we're
confusion
it's our value system and they made that
argument right and then
and then there was you know definitely
the 90s were like the kind of
you know halcyon age of of clinton and
thomas friedman and the really like
the west figured it out first but
everybody just wants to eat mcdonald's
and invest in blue chip companies and
that's sort of like
the end of history and what a marty said
came along he said look
obviously things like specific forms of
parliamentary democracy or
you know specific ways of doing things
were definitely like products of 17th
and 18th century europe
but more broadly speaking the notion
that you couldn't find
global roots on all continents and in
all traditions of
ideas of holding powder accountable
different types of group decision making
he even went into like
various forms of like early buddhist
communities in india
and how there was like relatively
democratic decision-making after the
death of the buddha and his point was
not to say like it was all the same or
that some of it wasn't even necessarily
like applicable in the modern age but to
say that like look
both of these viewpoints are really
wrong because one viewpoint is saying
that like
you know it's fixed and static and
somebody in singapore
because it's their culture right like
they you know they don't want to be able
to speak out against government
corruption because it harms social
cohesion
and then in the west you know or in
european united states like
oh yeah everybody really totally wants
to catch up with how we do things
versus just this notion that every human
being
really does uh you know there is an
instinct
uh you know for for freedom for having
accountability and
and you know this also to me sunk up uh
linked up with bill fletcher jr's
conversation on black marxist tradition
and the idea of like
these you know revolutionary figures in
places like africa saying like we have
to return to history
we've been robbed out of history by
things like imperialism and colonialism
and also at this time already we're not
talking about westernization we're
already talking about globalization in
the positive sense which is just
ideas and traditions and people
cross-pollinating
and generating things that make more
sense yeah and it's like and that's just
one more thing
to to add is that you know think about
that um the paul robeson video that we
watched for a cold open
which set the stage
that's how we do when he
says you know it's like you know
america is my country and i built this
country that's right and you know that's
something that's very powerful and
that's also true
um in in the united kingdom as well and
in france so like all these nations
they're these kind of relationships are
very deep and they're the relationships
of force and the relationships of
of terror but this kind of way to talk
about you know these communities that
are
fading away now that we're all living
together i mean like we've been
interacting with like so much of the
world like the entire west has been
interacting with so much of the world
for so long to try to talk about it's
like some moment that's passed
um is you know absolutely wrong and it
also erases
the majority of history of all of these
nations i'm picturing like the idw
twerps that sometimes happen upon this
show just like
that that's wrong it's factually
accurate the west the west west
benjamin wow why won't why don't
alexandria court has debate about
shapiro
i'm gonna go masturbating about her now
that's my idw
fan voice pretty good yeah he might be a
patron
uh well if he's a patron then he's great
remember there is a patrons or good rule
being a patron of the show means that
you support the free exchange of ideas
yeah that's true
there's been a handful there's there's
patron there's actually there's some
patrons who i know disagree on any
number of things but
just like the quality level can't argue
with that
