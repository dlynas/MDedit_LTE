## Transcript:
thank you very much for joining us
um Professor Randall Ray a senior
scholar at the Levee Institute
and author of The macroeconomics
textbook co-authored with uh
Professor Bill Mitchell and Martin Watts
and a prominent post Keynesian modern
monetary theorist scholar and student of
the famous Hyman P Minsky thank you for
coming on
sure thanks for uh having me on
um so in today's episode
um we'll be looking at
crisis economic crisis specifically
financial crisis and it's a broad topic
that includes a variety of issues such
as investment the accelerator growth
Banking and a range of policy
instruments like monetary policy and
Regulation and hopefully we'll be able
to cover most of if not all of these
topics in the upcoming slides that the
professor is going to show us so let's
get right into it okay so I'm going to
go through the theoretical background
and I'm happy to take questions on any
of this and then we can discuss more uh
the financial crisis if you want
so let's begin with Keynes
uh Kansas general theory uh really was
the beginning of a non-marxist
macroeconomics he's sort of the the
father of macroeconomics
um outside the Marxist tradition
and in his general theory what he did
was Advanced a theory of effective
demand
and in terms of the general theory uh
what he presents that as is the
intersection of an aggregate demand
curve he called D the D curve in an
aggregate supply curve he called the Z
curve that determines the point of
equilibrium the point of effective
demand and the way that I always put
this to make it as simple as possible
Keynes view was that firms produce what
they expect to sell they hire the number
of workers that they believe are
necessary to produce the amount of
output they think they can sell uh and
make a profit
so that is the point of equilibrium
there's no reason to believe this is
full employment because firms are not in
the business of hiring and doing charity
work they're in the business of making
profits okay in Kane's system
investment is seen as the driving
variable
that causes income to increase or
decrease and that savings simply adjusts
to this so Keynes like the neoclassical
approach beforehand
agrees that investment equals saving and
equilibrium which is also a neoclassical
Theory they do it in the loanable funds
market for canes though uh the saving
depends on income and investment is the
driver of income so essentially saving
just passively adjusts to be equal to
investment
okay so it's seen as a demand driven
model with investment the driver of
demand
and this is fine for the short run which
was keynes's main concern in the general
theory so we look at the demand
generating effect of investment
perfectly fine for the short run and
what does the short run mean it means
you can take the quantity of capital and
the quantity of Labor as fixed and then
you determine the point of equilibrium
so capacity is is fixed and you try to
if you're not at full employment then
you might want to stimulate investment
in order to increase aggregate demand
and increase employment so you try to
figure out ways to increase agit demand
so you can move toward full employment
because the general assumption is that
the market doesn't get you to Full
Employment you are generally below Full
Employment and Keynes goes through a
long explanation for why this should be
your expectation in a capitalist economy
and I'm not going to go through that in
detail now but uh the the key is because
we're a money using economy
right and it would be a sheer
coincidence that employment would be at
the Full Employment level
yeah we have we have a video on that on
YouTube from the last time you did come
on so we got that covered but uh the
point I want to make is that Keynes
talks about an equilibrium beneath full
employment
but I think a lot of post keynesians
especially like Steve Keen I I would
think would have an issue with that
since they don't really believe in
equilibrium right whether or employment
or plan for unemployment the economy is
always out of equilibrium a dynamic
system so what would your take beyond
that well there there are several
different uh post Keynesian approaches
and heterodox approaches in general uh I
accept the view that what Keynes was
trying to do was to find a point of
equilibrium that is not a market
clearing equilibrium in any sense it is
a position of rest as Joan Robinson put
it it's a position in which
firms have employed exactly the number
of workers they think they need to
produce the amount of output they can
sell at profit that's a state of rest
that is his definition of equilibrium
and I don't think that people like Steve
Keane and so on fully understand this
that that is what Keynes means by
equilibrium has nothing to do with
market clearing
right okay so that's that's my response
they may not be satisfied with this
because they've probably heard it before
but I think this is Keynes View and this
is certainly my view and I think also
the view of Joan Robinson
okay so anyway uh now we all know
because you you had principles of
economics that there's a multiplier so
if investment goes up by 10 income goes
up by more and the reason is because as
investment increases what that means is
you're employing more workers to produce
capital goods and those workers are
going to consume
so consumption goes up too so investment
has a multiplier effect on income
because the workers in the investment
sector increase their consumption
and so income goes up by multiple and
for undergraduates we usually use a
multiplier 10 because they can do the
math so if investment goes up by 10
income goes up by 100 now real world
multipliers are nothing like this uh
maybe more like less than two and uh
Keynes warns in the general theory don't
take this too literally don't get all
hung up in the mathematics of this he
was very worried that people would have
a very mechanical approach to the
multiplier and all the textbooks do have
a mechanical approach to the multiplier
okay and he goes through reasons why the
multiplier can vary uh and so on that
I'm not going to go through but anyway
this then led to two issues in the early
post-war period uh the first is called
the accelerator and the second is uh
what leads to growth Theory
okay because uh in the general theory
we're taking a short run approach but if
we expand this to a longer run approach
it's not legitimate to hold capacity
constant if you're increasing investment
capacity goes up you can produce more
so an increase of uh uh
investment will increase income through
the multiplier
and it's reasonable to assume that as
you go through time if national income
is going up firms want to invest more
so that is going to lead to an increase
of investment so
it's called the accelerator because the
multiplier process increases income
and then that induces more investment
which causes growth to accelerate
so I'll spend a little bit of time
talking about that and then the one that
I think is actually more interesting is
that investment is going to lead to more
Capital that increases potential output
and that led to the question
how can you be sure
that aggregate demand increases on a
pace
with potential output as investment
proceeds
and then this led on to growth Theory
so those are the two topics
I'm going to uh
some Marxist economists like Paul Sweezy
of this concept of the tendency of the
Surplus to rise
especially with large oligopolistic
firms that have allows that capacity of
the Investments are made but demand
doesn't quite catch up to fill that and
that kind of leads to wastage and
and of a kind of inefficient uses and
that kind of leads to crisis
um do you think there's any uh truth to
that kind of approach yes yes there's a
tendency towards secular stagnation yes
right and I think that that is what we
have seen in the post-war period And so
one way to try to forestall the
stagnation is to have government
increase spending
now none of the keynes's own model and
these models I'm gonna get into and
don't directly include uh government
spending or even the foreign sector so
we're doing a very simple simplified
model here I'm going to go through
the um the work that showed the
conditions in which
aggregate demand does grow fast enough
to use the capacity that's being
generated without using the government
to fill the demand Gap okay so it's
possible but it turns out unlikely
and so it's more likely you're going to
end up with secular stagnation and that
is why there's a role for the government
to play
or exports but of course
exports are bigger Thy Neighbor
can't work for everybody
someone has to lose and Keynes was very
worried about that
so yes that's exactly right and so yes
the the
um the work of dolmar is similar to the
work of Sweezy
right right
okay so Howard Domo model
when I had a brief look I haven't
studied in depth they seem to have a
loanable funds approach with more
savings leads to more investment no not
really nope
in the textbook Exposition it could be
the textbook
that is not the original domar uh domar
had a very good understanding of Keynes
and of the saving investment relation uh
so I'll do that next first we'll do the
accelerator then I'll do the um okay
so-called growth Theory
okay so going back to Kane's fluctuation
of investment is the key driver of the
cycle
and uh that we're going to see it's also
a key driver of profits that's koleski
so the accelerator model we typically
assume investment is autonomous
uh it has a multiplier fact so basically
that's what Keynes is doing in the
general theory but now we're going to
assume the desired investment is related
to GDP so as GDP Rises so it's not
autonomous now we're making it a
function of income desire your desired
Capital stock a star Rises and we're
going to keep it simple uh so that um
your desired Capital stock is equal to V
times expected uh future
GDP where V is your desired capital
income ratio we're assuming firms have a
desired Capital ratio relative to income
and they're going to try to keep that
ratio constant through time it's a
simplifying assumption that makes it
possible to solve the model okay
so investment uh in time T has to close
the gap to achieve the desired Capital
ratio
so V is the accelerator coefficient it
tells us how much investment is induced
as income goes up this is going to make
investment more variable than GDP we
have a table in the textbook that shows
you that I I it becomes much more the
system becomes much more
uh unstable when we do this and the
reason in words is because investment
has a multiplier impact on GDP which
then has an accelerator impact on
investment as firms try to close the gap
between investment and desired
investment based on that Capital output
ratio now this is too simple in the
textbook we go through a more a flexible
accelerator I'm not going to do that now
but you could assume that firms just
gradually close the gap instead of
trying to close it really quickly that
helps to smooth things out it makes a
less unstable I suppose the flexible one
just kind of at the speed of adjustment
variable yes and then if you're
neoclassical you can make that a
function of the interest rate
which we didn't do in the textbook yeah
okay so there's an interaction with
multiplier and accelerator investment
raises income through the multiplier
that increases investment through the
accelerator
but as the economy uh reaches a peak
and investment Falls that reduces income
through the multiplier reducing
investment through the accelerator so
you can see that there's a feedback
effect and it's going to make the system
very unstable
and um the cyclical Behavior can be a
nice stable cycle it can be damped which
means you reduce the deviation or
explosive where you go to infinity or
zero depending on the parameters which
are the propensity to save and the
accelerator
um coefficient okay I'm going to come
back to this because Minsky starts here
in the 1950s go ahead
all right so maybe I'm considering over
to wait for Minsky but um I guess I'll
just say it now uh so when I looked at
this in the textbook and it kind of
shows a cyclical pattern I think it goes
right back to my notion about is there
an equilibrium because we seem to
constantly be in flux merely by the
mechanisms of the multiply accelerator
itself and also I know a lot of
the post Keynesian theories and then
Minsky's Theory itself a lot of them are
based on like psychological factors like
expectations about the future other
correct of Iran
um they multiply accelerator model seems
to show cyclical fluctuations even when
you keep all the behaviorable variables
constant like the propensity consume and
and the responsiveness to investment
um in regards to changes in income
um so from the looks of it capitalism as
a mere point of mathematics is unstable
right like behavioral factors kept
constant
yes as we'll see uh Minsky's argument is
uh the market processes are
destabilizing and this is an example of
a market process that is destabilizing
but we can constrain the instability
with institutions
so this puts Orthodox economics turns it
on its head
in Orthodox economics the market is
stable
the institutions destabilize it Minsky
reverses that
right which is interesting because
Samuelson kind of came up with this
Theory and he's a neoclassical
equilibrium theorist like how did he
reconcile those two beliefs he had I'll
show you in just a minute
brilliant all right let's get to it okay
so anyway the second thing that I wanted
to to look at is related but um it's a
bit different agenda and that is the
domar Eric models which became growth
models now they did not think they were
doing growth models that isn't what they
set out to do
um but it's what became the growth model
so in the late 40s and into the 50s uh
people were worried that the Great
Depression would come back right we had
the the huge boost of World War II got
us out of the Great Depression
uh Hanson uh warned that uh you know we
were gonna have stagnation uh with the
withdrawal of all the government
spending
domar uh was thinking about this
question Keynes is a short run model and
he's ignoring the capacity effect of
investment
how can we be sure that the demand
effect of investment will be great
enough to keep Capital fully employed
what happens if it leads to excess
capacity then we're going to get secular
stagnation
okay and so Herod and Omar can be seen
as trying to extend Keynes to allow
capacity to change which means now we're
doing a long run model
so we're we're moving from a short run
model to a long run model they also were
interested in the distribution effects
of different spending propensities this
is especially Herod and that is what led
to post Keynesian work on distribution
the early post Keynesian word kragel and
Eichner go through
and pastimati through the distribution
uh impacts of changing the propensities
to consume and save workers and of
capitalists again I'm not going to go
into that that's not the direction that
interested me uh of the the dolmar model
uh what interested me was this question
about stability Through Time
okay
so a general growth model
um is that um over the long run growth
must be determined by either you
increase the quantity of the factors of
production or you improve the technology
so growth can be induced by increased
the quantity of capital quantity of
Labor or technology
Orthodox usually use a production
function uh so really it's just a micro
production function at the aggregate
level where output
is equal to a which stands for
technology
plus the
um the quantity of capital and the
quantity of Labor that grow through time
we assume there are constant returns to
scale perfect competition Factory inputs
return earn a return based on their
marginal productivity we assume Cobb
Douglas and then we take the production
the the derivative of that so we get the
growth of income d y over y equals
the share of employment and output which
is 1 minus V times the growth of labor
plus the share of capital and output
which is V times the growth of capital
plus the Improvement of Technology
okay so this is a straight neoclassical
uh version of what they were trying to
do and this became interpreted as the
neoclassical growth model why do they
use Cobb Douglas and all this because it
has this nice characteristic that you
can do this so that you can um allocate
uh the contribution according to the
shares of Labor and um capital in output
okay uh various uh Orthodox economists
beginning with solo
tried to use this framework to estimate
actual real world growth
and they find that or solo first found
that after growth of labor hours uh
they're still up to 80 percent
unexplained of growth and uh after some
revisions to his estimates he's able to
explain about 50 percent
and so the Unexplained part must be
technical progress so that's the idea
actually what it measures of course is
uh all of your error
um maybe your specification isn't right
maybe you're not measuring the factors
of production correctly maybe a
production function approach is just
wrong uh it's a measure of your
ignorance really
so over the years people
have uh uh improved it in the sense that
the Unexplained part gets smaller and
smaller uh Denison finds about a third
is due to technical progress Robert
Gordon has a really a great book in many
ways the rise and fall of American
growth
um in that uh
he discusses a lot of the real world
stuff that really mattered
but still in the back of his mind he has
this framework
uh which is really a supply-side
approach
to uh aggregate to economic growth
and um I I think that that is the main
flaw of the book again I don't want to
go into that and I just pointed out that
um this sort of work continues
so it all assumes that Labor's share of
income accurately reflects Labor's
contribution to production
that is it assumes that marginal
productivity theory is correct okay uh
Anmar Shake uh in 1974 wrote this famous
paper the humbug production function
which I'll come back to which um
explains why the empirical work looks
pretty good and but first I want to go
into the Cambridge critique of this
approach
okay
okay so the Herod model
I'm not going to go through all the math
I'm just going to give the assumptions
and then skip to the conclusion right
here
uh saving
is equal to the average propensity to
save which is the same as the marginal
propensity to save because we're doing
the long run model
times income the labor force grows at a
concentrate in there's no technical
progress we can add it in but this just
keeps us simpler there's no depreciation
of capital again it can be added in but
this keeps the math simple
the production function has fixed
coefficients of Labor and capital
so production of one unit of output
requires a fixed amount of capital and a
fixed amount of Labor to double output
you have to double each input again this
keeps things simple
we let um oh here I'm letting U be the
labor output ratio usually it's 1 minus
V
and V is the capital output ratio and we
do all the math and we get to the
conclusion which is that
uh the the rate of growth of output
has to be equal to the ratio of the
propensity to save to the capital output
ratio
it must grow at that same rate Through
Time
to make sure that investment equals
saving Through Time
this will ensure the the demand side of
your economy is growing at the same Pace
as the supply side
which means
you get to use all the capital that you
produced we don't have a tendency
towards secular stagnation
so this is the necessary condition to
avoid having too much capital or too
little capital
okay
now since we assume that the saving rate
and the desired Capital output Ratio or
constants
then the growth rate also has to be
constant
in order to keep investment equal to
saving
and
have the right amount of
capital no excess no shortage now as to
your question
is this loan with funds the answer is no
it's not loanable funds this is a
necessary condition
for the demand side and supply side to
grow at the same pace
so no he did not fall into a loanable
funds theory that saving as financing
investment
okay
okay brilliant all right
um Del Mar's model is very similar I
actually like domar better but people
are more familiar with Herod so I'm I'm
presenting Herod we can do a very
similar thing with uh domar and then we
show that they are mathematically
equivalent results
right okay
so then
um Joan Robinson comes along says you
know it's very unlikely that this is
going to happen it's very unlikely we're
gonna have exactly the right growth rate
and so she lays out uh three different
growth rates the warranted growth rate
the natural growth rate and the actual
growth rate so the warranted growth rate
GW
is
s over V
okay that's the necessary rate of growth
to ensure that the level of the Capital
stock is exactly that which firms
require given the current level of
output it keeps the capital output ratio
constant
if the economy grows at this rate
there's no reason for firms to try to
reduce or increase the Capital stock
growth rate
because it's the right growth rate if
the economy grew slower you'd have too
much Capital not enough demand
if it grew faster you wouldn't have
enough capital
so this is the the only growth rate that
works okay the it keeps you on
equilibrium of equilibrium path where
demand is growing equal to supply
then there's the natural growth rate
which is the growth rate of the labor
force if the economy grows faster than
that you run out of workers
if the economy grows slower you get
unemployment
so if uh the GN equals GW then you're
growing with full employment
and then finally the actual rate of
growth is GA it's whatever the economy
is actually growing
the Golden Age occurs where these three
things are equal
so
your actual growth rate is equal to your
warranted growth rate and that is equal
to the rate of growth of your labor
force
right if the actual doesn't equal the
warranted then the actual Capital stock
is not equal to the desired stock
if the actual doesn't equal the natural
then you're not at full employment
either too little or too much labor
but s v and N are all independently
determined
so there's no reason to believe that
we're going to get the golden age
it's a sheer coincidence
okay that's bad enough
that it requires a sheer coincidence but
it's worse than that because if you're
not there you won't go there
there's nothing that stabilizes you it's
a knife edge okay so there's a stability
problem
if the warranted doesn't equal the
actual you probably won't move to
equilibrium you'll move further and
further away
if the warranted is above the actual
you're growing too slowly
firms have more Capital than they want
because output is lower than they
expected so what do they do reduce
investment what does that do slows
growth even more
so you fall away from the warranted rate
you move to a slower and slower growth
rate what happens if the actual is above
the warranted now firms have less
Capital than they want because outputs
higher than they expected
so they invest more so what happens you
grow even faster so you grow farther and
farther above the warranted rate
so it's a knife edge property you're
only stable if you happen to be there
okay so it's the worst outcome you can
get
um if we add in technological growth I
said we can do it uh then we're adding
another variable that is independent
and so it's even less likely
uh your growth rate is going to have to
be higher than the labor force growth
rate to keep your labor fully employed
so that makes it the stability even
harder
okay so that uh that finishes what they
were trying to do
okay
and then
there are two problems with this
one is
the real world is unstable
but it's not that unstable
right this knife edge property would
make you think you either go to infinity
or zero
because you're not likely to be on the
knife edge
so there must be something
that prevents you from falling off the
cliff or going you know to the Stars
right and the second is that um if
you're a good neoclassical economy so
you believe it's the market that keeps
you in equilibrium
so solo comes along I'll come back to
the first one later what is it that
keeps the you on it keeps you near
enough to the knife edge because Minsky
had an answer to that right but solo had
a neoclassical answer it's the market
that does it
and so he says the economy has to be
more stable than that
and there must be some Market mechanism
that will move you back to your
equilibrium growth path
so he you know he's thinking uh what if
the propensity to save is too high given
the growth of the labor force and the
capital income ratio then you're going
to have too much saving
well what happens if you have too much
saving the interest rate goes down
because it's loanable funds so this is
where the loan with funds is it's not in
dolmar it's in Solo okay who should know
bigger because he's supposed to be a
Keynesian right but anyway Domo
um as usual I mean the budget came so
I'm not surprised
so anyway
the
um uh
the interest rate is going to fall
and uh that's the cost of capital so
firms want to use more Capital relative
to labor
so uh what solo is saying is the problem
with the domar model is the capital
output ratio is fixed
but he's saying it won't be fixed
because if Capital gets relatively
cheaper
then you're going to switch and use more
capital and less labor if labor gets uh
cheaper you will switch and use more
labor than Capital so it's because the
factors of production
uh uh how the quantity you use of each
depends on the the cost of those so
that's the market mechanism working
so anyway as the interest rate goes down
you use more Capital relative to labor
so you switch to a capital intensive
production process
firms are glad to have more capital
and uh
it's it's
because you're happy with the greater
capital
uh you don't try to change that uh the
amount of investment
to reduce it you want more investment so
you you remain in equilibrium
on the other hand if the propensity
saves too low then the industry is
driven up so firms use less capital and
more labor
so they switch to a labor intensive
production process so the conclusions of
taking this approach that Solo's taking
is that we always stay at full capacity
growth is Stable Market forces move the
economy to an equilibrium growth path
and it's the propensity to save that is
driving the system
not investment it's a propensity to save
because it causes the interest rate to
adjust
it's a loadable funds argument
so then this leads to uh two kinds of
critiques
the first is the Cambridge controversies
Robinson and sarafa now sarafa in 1926
had already destroyed the marginal
productivity Theory
this is brought back uh in with his book
in 1960 and uh by Joan Robinson
who showed that it's not true that they
desired Capital output ratio depends on
the interest rate a falling interest
rate won't necessarily lead to a greater
substitution of capital
they essentially showed that the
analysis
that uses capital and labor as factors
of production with returns determined by
their marginal productivity is illogical
part of the problem is the capital is
heterogeneous
how do you measure it
how can you measure the marginal product
of capital
you can only measure it on the basis of
expected profits because it's
heterogeneous you can't use weight or
something like that it has to be its
profitability
and you have to know the price of
capital in order to calculate a profit
rate
but you can't derive a price of capital
without knowing the profit rate
okay so you've got this you know the
endless Circle the profit rate can't be
determined from the demand and supply of
capital
so marginal analysis in general so this
critique it was all about it's called
the capital controversy but it's equally
true of Labor
and Keynes made a mistake in the general
theory where he said he would accept the
postulate that the wage equals a
marginal product of labor and this made
sarafa Furious because in 26 he had
already shown the marginal productivity
theory is completely illogical you
cannot derive
um
nice sloping functions of uh labor
against labor demand against the wage
and now this debate is all about the
interest rate and capital uh it can be
shown that as interest rates and wages
change you switch techniques
and uh in in ways that violate demand
curves
so you can't expect a monotonic
relationship between the industrating
capital okay right uh
now eventually
uh solo admitted solo and Samuelson
admitted that uh uh the
Cambridge England side was correct in
the Cambridge U.S side was wrong okay
but it's made no difference whatsoever
fascinating you think it was in a paper
called summing up but Samuelson just say
is the the simple tale that the
neoclassicals thought isn't as it is and
uh it's sad but then you just went on to
keep on teaching
the same stuff
and thank you I'll come to you in just a
second so
um
so it says okay well our Theory isn't
coherent
uh but when you use a Cobb Douglas
production function if it's the data
really well you know that's what my
lecturer said when I broke my Cambridge
controversies up in regards to the
forecast so so here's the answer you
want to give them you know and and so
make you in his textbook uh he says it's
just amazing how the good the
correlation is he never mentions the
Cambridge controversy and probably in
truth he's never heard of it
I wouldn't be surprised at all if he's
never heard they lost this debate
um but anyway what Shake showed uh in 74
is it's an algebraic equality
uh so this is a long quote but so long
as aggregate Shares are constant and
this is one of call doors
uh empirical you know regularities uh uh
a fact that labor and capital shares
change very very slowly okay and until
the past 20 years in the United States
the uh the shares were very very
constant so as long as those aggregate
Shares are constant and aggregate Cobb
Douglas uh production function having
apparently constant returns to scale
will always provide an exact fit for any
data whatsoever
will seem to also possess marginal
products equal to respective Factor
rewards and he shows this is true for
any data including uh uh any kind of
economy and so what he did was he uh
created a production function that
spells out humbug
to create the data then uses the um Cobb
Douglas production function to estimate
it fit and it's perfect
okay so it just shows it's not due to
any law of Economics is due to the laws
of algebra if you estimate an identity
you get a very good fit
so in Solo actually wrote a response uh
to shake and he said
I'm paraphrasing he didn't use exactly
these words okay
well I wasn't testing agri-production
functions or marginal products or
anything else I was just showing how to
interpret empirical evidence if you
start by assuming the data were
generated from a good neoclassical
production function
it's as funny as you could get right
and then thank you says this is proof
that the Cobb Douglas production
function fits reality right
just because we're assuming we're
assuming that the data came out of it
anyway uh and uh you notice the whole
real real business cycle literature they
gained Credence because they used a Cobb
Douglas production function and came up
with an explanation uh and use the the
good fit to show that real business
cycle theory is true right so it's still
it's still used in spite of shake
showing your estimating
um identities
all right uh that is it on that topic do
you have any
yeah I mean so I guess the the what's
the alternative right proposed
keynesians we're not going to use cop
Douglas I know for the short run we
can't tend to use the leontia production
functions
um but when you look at the long term
economic growth like what's the
alternative
well I I don't think uh that production
aggregate production functions are a way
to do anything at all
um I think you know the the things that
work well are um stock flow consistent
modeling with uh when Godly sectoral
balances approach
I I would do that
instead of um
uh using production functions
right and there's a lot of calls to
incorporate energy into into growth
Theory uh on this production Theory
generally even like just the circular
flow of income what are your opinions on
that
right I'm not sure what that is
like as an input into production I I
don't have an opinion I mean I think we
need to um
worry about environmental impacts of
growth uh
and uh
um
you know move toward environmental
sustainability uh and I don't think we
should uh promote growth for growth's
sake anyway
uh I think it's very important to
you know to to watch what's going on in
the economy and and try to be prepared
for an oncoming financial crisis which I
think we are facing
um but I I don't think production
functions help you at all
I I think Godly sectoral balances watch
what what's going on in the private
sector
um as far as um their saving rates and
their debt ratios
I think is helpful so looking at
financial data instead
of
um
you know real productivity I think is
what's important you think there's any
um use in taking straffa's
um input output method developing it
further in in post games in economics
there yeah
input output analysis so if you're
talking about a developing country and
you're you're trying to figure out you
know which areas should they invest in
where do they already have some
strengths which is the inputs right you
know which uh you know what what kinds
of uh characteristics does their labor
force have what kinds of Natural
Resources do they have uh I think input
output analysis is
um uh very good does not be seraphian
um
it was always quite a lot more
complicated I think the appeal of
neoclassical economics is all simple it
is at least with all the mouse just just
the diagrams and whatnot
you get into Stratford it's really hard
to wrap your hair around it so I think
the students
um I mean even for the professors
themselves I think there's a reason
where they just keep speaking to
neoclassical equilibrium Theory and all
of that and just measure Capital as if
it's um
some substance that you can keep adding
on on and on a putty buddy buddy and
Clay yes yeah I yeah I know but I think
um
there there also is a very strong belief
that markets work
and I think that is what heterodox uh
Rejects
that that that whole uh framework is
just wrong
markets don't work that way
uh there's no there is no invisible hand
which Keynes had already said uh in his
end of laissez-faire he he he didn't
know what to replace it with in 1926 but
he knew that was wrong
okay uh and you know now we have another
100 Years of evidence that it's just
wrong markets do not work that way
financial markets don't work that way
and the the production side of our
economy doesn't work that way
okay let's get on to the next stuff okay
so now gradually uh I'll be moving to uh
Minsky so
let's start with uh keynes's ethereal
investment so before we were saying
we're taking it as a um you know
autonomous exogenous given
uh but Keynes does have a theory of how
investment is determined and uh the best
place for this is chapter 17 of the
general theory uh although it's very
difficult
uh going I'm I'm going to simplify I'm
not going to do the the full-blown
theory of asset pricing
uh there are other places in the general
theory where he has a much more
simplified approach so that's what I'm
using here
uh to uh
get behind the investment decision so
um gains formulates what he calls a
marginal efficiency of capital
this is not marginal productivity of
capital so it's not physical output
it is the money returns you can get from
investing in capital so it's a money
return not a physical return some people
accuse gains wrongly of having some kind
of marginal productivity theory he
didn't this is all in dollars or pounds
uh whatever I suppose that's why learner
prefer to call the marginal efficiency
of investment right well there is
marginal efficiency of investment and
marginal efficiency Capital there's some
debate about this and I guess hardcore
is probably one of the best sources if
you want to read up on it so I'm not
going to go into that
uh
we'll keep it simple marginal efficiency
Capital it's equal to the rated discount
it'll make the present value of a series
of annuities so these are the the pounds
in the future or dollars in the future
given by the returns expected from the
capital asset during its life just equal
to the supply price
um so
and then he goes on to say we calculate
the marginal efficiency of a variety of
types of capital assets that we might
invest in the greatest of the marginal
efficiencies is then taken to be the
marginal efficiency of capital in
general
what does it mean so investment is going
to yield a series of expected returns he
calls them cues for quasi-rant which
comes from Marshall
so in year one we have q one year two we
have Q2 on out to the final year Q in no
reason why the Q is the same in every
year probably in the in the first year
it's going to be low
uh as you know you're introducing some
product to the market and then the cues
increase and then maybe they start
dropping off towards the end so we can
have different cues in each year
what we have to do then is Discount
those back to the present to compare
them to the price of buying the capital
and decide whether it's worth it to buy
the capital so we discount back and
compare to the supply price
we find the marginal efficiency of
capital that just makes the expected
returns
equal to the supply price that's one way
of doing it uh that's I think the best
way to do it but he also says you can
compare the Mec to the interest rate the
market interest rate and then invest
only where the Mec is created in the
interest rate uh I don't like this one
as much and uh Vicky chick and her I
think a 1986 book on Keynes
uh goes through examples where these
don't necessarily give you the same
answer
the the first one is much more
consistent with his argument in chapter
17. so that's the one that I would
prefer to use
so
we
calculate the mecs and then compare them
against the supply price of capital
I got two questions on that okay
um and there in regards to I guess where
you touch on the interest rate
um so I suppose if it's above the
interest rate go ahead and invest this
is the basic idea but of course the Mec
itself can shift in response to
aggregate demand conditions in the
economy I know Warren Mosler talks a lot
about the interest income effect
would you say that
um any change in the interest rate
wouldn't be a mechanical sort of
um effect because the interest rate
itself can
um shift the Mec
well
um
you're you're making this decision
exante like right now
so uh you're
comparing it to the current rate of
interest
okay so you're making the the decision
today do I hold a financial asset and
get interest or do I buy a capital asset
and get the cues
that that that's the second method here
uh now it begs the question
which interest rate right
says the interest rate
what interest rate are you going to use
um that's why I don't like this one
the other one
what we're doing is we're looking at all
kind of possible assets that we can hold
including Financial assets
and then we are calculating the expected
returns and in chapter 17 those expected
returns include the queue
less the carrying cost
plus the liquidity premium
okay and that makes it possible to
compare a financial asset any financial
asset
against any physical asset
because you compare the total returns Q
minus C plus l
uh so it's it's a much more complicated
and I think much more appealing
approach than the simple one where you
compare the Mec against an interest rate
okay
um I suppose my second question will
also be quite similar and if you go back
to the reswitching argument
um but Capital intensity
well it could be really high at a given
interest rate and then
as it increases it lowers but then it
gets high again
um would that also be an argument
against the
mechanistic way of viewing interest
rates on investment
I I would say yes
um
again we we need a a way
to compare
uh the return expected returns
of every possible thing we can hold
Through Time
and that's what chapter 17 is doing
so it's much more complicated than this
uh graph here
and
uh then we make a choice depending on
our expectations now you could ask well
what happens if your expectations change
well of course then you would make a
different decision
and
um there's there's no reason why the
decision you made yesterday uh
would be the same as the one you make
today
and there's no reason why the decision
you made yesterday
uh it turns out to have been a mistake
you can make mistakes
in the general Craig has a paper where
he talks about the three different
methods in the general theory
so the simplest one is to assume that
uh whatever you expected turns out to be
true
and so you never second guess and that's
keynes's preferred method in the general
theory
um but he also does allow for you uh to
find out it was a mistake
that's the second method
and then the third is
uh you you find out as a mistake but you
don't change your behavior and then the
third one is you find out it was a
mistake and so you change your behavior
the third one is by far the most
realistic one it's the one he uses the
least but the reason he uses it less is
because if he can show you don't get
full employment
even if your expectations are always
fulfilled
that's the strongest possible argument
against pagu
strongest argument against neoclassical
economics
because if you're saying that
unemployment exists because firms made a
mistake that's a weak argument
because in the long run you figure well
they'll learn from making mistakes
but if you say that
um even if they don't make a mistake
there's nothing to push you to full
employment
okay you're they oh they did the best
that they could do
and it turned out their expectations
were completely fulfilled
and still we didn't have full employment
that's the strongest argument you can
make against neoclassical Theory so
that's why he usually assumed that
even though it's not realistic
right
all right
um
in chapter chapter there are chapter 17
post keynesians and their chapter 12
post keynesians
the chapter 17 post keynesians we were
talking about uh equilibrium chapter 17
is an equilibrium chapter
okay uh you know you're making decisions
and
um you're coming to a point of effective
demand
depending on how much investment there
is
chapter 12
is a disequilibrium chapter
so the post keynesians who don't like
equilibrium love chapter 12.
uh because it's all about you know the
speculation
whirlwinds of optimism and pessimism
um
that I
doesn't seem to be about equilibrium at
all it's about great instability
so he defines Enterprise as trying to
forecast a prospective yield or the life
of an asset
um
versus speculation which is trying to
forecast the psychology of the market
where you're trying to out guess average
opinion
and he says that when Enterprise
dominates you get relative stability
when speculation dominates you get great
instability okay
and the problem is that as investment
markets he's talking about the stock
market has the stock market develops
and improves
speculation increasingly dominates
um and that's a big problem because now
uh you're going to be focused on
speculating instead of investing uh in
plant and equipment for the long run
so speculation and bubbles on a steady
stream of Enterprise is okay but when
speculation starts to dominate over
Enterprise then you're in big trouble
so he talks about ways that you might
make the stock market less unstable and
it sounds something like a Tobin tax he
says we get make stock ownership more
like a marriage so it lasts longer or we
can impose a cost of getting out
uh but there's a problem
economic Prosperity relies excessively
on a spontaneous urged action what he
means is that you're confident enough to
invest because investment is the driver
of the system
um if investment relied only on closed
calculation we would have too little and
the reason is because if you think about
it too carefully you would never invest
because the future is too uncertain so
we need a spontaneous urge to invest
in order to have a decent economy
with economic growth
and what this means is that the
politicians always have to favor the
business man say business person uh in
order to keep them optimistic so they
will invest so we're we're sort of
beholden to the capitalists
everything we do has to please them and
keep them happy or we don't have a
decent economy and Keynes wants to
change that so in chapter 24 he talks
about socializing investment
so that we don't have to rely so much on
the business person
and doing everything possible to keep
them happy
he also says in this chapter that you
can't really solve the problem with
monetary policy
okay you uh it's going to require
um fiscal policy SP the spending side
not the monetary side of government
because
you can't counter the wide swings of the
marginal efficiency of capital
uh which swings because of optimism and
pessimism up and down you can't counter
that by changing the interest rate
the MEK can fall too fast and too far
for you to offset that by lowering the
interest rate through monetary policy
so we're gonna have to rely on fiscal
policy and neoclassicals keep
emphasizing the role of expectations and
that the interest rate is the main
driver of expectations what would you
say to that
uh well it certainly didn't work
we we had zero and even negative on
government debt and could not induce
investment
and recovery from the global financial
crisis
see the the problem is uh there's no
limit to how low the MEK can go I always
ask my students even graduate students
can the meek the marginal efficiency
Capital go negative you know and they
usually say no they say well hold on a
second you can't think of Investments
that will be losers
that give you negative profits of course
you can it's easy to come up with those
you know for bearing trout farms let's
grow trout in the pond and harvest their
fur for winter coats
that's going to be a sure loser
so there there's no lower limit to the
MEK and the problem in 2010 was every
possible investment you could make had a
negative return
so it does no good having a zero
interest rate
okay and that's why it won't work
right all right a funny point about the
speculation as Keynes came up with his
analogy called the the Keynesian beauty
contest yeah the idea isn't to to find
out which stock which company is going
to perform best to invest in them it's
more like finding out what the public
opinion is so if you choose between the
six previous faces you'd lose because
you'd think I have to choose the six
faces that the public is going to find
the most prettiest when you can have
like a third order four over version of
it is where you think that well the
public already knows I'm going to think
like this I'm gonna have to outwit them
so it is a he had a funny way of writing
games did
and you know that is the way the FED
operates now they're trying to out guess
average opinion and in order to control
average opinion
they they've got themselves you know all
wrapped up in a little ball
where they do things that they don't
really want to do in order to try to
influence opinions
what trying to play 4D chess
yeah yeah
that's how monetary policy works today
they're they're just chasing their own
tail
and it does not work so they uh they
were trying to get inflation
expectations up to two percent they
could not do it for 10 years
um and and now and they always claimed
expectations determine inflation okay
and so inflation in the U.S goes to
eight percent and expected inflation is
three
it's clear expectations are not causing
inflation okay
expectations are still low
even though we've had a year of high
inflation
everyone expects them to go back down uh
and so the the FED has had to abandon
this belief that expectations determine
inflation because it's clearly wrong and
it's always been wrong
okay
70s because because the big argument was
in the 70s we've got stagflation because
inflation expectations came into line
with um
well the actual inflation yeah well that
was wrong that isn't true
the we add inflation because OPEC
quadrupled the price of oil
and uh oil just like uh happened
recently uh and oil feeds into food with
a little bit of a lag because food
prices are 70 oil prices
then the final component was shelter
costs
those three components drove inflation
it had nothing to do with expectations
expectations eventually converge to
reality not the other way around reality
does not converge to expectations
expectations converge to reality at
least for everyone who's who is sane
okay there there are people for two
thousand years have been expecting
a second coming of Christ it has not
happened well I suppose they would
emphasize the fact that taxation was
accelerating rather than just increasing
from biology and that was due to
expectations
it it was uh largely shelter and food
because food is with a lag
one once you have increased the cost of
planting your crops and pouring the
fertilizer on them and uh the pesticides
you've got to recover those costs and in
addition uh there were geopolitical
reasons why we were exporting uh wheat
to the Soviet Union
uh those two things oil prices and
exports uh helped drive up the price of
food
and then shelter in the United States is
very complexly determined
it's not expectations and you know if it
was just expectations
why is inflation global
uh so people say well you know Biden
caused it uh but hold a second Biden did
not send checks to everybody in the
world
it only happened in America
uh but inflation is global
why well food and oil
um in the UK would appreciate some of
those tricks right now
you say what we'd appreciate some of the
taxi in the UK right now oh yeah Biden
could send him over
and then of course if the U.S raises
interest rates everyone does and uh that
helps to um uh depreciate currencies and
cause inflation in foreign countries so
it some of it does come back because of
U.S Behavior but it wasn't expectations
it was the FED that did that okay we
better move
okay uh koleski's model of investment
the only reason I want to present this
is because of the profits equation
uh because I'll need that later talking
about Minsky uh probably most people are
familiar with it you if you started the
aggregate level with GDP equals income
uh you can
balance the spending side and the income
side uh and get down to the profits
equation in the simple model with no
government and no foreign sector
profits are identically equal to
consumption out of profits plus
investment
so the way that kluskey put it is
capitals get what they spend
whatever they spend on consumption comes
back to them in the form of profits
whatever they spend on investment comes
back to them in the form of profits so
capitalist spending determines profits
what this means is profits are
determining the aggregate level it's not
determined by
competitive Behavior by market power
anything like that and the aggregate is
determined by what capital is spend
if we expand the model to include
government spending and net exports and
then of course taxes too then we get uh
the the full-blown profits equation
which is that profits net of taxes are
equal to investment plus G minus t which
is the government's deficit plus net
exports plus consumption out of profits
minus saving out of wages
uh as a simplifying assumption klesky
assumed that this is zero and out in the
real world it is about zero because
workers don't earn enough to save
so uh that one can usually be
ignored consumption out of profits I
usually is also assumed to be zero
because capitalists exist to invest they
don't exist to consume and so we get
down to gross profit or sorry net
profits at the aggregate level are equal
to the investment plus the deficit plus
net exports why is this
basically it's because these are kinds
of spending uh that are not
um
that are additional demands on output
that are not expenses of capitalists who
produce the consumer goods so that is
why they generate profit they generate
extra income
to the capitalists
uh so we're going to use this when we
get to
um Minsky
Minsky's early contributions in the
1950s
um he uh had three important papers in
the 1950s
that sort of laid the groundwork for his
later work
first Innovation is endogenous
and responds to profit opportunity now
schumpeter was Minsky's dissertation
advisor until he died and um uh schum
Peter of course is famous for innovation
what Minsky did was he
extended Innovation to the financial
sector
uh show Peter was all about innovation
in the you know the so-called real
sector
and um Minsky made innovation in the
financial sector responsive to profits
so if there's a profit opportunity uh
the financial sector innovates in order
to take advantage of that
he talked about the development of the
FED funds Market which is in the United
States that's our inner Bank lending
Market where Banks lend reserves to each
other
and
um uh that led to a version of
endogenous money arguing the Central
Bank cannot control
the quantity of Bank lending by
controlling quantity reserves because
Banks can economize on Reserves
so they can make loans even if Central
Bank is trying to constrain the growth
of Reserves and the FED funds Market was
an example of how banks economize on
reserves any bank with extra reserves
can lend them to banks that need more
Reserves
the problem is innovation stretches the
liquidity of banks
and increases fragility so the um the
banks will have fewer liquid assets
relative to illiquid assets like loans
which before the the era of
securitization
uh you couldn't get loans off your
balance sheet so once you made a loan
you were stuck with it relatively
illiquid and that will increase
Financial fragility
uh intervention by the government
uh it could be the treasury but usually
it's the central bank
will validate Innovations so the idea is
Banks innovate that increased fragility
to a Breaking Point they get in trouble
and then the government bails them out
uh intervenes and that validates the
Innovations
so they continue doing them
if the the government didn't do that if
the Innovation led to failure
they would drop the Innovation but they
don't drop the Innovations because uh
the government intervenes
yeah go ahead
um so he recognized the money was
endogenous what if in the um gold
standard days because this is the 1950s
we had like an international gold stand
in terms of Bretton Woods but especially
before 1934 we had a fixed exchange rate
even domestically uh does that constrain
Bank lending does that ensure the banks
act more like The Honorable funds Theory
approach would pretend like they do
no not not for Minsky uh as far as I
remember he never talked about the gold
standard that way it constrains fiscal
policy
also understand it does not constrain
banking they can because
my thinking is that if if there's a gold
standard Banks just won't get results on
demand like they do now
um and then they'll have to be more
powerful with of Landing but the the
banks don't have to provide gold
okay they only have to provide Reserves
and the central bank can always provide
reserves if banks need them the senator
Bank can always be a lender of Last
Resort even on a gold standard uh but it
constrains fiscal policy
so that uh the uh you you worry about
your pressure on the exchange rate if
the economy is growing too fast
deposit
which is what happened
right in in the uh when uh when France
decided uh to break the dollar
um Nixon went off goal uh Minsky saw
that as a constraint definitely and
um so not a topic that I'm going to do
today Minsky advocated a job guarantee
and he recognized the gold standard
could be a constraint on implementing a
uh the job guarantee so when we when we
went off gold he said we have finally
removed the last constraint that
prevents us from having a job guarantee
so he saw it as a fiscal constraint
okay other uh paper in 1957 he used that
multiplier accelerator model of
Samuelson
uh but instead of having a neoclassical
stabilizer his stabilizer was
institutions
so he argued that the um
with a multiplier accelerator model the
uh
economy will
um
good cycle
and they could be explosive Cycles
there's no reason why they're in you
know a nice
constraint cycle
but we have
um ceilings and floors so a ceiling
means a limit to how fast you can grow a
floor means how far you can fall down uh
over the course of the business cycle
and those ceilings and floors are
institutional constraints
so instead of the market being stable
the Market's unstable
but we stabilize the market
by uh instituting institutions and I'll
talk about more uh in a minute
uh about how the government provides
institutions to stabilize the market
processes but just for right now let me
say Minsky didn't argue that it's only
the government the market itself
can create ceilings and Floors
and an example is in the stock market
you can suspend Trading if prices fall
too much in one day what do you do
you stop it okay you suspend trading you
try opening the next day and see if
markets have cooled down if they haven't
you keep it closed right and then you
try this the third day if things have
settled down then you allow trading to
occur so that that's a market ins Market
created Institution
that stabilizes a naturally unstable
Market process
which is when crypto is falling what
happens you sell right so you need
something to prevent
uh the market from going to zero
so very different from Samus and solo
yep so when it comes to like the Great
Depression that preceded the Great
Depression like the long depression
after 1893 the one after 1873 like what
what got us out of it because at the
time government institutions were very
they barely existed there was no such
thing yeah there was no fiscal policy
well not much anyway so what kind of got
us out of that
well you um what happens is Minsky you
talked about this that without the
government what happens in a depression
is it has to go on long enough
until you have simplified the financial
system what does that mean
most of the financial sector fails
right okay you you go as low as you
possibly can and
then it it could be you you've had um
you know negative net investment
for a long enough period of time
the the capacity has been destroyed and
you know there's always some consumption
going on
and you you finally reach the the limit
of uh how much capacity you had to
destroy in order to induce some new
investment
and that will get you going again and
the advantage you have is there's no
debt
because anyone who had debt has already
defaulted
so now you get to start again with a
simplified Financial system not much
debt only equity
and an incentive to invest because you
wiped out capacity
that's what we used to do
okay and then in the in the Great
Depression that's the path we were
headed on
until the new deal and World War II
that's what got us out
you said there was any Samuel
sayonianism Samuel sonian multiply
accelerator Dynamic going on that would
go us back
to you well once the investment starts
increasing yeah uh slowly you can get on
a path to recovery right okay
and just one other thing remember we
crashed in 1907 too
and we didn't have a central bank so you
guys did but we didn't
um
and uh so JP Morgan got all the big
Bankers into one room and locked the
door and said you guys are not leaving
this room until we get an agreement you
know we got to bail each other out
and then they started working to create
the Fed so that they wouldn't have to do
it again the next time so that that's an
example of the market coming together
and creating an institution that we
protect protect each other which some
crypto people are trying to do now right
because there's no Central Bank for
crypto and so they're trying to see if
they can do what um JP Morgan did
the first attempt failed we'll see if
the second one uh can succeed that's
interesting because before the central
bank was created we had an era of Free
banking Banks like they offer their own
their own notes basically how did that
work
well that's what we did we had the worst
banking history of any country in the
world
we we had a depression every 20 years
in the 19th century every 20 years we
had a depression
um with bank runs
that's what happens if you don't have a
central bank
so you guys learned your lesson earlier
than we did you you read uh beijit and
the bank of England started acting as a
lender of Last Resort but we didn't have
uh if banks issue their own notes how do
backgrounds work because we're not
competitors print their own modes in in
response to uh well because they usually
make them convertible into something
well no they made them convertible into
Bank of England notes all right yeah and
they had done that for a long time
and the bank of England did not act as a
lender of Last Resort so you had Bank
runs and then finally after uh Beijing
they the bank of England started acting
like a central bank
but before they always would call in
their notes if there was a run on the
country Banks the bank of England would
call in its own notes
uh making things worse because nobody
had notes to do the conversion then they
realized oh no we don't call in notes
what we would do is we lend notes if you
lend your notes then the banks can do
the Redemption
I presume in America those banknotes
would redeemable in dollars but that
there was no Central Bank to offer
dollars on demand
they could be redeemable into private
Notes too
um but uh
and I suppose uh coins and yes we we had
uh treasury notes
that they could they can redeemable for
okay uh the the last point is Minsky
is writing in the 50s he says okay we
have these ceilings and floors in place
these institutions are stabilizing the
economy
uh but the problem is stability is
destabilizing this is one of his most
famous uh quotes and uh it probably came
from ABBA learner
um it was a a phrase he picked up from
Bob Lerner maybe he was describing
Minsky's Theory
and uh Vince he's associated with that
so anyway the he was predicting that
also although things are stable now our
financial system is very uh simple and
safe
that will change because of the
innovations that are gradually going to
stretch uh fragility and uh a crisis uh
we will start to have crises again we we
went for probably our longest period
ever without a financial crisis our
first one was 1966 and it was very small
in the 70s we started having more
serious Financial crises but that's a
period from World War II uh until the
70s uh we didn't really have Financial
crises for the first time in our history
um but he predicted they would come back
extensions in the 60s and 70s this is
when he develops
the um Financial instability hypothesis
so uh he writes the book John Maynard
Keynes where he presents the financial
theory of investment
so what Minsky said is Keynes developed
an investment Theory
of the cycle
and what was lacking was a financial
theory of investment so we have a
financial theory of investment and
investment theory of the cycle
he used a two price system approach this
is this comes out of chapter 17 of the
general theory
we have a price system for current
output including capital and then a
price system for assets and it's the
interplay between these two systems of
prices
that generates investment
so the demand price of capital
has to be greater than the supply price
of capital which comes out of the
current output price system in order to
have investment occur so that's why it's
a
Financial theory of investment
uh I'll come back to that
and then uh he also included lenders and
borrowers risk which came out of kolesky
as well as koleski's view of profits
this wasn't added until the 70s
when uh apparently misky came across the
koleski profit equation and he put that
into his uh Financial instability
hypothesis
where the idea is investment today is
forthcoming only if investment is
expected in the future okay why does he
put it this way because if there's no
investment in the future there's no
profits in the future
investment spending is the source of
profits it creates profits via the
colesky equation
and then finally the financial
instability hypothesis is the idea that
parent stability changes expectations
and behavior in a way that generates
fragility
so there is an investment profit uh
positive feedback effect
a self-fulfilling expectations
that actually make things worse
uh for reasons that I'll get to
so that's a summary of uh what he's
trying to do and I'll go into his
uh
model of uh this and and how he explains
the the development of the uh Financial
profiles as we go through the business
cycle
so investment theory of the cycle
Financial theory of investment
at least a portion of investment has to
be financed some of it is internal
financed with some of it is external
financed
um so here is his famous investment
diagram
uh on the vertical access we have the
demand for Capital which is PK and the
supply of capital which is PS
on the horizontal we have the quantity
of investment
and we can think of this as uh both
a diagram for the individual investment
decision and also a diagram of what's
going on in the economy as a whole so a
macro level diagram
so in order for investment to occur
demand price has to be above the supply
price
the supply price comes out of the
current output price system
this is the uh the price quote
that the supplier will give you if you
buy a new machine
okay and so say that this is the quote
we will sell you the machine for this
price now you have to decide is it worth
it to buy it
well now you have to do the Keynes
calculation what are the expected
returns
from investing and I need to Discount
those back to the present because the
Returns come in the future
and I can also add another discount
factor for how uncertain am I about this
how much confidence do I have
inform formulating my expectations
so that
discounted future returns give me a
demand price which is PK now I've drawn
it so the PK is above the PS
otherwise you don't invest right PK must
be higher than PS so there's no
investment
so we've got the demand price above that
means we want to invest
okay
PK is ever equal to VPS like on the die
they start at the same place where the
amount you want to you're willing to pay
is equal to amount they're willing to
supply
well uh if it was exactly on it I
suppose you you would invest up to this
point
okay right all the interesting points
are Beyond this one though
okay so
I sub little I I think it is very small
to read this is internal investment so
you're using your own retained funds
so you can invest this amount using your
own funds
all right but you can see the PK is way
above
the PS so you're willing to borrow
if you borrowed in those borrowers risk
and lenders risk
let's do the lender's risk first so the
lender's risk is mostly objective
because it's written into the loan
contract
so this is what it costs you to borrow
and as you borrow more the costs go up
the the costs include the interest rates
and other
um codicils they put into the loan
contract it could be that you have to
maintain bigger counter balances in your
deposit account so banks will typically
require you
to have deposits in your account so you
have to hold more deposits that's a cost
to you and uh the
whatever else there you know the
collateral that you have to have coming
up with more collateral is a cost so
this slopes upward
that's lender's risk for the most part
it's subjective you know what it is
because it's written into the contracts
there's also borrowers risk borrower's
risk is subjective
okay it's not written into a contract it
is how much risk do you think you're
taking by going into debt
because if you go into debt
uh there's a danger you're going to lose
your firm
um if you can't service the debt so
you're taking a bankruptcy court if you
use your own funds
what if it turns out you were completely
wrong
uh about the returns and your returns
actually are down here
you lose your own funds but you don't go
bankrupt
but if it turns out the returns are down
here and you borrowed you lose your firm
so you have to build in a lender's risk
that is much sorry a borrower's risk
that is much greater than
um
just losing your own funds because you
lose control over the firm
and this is also downward sloping
because the the more you borrow the
greater the risk you're going to go
bankrupt
the intersection of these two then
determines how much you invest this much
you use your own funds this much you
borrow
now the idea is that over the course of
the cycle these these curves can shift
around
and
if it turns out that this was a a good
project your expectations are met
you had built in a margin of error
because you had accounted for borrowers
risk
but you say well everything turned out
fine
you might now think that the risks are
lower
and so the borrower's risk curve could
shift out more
because you think the chances of
bankruptcy aren't that great because the
economy is doing really well you're
doing well and you uh reduce your
estimate of what the borrower's risk is
so this curve could be flatter
at the same time the lenders find out
that hey you made all your payments
the economy is doing well hardly
anyone's defaulting
so the lender's risk also is reduced
so in an expansion these curves tend to
get flatter and you get more and more
investment
the more investment there is the more
profits there are
so the easier it is for you to get
profits because there's more profits in
the aggregate
so success breeds more success
because it encourages more investment
which creates more profit which then
encourage you to borrow and invest more
so it's a self-fulfilling prophecy until
something goes wrong
when something goes wrong then
everything moves the other direction
okay a few big firms fail
they default on their debt
now the banks start worrying they
increase the lender's risk
and borrowers start worrying it might
have happened to them too so then all
the curves shift in
and that becomes a self-fulfilling
prophecy too because if investment is
going down profits go down and you're
going to get more failures
so you can see how you could explain
uh the boom and you know the downturn
because
of the self-fulfilling nature
of expectations
investment leads to more profit
reducing investment leads to less profit
so your expectations
um are reinforced by the way things work
the aggregate level
what specific Factor would flatten the
curve compared to like just shifting it
okay well the that's right if if you
become less optimistic
the PK is going to shift down
and the borrower's risk is going to
become steeper too so both things
probably happen right
when you're optimistic probably both
things happen too
both the PK shifts up and the borrower's
risk gets flatter and ditto for the
lenders now the PS is just going to
depend on the costs
uh to the suppliers so that one may not
shift up and down over the course of the
cycle it might it depends on whether you
get bottlenecks
in production if you did then the PS
could shift up
it becomes more costly to produce the
machines because you run up against a
shortage of Labor or a shortage of
inputs so it could shift up but it
doesn't necessarily have to
um
would it be because it seems to imply
that the people who produce the machines
are also the lenders but usually you
have a separate industrial sector a
banking sector
and then the Borrowers
so why would there be lender's risk for
the producers themselves oh no
this this lender's risk is paid by you
the buyer not by them
you you have to pay interest
uh on um the uh the loans from the banks
so lender's risk is faced by you the
buyer not the seller okay
although they may be borrowing too
so their interest rate could change the
final thing is of course what does the
Central Bank do in an expansion
eventually they always raise interest
rates right yeah so that that is going
to increase the cost to you of borrowing
so interest costs are going to go up
this this curve can get steeper not
necessarily because the lenders are
worried well because the FED is raising
rates Central Bank is raising rates
so the borrowing costs go up right
okay
endogenous money uh
Minsky's second phrase the this very
famous is anyone can create money the
problem is to get it accepted so what he
meant was anybody can issue a monetary
IOU your problem is to find someone to
accept it
for banks this is pretty easy because
they have the central bank and the uh
Deposit Insurance which in the U.S is
the treasury
they have the cinder bank and deposit
Insurance standing behind them so it's
easy for banks to get their money
accepted it's harder for the rest of us
to get our money I O use accepted so
would it have been harder for some banks
to get the currency accepted in the Free
banking era
sure yeah Banks notes did not exchange
at par
in the U.S so a
Chase Bank uh note that says a dollar on
it might be accepted at 50 cents
at uh JP Morgan uh so no we did not have
notes exchanging at par
so it would depend you know on the
perceived riskiness of that bank it
could also just depend on
um how far away is the bank right the
United States is a huge country if you
have a New York bank note in San
Francisco
uh it may not be accepted at par even if
no one's that worried about the bank
okay um
money uh is a unit of account
and then we have ious denominated in
money
so this is what he means when he says
anyone can create money
uh he's not
he doesn't mean anyone can create
currency of course that's not true but
anyone can create a dollar denominated
uh IOU
banks are firms just like other firms
they're profit Seekers and they are
innovators
and they are continually innovating for
two reasons
one is The Regulators that include the
central bank and Treasury
may be trying to constrain them
and so they innovate to get around
constraints
and the second reason they innovate is
because they're they're
competing for profits and one of the
ways you get profits is you come up with
some new Financial instrument
and you can get profits from it for a
while
the thing about uh Financial Innovations
is that you usually can't trademark them
right so they get copied so you invent
securitized mortgages
and for a while it's very profitable
but eventually everyone's going to be
doing it and so the profits get competed
away so you have to innovate again so
you say I'll securitize subprime
mortgages
because nobody's doing that yet and then
pretty soon everybody's doing it so you
have to continually innovate with new
products
uh or
um the you know the profits disappear
because everybody can copy you
um the central bank is uh supervises
uh Banks so looks at their balance
sheets uh to see what they're doing they
regulate what is acceptable behavior and
they set the interest rate target
they don't control the money supply
the
um minutes he always said the most
important function of the central bank
is lender of Last Resort
uh and what that does is it sets a floor
to asset prices
you can see the
supervision and regulation is trying to
set a ceiling to asset prices
so for example the the FED has the the
legal ability
to set margin requirements for stocks
so how much can you borrow versus how
much of your own funds do you have to
use to play in the stock market if stock
market is booming the FED can raise
margin requirements
that is to put a ceiling
on financial assets
or it can limit what banks can lend to
which kind of activities they can lend
to that'll put a ceiling the the FED
also has the ability to regulate
mortgage markets so we can try to
prevent a housing bubble
by preventing Lending
so the
Center Bank sets both ceilings and
Floors
lender of Last Resort you're setting a
floor because you know as draghi says
whatever it takes once you say we will
buy it you set a floor to how low it can
go
um so what this approach I mean this
sort of vision of how Banks work does
that apply to like Credit Unions as well
and building societies and whatnot
Yep they're all
they're all in you know very similar
activity which is determining uh what is
uh credit worthy enough
for them to buy it so is your IOU credit
worthy enough for me to buy it
uh Credit Unions
um maybe they're buying commercial paper
so you know is the commercial paper of
General Motors
uh credit worthy enough for us to buy
and then they issue their own
liabilities so what financial
institutions do that's unusual
is they buy assets and issue liabilities
you know so was this firm here they're
buying assets and issuing liabilities
but the difference is financial
institutions
put very little of their own money in
right five percent to eight percent
the their leverage ratio is very high
their leverage ratio might be twenty to
one for a bank
it might be 300 to one
for a uh uh a non-bank bank a shadow
Bank maybe 300 to one
so the leverage ratios are very very
high much higher than for non-financial
corporations
so it's mostly other people's money
uh that they are using in other words
they're issuing liabilities that people
are holding to finance their position
and assets
and the ratio of um their financial
liabilities to their financial assets is
very high much higher than for
non-financial corporations but otherwise
everybody's issuing liabilities to buy
assets
but what makes financial institutions
different
is the percent
of their own money that's at risk it's
very low that's why they have to be
regulated
there's another important factor whether
that backstop by the Central Bank such
as a financial institution but doesn't
have an account at the central bank
and they're creating loans then
obviously if I have a kind of is a risk
to crisis
yes it is and that see that's the that's
why the the regulation should be much
closer
on a Chartered Bank
because the um uh the equity
uh is not so much at risk
because the central bank's going to step
in and help them
and so Market incentives don't work at
all
with a Chartered Bank that has the
treasury and Central Bank standing
behind them they can't work
because they they have protection behind
them if you talk about Shadow Banks then
the idea is
that uh the holders of liabilities no
uh that there's a risk and they are
supposed to do some kind of supervision
now the reality is that doesn't work
either
because uh you
let's say it's not transparent it's too
difficult to find out what they're
holding which is what we found out with
crypto right
it was too difficult to find out
uh you know what the assets really were
of these exchanges it turned out they
didn't have much of any they all they
had was liabilities almost no assets
okay final step
the financial instability hypothesis so
it's a financial theory of investment
investment theory of the cycle
positions and assets have to be financed
including investment
uh you build in margins of safety in
case your expectations were too
optimistic
so Minsky uh developed this
classification scheme there are hedge
speculative and Ponzi Financial profiles
and a hedge profile is one where the
expectation is that your income
flowing in is enough to service your
debt to pay both principle and interest
that's the safest one a speculative
position is one where in short term
you can cover the interest payments but
not the principal
okay this is okay as long as your income
will go up
so lots of kinds of Investments uh you
don't get much
uh income
in the near term
but eventually your income flow will go
up that's why you're investing so a lot
of Investments are speculative this is
not speculative in the same census of
Keynes this is not a euphoric
speculative speculative bubble this is
just a speculative profile where your
income needs to go up in order to pay
the principal
and then finally Ponzi is when
you can't even pay the interest so you
have to capitalize the interest that is
you have to borrow to pay interest
there are some kinds of businesses where
Ponzi Finance is okay like if you're a
home builder
you're building a home you're going to
sell it you have no income until you
sell the home
that's a Ponzi Finance because you still
have to pay the interest but you pay the
interest by
capitalizing it into your loan so your
loan gets bigger and bigger until
finally you can sell the home
so Ponzi could be a strategy that's okay
but
what means he's more worried about is
you become Ponzi because your income
fell so if you were in a speculative
position you could pay the interest
but then instead of going up your income
goes down
you can't pay the interest now you're
Ponzi
so you have to start borrowing to pay
interest so Ponzi is the riskiest one
and things uh either have to get better
or you're going to get cut off
because a bank will not continue to lend
to you increasing the size of your loan
uh forever
so Ponzi is unsustainable
financial position it can't continue his
argument is that over the course of the
cycle you start out from uh you know the
depression or a deep recession
with a robust Financial system because
uh everybody who had risky Financial
positions went bankrupt
so we have a robust Financial system
but over time success
will create instability so you will get
uh you will move from Mostly hedge
to a mixture of hedge and speculative
and then finally to a speculative
position dominate the economy and you
get some Ponzi
and then either Banks cut off The
Lending
or some Ponzi units fail
and then that can spread through the
system as the lenders tighten up all the
lending standards and
um
it gets hard to uh to get loans
investment Falls profits fall and the
system goes into a downturn
so that's the um uh the explanation of
the business cycle
you can even get a Fisher debt deflation
process so this is Fisher 1933 when he
wrote about the Great Depression uh was
so bad uh not just because output fell
and unemployment Rose
but because asset prices collapsed
because everybody had to sell assets to
try to make payments on their own debts
and that is what causes all the asset
prices to collapse because if there
there's all Sellers and no buyers the
prices fall so in the Great Depression
asset prices fell by 85 percent in the
United States GDP only fell by 50
so that is what made the depression so
that
institutional constraints put ceilings
and Floors on income
so that is the big government that's the
fiscal policy but ceilings and Floors on
income uh Minsky talks about
the income and employment effect that's
basically the multiplier
so government spending has a multiplier
attached to it
uh if Government increases its spending
that has a multiplier impact on total
spending
there's also a cash flow effect that is
the kolesky profit equation
that government deficits
increase profits so when you go into a
downturn the deficit goes up that keeps
profits flowing to firms so they can
make payments on their debt
and then finally the portfolio effect of
big government is
that deficits lead to government debt
which is a safe asset to hold in
portfolios so you get um
uh government data in a private
portfolios and uh strengthen the
portfolios
the big bank is the central bank it also
puts ceiling and Floors I talk more
about them already supervision
regulation lender of Last Resort
the problem with having a big government
a big bank is it creates a moral hazard
because the government is there
to bail the system out and they
especially bail out the biggest firms
and biggest banks because that feel
their failure would have the uh too big
of an effect on the economy
and then that creates uh the expectation
that the government will always come to
the rescue so no risk is too great and
you get um
uh the transition from hedge to
speculative to Ponzi
in the Minsky's latest work he talked
about the long-term evolution of the
economy over the whole post-war period
from a very uh stable kind of capitalism
that he called money uh sorry not my
managerial welfare state capitalism
that um had the big government and the
big Central Bank institutions that
promoted stability
um and uh institutions that helped to
keep uh employment closer to full
employment
but gradually over time
that was transformed into money manager
capitalism
uh in the 1980s
which was a much riskier kind of
capitalism in which the main financial
institutions were not regulated Banks
they were what we used to call non-bank
Banks but Paul McCully came up with the
term Shadow Banks those become the
dominant financial institutions they're
much riskier
they're not regulated very much
and they are not transparent it's hard
to know what's going on
and that is what finally collapsed in
the global financial crisis money
manager capitalism is very similar to
what we had before the Great Depression
which was called Finance capitalism by
hilferding Minsky argued that kind of
capitalism crashed in 1929
we replaced it with this very stable
kind of capitalism
but that gradually evolved to money
manager capitalism
and he asked the question can it happen
again what he meant was Great Depression
with a Fisher debt deflation process he
asked that question in 1984 and he said
no it can't
the reason is because we have all these
stabilizing institutions
by 1989 he changed his mind
he said yes it possibly could happen
again
and we came close
in 2008 okay and we may come close again
so it didn't quite happen again
we got the worst Global financial crisis
since the 1930s but we did recover and
we still are in this stage money manager
capitalism
right okay what to do yeah go ahead
I have one more slide
so I think Minsky agreed that the
central bank has to step in as a lender
of Last Resort but many people both left
on the road especially on the left they
see this as a bailout another too big to
feel Banks should have been left to fail
and die
so what really was the blower in 2008
yeah was it bad yeah well lender of Last
Resort really does not mean you bail out
the bank
it means you bail out the bank's
customers
okay
um now Minsky died in 1996.
well before the crisis so there's no way
to know
for sure what he would have done in 2008
okay
uh
I think the FED should have been a
lender of Last Resort
I think the FDIC should have paid off
insured depositors
but I think that we should have done
what FDR did in 1933
and I believe Minsky would agree with
this
the only way I I can justify saying that
minsey would agree is because he wrote a
lot about what FDR did
okay so I think he would have said we
should do what FDR did which is you
declare a bank holiday
you shut down all the big Banks see in
the United States our small Banks were
fine they didn't do any of the crazy
stuff
so we had thousands of small banks that
were perfectly fine we would have only
had to close uh 12 Banks
close those 12 Banks down
uh and uh take them over
fire all the management and start
Prosecuting them and put as many of them
in prison as we could and we we could
have probably put a thousand of them in
prison
prosecute every single one of them
very long prison terms to teach them a
lesson and then which we did in the
saving the loan crisis we put a thousand
uh top Management in prison
um
then gradually
sell off the assets
cover the insured depositors
and then choose which other kinds of
holders of liabilities
uh there would be a public purpose in
Saving
so for example Pension funds
uh Pension funds were holding a lot of
garbage
a lot of garbage assets that uh were
sold to them by the investment Banks and
I think we should have bailed out the
Pension funds so we would have to make
choices like that that aren't easy
choices you know who do you save who do
you let fail
um but that's what we should have done
and I think Minsky would agree none of
that is lender of Last Resort
lender of Last Resort means that you
lend to
a bank that is healthy
and has good assets that in normal times
would be acceptable collateral for
Lending
and you lend at a penalty interest rate
we didn't do any of those things
so the what what Bernanke did uh was
completely inconsistent with lender of
Last Resort
okay
penalty interest I know Warren mosa
doesn't agree with penalty interest
rates because yeah his idea is that you
give the reserves so people can um some
people supposed to save but like what
what's the rationale behind penalty
interest rates
because you don't want them to come
unless they really need it and we did
the opposite see we didn't even make
them come to the discount window what
Bernanke did was he auctioned off
Reserves
and then uh the the the the the final
accepted bid whatever that rate was
which would be the lowest one so the the
FED would take the highest bids first
and if they're auctioning off say 800
billion of Reserves
uh the final bid for that last dollar of
the 800 billion whatever that interest
rate was was the interest rate everybody
paid
so it not only wasn't a penalty rate it
wasn't even the market rate it was below
the market rate that's what the Fed was
lending at it's the opposite
the opposite of well-established lender
of Last Resort policy
so we weren't even landing at the market
rate okay so we were subsidizing the
interest rate
lending uh basically to 14 Banks 14
Global Banks got most of the loans
and um it
much of what the FED did was illegal the
illegal by Federal Reserve Act rules not
only bad idea but illegal activities
uh that the Fed was engaged in and
remember uh Bernanke knew this
Congress asked him
we want the data we want to know what
you guys did and Bernanke refused to
supply it
Bloomberg took
um the FED to court under Freedom of
Information Act uh case and one
and so that data was released
and two of my graduate students went
through the data and found out there's
29 trillion dollars
of loans originated
uh the vast majority of that for 14
Banks
plus foreign central banks
that's who got the lending and it's 29
trillion
we shouldn't have done any of that
okay I think Warren and I strongly
disagree with each other on what should
have been done uh I I think that those
those Banks had engaged in massively
fraudulent Behavior and they should have
been shut down and prosecuted not saved
and the financial system would be much
better today if we had done that both
the the land of glass Resort isn't a
saving per se it was more of the
subsidized interest rates
um
what do you think is the main component
of the bailout
subsidized interest rates for a period
of two years in which the banks could
not borrow in markets because nobody
trusted them
um so the subsidized interest rates uh
day after day most of these the the
loans are short term and so they have to
renew them the next day because they
still can't borrow in markets
um
buying massive quantities of assets
uh I'm not talking about QE because then
they also uh bought lots of Assets in QE
but this was the the alphabet soup of
special programs the Fed was engaged in
we don't know exactly uh what those
assets were the um
uh
the two students who totaled up all of
the Lending
uh also were going to continue the
project
to look at what the FED bought
the FED claimed it didn't buy uh
um
trashy mortgage backed Securities we
don't know for sure whether they did or
not
um
they claim that they didn't
but uh it's likely that they did
the question is whether the FED only
bought
government insured mortgage-backed
Securities so if if all the mortgages in
the Securities were government-backed
the government was already on the hook
so you you could argue that um you know
the we we would have ended up with them
anyway
the treasury would have had them if they
were Bad Mortgages
um but we don't know for sure if that's
true and to my knowledge nobody
has gone through the data to see whether
it's true or not
in regards to Kiwi I mean there's a
misperception of us just giving banks
free money but there's the argument that
they bought the assets at above market
prices like far above is that true
uh it's possible that
again you would have to go really
through the assets
to see what they were buying and I don't
know the answer to that but definitely
If the Fed is is there uh buying they
will tend to push those prices up but
it's true the FED wasn't just giving
them money uh they were buying assets
and crediting reserves and it's not even
clear that this was uh to the advantage
of banks
because on the um Securities they were
earning interest
the the FED bought a lot of Treasury
Securities too and uh the banks are
substituting
uh very low interest earning Reserves
for higher interest earning Securities
it wasn't clear that this was good for
banks
yeah well we're running out of time so I
just want to read speed through the next
the last stuff so is it okay this is it
all right
which is
um you know
what do we do
uh we're in this era of money manager
capitalism which is a highly
unstable kind of capitalism
and the uh the question is
what do you do well to some extent
the evolution of the financial system is
inevitable you can't stop it
stability is destabilizing so if you
achieve stability
uh you're going to evolve toward
instability
this is a natural process
and uh Minsky liked one thing about
rational expectations
was that the agents in the model have a
model of the model
okay he thought that that was a good
innovation of Lucas and the new
classicals
um the problem was that the agents in a
Lucas model
I have a model of the model and their
model is the correct model it's the way
the world really works right
uh
Minsky argued that those agents are
crazy they're insane the the only people
who think that they know how the world
works are insane people the ones that
stand on the street corner right
um jabbering because everyone else knows
that their model is wrong
but their model
um will uh influence their behavior and
their model will will be continually
changing through time and as the their
model of how the world Works changes uh
their behavior changes
just as an example so the early post-war
period was very stable
and so your model of the way the world
Works gradually moves
uh to the belief that the world is
stable
there when you first come out of the
Great Depression
uh your model includes the Great
Depression
but after 20 years of no great
depressions your model has changed
you say oh well that was the past we
don't do that anymore we don't have
great depressions anymore and so now you
don't have a great depression in your
model of the way the world works
and this is why we transition to a very
fragile economy
because you discount the possibility
that things could go bad
and then of course it becomes
self-fulfilling because you take too
many risks until you start getting
Financial crises so he used to say that
his financial instability hypothesis is
ultimately pessimistic because there's
nothing you can do
if you put in place institutions to make
the economy stable
you will make the economy unstable
all right
so we had 1930s reforms the problem is
all those Innovations
uh made the reforms
um uh completely impotent
so the reforms don't work anymore
and they're not it's not a matter of
just going back and saying well let's do
what Roosevelt did let's separate
commercial Banks from investment Banks
and uh you know regulate the interest
rate the banks can pay like we did in
the 1930s those reforms won't work
anymore
so we need new kinds of reforms that are
appropriate to the money manager
capitalism stage free markets ideology
is not going to work we need new
policies to reduce insecurity
remote stability
and encourage democracy and these were
three very important
um things on Minsky's agenda
throughout all of his writing reducing
insecurity such as unemployment
old age insecurity
reduce that kind of insecurity
promote stability in the financial
sector
and encourage democracy uh both
political and economic democracy those
are the three things that he wanted
policy to do and when he came to the
levy Institute in 1990 uh that whole
period six years from 1990 to 1996.
Minsky's writing a series of papers on
how capitalism changed and
what kinds of new policies we needed in
order to deal with that
so I will stop with that
thank you I had hoped to want to go into
the types of regulation on policies into
detail but we won't have time I think I
might just run through like two or three
just briefly to hear your opinion on
them
um I think uh glass-steagall was
probably the one regulation everyone
knows about what they thought was
critical and leading to the financial
crisis what's your opinion on
glass-steagall and how much it actually
contributed to stability yeah
um Minsky was
um less enthusiastic
uh he did write on that so you can see
his Levy papers
he uh tended to favor the bank holding
company model
so yeah Bank of America is a holding
company it has a commercial Bank it has
an investment Bank it has Merrill Lynch
today and so on and maybe an insurance
company
um but if you do that
uh you have to have you know Chinese
walls between them
uh so that you can protect the
Commercial Banking part
and um uh I think that that that was his
preference
but he also wanted to promote small
Banks not big Banks
small to medium-sized Banks so Minsky
was against having these three trillion
dollar Banks
uh he probably would agree with breaking
them up
so we could have big we could have Bank
holding companies so you have a variety
of kinds of business but they would be
smaller Banks in there and we had a
proposal for a Community Development
Banks which are very small Banks that um
would be focused on local communities he
wanted to promote that but he was always
against bigness
bigness of Banks and also bigness of
non-financial Corporations because he
didn't think that was consistent with
his last thing here democracy
bigness is not consistent with democracy
so break them up
um
personally I I'm probably more of a fan
of glass-steagall
of um
preventing
um
commercial Banks from getting involved
in other things and the main reason is
because
uh they the at least the bigger ones
will they're always incentivized to dupe
their customers
so if I walk into a Bank of America
today
there there there's a little cubicle of
Merrill Lynch
and they they they're they're trying to
grab you and bring you into their little
cubicle and sell you some investment
products
um and uh I'm not saying they've never
done anything illegal with me you know
but the Temptation is always there you
take this little old grandma who doesn't
know what she's buying and she thinks
she's in Bank of America and therefore
she's got Deposit Insurance and you try
to sell her something that's not insured
I'm worried about that
um so I I like to separate them
uh one policy about stocks um stock
BuyBacks I mean a lot of people defend
them because they say if there's not an
investment opportunity around whether
it's because of aggregate demand or
whatnot then you know let them use that
Surplus cash to invest in their own
stocks
um would you say to that
they absolutely should not be allowed to
buy their own stocks the I think it's
absolutely crazy that we let them do
that because the incentives are all
wrong if you tell a CEO
that um we're going to give you stock
options
and your mission is to maximize share
prices what are they going to do
they're going to do stock BuyBacks
it's the the quickest way
to increase their own stock option value
and increase Share value no if if they
can't think of anything better to do pay
the workers more
increase wages
okay if there's no profitable
Investments out there
pay the workers you don't need the
profit
no look they're making all this profit
okay they've got plenty of retained
earnings that tells me they're making
far more profit than they need to
because you know why do you want profit
well one reason you want profit is to
have retained earnings so you can invest
but then they're telling me no we don't
want to invest we don't see any good
investment opportunities then pay the
workers more
and you can pay the shareholders to
increase the dividends right they have
two good options there
okay one is pay the workers a decent
wage and the other is dividends so no I
don't buy it at all because the
incentives are all wrong
uh one one question
on behalf of my former economics teacher
it was he was very um gold standard kind
of kind of guy he's at the QE is
terrible because banks will use all that
money to invest in the stock market
what do you say to that
look cute he puts excess reserves into
Banks there is nothing they can do with
excess reserves
it can't go anywhere
the only thing they could do is lend it
to another bank but Banks don't want it
okay the the reserves never leave the
balance sheet of the Central Bank
there is nothing a bank can do with
reserves I mean they they could try to
create a run on the bank that's the only
way the reserves can get out yeah
okay if they say oh we're we're on the
verge of failure you better come get
your deposits that's the only way to get
reserves out of the system otherwise the
reserves stay in the banking system so
this sounds like somebody who doesn't
understand a t account
yeah this is quite a Mystic
misunderstanding that reserves can just
be spent like like any money can
and the last and final question why not
public Banks why don't we just
nationalize the bank yeah I I I don't
have anything against public Banks I
think it's a good idea the Community
Development banks that I was talking
about these were sort of public-private
Partnerships with the federal government
being a part owner I I and development
Banks which are common around the world
uh
we sort of have it too in the United
States so we we have the federal
government involved in lending uh we
have student loans where the federal
government is involved in lending
there's any examples of countries that
have like a full public banking system
and it works uh
I don't know about full but there are
hundreds of development banks around the
world
um that you know Finance the development
of the economy
um and then
um
there are
well I there are public Banks I'm sure
that's the answer to Minsky's pessimism
that well
it's not the answer
could it uh increase stability of the
financial system yeah it uh could
um and it could also promote Economic
Development which means he also was
trying to even for the United States
we're an underdeveloped country in many
many ways it would help us to develop
too
so I I support public Banks
do I want to completely eliminate
private banking no not necessarily so
I'm not seeing them as a an alternative
to private Banks I'm going to supplement
to private Banks
right okay uh thank you so much this was
really educational and I really
appreciate you coming on it was
fantastic
okay well for those who want more on
Minsky this is a
2015 book
and this on the left is my latest book
on money
and there will be another one in uh
March
that is a um
uh cartoon book
on money
right okay could I Giovanni could you
get the textbook I can advertise that
because
listen key
thank you and I would recommend to
everybody
to have a look at the textbook that
Randall Ray Bill Mitchell and Martin
Watts wrote 2019 I believe it's
absolutely brilliant
it's a good uh post Keynesian
introduction into economics as opposed
to the neoclassical books that you've
familiar with
um this is far better
and uh on that note
thank you so much for coming on I really
appreciate it it was a pleasure to talk
with you
okay thanks
thank you bye
