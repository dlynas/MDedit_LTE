Transcript:
(00:03) white people go around it seems to me with a very carefully suppressed terror of black people tremendous uneasiness they don't know who they don't know what the blackface hides they're sure it's hiding something what is hiding is american history you know what what is what it's what it's hiding is what why people know they are done and are doing you know it's what you know white people know very well one thing there's the only thing they have to know they know this everything
(00:33) else i say is a lie they know they would not like to be black here they know that now they know that and they're telling me lies they're telling me and my children nothing but lies for baldwin the truth is that the ghettos of his youth remain gnawing at the spirit of those who live there the poverty is piled high making it even more inescapable and making it even more inescapable how thoroughly or despised the high rise islamic was a high crime area almost at once because what you're going to do all these children really whole families
(01:13) condemned forever to nothing in the richest city in the world  my best friend a black boy jumped off george washington bridge when he was 24 and i was 22. and i was sure that i was going to be next just from despair or from despair from rage you know because you can get to a place where you know where you're in battle so often that you that's all you that's all you can do you know you've been beaten so hard all you can do is your world narrows to a kind of red circle of rage and you begin to hate everybody which
(01:55) means you hate yourself no and when that happens it's over for you baldwin has taken that despair and rage and turned it into novels theater and essays characters drawn from his family and friends this fall dial press is publishing his 19th book a novel called just above my head the story of a black gospel singer during the civil rights struggle  the gospel church is a theme running through much of baldwin's work  his father was a minister and baldwin himself became a preacher at the age of 13.
(02:47) his play the amen corner shown in revival at lincoln center's black theater festival was drawn from his own experiences in the pulpit   for many growing up in poverty the church is the only consolation when baldwin left the church he wanted to do more than to console often baldwin speaks to youngsters who grew up as he did letting them know the future holds a place for them on this day he spoke at the police
(03:50) athletic league in harlem a writer might be a dancer might be a carpenter might be um architect might be a junkie might be any number of things you think there's still a chance for today's background there never was a chance for a black writer come what's your name jeffrey listen a writer black and white doesn't have much right nobody wants a writer until he's dead but to answer your real question there's a greater chance for the black rhino today than it ever has been the children asked him the same question
(04:45) i wanted answered why did he move to paris paris is very important to me because i was able to um well i was able to take a deep breath and i was able it may sound a very corny way to put it but i wanted to i wanted to find out where being black ended where i began or vice versa i mean that some things had happened to me because i was jimmy and something's happening because i was black and i wanted to find out how to get these things together because i didn't want to spend the rest of my life going around saying
(05:18) you treat me that way because i'm black after attaining worldwide acclaim as a black writer baldwin wrote giovanni's room an explicitly homosexual love story his publishers in new york refused to print it for fear of alienating his newly acquired white middle class audience baldwin was furious and took the book to england for publication you published giovanni's room very early on in your i finished the book in 55.
(05:47) and that to to deal with homosexuality was difficult and you already were dealing with you know black writer what made you decide to do that well um one could say you almost said i didn't have an awful lot of choice it was something gianni's room comes out of something which tormented and frightened me a question of my own sexuality i used to know when i was younger great many men boys who were so terrified that they might um have a homosexual and you know they might be bisexual or they might you know want to go
(06:31) globes want to go to bed with a man you might might be able to fall in love with a man they were so frightened of that they could never fall in love with anybody else you know there was a frightened men they couldn't touch women joanna dream come something out of come somewhere out of that did you also feel that you wanted to get it on the record your own homosexuality early i don't know if that um well i don't know if i wanted to get on the record but i wanted to but i wanted to confront it i'm very glad that you know that that
(06:59) was done because it also simplified my life in another way because it meant that i had no secret somebody could blackmail me no you didn't tell me i told you james baldwin is one of those lucky people who's never been unsure of his family's love the oldest of nine children he was helped financially by the others during his struggling years in france now he's in the states more than in europe and with his family more often than not with the success of his books he was able to buy a manhattan apartment
(07:30) building where his mother and several family members live now mrs baldwin's apartment is a center of activity for the whole family did you think he was going to be as as big a success and as important no i didn't think that but i knew that he had to write brothers and sisters and friends of the family were there nieces and nephews underfoot he still can't upstage me now conversation ran the gamut of subjects but baldwin's mood turned when we spoke of the american attitude toward blacks there's a price this
(08:11) republic exacts any black man or woman walking and that is a crime i paid for that crime in my life and i don't believe my countrymen anymore they will not do to him what they failed to do to me i was seven years old 47 years ago and nothing has changed since then look look i don't mean it to you personally i don't even know you no i got nothing against you i don't know you personally but i know you historically you can't have it both ways you can't swear to the freedom of all mankind and put me in chains
(09:06) it sounds as if you believe that slavery put a curse on us somehow well it is a curse you know um the american sense of reality is dictated by but what americans are trying to avoid and if you're trying to avoid reality how can you face it you know if you don't know what is going on in the ghettos of this nation in the hearts and minds of women men you see every day you don't first of all in that case you don't really know what's going on in your own hot mine and you had no way of knowing what was
(09:39) going on in the hearts and minds of millions of people on this globe you have told people this nation in particular a lot of what they don't want to hear yeah i have i've tried you never know but i tried yes to um the song says wake the children sleeping you know i'm supposed to be a disturber of the peace still preaching huh yeah
