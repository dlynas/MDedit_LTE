This is going to be an interesting episode. As I write this script, it's currently about noon on Monday, November 2nd. The polls have Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, ahead by something like 10 points over Republican incumbent Donald Trump. By the time this video is released on Friday, any number of ridiculous things may have happened. So I'm going to keep my speculation to a minimum because it likely won't mean anything by Friday. That being said, I will have to use a few hypotheticals from the current election to explain my points. Just take them with a grain of salt and remember that some information will have changed by the time this video goes live. With that out of the way, in this episode, we're going to talk about the electoral college and how it stifles democracy. The electoral college is something most people forget about between election years. And then all of a sudden, it explodes back into the national consciousness when a presidential candidate might win more electoral votes, but lose the popular vote. This has happened a number of times in the past, but we'll get to that later. Before we talk about the specifics of the electoral college, we need to address something that always comes up when discussing this topic. The United States is not a true democracy. It was never intended to be. The founding fathers, despite their godlike status among Americans, were a bunch of elites who wanted to make sure that only rich, white, land-owning men had to say The United States is classified as a constitutional republic or a representative democracy. This means that average people have very little real power, and we're at the mercy of often undemocratic-elected rulers. Politicians like to use the language of democracy to make us feel like we're in control of the country. But our institutions say otherwise. So, for all the people in the comments who feel the need to say we're not a democracy, you're right. My goal is to explain that we should be. So, what is the electoral college? A lot of people seem to think it's just a sort of point value assigned to each state, and that's not entirely wrong. The points are actually a group of people known as electors, who are appointed by each of the states and the district of Columbia to represent the will of the people and cast their votes for the correspondent candidate. Since 1964, we've had a total of 538 electors across the country. To win the election, a candidate has to pass the 270 mark, which is why you'll see stuff like this in the weeks leading up to the election. The number of electors given to each state is determined by population. California, for example, has 55 electors, while Wyoming has 3. You might begin to see a problem here, but bear with me, it's probably not what you think. California is home to roughly 15,690,000 registered voters. That gives them one elector per 285,272 voters. Wyoming has a voting population of 268,000, which gives them one elector per 89,333 voters. See the problem yet? Because of the better ratio of voters to electors, a single Wyoming voter has the voting power of 3 Californians. That means that smaller, lower population states have disproportionate representation and therefore disproportionate power in the electoral college. So, your vote could be worth a lot less than someone else's, based solely on the state in which you live. But that's not the only problem. We also have to consider those states with many electors. As of right now, the electoral votes for each state are all or nothing. No matter how close the results are, the person with the advantage gets all the votes. Look at these three states. California, Texas, and New York. If a candidate were to secure a narrow lead in all three, they would net 122 electoral votes from just three states. Why is that a problem? Hypothetically, it's possible for a candidate not to win a single vote in 39 states and still become president. They could focus all their energy in just 11 states, ignore the rest of the country and still win. Then there's a third major problem. Swing states. Again, because of the winter take all system, it doesn't make sense for candidates to spend time campaigning in what they consider safe states. Instead, they spend the majority of their time and money trying to win over just a handful of states that could go either way, pandering to state specific issues and completely ignoring the majority of the population. In a very real sense, Donald Trump and Joe Biden are competing to be president of just eight states. Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Because of these three glaring flaws with the system, the overall effect has been to depress voter turnout in the state's politicians don't care about, make elections seem like a sports event and allow for the candidate with less support to become president. This is incredibly undemocratic. Over the past few election cycles, there's been a big push to award state-level electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote. This would effectively make the electoral college obsolete and force candidates to care about the votes of every American rather than just those in swing states and disproportionately powerful ones. There's been quite a fraught relationship between the electoral college and the popular vote over the last few decades. In 2000, Democratic candidate Al Gore won the national popular vote, but Republican George W. Bush won more electoral votes and became president. Then in 2016, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, but Republican Donald Trump won more electoral votes. And again, the loser of the popular vote became president. There's been a lot of debate over this discrepancy, with historically anti-government Republicans finding themselves defending the electoral college because it always seems to benefit them. And Democrats actually pushing for expanding democracy for once. Not because they particularly care about democracy more than the Republicans, but because they never benefit from the electoral college. Both the Democrats and Republicans are firmly anti-democracy when it comes to actually letting the people decide the future of the country. Okay, if the electoral college is so broken, why have we let it stick around for so long? Part of the problem is the unique American fascination with the founding fathers and old documents. We lie and eyes anyone who is around when the country was first formed and gloss over the many unpleasantries of the men involved. We treat the constitution like a holy book, taking its word as natural and immutable truth. When the founders themselves had very little real plan besides setting up themselves and other rich white men for success. This is especially true of the electoral college. The delegates of the 1787 constitutional convention had many different ideas regarding how the president should be elected, and for three months they weren't able to come to a consensus. Eventually, just to get things moving again, they slapped together the notion of the electoral college. A system so bizarre and convoluted that delegates didn't know whether to support or oppose it. It was never intended as anything more than a temporary measure until they could figure out a better option. Spoiler alert, they never replaced it, and we've been stuck with the ridiculous and undemocratic system for over two centuries. Over that time, the electoral college has allowed the loser of the national popular vote to become president five times. The most recent example being 2016. With the 2020 election being resolved as we speak, the electoral college could yet again deliver a president who loses the popular vote. As of right now, it looks like Biden will win both the popular and electoral votes. But as we saw in 2000, it's very possible to use the Supreme Court as a weapon to stop the counting of certain ballots and deliver the presidency to the candidate with the edge and electoral votes. This is where things get interesting. In this blessed year of 2020, there has been a record amount of mail in voting. Coincidentally, I've done a video on mail in voting. If you're one of those people who thinks it leads to fraud, please go watch it. Now, the vast majority of mail in votes are being cast by people voting for Joe Biden, generally people who understand that COVID is a real threat and don't want to risk infection. Trump knows this, and with his shiny new Supreme Court justices, he'll do his very best to stop the counting of mail in ballots. If the election is close enough, Trump will likely try to use the Supreme Court to deliver an electoral victory on or soon after election night. Remember how I said the Supreme Court delivered Bush's victory in 2000? Well, four of the people involved in that case, John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Koney Barrett will all weigh in on a potential legal battle over the 2020 election. You may recognize a couple of names from that list. Trump appointed two of them to the Supreme Court during his first term. It's hard to see how our current Supreme Court would deliver any result other than one favorable to Trump if it comes down to that. What's perhaps more concerning is that even though Republicans have won the popular vote only once in the last seven elections, they have appointed six of the nine Supreme Court justices. How does that make sense? Politicians who lack the support of the majority of the population have installed Supreme Court justices to lifetime appointments to the highest court in the country, thereby entrenching regressive unpopular views in the most important legal battles for the next 50 years. This is not democracy, this is ruled by an increasingly small and unpopular minority. Republicans know that they're incapable of winning the popular vote. Their candidates just don't appeal to most Americans and understandably so. Because of this, they will fight tooth and nail to keep the electoral college and prevent the expansion of actual democracy. But don't think for one second that the Democrats wouldn't do the same thing if they were the ones benefiting from the rigged system. The point is that those in power benefit from the electoral college. Normal people do not. No matter what your political opinions, if you truly believe in the idea of democracy, one person, one vote, each vote counts the same, then you must be against the electoral college. It's a system that even the founding fathers never intended to be permanent. It doesn't encourage democracy, it stifles it. So what can we do? It's not exactly easy to overturn something that's enshrined in the constitution. Well, it might be easier than we think. Sure, the general framework of the electoral college is outlined in the constitution, but we don't even need to abolish it. We can just strip it of its anti-democratic power. The movement I mentioned earlier, officially known as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, is making real progress and making the electoral college obsolete. The compact is simple. It's an agreement between states to award their electoral votes to the winner of the National Popular Vote. The problem is, they need to reach a total of 270 votes worth of states in order for it to go into effect. As of right now, the compact represents 196 electoral votes. That's just 74 shy of relegating the electoral college to the dustbin of history and giving the people the power to actually elect the candidate supported by the majority. It's too late to overpower the electoral college for this election, but we can do it before the next one. If the 2020 election is determined by the blatantly partisan Supreme Court, or if the winner of the electoral college loses the popular vote again, we have to make it clear that we will no longer stand for a corrupt system that disenfranchises millions of Americans. Protest our powerful tools, as our strikes, makes some noise, remind the powerful that they work for us, and hit them in the wallet by refusing to work until our demands are met. The capitalist system relies on labor. Average people provide that labor. If they want us to work, we want to say in how we elect the president. Allowing the people to vote directly, not voting for people to vote for them, is the only democratic solution for electing a president. We're supposed to be a country of the people by the people and for the people. Let's work towards making that a reality. If you enjoyed this video, consider dropping a like.
