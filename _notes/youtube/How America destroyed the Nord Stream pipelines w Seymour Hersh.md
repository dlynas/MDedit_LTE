Transcript:
(00:02) now you talk about Terror  what about for me  I've been terrorized all my days 

on Monday September 26 2022 a series of underwater explosions blew huge holes into the Nord stream one and two two pairs of pipelines constructed to carry Russian natural gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea these four pipelines steal reinforced concrete cables built to withstand the direct impact of the anchor of an aircraft carrier were destroyed in a clandestine Act of sabotage according to an investigation by Pulitzer Prize
(01:06) winning reporter Seymour Hersh the pair of nordstream 1 pipelines carried Russian gas to Germany until Moscow cut off supplies at the end of August 2022. the pair of Nord stream 2 pipelines which would have doubled the amount of gas that would be available to Germany and Western Europe were never operational as Germany suspended its certification process shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 2022.
(01:38) White House spokesperson Adrian Watson called Hirsch's report quote false and complete fiction CIA spokesperson Tammy Thorpe said quote this claim is completely and utterly false denials by U.S officials of covert operations of course are routine Secretary of State Dean Rusk for example denied any U.
(02:03) S involvement in the Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba assuring the American people that the invasion was not quote staged from American soil when Seymour Hirsch in 2004 published the first stories about the torture of Iraqi prisoners at Abu ghraib a pentagon spokesperson called his reporting quote a tapestry of nonsense adding that Hirsch was a guy who quote threw a lot of trap against the wall and expect someone to peel off what's real despite the denials the United States has long expressed hostility to the pipelines it worked to prevent the
(02:39) completion of the pipelines and imposed illegal sanctions on Enterprises engaged in its construction President Biden on February 7 2022 prior to the invasion of Ukraine by Russia stated quote if Russia invades there will be no longer a Nord stream too we will bring an end to it during a senate hearing Victoria Newland under Secretary of State for political Affairs was asked by Senator Ted Cruz whether his legislation aimed at sanctioning the Nord stream 2 gas pipeline which was voted down in January of 2022 could have stopped the war
(03:20) like you I am and I think the administration is very gratified to know that Nordstrom 2 is now as you like to say a hunk of metal at the bottom of the sea Newland said U.S Secretary of State Anthony blinken described the destruction of the pipelines as a quote tremendous opportunity which would enable EU countries to become less dependent on Russian energy the New York Times reported in December that Russia had begun expensive repairs on the pipelines raising questions about Washington's claim that Russia had
(03:58) bombed its own infrastructure these explosions are not insignificant acts they are acts of War they expose not only the collapse of the rule of law but the lack of oversight by Congress I covered the mining of Nicaragua's Harbors in 1983 by the Reagan Administration as a reporter in Central America the mining was designed to the economy in Nicaragua and boost the fortunes of the U.
(04:26) S backed Contra Rebels seeking to overthrow the Sandinista government in Nicaragua the mining backfired it sparked outrage around the globe and saw Congress cut off funding for the contros a year later the international court of justice in 1986 ruled against the United States over its mining of the harbors hersh's Revelations should have led to a similar condemnation by Congress and an internal investigation into illegal activities by the CIA and the Pentagon it should have prompted news organizations to dig deeper into a
(05:01) scandal a flagrant violation of the U.N Charter and international treaties it should have prompted a national debate about the war in Ukraine and the steady escalation of our involvement one that could lead to a direct confrontation with Russia and possibly nuclear war joining me to discuss his latest investigative piece is Seymour Hirsch one of our most important and fearless investigative reporters who among many groundbreaking stories exposed the U.
(05:33) S Army's 1969 milai Massacre and cover-up the Watergate scandal the secret bombing of Cambodia the torture by U.S soldiers at Abu ghraib of Iraqi prisoners and the false narrative told by the U.S government about the events surrounding the killing of Osama bin Laden so Silas talk about why the U.S destroyed the pipelines and in your story you write that they began preparing the destruction of the pipelines two months for the Russian invasion of Ukraine and then if you can also explain why they saw the pipelines as a threat
(06:14) well you're getting to the core of it um and actually if you wonder why people on the inside might have talked to me about this is because of their disillusionment with what the Obama Administration did the initial plan to do was the initial idea of a covert team to set up to look at the uh had nothing the initial team was set up only to give options and that was before Christmas of 19 2021 we were three months away or two and a half months away from The Invasion and but the Russian the the Putin Etc was already moving forces into
(06:51) Belarus so something was on and the idea was Jake Sullivan coming a group the usual CIA NSA State Department Treasury Department uh Joint Chiefs of Staff a small group a meeting at a very secret place they have in the executive office building and I I did mention specifics there because I wanted people to know that I knew specifics because I knew there would be resistance to the story I was writing which I didn't learn about till after the after the bombing took place last September at that time it was just a question of the the the word of
(07:28) art the language of was very specific our language they were told to discuss uh kinetic or you know uh the way it was actually put was we want reversible and irreversible options that was the literal language the art The Artful language used and the reversible options would be more sanctions et cetera Etc and you know ask Cuba about sanctions you know they've been sanctioned since 61.
(07:56) yeah yeah right and the sanctions says they didn't work out in Russia too the current one and the irreversible would be something kinetic So within a couple of weeks it was clear the the people who advocated force uh won the game and they they were thinking of military options and they had all sorts of crazy options we had learned in the in the Vietnam War uh we mined High Fawn Harbor by dropping um uh mines from up from a bomb with the timers on them from airplanes it's amazing the the state of art of Mind Warfare is growing up enormously and so the option was blow up
(08:32) the pipeline that's the one option you can give and they told the White House I would guess I don't know specifics but certainly by uh mid-January they were saying okay it's possible because people there knew of the capability we had a very Superior uh School in um down in the panhandle of Florida somewhere near something called Panama City there was a big Navy school for divers a Navy drivers not not seals they were Navy trained divers and they had been skilled in the art of blowing up uh an oil rig
(09:07) we don't might we might not like you know good in the bad they could also clear Harbors but they were experts and we knew we had the experts a good bomb could mine anything even a pipeline but how to do it wasn't clear but they told the White House in January they had made a connection with Norway the Norwegian Navy goes back to the Vietnam war with us really I've written about that as you probably know they go back to the provocation that led to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution led to this whole horrible War there's an analogy I'm
(09:36) writing about it because we're in an analogous situation with the Linda Johnson having the right by lying and doing something deceitful um uh pretending that North Vietnam had attacked an American Destroyer which it had not uh and put us into a war that you know as we like to say killed between two and three Vietnamese as if between one million or two million isn't such a big deal anyway whatever whatever racist in the nation you want to give it it's there and in this case so um they came up with an option that was it
(10:12) was all a terribly secret program that they were doing what they were working with the Norwegians that's never been made public and until actually as I as I mentioned I wrote about in another subset piece and and uh the extent to which don't worry is in our pocket and uh on this stuff and so um uh let me ask why though why let me just finish the thought yeah the issue is uh initially it was gonna it was just gonna be a threat the the the Putin uh that and the the hostility from Putin had been growing with American
(10:50) Americans respond to president yeah yipping and yapping about a bad guy and the the uh Putin Putin was a dead Letterman you know in America right now uh right now it's you can't talk about them any rational way um but the question was um uh uh once they told the White House that both the president and the under secretary for political Affairs uh um whatever her name is um Victoria Newland Victoria Newland whose husband is one of the original Robert King yeah Kagan who's one of the guys that thought the solution to Al
(11:30) Qaeda bombing Us in the 911 was to who was the attack I uh radical hating Saddam right you know anyway whatever the worst mistake probably made in modern history even worse probably in long term maybe worse than Vietnam because of the consequences that we still are looking at anyway um the the the only point was that their idea was to construct a a mechanism to put pack back down Putin we're going to destroy the second pipeline the first pipeline there too the first one which went into business in 911 supplying Europe Europe or gas
(12:11) cheap gas a lot of it was cut back was stopped by Putin himself um in 2021 or 20. just um because of the language we were using the second one was stopped by us it was the new pipeline North stream 2 had been finished in 2020 or 21 and have been sanctioned by Germany so we had a pipeline that could have been opened by the Germans but had been sanctioned and so Biden drops the gives the order to vomit and it's it's destroyed on September the 26th months after the and these guys have I don't know whether they were in in had just
(12:51) backed off when I don't know how where they had to go back and put everything online but they thought it was a dead letter issue so he does it uh and um on his command that's what people in the CI do they they respond to the crown and not to the Constitution uh something I mentioned that the first story and uh with a sense of Doom and he blew it up and so I've done a lot of thinking a lot of reporting on what was going on in late September that would have changed the equation by blowing up the German
(13:19) pipeline he was saying we've we've there's no natural gas or oil in West Europe we and there's been a constant worry going back to the Kennedy days about Russian and their great Reservoir national gas and oil uh weaponizing gas to maintain good relationships with Germany we never liked that we never liked the fact that that Germany was so dependent on Russian and Western Europe on Russian fuel that always bothered us particularly uh Cheney uh Cheney worried about it uh Condoleezza Rice spoke often
(13:53) about it in the bush chain years Biden when he was a vice president chaired a committee that continued this is not a new idea trying to remove the it's not a new idea to remove this link that would give the the Russian some some some power inside Europe that was always a nagging issue for us in the Cold War the world of containment and this whole facade of containment that we think has worked but has not anyway that's another story and so what happened is on the best I can get and the people I talk to
(14:28) obviously I'm you know I'm longer tooth here and where she did and so I know a lot of people and the in the the whole intelligence picture I'm seeing particularly by late September is so different than what's being written in the times the Washington Times And The Washington Post it's like it's another world they're so dependent on the paper on briefings from I guess from the Biden people I don't know where they're getting the stuff they publish but by late September there had been a
(14:54) wonderful alleged Victory when the when the Russians retreated and the ukrainians ran across you know dozens of miles of territory but I will tell you that by late September at the best it was going to be a very dark stalemate with no Victory possible and zielinski not willing to negotiate he had backed off and he was in his own little world of total corruption the corruption of Ukraine I mean it's so bad that the worry we've had in the community is that he was in trouble the generals because he was taking too much of the swag his
(15:27) his cut was too big I'm serious so I'm in that level of information that is really good and I know it's real and meanwhile the papers are talking about you know whatever they're talking about sometimes there's a hint of Darkness so in September I think I will give you what I believe is the rationale for what he did which is he wanted to prevent Germany which has always right now there was in case you care there were two large marches in Berlin last weekend one the the police said 30 15 000 or 13 000
(15:56) and the and the newspaper people and the the people running the protesters who must go to the 50 000 tremendously amount against the war not about the pipeline so against giving more to this war because of the danger of posts they did a marching Saturday and Sunday they went to the um uh the the largest American base in in near you know near Berlin Mannheim and surrounded it and also protested and apparently on one in some Embassy whether I don't I don't remember whether it was ours or not but they had a destroyed Russian tank on
(16:29) display and they took down with the display and they put flowers and peace signs on it over that weekend not a word in the western press not a word in the New York Times not it was a big story in the the media in Europe and certainly even in London had good stories on it not a word here it's like it's like there's some sort of um um uh Nimbus a dark cloud over us anyway so I think I mean the best guess you have and I I would guess 90 this is is good is that that Biden were frightened that if he saw a long War coming Germany
(17:06) which was reluctant to re-arm after World War II after all they spent a decade murdering raping and killing in Western Europe among other places and their allies now are all in NATO so I I think what he did is he told NATO and he told Western Europe and he told Germany uh we no longer have your back we've always had your back we no longer have but you can't count on us anymore because this President thinks his war in Ukraine is more important than making you giving you the German government the the ability not this winter but next
(17:38) winter is going to be a tough one the ability to keep the factories going and people warm now right now in Germany the price of electricity is still rational uh it's it's there's and the government is subsidizing up to 20 in some places more uh so people that particularly in larger cities and the corporations but the largest corporation in the chemical company in the world just cut back production it's been talking to China about moving some facilities there because they can't predict be they don't
(18:07) have a predictable you know they all the gas to Russia was pumping in North stream one was cheap and plentiful and German so much that German the German corporations that were getting the that were were that handled the gas we're selling it Downstream and making a profit about which Russia did care now the pipeline Nordstrom won uh which was such a boon to the European economy was run by was owned 51 by gas prom uh oligarch so Kickback the great deal of money to Russia to give you some idea how much money that was being
(18:42) produced for Russia and for gasping one it was uh one year 45 billion dollars was was funneled into the Russian economy economy by gas problem 49 of it the company was owned by I'm going to talk about stockholders was owned by four European countries that sold the the cheap gas Downstream so it was a big operation and they lost Nordstrom one Nordstrom two was going to pick it back up so that he Biden did this what some people call an act of War at least the people involved think it was an act of War who did the planning for it uh
(19:16) because uh he no longer trusted West Europe to support him and his Venture in Ukraine which I think he but the only thing he can think is that presidents and Wars always are popular that's you know a war is sustained presidents we've seen that we've seen that historically uh that uh you know uh Bill Clinton came into office with uh one uh don't tell don't don't you know don't uh you know the with the attitude of allowing gays in the military there was tremendous resistance and he was in
(19:51) the first couple of months where just a disaster he he probably should have fired some of the members of The Joint Chief were openly critical of him but he didn't do that he waffled but on May in May I think it was he he authorized the bombing of Baghdad the first time we the Americans have ever we've ever bombed a major capital in in the Middle East and there was killed eight people which gov I remember one official tell me only ate and I said to him what if one of them was your your third your your uh
(20:21) his son played in a bowl team with mine that's how I am Sandy Berger Sandy was Deputy national Square device he I was I came in there would do a story about what they did and he said what are you worrying about that only eight and I said one of them was one of your son that played third base with my kid you know my kids baseball team and he said get out of this office yeah literally I'd never no Republicans ever done that to me even in the bush even the in the in the uh uh in the days of Watergate nobody uh there's always a manner of
(20:49) polite he said get out of my office somebody I'd known for 20 years and that's so and so Biden does the bombing I mean of Clinton and the next day was a Saturday and on Sunday I'm watching he goes to church and he's followed by cameras going to church it was his best day in the white house he'd actually bombed to kill people and that was his best day and I remember that stuck in my mind forever that's so you know that's where we're at with this presidency we have right now the best day he thinks is
(21:18) going to come uh when he wins in whatever his fantasy is about Ukraine it is terrifying but he's losing the war they're losing the war the Russian I don't know if you know if I think if you watch the times and post like I do uh I think it's they're beginning to back off but they still run nothing you know I I love the stories about Russians raping and brutality uh there's is there an army that doesn't rape and utilize yeah I mean are you kidding do you think what do you think what happens when a
(21:48) Russian soldier is captured by the ukrainians right what they're giving blankets and and and hot coffee well or or those the ukrainians uh are you our collaborators what happens to them well you're talking about that famous story about that first Village yeah and where they the the reporters were taken by the but they never mentioned that they were taken by representatives of of uh of the Ukrainian government to this Village yes um my understanding I haven't written this because I I I I I followed the war
(22:25) but I I haven't been writing about it during the uh covet days I was I've been doing a big project on containment going back to China in 54. I mean it's fascinating how how dumb we are have been all along with our anti-communist stuff but anyway uh back I'm back in Vietnam too a lot but um but uh they're armbands they would just tell they put armbands around certain people and there was a lot of reporting in the European press not here that many of the people who were executed so badly had had been been
(22:56) accused of being a Russian supporters or collaborators by the ukrainians so that they were killed and not necessarily by the retreating Russia troops but I assure you there are abuses by troops everywhere I'm rapist that's one of the virtues of being a soldier you know in every war though you know don't think we're any better than anybody else we don't I don't we know we're not I mean milai told me that I went light on on the sex stuff at me like I just didn't want when I wrote my stories I didn't
(23:24) want every South Vietnamese Soldier to wake up after reading what really happened and getting is the revolver and going hunting down about American Soldier yeah I was worried about that the war was still on soldiers do awful things yeah yeah I know I and you know and both sides both sides Lil I like to breathe I want to ask about the Navy's diving and Salvage Center which you mentioned uh because as you said it's not part of America's Special Operations Command but it was selected for a reason not solely because of its expertise uh
(23:58) but because as you write in your story it allowed the administration not to brief Congress well when you're working with the CIA and the NSA on secret operations there is a law you have to you have to do the CIA in particular has to do a finding that has to be presented to Congress it's to this it basically it's to a clerk on a subcommittee of Appropriations that only has four members on it I mean it's a very still a very contained operation uh but it's it has to be briefed and you also have to brief the gang of eight
(24:34) which is what they call the uh the House and Senate leaders of both parties and the House and Senate members of the intelligence committee and there hasn't been any um uh any collaboration or any column uh uh any good feelings between the two of them uh since bushka since Trump got in there you know I mean are you kidding and I would you think about I if you're by then you want to run a down and dirty program you want to do you want a brief speaker McCarthy about it I don't think so but whatever case is
(25:09) one once the reason they pick the the divers who are skilled it's a it's a school you pick people that have been trained by them by the way the whole trick of an operation like this is very few you only need two divers but you had to pick good ones who are not necessarily were at the school but they've been trained by the school and have been in the field doing good and bad as I wrote anyway um that once you you you don't go to the Navy Seals because they're in the Special Operations Command and that
(25:41) requires a finding so they look this is all just word games because I I wrote a lot for the New Yorker after when Bush and Cheney were in running Ops they never briefed anything to the Congress they just said screw this law you know who cares but um uh under Biden it was very convenient to say the week once Biden spoke out about the operation and once you only had people there who were from the Navy doing the diving and that's deals and once you actually had even if somebody you actually had uh you had told the Joint Chiefs much
(26:20) about this because they have to respect certain laws you can decide it's no longer a covert operation it's now a classified operation and under rulings they have the CIA can bring in an army unit a military unit into an operation that's classified without briefing Congress that's just all games and words but that is so that's what they did they were very in a way Biden's shooting off his mouth Biden's in February after they gave him a briefing went public and it was asked about he was trying to stop
(26:51) Russia we can stop Nordstrom too we know we can't and we will when we can that kind of languish was used by the way not one reporter has asked the White House about that since those those early Expressions not one reporter they just don't do it and there was it was interesting to me the four days I didn't know anything about this then I was just following it four days after the September 26 bombing which I do think was aimed at keeping Europe away from being tied to Russia because of this long-standing worry about the
(27:22) Russian weaponization that the word we use four days later Jake Sullivan who had convened the initial meeting and a news conference he was asked not right away I was amazed that's all 11 minutes I've looked at the tape was he asked about the bombing under the sea and he said yes he said and the the I don't know what what they're feeding the Press Corps today but the question was asked in such a way do you think Russians did it what as somebody said to me about the story I wrote um a friend of mine that's much smarter
(27:55) than I am um uh given that the uh Newland and and Biden had both in January and February talked about the possibility of doing once they learned it was possible from The Secret World which was really upsetting to the guys in the secret world doing it uh once they said that anyway uh you think somebody would ask that question but instead the first question asked was uh uh do you think the Russians did it and Sullivan who would convene the meeting knowing exactly what happened uh his answer was I love this he said uh well you know
(28:28) it's like that because they're immediately accusing us and you know denying we said that seems to be the way the Russians operate but I will tell you the Janes and the swedes are doing an investigation let's wait and see until it happens so a month later the days in Swede in October 16th I think I didn't even mention this in the Articles it's too stupid to be believed they announced that they had studied the event for for weeks and weeks and they concluded there was indeed an underwater explosion was there that was their study
(28:58) and so here's the question I've asked here's the question that the next time there's a news conference I so ask a please please some reporter ask this question well Mr President um you're the president and you have the right uh uh the absolute right to to uh to um uh to uh to uh demand uh it's called Uh over word of our fruit that skips my mind he could he can make a request he can uh he can ask the head of intelligence the office of National Intelligence has an intelligence there's
(29:36) a there's a top they're the top dogs uh it's called the national head of National Intelligence runs all the community um and he can ask them uh he can compel him to um to do a study of what happened and who did the bombing and and he can also ask uh the the the CIA has an office called the director of intelligence along with operations and science and technology which produces a lot of good stuff there are a lot of bright guys working there he can ask them to to do a study and and if they see I when it has people in the field
(30:12) like they did in Norway as a team I used to be called the C team it's all very secret I'm sure they change everything every week but he has a team there that does the monitoring if we have a team abroad they monitor like local phone calls everything to make sure nobody's figured out there's something on going on a very high intense operation make a study he's never he's never asked anybody to do anything why don't you ask if he's that you know just ask and the answer will be of course they haven't
(30:40) because they know the answer right right I mean it's really this is such a dumb lie they're into and they're going to just lie the rest of the way because this why not let's talk about the reaction let's talk about the reaction and in particular the reaction of news organizations um as you when you and I worked at the times if somebody washed and post broke a major story uh we had to dig to find out whether we could match it if we couldn't match it we had to acknowledge that the post ran at the Times hated
(31:13) doing that um but this reaction is frightening now I'm sure you I find it frightening but I'll let you take it from there I mean it's I've been just kind of I find it kind of Staggering well the problem but you're right in the early days I'll tell you something else we did when I was at the Times um um Everybody screws up the story I screwed up a story about um uh a certain Ambassador during the Chile crisis and he was a friend of uh he was a friend of the paper and uh April's until the editor had visited him
(31:47) he was Ambassador Ed Corey was the ambassador to Ethiopia at the time and he had been in Chile and he'd been involved in there were two aspects to the Chilean operation we did to get at the yendi I mean we um on the idea that allende's death was a suicide is not not possible for me to believe we were after ayendi there were two levels there was a propaganda level that the Ambassador ran ranting about him and calling him out and then there was a secret level of actually paying people to kill people that he was not cut in because he wasn't
(32:23) trusted By The Station because he was sort of a motor mouth at Corey and so um as a reporter when I I wrote the story the first story about Chile and the CIA involvement in Kissinger was angry and all that stuff he was involved and um uh and uh there was a senate committee led by Frank Church who later investigated uh another story I did the church committee after domestic spying and he started he put out his committee put out a report and I like 50 other reporters um I was following the story wrote a piece for the New York Times about the
(32:56) senate committee said this and that about this chili stuff and Corey I mentioned they had mentioned Corey as being involved in the actual more act more aggressively than just or just propaganda and he of course went nuts about it and even though I had done the same thing others did he focused on me and he was right I later learned that he was cut out I later learned that he was cut out of of anything involved The Killing stuff because they didn't trust the Ambassador which happens and so I wrote I was then working on a book on a
(33:27) Kissinger and it was 81 I'd been out of paper for a couple years and I told a well you know what uh we screwed this guy over in on page one even though it was I wrote the report six other eight other people did but so I wrote it and he blank you know New York Times was the New York Times and so we did a front page correction I wrote a 3000 word port not only correcting that he wasn't in there but describing why he wasn't and I was as a way to write another story about what really happened and we put it
(33:56) on page one and the response of the peers was pretty much ignoring this sort of exceptional thing because I wrote a three thousand story saying you know I screwed up stuff but there was a reason for it which is made better the the Time Magazine they they did they real medically the ridiculary piece they the three thousand word oops right they'd run the same story they did I did earlier a couple years earlier in the senate committee and so Abe rooseveltal said to me I'll never forget it he said I'm never going to show uh he
(34:28) use a vulgar word for rear end I never oh he said I'm never going to show my ass to those guys again you know screw them all I'm done with no more Corrections if this is the way they behave you know we you know I spent a month doing it I'm sure I got paid minimal money it wasn't about money you know I wasn't on the staff uh so but you so I saw that even then you're right even until then the times covered things that they didn't report it was of note but I I would say that's disappeared
(34:59) totally long before I I wrote stuff I mean I when I was doing stuff for the New Yorker um after 9 11. um I was doing a lot of stories because I have access all with unnamed sources but of course the New Yorker knows the sources and the People by the way I'm working with New Yorker Checkers right now and an editor who used to be uh was my editorial and London review books when I wrote a bunch of stuff for them and so um uh they stopped chasing stories back then um in I thought after 9 11 you know they just you know I I had a wonderful friend
(35:37) of mine that was on the paper called me and said well we all were called in Sunday about this story and we called everybody we can't match it so we're going to forget it I said what he said I know it's crazy but they're not going to do it so it's just an old values change and it changed then and it's right now what they're doing is they're putting American Jeopardy I mean that's a serious charge to make the times has a special obligation is stature and it still has a staff the
(36:05) print circulation is way down as you probably know down to 330 000 it was 1.7 million but they're doing great they have an online reading you know that's I still get the paper I'm old-fashioned my wife's been reading it online since it started because it's easier for her um I still get the print and I like to feel it and I like to read it that way but um it's got an obligation to the America you know the one fight I had with Rosenthal when I worked there that was never resolved wasn't about the papers instinctive
(36:34) anti-communism it was about the fact that they they weren't an American newspaper they they were you know none of this American exceptionalism they're an international newspaper and they shouldn't cover things from the American point of view as they do I was that was a big fight I had not just an intellectual fight that's you're making you're making a mistake you're bigger than that you got to start covering the story from a world point of view and they didn't they didn't he thought I was
(36:59) nuts well they I'm just going to stop there for a minute but I mean they I I mean hey Rosenthal very problematic figure I mean those were the Glory Days it's so diminished in terms of its Integrity its ethics and the quality of its journalism whether Jeff girth of course is Great Piece we did an interview with Jeff on the Russia Trump Saga two years four years of slogging uh what was salacia salacious gossip as news the caliphate podcast all that kind of stuff I want to thank the real news network and its production team Cameron
