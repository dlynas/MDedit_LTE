Transcript:
(00:00) so no you're a bit depressed at the moment so I thought what's true at all let's do an interview with her a nice cheery optimist this guy Rutger Bregman utopia for really so it's about how can we build a much better world than the one we currently have he's got some great ideas basic income that's one short of working week Kitching come on everyone this is fantastic stuff so he's going to go into detail about these ideas about how we could build maybe just maybe a utopia some people think
(00:32) utopianism is inherently quite dangerous idea if you have this view of history of natural constant progress where you create this you get this perfect society that's been tried a few times and it's led to huge amounts of bloodshed tyranny totalitarianism all used to justify an utopian idea that's partly true I mean I was born in 1988 it was a year before the fall of the Berlin Wall really oh and what what what what I was taught at university is that you shouldn't thinking utopian terms anywhere because
(01:01) it's dangerous you know we've all tried that communism faces and we're still cut into corpses right but I always have this nagging sense that we had lost something I mean democracy was it so keen once as well there are a few ideas which may seem utopian now but may become reality in the future the problem nowadays especially on the left is that it knows very well what it's against but it doesn't really have an idea what it's for so it's basically against everything against austerity against the
(01:29) establishment against homophobia against races racism and I'm not saying I'm not against all those things but you also need to be for something and that's a vision of where you want to go the point I'd often make is the left and you look in a very defensive posture why have we ended up so defensive and lacking in imagination of an alternative moments of crisis are really really important that those are the moments that you can get new ideas into the bloodstream of thought you know the problem was that in
(01:59) 2008 with the financial crash is that this was another moment of crisis where there should have been new ideas on the shelves but they weren't there my hope is that with 2016 with brexit and Trump is that we've done more of our homework a lot of people watching this video if I was to sum up their views I think it's fair to say they would think everything's kind of going to pop you kind of challenge that they're you well the big lesson of history that is that in the past everything was worse we're
(02:25) still living in a period in history where we are incredibly wealthy healthy very safe and we should be grateful for that the second thing is that there are really exciting ideas out there right now that are gaining in popularity I think the best example is the idea of a universal basic income to just completely eradicate poverty and it's taking off just talk about the history come to basic income because as you point out it was that well-known lefty Richard Nixon who experiments with the idea in a moment it rather than actually
(02:54) necessarily being something which just comes to the left of politics it was Milton Friedman he framed it more MIT maybe was a negative income tax but the facts are very very simple basically the same people from the left to the right all the great economist they all thought that this was going to happen so not only Milton Friedman believed that Biddle - also Martin Luther King Nixon didn't think of it himself he just wanted to make history he thought oh this is this is an idea that everyone's buying into right now let's do it
(03:18) so his proposal for a modest basic income got through Congress twice and it was only shot down in the Senate because Democrats thought that his proposal wasn't high enough a lot of critics of basic income being Devils I forget here they'll go just make everyone lazy well what I found is that when you ask people what would you deal with the basic income about 98 percent of people say you know I've got dreams I'm gonna do something useful with it don't worry I'm gonna quit my job and it's
(03:44) gonna be great but if you don't ask them what would other people do with a basic income about 90% of all people say I know other people they'll probably wasted on drugs and alcohol etc and that's why I think you need to look at the evidence there's one famous experiment that was done in Canada in the 1970s it went on for four years they didn't have money left to analyze the results because a new Conservative government had come into power and they said what kind of crazy experiment is this stop it and then 25 years later a
(04:13) Canadian professor found the records did the analysis and discover that it had been hugely successful people didn't massively quit their jobs that the hospitalization rate decreased by 8.5% crime went down kids performed better at school that's the thing we keep forgetting all the time poverty is hugely expensive in terms of higher health care more crime you name it is one of the main justifications for a tinkle in gum technological change one study suggests in Britain 11 million jobs could go not just low-skill semi-skilled jobs like
(04:47) before but middle-class professional jobs so is it now the case do you think that work is going to become more more precarious and that a basic income gives more stability and security to a more insecure workforce is that one of the yes definitely but I think that we underestimated capitalism's extraordinary ability to come up with new jobs there's one poll that was done in 2014 by YouGov that found that 37% of all British workers think they have a job that doesn't even need to exist now I'm not talking about I'm
(05:21) talking about care workers or the garbage men or the teachers here wait just bullshittin jobs you want to get rid of it's really interesting that it's especially the people who have brilliant resumes earn very decent salaries have great jobs the only problem is that at the end of the day you give them one beer or maybe two and they'll start confessing my job is completely useless I think that is one of the biggest taboos of our time there's there's one thing though that you can always use to
(05:48) see if the job is useless or actually quite useful you can just go and strike and see what happens so in the book I've got one example of a strike that happened in 1968 with garbage man big city like New York and survived the strike of garbageman for about a week and then you know the emergency state has to be the claret and it's complete disaster so those are very useful jobs and then I just wondered has it ever happened at one point in history that the bankers went on strike and I see I found only one example in all world
(06:18) history so for the vows of years there was only one time it actually happened and there was Ireland 1970 all the experts predicted disaster economists were saying this is this is a heart attack for the economy and then nothing happened you proposed a 50-hour week in 1930 see I think it was John Maynard Keynes predicted that by now I think was it a 14-hour week anyway we'd be it was fifteen exactly he did predicts 15 how did he get it so wrong well here again he wasn't the only one so Keynes prediction may seem completely
(06:49) crazy or ludicrous but it was just mainstream back then but it didn't quite happen in the 60s and in the 70s the work we kept shrinking and shrinking but then around 1980 especially in the US but also in the UK and other European countries people started working more and more so the first explanation is consumerism we keep buying stuff we don't need to impress people we don't like that's that's the the the most common explanation I'm personally more in favor of the of the other explanation by david graver
(07:18) since then in the 1980s we seen a huge amount of new jobs that don't really need to exist and as long as you stick to the ideology that you have to work for your money if we keep using that 19th century mindset then you know at some point old jobs will be useless but we still have jobs we need to rethink what work actually is because there's so much work that's unpaid but incredibly valuable volunteers were caring for our kids caring for elderly it doesn't have to GDP but go on strike and it's if all
(07:52) these yeah why is it bad for me why is it good to spend more time everyone in the 1930s and 40s believed that the big challenge of the future was going to be boredom nowadays it's stress just think about the waste and the costs we know for example is that people who work longer work weeks they're not more productive Henry Ford already discovered that in the 1920s but you should also think about not only the cost of stress but also the cost of poverty we have some frame our argument in terms of fairness or caring for for other people
(08:24) and I think that's I mean that's entirely right but you could also use right-wing rhetoric to defend leftist ideas for example poverty is usually expensive cost of child poverty in the u.s. are estimated 500 billion dollars each year there's a higher health care spending higher dropout rates more crime incredible waste of human potential it would cost just 175 billion a quarter of the country's military budget to eradicate poverty to get all the poor above the poverty line if you really go directly at the root of the problem try
(08:56) to eradicate it that's an investment we need to talk much more about these issues in terms of investments with really good returns your so-called sensitive social justice which is should be ironically named but it was set up by Iain Duncan Smith and they argue that child poverty is often not about money and it's about parents and their bad choices cigarettes alcohol family breakdowns and he's right is he yeah he's actually right yeah well there's a lot of data that shows that four people
(09:26) make many poor decisions it's just that the reason is completely different than what politicians like him think it's ourselves with an experiment that was done in India they went to India and did an experiment with sugar cane farmers and you should know that these farmers collect about 60% of their annual income all at once right after the harvest and they didn't a cutest before and after the harvest the farmers score much worse than the IQ test before the harvest the effects of living in poverty correspond
(09:56) to losing about fourteen points of IQ so yeah it's true the poor make many poor decisions because not not because they're dumped or something because but because anyone would make dumb decisions in the same situation poverty actually impinges on your mind it's like a tunnel vision you only can think about the next day or maybe the day after that but you don't have a long-term vision so what you need to do is just get people up above the poverty line and you will not only get an explosion of ambition and
(10:25) energy but people also be a lot smarter one of the other kids make in the in the book is certainly bold which is open borders I would say that's probably in the current climate will the most unassailable ideas I can think of how on earth are you gonna sell such an idea and what's the basis right we know from so many studies that global inequality is huge much bigger than national inequality and the most powerful instrument we have in the fight against global poverty is immigration and there's so much nonsense going
(10:54) around about it the migrants will take our jobs that they'll be lazy at the same time I mean I agree with you that this is this is a very difficult subject especially for them in their future but that doesn't mean I think we should completely surrender it but isn't the problem there I mean the science of it research you off it is very very compelling now the RAI often speak in terms of stories left often results of facts or statistics but they have an emotional case they go through here ok for you it
(11:22) should be about nationalism actually nowadays we we associate nationalism with inward-looking this and protecting what you've already got in the 19's in the Netherlands there was this ideology of the Netherlands being a guide country being like the most tolerant country on earth you can be I think feel patriotic about quite progressive ideas we're going to be the first economy that's entirely sustainable we're going to be the first or like think of Merkel reshuffled us we're strong country the
(11:51) Germans can do this that's framing tolerance and being welcome to migrants in terms of patriotism but wouldn't every country on earth have to basically abolish coolers at the same time if just one country abolished their borders which is well again I mean this is circles that said let me say this is a utopian idea but let's say we're in the Year 2300 and let's look back up on our time what is the biggest injustice of our time its borders I mean it's the biggest source of discrimination we have right now did
(12:22) you say I mean so the average American earns me three times as much for the same work as a Bolivian yeah even when they are the same skill of a lady and sex with a comparable Nigerian the difference as a fact of eight and a half that's adjusted yeah I mean we're talking about discrimination between black and white or men and women all the time and that's that's really important but it peels just in comparison with the differences between between borders and people living in other countries why do
(12:48) you think it's become so prevalent in both a countries to use escape go migrants refugees people in other countries for all the problems that exist in our societies the right and especially the populist right understands much better the way politics work that it's all about developing consistent narrative repeating it all the time pushing and the boundaries of what's politically acceptable and then just shifting it get builders is the Donald Trump if you like we've seen this tidal wave of right-wing populism and
(13:18) xenophobia populism sweeping over the Western world is the Netherlands the next domino to fall well was the first actually when Donald Trump started shocking everyone we're in we in the Netherlands were like we've all seen this before so years ago he was already saying crazy thing it was referring to mosques as I hate palaces escapees yes now he's saying that we need to close down all mosques banned the Koran etc in the in the 90s the Netherlands had arrived at the end of history politics was just all matter of technocracy all
(13:48) management then came the fog the Twin Towers then came in for time than Kim Garrett Willis and now everything is open again when it's about culture that's the big dividing line right now but the interesting thing is that economically speaking we're still living in a technocracy we still have the same policies still the same idea still the same people saying the same things based on the same outdated ideas so Garrett will ders he's the most successful utopian thinker in our country he's saying completely outrageous things all
(14:18) the time that for example Muslim women should pay to wear a head tax with a head rec tax he calls it it's most awful things but people get adjusted to it so that I think that's how it works can you see the echoes of the 1930s in terms of what we're going through at the moment definitely does that not disturb you yes each of this well it does actually yeah so there are a few differences the first one is that we're not as used to violence as we were in the 1930s also the global institutions are much
(14:46) stronger than they were in the in the 1930s but there are other like very scary similarities Trump is a huge narcissist if you if you read biographies of Mussolini or Hitler you just they should be struck how how could the they compare I think we should all really be afraid when when violence starts when we start getting to get used to that we haven't seen that yet in the in the u.s.
(15:14) unfeelingly in a way isn't this totally the wrong the wrong way around in terms of what our approach should be you should be realism Fiat opions in the sense that are you thinking myself is a pragmatist you know I don't think it makes it's for utilities and services like the railways to be ruined by private properties and naturally I think it's utopian to have a society which is not based on people's needs it is instead based on profits a very ideological model to have a very topia model you know with the pragmatists they're the
(15:42) extremists all the utopians that's what I try a little times just to show that universal basic income for example it's not a crazy idea there's a lot of scientific evidence that shows that it works we can afford it we've got the research we got the evidence we can do it tomorrow politically it might not be feasible to do to it tomorrow technically we can do you think it will happen in our lifetime UVI we've got no idea I'm not I'm not an optimist I'm not a pessimist I'm the
(16:06) possiblest I think that things can be different there's nothing natural by the way we've structured our society about the way we've structured our economy can all be different wow that was fascinating stuff I'm sure the bits people disagree with but I think I want to get a debate going around this leave some comments what do you think about these proposals do you have your own proposals what sort of world would you like to build what sort of policies would you like to pursue bring it on let's build this world below
(16:33) the comments and YouTube easily done we've got loads of other entities to come loads of interviews probably up here if Adams put them there otherwise I'm just waving in the air as ever leave your comment subscribe I'll see you next time
