(00:20) com second thought remember january 6th of course you do remember it was the day antifa did everything trump supporters had said they would be doing for months did it exactly the way they'd been planning and telling all their friends they'd be doing it in online forums did the whole thing while wearing maga shirts waving confederate flags and having the names and faces of long-standing republican voters grafted onto their own mission impossible style and then antifa chivalrously took none of the credit for it wow what a
(00:46) memorable time in american history that was it's been almost a year or exactly one year or just a little more than one year i i don't know i'm writing this in december let's just say it's been about a year since the weirdest day in recent american history and in the meantime things haven't been super fun the far right seems like it's continuing to grow in power and in influence under the biden admin and in this episode we're going to be looking at that a little more closely because it is a troubling
(01:14) omen for the future of politics in this country let's get started the first thing i should address is the title of the video the idea that fascism is on the rise in the u.s that's a pretty obvious statement for most people and likely even more so for the audience i have on this channel fascism has been on the rise for a while so much so that it's made that very statement the topic of countless op-eds and not too long ago the most powerful government seat in the world was filled by the unwitting culmination of that
(01:45) trend for four years the united states was ruled by a man who repeatedly parroted fascist narratives cozied up to white supremacist organizations and used armed forces and a militarized police to quash anti-fascist protest movements and those are just some of the many many many many many many other telltale signs of fascism there are just so many i'm not going to spend more time on this already tired argument of whether trump is a fascist a proto-fascist a neo-fascist or not a fascist at all haha don't worry about it because you've had
(02:18) over four years of that and we're all sick of it this video is about how the us as a whole is getting fascister even more fascisty how america is doing big fash but just so it's out of the way i'm going to be using the same definition of fascism i've used before palin genetic ultranationalism palin genetic meaning a belief in and a desire for the violent rebirth of a nation to overcome a period of moral decay and ultranationalism meaning an overwhelming loyalty to a perverted vision of one's country often laced with
(02:51) bigotry and racism there is more to fascism than that and it varies by the culture in which it appears but since we're talking about big trends in our common discourse defining fascism by its core ideology like this is actually pretty useful so with all that in mind let's go back to january 6th that day was a real turning point for the american far right particularly in the months that followed it on the one hand it was the first time in several years that crackdowns had targeted white nationalists and their
(03:20) friends so aggressively as i'm writing this over 700 people have been arrested and charged for the acts committed on the day of the riots and several trials are ongoing to identify central figures and prosecute them groups like the proud boys who were involved in the event and reached superstar status in 2020 after this infamous clip stand back and stand by but i'll tell you what i'll tell you what somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left because this is not a right these groups started to
(03:48) lose members in 2021 whether it was because of nasty platforming from parlor and other online cesspools for the far right or because the group splintered after leader enrique tario was outed as an fbi informant the proud boys and groups like them could not and did not build the same sized audience on telegram as they had achieved just a year earlier on other platforms but that seemingly downward trend is a very small part of the story not only have public shows of force by the far right increased not only do already white
(04:18) supremacist police forces get infiltrated by even more extremist group members the overall trajectory of the far-right movement in the u.s in general has been growth massive growth and the reason the far right has grown so much is because it has successfully coalesced under a few key narratives that it has been able to mainstream in greater american political culture the proud boys may not be what they used to but it's because the american right as a whole has taken their place take a look at this clip taken from a community
(04:48) meeting in shasta county california and you better be happy that we're good citizens that we're peaceful citizens but it's not gonna be peaceful much longer okay and this isn't a threat i'm not a criminal i've never been a criminal but i'm telling you that good citizens are gonna turn to real concerned and revolutionary citizens real soon and nobody else is gonna say that i'm probably the only person that has a boss say what i'm saying right now that we're building we're organizing
(05:13) and we'll work with law enforcement or without law enforcement but you won't stop us when time comes because our families are starving if you don't hear the seriousness of my voice i hope you open your ears you absolutely listen to what i'm saying because this is a warning for what's coming it's not gonna be peaceful much longer it's not gonna be raw rash i'm gonna be speechless it's not gonna be down outside saying pledge of allegiance it's not gonna be away from flags it's gonna be real
(05:37) when you see the things that i've seen i went to war for this country i've seen the ugliest dirtiest part of humanity i've been in combat and i never want to go back again but i'm telling you what i will to save this country if it has to be against our own citizens it will happen and there's a million people like me and you won't stop us open the county let our citizens do what they need to do let owners of businesses do what they need to do to feed their families take the masks off that's a pretty
(06:07) troubling discourse and as tempting as it might be to see this as a brief insight into a small movement there's good evidence that the man in the video is just the most vocal part of the new american right there's good evidence these beliefs aren't limited to militias with goofy names they're an integral part of the conservative mob just take this statistic from the gwu program on extremism only around 13 of those charged in the capital riots were formal members of militant groups like the proud boys the three percenters and the
(06:39) oath keepers the remaining 87 percent were a mix of typical trump supporters and independent far-right extremists there with their friends and family or loan attendees defined as inspired believers that means most people who breached the capital were just average republicans and you can tell these rioters just don't look like the typical far-right extremist they are much older with around two-thirds being over 35 years old much less likely to be unemployed and a full 14 percent of the attendees charged were business owners
(07:11) and 30 percent were white-collar workers these are not the typical far-right extremist demographics these are just republican constituency demographics all that to say that the mainstream republican party has not only swept the violent far-right under its wing it is comfortable embodying it itself okay how did this happen what are the narratives that have made their way out of smaller far-right cells and into common right-wing discourse there are some you're probably already expecting like the belief the election
(07:41) was stolen that is a big one and around 60 percent of the republican party does hold that to be true to be fair trump spent months and at this point over a year hitting them over the head with that one so it might not be the best example of a small group's narrative making it big a more concrete example of that phenomenon is the qinon conspiracy one in four republicans buy into the q anon conspiracy theory that a group of satan-worshipping cannibalistic blood-sucking pedophiles is ruling the us government plenty of people have
(08:13) looked into the movement's anti-semitic tropes and its close proximity to neo-nazi and white supremacist groups so i won't spend more time on it here but there's that 25 percent the more unexpected narrative making waves and bringing back that classic fascist flavor to the republican party is the great replacement theory by the way this is probably a good time to mention this video definitely isn't making it through the algorithm so if you feel inclined my patreon is in the description anyway the great replacement theory is a
(08:42) classic among neofascists and it's pretty clear why put to paper in 2012 by french writer reno kamu nope wrong kamu this is the guy the great replacement asserts that there is a plot which really means they think it's a jewish thing that the white race and white culture whatever that is is disappearing because of immigration from majority non-white countries fascists and i really do mean fascists here believe this will bring some general persecution of white people because of course they can't imagine the
(09:11) world being run any differently than with one race subjugating another while at the same time believing wholeheartedly that racism ended with obama in any case this is the theory that motivated the christ church shooter brenton tarrant and the el paso shooter patrick crucius and it's a big wet pile of fascist garbage that has unsurprisingly historical trajectory going straight from world war ii through the american nazi party europe's own fascist politicians and has now found a home among a substantial chunk of the
(09:41) republican electorate here's a clip of tucker carlson endorsing the theory on fox calling it by name and likening it to eugenics an unrelenting stream of immigration but why well joe biden just said it to change the racial mix of the country that's the reason to reduce the political power of people whose ancestors lived here and dramatically increase the proportion of americans newly arrived from the third world and then biden went further he said that non-white dna is the quote source of our strength
(10:12) imagine saying that this is the language of eugenics it's horrifying but there's a reason biden said it in political terms this policy is called the great replacement the replacement of legacy americans with more obedient people from far away countries they brag about it all the time but if you dare to say it's happening they will scream at you with maximum hysteria that is america's most watched conservative casually parroting an openly white supremacist theory on prime time tv but what does this have to do with
(10:42) january 6th according to you chicago professor robert papp between four and eight percent or around 21 million americans at the high end believe both one that the election was stolen and that two trump should be reinstated by force of that group 63 percent believe in the great replacement theory almost 10 percent more than believe in cuanon whose flags we saw waved throughout the crowd on january 6th and at every trump rally for over a year let me say that again more people in that crowd hold a deeply fascist belief then believe in
(11:19) the other slightly more wacky letter of the alphabet-based fascist belief and we know that the q crowd was a big part of the trump fanbase to start off with because they're just so open about it the great replacement crowd is just not waving as many flags it is 18 more letters than a big q though anyway more than just getting some demographic information pap was able to estimate that among all other motivations a belief in the great replacement was the most significant trigger that turned people already convinced that the
(11:47) election was stolen into people who believe that they should engage in insurrectionist violence to reinstate trump in other words the belief that white people are being replaced is the motivator that justified the riots for its perpetrators and with these narratives making their way to the most watched conservative tv show and to regular conservative conferences since january 6th we might be in for an even worse time going forward but the q anon and great replacement stuff isn't the whole picture in the last year opposition to vaccine and mass
(12:19) mandates have functioned in much the same way rallying together the various strands of the american far right to the somewhat more moderate republican base and infusing a more authoritarian tone into their discourse the idea that the whole pandemic is some sort of hoax just like they believe the election to be has invited fascist extremists into what we recently called the mainstream currents of republicanism who brought with them their horrifying views of what politics should be fascists and more generally
(12:47) awful far-right extremists are welcomed into the republican fold but in making this video i want to be careful that it doesn't seem like this is something new it's certainly very bad much more explicit today than it has been in years and tainted with a much more military and violent shade than before but fascism in this country has existed in some way for decades if not centuries the conservative wing of the american political establishment often joined in its mission by the more progressive wing with only a few years
(13:17) of delay has found in its electorate enough political will to push forward nationalism xenophobia racism and the glorification of white religious culture at the very least since the reagan era and this country as a whole has engaged in genocidal racial violence for the majority of its history it has always embraced more authoritarian less democratic rule it has always glorified its hegemonic role in the international sphere it has always in part or in whole condoned its national project against racial and religious minorities and
(13:51) against every political movement to its left the capital riots charlottesville a couple years ago moments like these were significant they were marks of the change in fascism's presentation but by no means were they catalyst of fascism or flukes we can easily ignore because even if we understand the kinds of narratives that bring fascist ideology into a more prominent role today those narratives are still just the last step before mainstream acceptance their emergence in far-right cells and compatibility with the greater
(14:22) conservative currents had to come from somewhere and they did today fascism has been driven to its current apex not by those narratives alone but by the failures of the neo-liberal era failures that have been building for decades and that have laid a fertile ground for fascism to take root the economic insecurity that has fallen on more and more shoulders the general decline of unionized labor the disappearance of jobs that entire cities were built on and the increasing pace of economic crises have resulted in a particularly
(14:53) unstable system that fewer and fewer people have faith in that has opened up the space for opportunistic figures all too happy to make sure the capitalist economy endures even if it means a descent into authoritarian ultra-nationalism figures who have tried to portray moments like the trump presidency as a departure from what brought us here in the first place when it was really just a natural next step for a fragile crisis-ridden capitalist economy that's so dumb that makes no sense how could that be that's you
(15:24) that's what you're saying right now i can hear you i can see you i know you're confused if only you had an ongoing 12-part series on fascism and its modern forms to help you understand it better oh wait you do you can watch the first episode of my series the new f word on nebula we're working on the next episode as we speak so stay tuned for that i'm really proud of what we've produced so far in the meantime if you'd like to help support content like this and my very time consuming fascism series
