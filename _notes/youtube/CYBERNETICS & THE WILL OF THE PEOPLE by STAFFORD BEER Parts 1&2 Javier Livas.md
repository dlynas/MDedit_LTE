CYBERNETICS & "THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE" by STAFFORD BEER Parts 1&2 //Javier Livas
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ybjOw6UJ8A)

## Transcript:
Lindsay Tu Cliff Memorial
lecture this is to commemorate a student
who is very dear to us who died in a car
accident a couple of years ago but who
who Who's uh was very concerned with the
issues of peace and social justice and
it's on this theme that we built these
Memorial lectures and I can't think of
of anyone who uh who who signifies and
has worked towards these goals uh um
uh the in that anyone we can think of
really than Professor Stafford beer who
who's with us this evening to share his
thoughts with us um as you can see from
the format of of this this uh this um
Arrangement um Stafford would prefer not
to be speaking to us but which is to
discuss with us and and develop ideas
with us on the theme the will of the
people I
honestly as I was expecting Eric to
introduce uh Stafford I didn't prepare
anything and I I really honestly would
not know where to begin he's done so
many things and contributed in so many
ways to the development of of uh of of
thought and uh and social organization
and and and uh contributed really to uh
ideas in so many different fields that
uh it would be foolish to try to
encapsulate that and and just one or two
sentences um all I can do really is is
uh say to uh that we're very grateful
that he was able to find time to to to
join us this evening to commemorate
Lindsay sutcliff's uh memory and um turn
over the discussion to him thank you
very
much well I'm very pleased to be with
you uh but I I'm serious about the
format of this thing
see if we restrict ourselves to
lecturing then we've got to know what
we're talking about and we have to uh
refine a topic down to something which
becomes quite
trivial
usually and I am very deeply concerned
that because of this phenomenon we never
really address our minds to such a vast
issue as I have calmly written with my
hand
shaking as the title for us to look at
tonight because where does one start and
where does one finish and how can one
say anything at all
coherent that hasn't already been said
before that doesn't seem to be the topic
of a of of a a very glossy Sunday
supplement or one of those
things I want to if I can to to create
an atmosphere in this room tonight where
everybody is really personally wrestling
with what on Earth this means the notion
that we would like people to be able to
express
themselves in in their own spirit in the
development of their society and in
every other conceivable
way we have only to say that please note
to realize that most people in the world
have no more hope of doing this than of
jumping over over the moon because the
world exists in a state of
tyranny we then say for our own sake as
far as we are concerned that we are
extremely lucky
because we live in a society which we
presume to call
free and we say we are in a democracy
and that's very that's very nice but
then of
course I say it with with
the a lot of concentration of spirit we
know that this isn't
true we do
have the ability to sit here and talk
about it without without any risk that
people will March in and cut us off to
jail that's something but maybe that's
about all it is very hard to defend the
proposition that we actually live in a
democracy government by the people deos
Cris so what I'm saying is that if we if
we can attune our minds to to Really
grappling with this instead of saying ah
this fellow turns out to be a Marxist or
a non-marxist or Neo Marxist or
something like that then this is what I
would like us to try and do because I
think those political categories have
rather failed
us um the FR I've already established I
can't remember names tonight I want the
name of the French philosopher
who who recently
died play
play sist critique which is Hardo and I
hope some of you have read it read it
makes the point
that
um there has been no coherent political
Theory other than Marxism in which to
talk talk about these subjects so that
automatically one gets grouped in sets
of camps around this language I would
like to avoid that if we
can but we have to use some language now
if if I were to say to you right well
now if this is what we're going to try
and do we're going to try and grapple
with this and I'm not going to give a
lecture because I don't know anything to
lecture
about but I have thought a lot about
these things and I have done some some
things that I can tell you about what's
more then what language should we be
using and would you come along with me
and agree just for the moment to abandon
those labels which get us into such
uh like sticky fly papers to which we
just adhere and then we're we've had it
when we when we get caught with those
labels now I it turns out I am a systems
man I I avoid labels even about what I
am because you see as soon as I say I'm
a systems man some of you say haha that
means computers and other people say ho
ho which means brains and I say no he he
it means neither or both of those
things but clearly what it means is that
there is a body of knowledge that views
the world
systemically so again please avoid
labels or you're going to misdirect
yourselves and I don't mean these a v my
speaking to but Vis A V the subject
matter that we have met to
discuss we don't want those labels what
we do want is a clear
perception that we are dealing with a
system and not with bits of systems
which is what we are mostly invited to
contemplate because it's more
convenient you carve something up it is
in our intellectual tradition to do so
and develop a reductionist plan of
campaign for thinking about about
anything you say well consider this
first consider this next but the model
that I want to uh to to use with you see
will not obey that kind of law at
all it would be like taking apart a
radio set and labeling all the parts and
saying well we've got that organized now
which is the part that is actually being
Crosby's voice
see or Like a Surgeon taking a part of
body and saying well what where is is
this man's indomitable will that we all
know
about see there are things that are
epiphenomena of
systems that we never find by the
reductionist approach and I think that
we have got most markedly ENT
trapped as a result of trying to think
about these things in that way the
second problem we face if we if we dare
to write with termining hand the will of
the
people is that is the classic trap of
trying to enumerate the world you know
if we're going to make a nice tidy
Theory tonight about the will of the
people well this is this is bizarre you
can't do
it so how can we get
in now I'm trying to I want to take you
with me on a on a voyage and I have made
a map of this Mo Voyage which I will
distribute to you in a minute when I've
calmed you enough I hope hope not to be
too alarmed by this
map the
substance of things with which this
approach of Mind
deals is
complexity well you see it's not money
and it's not people as such
and I want to introduce you to the
notion of complexity as a computable and
handleable
concept because that's what our world is
made made up of and an awful lot I think
you probably agree with me straight away
avoiding all labels that an awful lot of
our problems result from the very thing
that we were supposed to be gaining from
as technology moved into the 20th
century the world was going to get
smaller every what he said and by golly
it did because of highspeed travel
because of Television because of
satellites
Etc and and the expectation was among
nice uh
optimistically thinking people
that what would happen was the shrinking
world everybody would understand each
other
more but what has really happened of
course is that uh to use a
mathematical
thought that the number of ways in which
N Things are related is n into n minus
one which is an exponential notion it's
it is something that is going to explode
under you as soon as more and more
people get in on the ACT and that's
what's happened to us and far from being
simpler it has become much more
difficult because of the added
complexity now if you look at a world
containing this complexity and I shall
be using tonight the word
variety so there's the first technical
term and it is a technical term but it's
used much as we use it in ordinary life
Variety in cybernetics is defined as the
number of possible states of the
system so what I'm saying is our
problems are generated apart from
wickedness and apart from power blocks
and apart from all those other things
our problems are very fundamentally
generated by explosive variety by the
number of possible states of the system
that we are LED into thanks to this uh
this technological world we live
in now one of the funny things about
variety
is that you as soon as you notice it you
have to cut it
down for instance I have just noted a
whole lot of new friends here about 50
people I've never met before and I know
all I know about them is they're human
beings now I know something about the
variety of human being I I know that
it's the human being is about 10 to the
10 neurons in his brain which can
generate an awful lot of variety and I
know that the interactions between all
the the 50 of those people in this room
is a colossal variety I anything might
happen here might happen you might play
beeth 7th Symphony go and build a bridge
anything you might do but you are as a
matter of fact sitting very quiet so far
listening now that is an agreement with
me to do something about the variety
because if you don't agree to that we
couldn't have the evening we'd have some
other kind of
evening so it's clear that variet can be
manipulated in various ways now the
world storms on proliferating variety
and getting it
manipulated in this process it seems to
me the will of the people gets
completely
lost because they are on the receiving
end of having their variety
reduced and that will happen to them
under a tyranny certainly because you
don't you speak a word out of place or
you'll be shot but it also happens under
our kind of system in a much more subtle
way because we people in this room can't
actually influence anything in the way
that our variety is
handled that is the that is a basic
thought I want to put to you and as we
look at the map we will begin to see
that it's pretty
alarming because the the human potential
is thereby degraded and
debased and firmly sat
on now where's the optimism by which to
match that pessimistic
opening I find there are all sorts of
ways of of getting into this tonight
we're we're here for a memorial
evening I found myself thinking about
Lindsay sliff and her life and its
termination which is a diminution of
variety if you
like and I thought rather perkle instead
of getting
gloomy of a monologue of Stanley
holloways which some of you may remember
which says it'll all be the same in 100
years 100 years from
now for I'll be dead and you'll be dead
it will be the same in a 100 years 100
years from
now that's a very odd thought
thought we will all be
dead so what is what is the world going
to be like and what is carrying it
Forward Stanley Holloway puts a nice
little humorous quir there by
saying and someone else will be well in
the cart 100 years from now I like that
lightning of the
atmosphere the fact is that we are being
replaced by generation
and as I thought about this this
proliferation of
variety it came to me that if we could
only introduce a fire
break into The Human Condition so there
was nobody around and then start again
in a 100 years see we would have a
chance to rethink everything clearly we
can't do
that but what counts as equivalent or
might count as equivalent is the fact
that about half the people in the world
are under
20 and again I thought of Lindsay sliff
who was still in her 20s when she
died if half the world is under 20 then
surely surely surely it ought to be
possible to recreate the world
somehow so what how do we do it do we
talk about
education we have met in an educational
Institution
of course we talk about
education but the trouble is my friends
we don't know what to teach any more
than I know what to say to you tonight
there are no answers to this
stuff and the trouble is and here is a
very nasty thought to to to start off
with a very aggressive thought because
we are all in education in one form or
another in this
room but the things we teach are the
things that have got us in this
mess
sobering isn't
it I
teach from time to time in the
Manchester business school and I was
asked last year to to teach on a program
for Africans on Hospital management and
I
refused on the grounds that we have no
idea how to manage a hospital and if any
if any of you have ever been in one I'm
sure you'd
agree there's no place for the sick I
can tell you
now what I'm trying to do with this
weird introduction is to say to you
look we excuse me we have a
proliferating variety going
on we have a lot of influences on that
variety which we are trying to steer
towards what end not towards the end of
knowing what we already know doesn't
work for God's sake
but towards some better end something we
might call adaptive something we might
call a learning system in which
therefore we cannot afford to put too
much
dcism too much
aprioristic knowledge the only fruit of
which we know is it doesn't
work you know there is a very big
Paradigm Shift involved in looking at
that problem like that
because we tend
hopefully
to suppose that everything is more or
less all
right that the notw workking of things
is an
aberration that if we put more money in
or more effort or more care or more
love into the things we we have and we
are trying to get right they will
somehow come right
now all my kind of
analysis in using the what I would call
the cybernetics of social systems if you
want a
phrase suggests that the the very
structures that we are trying to use are
out of gear with the rate at which the
expanding world is
operating now I'll show you what that
means with a very Swift drawing and some
of you may have a chemical background
and we'll know what lelia's principle is
that's just for those who know those who
don't can just look at my
diagram if you bombard a system M chello
was talking about physical chemistry but
I will generalize it and this system is
operating in this space and is in a some
kind of equilibrium at that
point then disturbances from outside are
going to
rattle it it will it will move
around but it will of course we expect
unless the whole thing blows up find a
new stable point and there it will come
to
rest and then of course the battering
starts again and it'll have to move
again well in fact of course the
battering in Social systems is
continuous but there are peaks of of
battering there are huge waves of
perturbation hit the social system and
whether you want to talk about education
or the family or any other social
phenomenon the economy you are going to
find that the there are waves that
produce this perturbation and then the
thing settles down or we hope it does
now my contention is and the the thing
I'm using to to try and get you to think
about this is that if we put in social
structures which were geared as they
were
were and this is about the beginning of
the Industrial Revolution to that kind
of
Technology the perturbations came along
at a certain
frequency which the structures could
then adapt to and produce this new
point just as a crystal will in the
chatellier's
principle but if then by the massive
Redevelopment of technology and the
explosion of the world in the way I
began to describe describe it just now
these perturbations come along at a rate
faster than the rate at which this darn
thing will
settle then you see why we're in trouble
now I think that that's that's what's
happening we've got explosive variety
which we cannot
contain that point then oscillates and
we begin to lose any recollection of
what stability may
be and this is why people feel so
thinking people feel so uneasy about the
framework that they are operating in
that the world seems to be uh running a
mck well the answer would be that it is
running a mck and it's running a MK
because that point never settles now I I
just want to show you the power of that
notion if you
will if that point never settles a we're
in constant crisis management
because we're totally preoccupied we're
getting that thing to simmer down I put
it to you that the evidence is that that
is true you know we are in crisis
management I I do a lot of management
consulting particularly among
governments and it is totally impossible
to get anybody to think of more than a
week ahead you know anything over that
is is long range
planning a month ahead is Blue Sky
Thinking you know they
there worse than that if that doesn't
settle not only in constant crisis and
in constant Neurosis because of the
crisis but you lose the recollection of
what stability
means now if you have no reference point
no stable point to work from then you
cannot run effective experiments which
is the basis of all
learning you need a learning system
needs a point of reference from which to
measure departures and then to come back
and ask if those departures are adaptive
to its its purposes or not so a you're
in crisis B you can't learn if you can't
learn I won't spin I won't drag this out
just think fast please if you can't
learn you can't adapt and if you can't
adapt you can't evolve and the whole
biological
notion is uh
destroyed and if you want evidence of
that then how are you into your doom
reading these
days see one of the ways in which
society has managed to cut down on
variety for us is to make it clear
that people like me are called prophets
of Doom and therefore can be
conveniently
disregarded now currently I wanted to
draw your attention to two books and I
just I said I was is going to make this
interactive and I'm talking a hell of a
lot more than I intended to
already uh who has read Jonathan shell
the fate of the
earth is two
three well here we are with a scenario
which says that if if there is a nuclear
war then in the first strike the United
States will
be a democracy of grasses and
insects that's his phrase and you should
read that book I mean it is just
shattering what is the will of the
people response to that kind of
threat in
Maryland they have
spent something like $2 billion doar on
an exercise to work out what they will
do if there is a nuclear
strike and do you know that cars with
with odd-numbered number plates go on
the second day and cars with even
numbered number plates go on the first
day and everybody is exhaled to bring a
packed
lunch I'm glad you laugh because you've
got to let it out somehow that is
true now that is how the will of the
people gets met you see with all sorts
of bogus things and the statement that
Jonathan shell scenario is of course uh
irresponsible against the public good
likely to cause panic and I should think
so too that's me speaking in Brackets
but that's what people are told and that
is how the variety is
reduced and of course the Slicker we the
Slicker we get about our methods of
communication the more effective is that
job done of just saying well I no really
I mean we can't have this it's not going
that's not
feasible the other book is Sheron
Deus originally written in in French but
called in English the eighth night of
creation anybody read
that nobody this
time well that again is a very very
remarkable book looking not at the
nuclear thing so much as at um
ecology and acid rain and things of this
kind but it does consider nuclear not
Warfare but
nuclear
um
accident and it says and it demonstrates
that if one nuclear power plant in
Northern Germany went up it would wipe
out Germany France and Switzerland in
one
go you know this is now are you going to
say well we can't tolerate that thinking
or are we going to say well how on Earth
could one possibly do anything about it
which is where the will of the people
comes
in now governments can use guns to
reduce
variety and if people Point guns at you
it's remarkable I have observed and my
unfort more unfortunate friends have
told me
Pand that you shut up proliferating
variety it induces a most peculiar kind
of uh blanket on
you
but equally I am suggesting not perhaps
equally but very nearly equally if you
are sufficiently
heed by a certain kind of
politician by a certain kind of
slickness as I feel about as I would
interpret uh the way the media do the
variety reduction trick it all looks so
polished you
see and it becomes very very difficult
to imagine the variety proliferation and
disruption that this very
very unbalanced world we live
in would would instantly disintegrate
into if if any one of a lot of things
happened now I haven't come here to to
uh scare the pants off you but you see
unless we are going to look at some of
those things fairly fairly well and
truly in the eyes we Shan have any
motivation to get deeper into the thing
that I want us to
discuss and in any case it is highly
relevant to talk about the way in which
variety is reduced because our options
lie in the variety that we are not
allowed to
entertain unless we're going to keep on
down the same old
road so how can you get that in the face
of the hectoring and of the gun
and so on how could you get to this
notion of it of it won't all be the same
in a 100
years we have to get variety back into
the
system in order to do that and that's
really what I want to talk about so with
that
introduction I will risk shoving this
map around and please please don't be
frightened by it because we we'll take
it we'll take it fairly slowly and if
you begin to look at it while it's being
distributed you will see that on the top
here is is some kind of systematic way
of looking at what I've just been saying
I better keep a copy of this I think
could we just sort of Swizzle that
around the
room

how many copies are they're supposed to
be 50 because I was told that 50 people
were coming but I think there may be
more than 50 people here are
there you only put down 50 well in that
case right
well let us uh if we may use this as a
map and
not uh just sort of freak out in
principle about being confronted with
such a
thing do you
see how the top piece of this matches
what I was saying
the big circle is meant to represent the
variety of human potential where variety
is the number of possible
States and what I've suggested is inside
that Circle are two heavy
squeezes which have reduced the variety
of which human beings are capable and
you may well agree that in many cases
and in large measure it's a jolly good
job you know we we uh we don't want to
use all our variet otherwise life would
be completely incoherent but the
question is have we have we diminished
Variety in the right way now if nothing
works then clearly we haven't so there's
there's something else going on here and
this is what the diagram is supposed to
be uh
demonstrating so uh the first piece of
the variety squeeze is this odd thing
that it'll all be the same in 100
years which still leaves me in
a in a very reflective mood and I'll
leave that one with you because that has
been a variety reducer and could be a
variety
expander if
indeed the half the world that is under
20 has idealism and refuses to follow
the same
path all the presses however we should
note which is the upper half which is
called historical
preemption this is the this is the root
mankind has followed which which indeed
has reduced human potential to a
particular spectrum of options as I've
called it we still see ourselves as
having having options but I want you to
realize that we we've thrown a whole lot
overboard that we could get
back uh it is said that hero of
Alexandre was uh was told to shut up
about his uh
some of his inventions notably the uh
the jet
engine uh because of philosophers of the
day didn't think and they were largely
the rulers of the day didn't think that
that was going to be a very productive
thing to do and I like that story
whether it's true or not because maybe
we shouldn't just be following our
technological
NOS but we
are and if anybody here has ever tried
to get a grant you'll know it you get a
grant to do more of the same you don't
get to Grant to do anything novel
because people will say well that's new
don't be
ridiculous try and get a PhD thesis
accepted and you will find will you not
some of you must have tried
it that if you propose to do something
it hasn't been done before the
supervisor is likely to say I don't know
anything about that this I know about do
a thesis on that you see what I
mean
well
now I'm saying first of all that we have
squeezed our range of options down to a
spectrum we have squeezed our potential
down to a spectrum of options which
could be reconsidered if we had a
mechanism and then I'm saying that the
immediate things that we do the
immediate Regulators of our society
squeeze the uh spectrum of options down
to what I've called here um
a range of something Choice which I
can't read yes right I couldn't get
perceived into the square see how you
lose your
variety the range of perceived choice is
not as big as the range of options and
that's a comforting thought providing we
could find a mechanism to
release the the things that are
squeezing us now the things that are
squeezing
in the short term I mean in the in the
nitty-gritty of life as distinct from
the big historical things that I've been
talking about I have listed here as
subcultural Conformity which of course
is a variety reducer because people by
and large say well you know he's got his
hair done in a a thing painted pink so
must
I
uh that you notice it isn't usually the
Conformity of P rockers that bares
people that that know that becomes the
issue it is the Conformity of people who
are regarded as
respectable and then habit is a is a
variety
reducer and so indeed are low variety
models now anything that you have in
your head as an explanation of what the
hell is going
on is a model of the
world and we've got to realize that we
may get those models wrong and reduce
variety and overly reduce
Variety in so
doing now you think about your
relationships with other people if I can
try and bring this home in a personal
way we we say of somebody else uh oh
that's not him that's that's not typical
at
all he was not acting in
character how do we know you see what we
mean is that the model we have of him
doesn't fit what he's doing and instead
of saying our model is wrong we say he's
not himself
today and just it's just the same as the
example I gave you earlier of big social
systems where we say well that doesn't
work but instead of saying therefore
it's wrongly
structured we say well it's aberant
Behavior so something went wrong we'll
put it right in future but we never do I
started counting the number of
Institutions I went to for example where
all the escalators were working and I
got to about 200 without finding a
single institution where all the
escalators were working and gave up
because it's quite clear that escalators
are things that don't always
work know whereas the model says that
they do only just today it so happens
that that's the difference so our models
are not necessarily adequate at all and
they are variety reducers now I wrote
separately from that collection
underneath the set of media conditioners
that I mentioned before that worry me so
much as reinforcers of these
models and that's why I say with
feedback and put an arrow up there you
see where we are on the diagram to the
the main variet squeezers are reinforced
I'm arguing by feedback through the
media which uses the models that we
already have got because what else can
it use if it's going to
communicate and by using it and by using
it very
skillfully in particular reinforce
it now on the right of that diagram I
have a world system which is everything
that's going on focusing on something
that I have called explicit
doom and I've given those references to
the two books down the
bottom uh we know that the world is
under a large number of pressures of the
kind I've just written on the Blackboard
and I've listed some of them there we
know that there are political pressures
where people are essentially trying to
gain power over each other we know there
are economic pressures which is much the
same sing without the
guns they just come along a bit a bit
behind and we know about mil military
pressures we know about religious
pressures those seem to me to be some of
the major categories that Focus the
world on an explicit Doom by which I
mean what it will actually be like at
some future
date that I use Doom to draw attention
to although it may be unpopular to the
the
the terrible risk that we are in
unstable
equilibrium and that the sort of things
we ought to be measuring are variety how
it is contained how it is conditioned
how it is generally massaged by by
powerful
people and how it is doing all those
things directly to a goal of
disaster well it's a so bring thought I
think now what I'm what I'm planning to
do is to go
on to discuss ways of looking at this
situation Under The Heading of the
varable system you see it there to which
the next diagram figure two refers and
under the notion of the self- reference
system which is to which the next
diagram refers so I thought that we
ought to pause at that point because
this thing across the top which I have
now
discussed is a sort of statement in
Chief of what I think we're up against
and I thought you might like to join in
at that point and say something
yourselves I mean do do you find that a
a true statement of Affairs do you find
the the way of looking at it through the
notion of variety
and focus
variety helpful or not or what else me
I find it very very helpful actually but
it strikes me that one of the most
particular and most neglected squee is
what we might call the economic scree
that is that very very few
people are really left with any choices
about how they spend what is their most
human activity which is doing things uh
there are a huge number of in quote
lucky people who can put a thing on and
off the con built and get paid at the
end of the week and there are various
other unlucky people who are
trying to get the privilege of of doing
that uh
and that that this is you know some of
the the idea was regard it as
rather uh mystical and uh
uh whole breed and and sandals F
actually
are very
important attempt of this but the
problem about it is that they are flying
to the periphery of the system as it
were to be allowed to do this whereas as
in the system itself this happens more
and more and
the uh technological Revolution which is
constantly in the media which be done to
what you said it is being done to is
really terribly focused on uh making
this operation this empty operation the
squeezed operation worse and worse and
and worse it is it absolutely is now if
I could build on that a little bit thank
you for that contribution I in the first
place I think that we ought to face the
fact
that um unemployment is is with us that
that is something that is going to be a
permanent feature of human society
because the rate of the population
explosion is such that jobs cannot be
created fast enough I mean I think that
this is it's not something one can
actually prove but it's something one
can see really rather clearly we're
going to have four billion people by
about the turn of the century and there
just won't be that number of jobs so we
better start reclassifying and if we
look at it in our modern England
Britain uh I think that uh you know it
is high time to stop using the word
unemployment to try and uh you know
there are many schemes as we all know
the notion of paying people a basic rate
to just to be be around you know and
then you start rethinking what you're
going to do about jobs all of that all
of those options are open and I don't
want to fall into the Trap I mentioned
of enumerating the world when I started
speaking because we can't do that
there is a whole raft of possibilities
that you have raised there let's let's
look at that raft without trying to
enumerate them the other thing I'd like
to say is that U I am very struck Myself
by the the decency of people as distinct
from the powers that get hold of people
and I would like to respond to you in
this Dimension by saying suppose people
knew and we could easily bring it home
to them and television has done quite a
good job on this one I
think if people knew the conditions
under which sugar cane was harvested and
the conditions under in in Jamaica let's
say and the conditions under which tea
was harvested in Salon let's say I doubt
that anybody in Britain would mind
paying twice as much as they pay now for
those Commodities even people on the
door because we you know because it's
not that big of component of our our
spending but of course we all know not
not
being absolutely naive that there is no
way whereby we could get that that
second 100% of money back to the people
we'd like to have it it would it would
dissipate obviously it would we we don't
have the
mechanism so those are those are two
responses to what you said let's have
some more I'd like to raas a couple of
questions one was you said and you got a
A Laugh of agreement from all of us of
course the system doesn't work and I'd
like you to expand as you've just been
doing a bit more on what precisely you
mean by that uh because a general
agreement uh can come from disaffected
intellectuals in a poly Technic that of
course you know a lot of our systems are
in a state of chaos and so on but the
other
the other end of the telescope on the
the world system might be the one that
would uh for me suggest um the possible
uh next steps from the analysis I mean
where the system really doesn't work
where it really hurts is is Among The
Wretched of the earth yes the 80% of the
of the five b uh that might be the place
where the reduction of
uh their creativity and potential
variety is not something that they
acques in as we tend to do in our
culture but something that's imposed on
them and given the opportunity there can
be an explosion of
creativity of which we we can't really
grasp it an image here well you know I
yes I very much agree we let me try and
Link those two ends see if if I come
into somebody's house in our highly
civilized
society the handle will fallen off the
refrigerator the doors don't fit you
know if you want to say nothing works in
this house by God you can prove it now
people have been LED along a path which
says well actually this is all very good
and you could put a new handle on
couldn't
you so that they're not really allowed
to think that this shoddiness and this
this not workability matters now I think
it does matter how come is it that in
with all our wealth and so walk out of
here and look at the
architecture you know mankind has built
beautiful buildings always and now
suddenly stops because it's wealthy and
because we therefore use
economic variety reducers which tell us
that we must minimize the cost of square
foot if you minimize the cost of square
foot you'll get boxes you can't get
anything else
so this is where the thing links because
you then go to the third world which is
where I spend most of my
time and you think if only these people
were not led into believing that this is
what they ought to
do when I first went to Chile and saw
the the squabble over over L linear
Blanca Commodities white line of
refrigerators and all those washing
machines all those things things I was
completely astonished and horrified when
I went into the Pion and saw people
living in tin sheds with sacks over them
with a television set and what are they
watching they're watching American soap
operas which say this fellow it's how
you should be
living now if we could stop if we you
know it is a question of values at this
point now all the pressure that we put
on the world on the third world in my
opinion and now I'm getting very away
from the sort of cool scientific bit
here and why
not the pressure we put on them is to
follow us in order to finance our
Indulgence in these absurdities it seems
to me because I we've now got 40
countries quite suddenly are are more or
less in
bankruptcy
why I mean could you can you can anybody
in this room conin vinc me that I it is
improper to use the word
Usery about the way that the third world
is
financed we will lend you more money to
pay the installments on the last lot of
money we paid we lent you well knowing
that you cannot repay the interest
that's
usually and we've got expensive Bankers
10,000 of them in Toronto the other
month you noticed 10,000 the mind
boggles
and they are saying you need this money
in order that you can have all these
goodies stop what goodies I don't want
them oh but you have to want them
otherwise we cannot continue our
system this is the mess I think we're in
and I you know if it's this bad it's it
it has to be said and of course it's a
political
thing well you started this what are you
going to say the only the other one I
wanted to way was you said that under
the bombardment you get crisis
management and I'd like to ask you
whether it's a product of your job that
makes you say that because management is
in
crisis nobody has a reference point or a
recollection of what stability means and
I would again refer back to the masses
The Wretched of the earth who have in
myth Legend etc etc
uh a sense of History a sense of the
archaic and which again may be the the
possibility of Hope for for the release
of a rang I very much agree and we'll
get to that if we ever get to the third
diagram I hope but in the meantime let
me just say that all the people of I'll
pick on India this time all the very
beautiful people I know in India who
have got their phds at Stanford and so
forth are trying to to to knock out of
of the social wheel the very things
you're talking about on the grounds that
they it's time India call up and that
those are superstitious nonsenses and
they're quite a PO when I when I quote
uh patang to
them they say why are you talking like
this to us no we've grown up now we've
got phds and stop it so I'm right with
you sorry you trying to get yeah I can
I'd be grateful for a little more
clarification really on your view of
variety in its relation to developing
industrial technology because I sent
certain tension on the one hand you seem
to be saying we're escalating complex
industrial society as it
were the time is
itself
producing and the changes that come
about through time in themselves bring
about more complexity and less variety
yet at other times in what you say I
seem to get a perception that you grasp
exactly the opposite I think perhaps
more true which is that as industrial
technology advances we get less and less
variety and more and more uniformity I
mean we've now got 40 different
companies selling hamburgers great and
the the range of foods available gets
less and less we've got a proliferation
of Corporations Building Homes but
they're all stand
par Mor
cown um so it seems to me that there
What's happen if you look at Channel 4 I
I don't expect it to be any better any
more varied than channels one to three
so seems to me we're getting this
uniformity but then on the other hand
your attitude to variety itself puzzles
me because you talk as though variety is
a goal in and of itself sometimes you
talk as though variety is a means to an
end I mean you recognize that there are
some possible Futures which might
be not entirely nonviable but would be
extremely undesirable yes fascism
brutalism barbarism is a might be a
possible viable future but a holy
undesirable one so it's not as if
surely we want variety for its own
sake uh and it's not as if we want only
certain kinds of possible Futures you're
talking about the will of the people so
presumably want that kind of future in
which people can genuinely exercise
their own wills and have control over
their own lives choice is the word okay
but now it may well be that escalating
Industrial Technologies and going in the
direction of reducing choice but okay
then okay and just can you clarify the
relationship between variety and
Technical change and is variety or
Choice a goal in itself frankly I think
you're doing marvelously yourself I mean
this is just what I asked you to do I'm
not try to duck anything here I mean I
said please grapple with this stuff and
this is the very point the human
potential does have this
variety thing to do so if you're bark
you can snatch that stuff out of the air
and play it for us now that's a use of
variety but if you're if you're taught
that uh that you can only have one kind
of music for ideological reasons then
you can't be bar now this whole business
I'm suggesting of the design of social
systems and the way we can perhaps or
not influence them is is what I call
Variety
engineering that's what we're talking
about and I think and you have just made
it abundantly clear that that's what
we're talking
about because everything you do will
either will either amplify or uh
attenuate
variety now all the designs of systems
that I get into and I I hope that this
will become clearer by the end of the
evening but I'm very happy that you are
pushing it to the four because I think
we can make it clearer during the course
of the
evening all of
this is on is built on the analysis of
how variety absorbs
variety and and you give me the chance
to say that
now because what really happens is that
if let's let's look for a few examples
of this
you sorry I go straight to Shannon
because why
not why go to well you go to Shannon if
you
want well communicate you have to
explain it to to communicate an idea you
have to have an adequate uh variety
handling capability um simply that
therefore to understand an
idea communicate sorry you don't to to
communicate an idea you have to have an
adequate variety handling appar
I wouldn't describe a five State machine
to you in over a period of 100 years I
have a Channel with less variety
handling capability than if I want to
describe a five State machine to you
over a period of two minutes you need
lots of words to say something
complex you see you can explain that
this this conversation everybody else
please know
exactly exemplifying what I said right
you need variety to absorb variety he's
come through with a forgive me Nick but
you put your head on The Chopping Block
he's come through with a whole Basin
full of variety which is shove thrown at
this guy like a bucket of water who says
ow you know I'm drenched now this is
because there's too much variety and too
little absorbing capacity of that remark
now what what do you do in a
conversation you do exactly what what
our friend here just did and say h bit
fell I mean that I don't know what
you're talking about this forces him to
redefine the terms now notice what will
happen by the time these two two chaps
have simed down over a beer and
understood each other they will both
have the same variety that's the
lesson because he will have explained
something of certain complexity which he
will have taken on board with a certain
equivalent complexity whether they agree
or disagree I don't care what I saying
is that they will understand each other
only when there is and the word is there
so you
want well now let me answer that by
saying I don't want it but it is I
believe the law of
nature that systems do not settle down
until the variety is
equivalent so it's a bit like water
finding its own level variety Finds Its
Own level because you cannot live with
it if it doesn't now all this is coming
out of the conversation as I hoped it
would just please try and tie in what's
going on now with with my opening
remarks see the reason we squeeze down
variety of the human potential is we
can't handle
it it becomes too much for us so we say
don't tell me anymore you know there's a
poster in everybody's office saying you
have just told me more than I wish to
hear this is very very
real function of neurosis is essentially
healthy you balance yeah undoubtedly yes
just as the function of psychosis is to
is if that's your model that's how you
behave s
tracking what worries me is that
uh only because I'm sure I don't quite
understand something it's that um that
you you described uh the Doomsday
scenario I think very acly and I agree
with you uh and that raises very very
shortterm questions about what we the
people if if you will are going to do
about it and it seems to me that even in
your diagram uh the the explicit Doom
that you talked about is linked up with
the organizational system right that you
began to talk about which in in one
sense indeed suffocates variety
yet it seems to me that if we're going
to in the short period of time we
perhaps have left to do anything about
that organizational system as people uh
it's going to require an enormous amount
of organization on our own part that's
right and consequently in part it's
going to require an enormous amount of
uh
constriction of our variety perhaps from
a different
perspective and uh it's that tension
that really puzzles me right um it's
very
puzzling okay we'll get on to this Loop
you I mean that's a beautiful
introduction to going straight on but uh
perhaps other people want to say more or
should we go on because I really like to
get through this be you know I don't
want the evening to stop with us having
got not reconnected sorry do you want to
speak at the back there yeah back
to um the the idea so can you speak up
yeah the impression I got was that you
you'd uh put over the idea that a lot of
problems started with the um rise of
Technology um and that this this started
the destaing of the system but uh hasn't
really the system from the year D being
in an unstable situation and that there
is actually no stable reference point
which we can look
at no I think it may be true to say it's
un stable but not as damn unstable as
all this is what I'm saying you see
because as someone pointed out just now
and I think they were right um the
tradition of the family for example has
been a very stable reference point
throughout a lot of uh
civilization and not at other times I
mean you need the social anthropologists
in on this
one that keeps recurring as a stable
thing but technolog is not that in fact
the pillar's not that that's
technology the family is live and well
it's doing really
well different sort of family I me no
the traditional family is it yes I mean
you know Dolly Parton sings about DV or
rsaa and everyone knows really that
she's singing the Praises of the family
and everybody's buying her records and
agreeing with her well you know look
see the American I've been involved with
this recently with the with the United
States now the United States Define the
nuclear family as a mother and father
and 2.3 children or whatever you know
where the the man is the bread
winner now that was the stable family
for thousands of years so we've got to
Define our term about
150 well that's why I said we need the
social anthropology C in our in our
uh in in our kind of civilization it's
about 150 but uh what are you going to
make of the whole of the Jewish
tradition for 3,000 years what are you
going to make of Indian tradition for
5,000 years so just in here what what's
so great about stability anyway I mean
this is well let's finish this that's
another issue I I want to deal with one
thing at a time or we get absolutely
lost look the the stable family as thus
defined and this is what you were
challenging mhm uh is now 11% of the
United States now that's not very
high yeah okay the rest is different so
we are dealing with something which is
which is much more fluid than that kind
of stability so now we come to your
point what's the thing about stability
the thing about stability is you've got
to have just enough to produce the
reference points that you
need in order not to blow apart
you're talking about social order I am
but you're not you're not addressing the
question of what kind of social order no
well that's that's fig two as I keep
saying I'm sorry about that but we are
forced to proceed in some kind of order
when you
said but when you said earlier that you
were talking about having not too much
variety and not too little and that was
the important question surely the more
important question is is what kind of
social order of course the point is that
you don't even get around to being able
to ask that question until you've got
some kind of quiet no you don't I mean
you're just you're just fighting or lost
or just struggling as most of the world
is to feed itself the trouble with that
way of putting it is that saying you you
you'll get a conception of some goal you
wish to reach but you won't get to it
from
here because you're saying we've got to
get from here into some other impossible
situation before we can get from there
to where you want to go and
well I want you to think about this and
you are thinking about it okay I have to
I have to be content with that until
we've got a bit
further I'm a bit I'm a bit confused now
forgive me but we started out suggesting
that variety is
squeezed um and our problem is that
people are not allowed to flower you
know the thousand flowers aren't allowed
to bloom all those flowers of variety we
now seem to have come full ccum and said
that our problem is in fact that there's
too much variety I mean the food thing
forgive me but the very fact that we can
have 20 different kinds of hamburgers
compared to 20 years ago which I
remember when you could only get one
kind of food if you went out for a m an
eing is actually most remarkable um
variety they're all the same they not
all the same you can now eat Indian you
can eat Chinese you can eat Italian you
can Spanish or you can eat Mexicano all
of which were not possible 20 years ago
you can now have virtually any kind of
food in the world in this town not
outside it we do have variety but that
seems to detract from stability if the
suggestion is that what we are looking
for is a balance between the rebel and
the reactionary the creative and the
conservative and that somewhere in that
balance Health lies that's that's
another matter it is another matter but
that is the matter surely between the
conservative and the radical essentially
the mod Stu well it may well be but the
the nothing will all you see those those
are judgmental words nothing will alter
the sort of basic physical fact that
until you have requisite
variety you don't have regul you don't
have regulatory
Powers that's the real
point because always and a on the extra
the higher variety unit will swamp the
understanding and the ability to react
with the lower variety unit is that
meaning too is not the meaning of Doom
judgment no not in my book but what I I
mean it is in another
discourse what I find very difficult to
comprehend is that you disregard or
throw aside all forms of labeling which
you say is no good you then propound a a
theory which is has a unity all of its
own which as far as I can see is yet
another form of L
and say but we must look at this which
you then Define in verbal terms as
varieties now I could take exactly that
and redefine it in a totally different
form yes you agre and we will be talking
about the same things with different
words but coming to possibly similar uh
conclusion in a different structural way
and this is where I find that I'm
getting totally confused by this
arbitrary use of the word variety and
the rejection of all other systems of an
well let's uh let's try and cool that I
I do accept what you're saying what I
set up what I said at the beginning was
that let us let us agree for the
purposes of this thing to to develop
another language now of course it's a
language and of course it's own to those
objections if the mere attempt to
communicate always does this and this
you know just hold each other's hands
and look in each other each other's eyes
and hope that there some kind of Osmosis
goes on we have to use language now this
is a language I use now the the
definition of variety is not arbitrary
in cybernetics well it is if
yes it's not just something I've thrown
at you it is a technical term in
cybernetics and it means the number of
possible states of the system now that
is a calculus which we have not been
invited pre pre previously to to invoke
or imagine we usually C count heads or
we or we count Dustbin Lids or we
measure things by money and that's the
outstanding one I asking you to to try
the experiment of thinking about it in
terms of variety now it's clear to me
that you accepted the invitation because
that's why you feel confused and that's
great I mean if if you end the evening
feel feeling totally confused that would
be a Pity but you are showing symptoms
of wrestling with this thing which is
just what I begged you to do
uh I hate to say this but aren't we
confusing a system and a meta system and
that what you're really falling back on
all the time is saying we want a system
which will allow everybody's opinion to
be consulted and certainly A system that
takes into account every possible factor
that can be in interaction with
everything else so rather than say what
sort of in answer to the lady's question
what sort of system you're talking about
you're not yet on to talking about the
system you're on to talking of you're
talking about setting up the means
whereby we can discover what system we
want as here or whereby in some more
mechanical way once all the elements are
connected up they will automatically and
definitively interact in such a way that
there are no more sort of informational
Barbarian hordes who will sort of sweep
in and upset the civilization in the Box
my reading of what fair
enough can I just check that than we're
at now which is would it be fair to say
this little little exchange we had
before between Nick and Eric where Nick
was overwhelming Eric with variety and
he said enough of that supposing the the
variety was balanced and at that point
there was an there was an understanding
between the two but the understanding
led to the fact that they decided they
hated each other in fact wanted to kill
each
other so there's no I mean at least the
ri was balanced they knew at least where
they stood now we know now we have to
enter on to the next phase of the
discussion and how to handle that
situation so that the thing doesn't blow
apart sure well that's figure two do you
want to go on
to all
right
one yes well it look if we look at
figure one just for a
minute what I'm saying here on the right
hand side top right of the diagram is
that this the the system that is the the
whole
world gives rise to something that I
choose to call the viable
system uh as distinct from nonviable
systems which you see I Earth there they
they they blow up they don't
work now I have spent my life basically
on trying to find out the
characteristics of the viable system I
set out
explicitly to try and do to try and find
out what were the characteristics of a
viable system about 30 years ago and now
I have written uh the books definitively
saying you see what what the viable
system is until someone comes along and
overthrows
that now I would like to tell you in
very brief obviously in very brief that
the the main books the two of them are
500 pages each talking about this so we
we've got
to cool it haven't we
um I would like to tell you very very
briefly what I have found to be and what
I contend are the necessary and
sufficient conditions of a viable
system and the language I'm using is the
language of variety you see which is why
I had to introduce that now if you look
at the second
diagram
you will find numbers one to five lying
about there and that is a contention
that there are five necessarily and
sufficiently five subsystems in a viable
system now I I would like you to know
that I started this work through the
human nervous system because it seemed
to me that that was a very good example
of a varal system varal by the way I
just used the different dictionary
definition of that which is capable of
an independent existence so this is
really a medical term the fetus is
viable be sometime before birth that is
the point where it can sustain its own
life if it is separated from from the
mother and please notice we in a very
difficult area here because people often
say to me
well uh your viable system wouldn't uh
wouldn't last if there were no oxygen
well true you know one has to nothing is
ever contrary to
liet's
monadology nothing is ever in biological
terms at any rate a a a uh totally
isolated system so when we say it's
capable of independent existence we are
we are making some kind of uh gesture to
to the environment in which it is
expected to be
varal I admit that that is a difficult
one but you should know it so I say I
started with the human nervous system
and then I developed all this in
management and a lot of colleagues have
developed it and it's been tried on
cells on B colonies and all sorts of
things it seems to it seems to have so
far this this notion that these five
subsystems are necessary and sufficient
seems to work so I would like to tell
you very briefly what they are so you
can see the diagram because this is
building up to I think a very crucial
point about the solution of the mess
that I have deliberately tried to create
in the room so
far system
one
is the the big the two big circles are
system
one complete with a square box to which
the circles are
connected through a
triangle and what we have here is that
the circle is an operation of the total
system and the square is it is the
management of that
operation and it is connected the circle
which is the operation is connected to
an external environment which is the
sort of MBA shaped object on the left
hand
side and as you see there too system
ones
depicted that is two square boxes with
accompanying circles and comping
environments
now these are the elements of a violence
system in the body they are major organs
in Industry they are subsidiary
companies or plants something of that
kind in a bee Colony there are bees in a
so in a social Community there are
people uh inside the body they may be
cells this is a very versatile
description and it is is using variety
as its
measure now the environment throws up a
whole lot of variety which the operation
has to handle and that is done not on a
line as shown in the diagram but on a
loop which I will just draw
here which says here is the operation
and here is the environment and there is
a loop that connects
them now
now this is at once something that we
can begin to talk about with a lot of
ferocious scientific
accuracy if we are prepared Madam to use
the notion of
variety see it is typical of an
operation that its variety is lower than
the environment in which it
operates now if the law of requisite
variety says this thing will only
stabilize itself if the variety is the
same
and it does and it would take a long
time to prove this to you but I'm asking
you to come with me now on this this
tour then it is obvious isn't it that
the variety of this has to be Amplified
and that's the ordinary electrical
engineers symbol for an
amplifier in order to make its variety
larger to cope with the with the
world and this variety or this variety
and that's the ordinary symbol for an
attenuator must be
reduced or both some
mix now let's let's just try and take
that on board I mean if you look at this
this room right now you find me with the
low variety and you with the high
variety because we are all human beings
you probably you're 50 times my variety
you could easily swamp me if you all
just started talking I could not proceed
I me if you if you uh assaulted me even
more I couldn't proceed but you you only
have to talk to stop me so what is going
on here I am amplifying my variety by
exerting some kind of presence in the
room by shouting I'm not talking in a
normal conversational voice I'm
commanding attention these are all
amplifiers You by convention are
attenuating your by sitting quietly and
listening you are not playing poker over
there and writing poetry over here and
having a little sing song over here you
see how the thing equ comes down to a
stability now this thing is a
homeostat it is the thing in nature
which balances variety it is the thing
that makes you have a temperature which
is within your physiological limits to
to sustain even though the room is
getting hotter or CER or
whatever these this is the basic device
which operates the law of requisite
Variety in the world as I see
it so we ought to have that kind of loop
gen connecting the circle to the
environment and connecting the square to
the circle because the management of the
operation always has less variety than
the
operation so we've got three things in a
row
and in fact they're not in a row I've
pulled them apart to make them obvious
we have some kind of environment with a
squiggly Edge and in that is embedded an
operation and in that is embedded the
management and the management of the
operation is trying to make the
operation work inside of environment in
which the varieties are getting larger
as you go out now that's what is on that
chart there except that it's pulled
apart and I put it to you that if you
you try that out on any anything you
like you will find that's
working and you will find that those
attenuators and amplifiers are in
place they are the things that do the
squeezing we were talking about in the
scenario we first
examine so if the government doesn't
like what you get up to as Citizens it
passes laws and those laws are
attenuators of your variey so you cannot
go around smoking cannab
is or whatever it
is they try to to uh to reduce your
variety to something that is handleable
by the social system at
large now sometimes it's done by laws
sometimes it's done by conventions and
it's done in all sorts of ways and the
will of the people is what is the will
of the people and you see this is where
Eric got in first but now we're getting
round to it is the will of the people
to have its variety attenuated in order
to have a fairly calm
situation or
not and if the government begins to say
look here you you reduce your variety
down here somewhere then the people will
start saying this is too much we're
going to have a
revolution now this is how the varieties
boil and bubble in soet society and you
can see it without all that political
overtone in if you look at a a
straightforward marketing situation you
you got a you got uh amplifiers which is
called advertising and you know to a to
the
nearest
th000 how much you can increase your
market share it's that clear you know
which I find a rather dismal thing but
it's it's the case that by amplifying
the variety which in this case is the
the adequacy of your product to operate
in that
environment you now persuade people that
this is true even when it
isn't so you say here are here is a
cereal for breakfast and this will do
you good I know a nutritionist who said
you would be better off eating the
packet try it out anyway you you you no
not eating the package
be
reasonable uh try this idea out and you
especially you please lady because you
will now begin to see what the value of
this kind of measure is it's only a
measure like another number of others
you were quite right but I am suggesting
to you that you will find this useful
and you put that in any situation and
you will find those amplifiers and
attenuators working now what's the value
of that the value of that is that it
immed medely increases your options to
the point of saying well perhaps we
should use another amplifier or
attenuator which may be less expensive
if you're an entrepreneur which may be
more freedom invoking if you're a
politician which may be more pleasurable
if you're a hedonist Etc you know any of
these
things so that's system one that's what
we find is going on at the elemental
level of the viable system and the
Staggering thing is that all those those
elements hold it are themselves viable
systems according to my theory of the
viable system and that is why you will
find
inside uh that
drawing a replication of itself do you
see it there in the thin
lines now in the full logic of this uh
demonstration of what is the nature of
viability
I have shown that these two things are
exactly
equivalent now if you see on the map the
there are three things I wanted to tell
you about my treatment of the viable
system one is that there are five
subsystems and we're working on that and
the second is the notion of recursion
and the notion of recursion says that
all viable systems contain viable
systems which are structured structured
by an identical cybernetic logic and
cybernetic here you could read
regulatory
logic now can I tell you in Brackets
because I don't want this to get too
theoretical I went to work in Chile for
president
yende and put all this into action for
the whole of the Chilean social economy
now I'd previously done it all over the
place in individual firms and in quite
large organizations and institutions of
various kinds but you know this is a
whole country and this was quite like
something now a lot of people have said
and you will not be among
them that it was impossible in two years
to link the whole of Chile together with
computers and microwave links and to run
an economy in real
time but I did it and the secret was
that there were 12 recursions which were
all the same things embedded in each
other which means that if you write a
very very intelligent thinking type
computer program you don't have to do it
in this room and it takes you two years
and then you go through the door and you
say well now fellas it's your
turn what are you doing in here and
we'll take another two years which is
how Computer Applications have by and
large being developed in the world and
that's why we're still stuck with
payrolls and nonsenses of that kind
by way of using the most brilliant piece
of equipment that the world has ever
devised the human brain has ever
devised Now by having 12 recursions in
Chile which is to say the national wheel
within which is the social economy
within which are four Ras branches light
heavy materials and consumer divisions
of the economy within each of those
there are various Industries uh textiles
Iron and Steel coal electricity fishing
all those things within those there are
individual companies then there are
individual plants and inside the plants
what do you find you find departments
and in the Departments you find actual
people would you believe who are doing
things now this is a set of recursions
of the viable system now we're beginning
to see how we might approach the issue
of the will of the
people but before we can quite get there
I have to tell you about the other
systems much more
briefly if you have a set of system ones
which are the elements of the system the
plants or the individuals or whatever
level of recursion you're going to play
with and I'd like you to I'd like to
encourage you to feel free about
whatever level you'd like to choose to
think about or think about several of
them the total system is going to be
made up of these elements if each of the
elements is striving to do its own thing
and this is what we call Freedom and
this is what we call
autonomy then how do we know that they
are not going to be mutually
inhibitory now this is where the variety
thing really comes home to roost because
I am going to need all my variety to
manage my element because my operation
is overwhelming me with variety and my
environment is even more overwhelming
with variety so I've got all my work cut
out as an ingenious manager to handle
all of that but meantime
you yes why not
you are doing your element and what is
to say that we will not choose policies
which optimize our performance but are
mutually inimical now that is what
happens in
society and if you live in a house and
are trying to learn to play the flute
and someone is has got about 87 DB of
rock and roll in next door you will not
be able to play the flute although both
of you are legitimately pursuing your
own
objective now it is typical of a situ of
a system in that state this is
cybernetic theory that I'm speaking for
a minute that it will go into an
uncontrolled
oscillation as each element tries to
accommodate the other it overshoots do
you see what I mean and it begins to
oscillate
rattle that is the reason for system 2
and you see there that set of
triangles which is damping
oscillation that's its
function so now we have an organism
which has Elements which can operate in
the outside world and are now
how cohering in the sense that they are
not oscillating but is that
enough wouldn't it perhaps be better if
by some overview of all the elements of
the system we could
see how the total system would behave
more to our
advantage now that's begging the
question of what is the advantage it's
begging the question of what is the
purpose of the system and this is where
all the political and religious and
economic and ideological things go
bzang this is where the pirate eics come
from I
think just how much autonomy is system 3
going to allow system
one now this is this is the guts of our
problem with the will of the people I
think let me put it to you in the form
which I so often say it in consult ancy
I go into a firm at the top it's easier
to take a firm because its purposes are
pretty
evident they are of course they have a
load of fun under the constraint of
making a
profit which is something the CBI
doesn't seem to understand right
now
um the people at the top of this firm I
go and see them and they say well we
have taken on board all the teachings of
Behavioral science we know we shouldn't
go around bullying people we are in
practice of uh giving Authority
decentralizing uh practicing autonomy on
behalf of our component
parts indeed we don't really know what
we are doing any longer
because nobody ever asks Our advice and
we stop giving
orders now this is you know I of course
I'm cartooning a bit here car
I'm exaggerating but not much you then
go to one of the Departments or one of
the sub subsidiary companies in the same
firm and everybody's looking at the
papers trying to find a job and you say
what's going on here and they say well
between ourselves this bloody company
you can't do a thing we want records of
everything we spend our lives filling in
forms and so
on now how come it's the same place
we're talking about
and there is the downward perception and
the upward perception are quite quite
different why because the treatment of
the variety is
misperceived and what looks to the
bosses as
a calming of variety which is going to
make life easier for the elements of the
system is perceived by the elements of
the system as a gross interference with
individual
liberty now I put that to you as a
company but isn't that also true in
society isn't it even true in the family
we've just agreed doesn't
exist so the will of the people we
somehow bound up with with that
equation now I personally think that
that has to do with the purposes of the
system let us look at it this way if we
made a a agreement in here to uh
assassinate
somebody and you are going to you can
you make a bomb you you make the bomb
and you will be in charge of the the
transport and so on and so
on now we have now created a varble
system to do a particular job wherein it
is clear that in the green to be a
system we uh abandon our rights to
autonomy because if you're not on the
right corner at exactly the right minute
he's going to get caught with his
trousers down and we shallan succeed so
so in that sort of determined
case you can show that the variety will
be totally let's say totally almost
totally I mean we won't perhaps
prescribe what pair of shoes you're
going to wear but
mostly you've you've had your variety
delimited for you if however in instead
of doing anything so stupid as that we
decided on an equally stupid notion that
we would found a Society tonight for
loving
people then we could afford to have the
Only Rule would be that you would be
thrown out as an element of this system
if C hating
somebody because there are many ways of
showing love and you could go around
doing that and that would be within the
purpose of the system so it seems to me
clear from such examples that the
equation between system and system one
where indeed we have a requisite variety
hom that on our
hand the amplifiers and the attenuators
in that Loop will be determined by the
purpose of the
system so if you really want a democracy
you will have to decentralize and you
will have to to uh devolve
autonomy and we don't do it we just talk
about democracy could you illustrate
this from
you said about the firm the sort of firm
where you said at the top they think
they have devolve it but it doesn't seem
like it uh are you saying that they
haven't really devolved it or they have
who's wrong in this
misperception yes fair point I I think
they're both wrong you see usually but
you can see how the misperception comes
about and it really is very
extraordinary that so you know so much
of the culture uh so much of energy in
the system is used to up fight in this
absurd
battle
um what exactly did you say it was on
the the people at lower D who the bosses
think have been given Freedom
experiences as having to fill up lots of
forms so presumably this is some sort of
feedback requirement which in uh an
organization with objectives that you
would want to further it wouldn't be
asked of people well the thing begins
with a perversion of language you see if
you must not
tell your departmental managers or your
subsidiary
companies things which they are supposed
to be free to decide for themselves what
you do is you have a
policy so you have a motorc car policy
and that says this man is this height
this age these qualifications wear
spectacles he can have a
Cortina so his freedom to choose a car
is gone
but that's just a policy you see
guidelines you suddenly find its set of
rules and regulations that's that's the
sort of thing that in in practice
happens you just set up some factors and
allow people to draw the conclusion and
there's never more than one conclusion
that's the sort of thing I mean you know
Ford's famous DIC to any color you like
as long as it's black and it isn't as
obvious as that obviously now if you
look at my diagram there are in fact six
vertical lines L which will absorb
variety the first of them is is the
connectivity of the environments running
vertically up the page the second is the
Thing Mark three star which I haven't
talked about the third is system 2 which
I mentioned is anti
illat and so on now once you show an
organization that it doesn't have to use
that Central axis of command then you
can overcome this problem that's the
practicality of
it now where do you get to with
government see it's extremely difficult
to know with government you know what
your legislator is doing you've got huge
lags on all this stuff
too well I shall continue because
because we'll be here all night 321 in
this diagram says well that is how we
run things right here and now and
immediately handle our situations inside
the
organism and this being so we absolutely
need a system
for which is concerned not with the
inside and now but with the outside and
then as I put it it it's concerned with
long range things and with looking
outside the organism rather than with
simply
reacting and you see those two damr
heavy arrows there they depict the the
the homeostat of
34 they show how those two things of the
investment of effort and care and
attention and time as well as money has
to be balanced between three and four if
the variety situation is going to work
and the organism is not going to tear
around in circles under the influence of
three or going to a stuper of long range
stargazing under the influence of four
so I think you can see how the variety
match has to be operable there and you
could account for the collapse of
everything from Rolls-Royce to the to
the
nation by considering how variety is
absorbed there and whether the
amplifiers and attenuators work
now I hope some of that is stuck I hope
only that you see the sort of thing this
is because I'm now coming to the central
point of the evening as far as I'm
concerned which is what is system
five now according to the logic I've
been presenting to you if you have an
organism which is in high trouble in
getting the 34 homeostat to work which
is to say getting a balance between the
inside uproar and the outside uproar
then you are going to need a system to
monitor it which is system
five in the the neurophysiological model
this is a this is the cortex or it's the
top management or whatever you see I'm
deliberately fudging this because I'm
trying to tell you what happened to me
when I explained all this to salvadori
ending I had a piece of paper just like
this on the table between us and spent
hours going through all this because
absolutely vitally understood
it and I drew in system five with a view
to saying so know where does the buck
stop compo Presidente it's you you see I
was going to say in my
ignorance but before I could say it
fortunately I spent some time putting in
the big five you know
historyonics he L back and he
said ah El
preo now this is one of the most
exciting things that ever happened to me
and obviously it communicates to a lot
of you here the the people the will of
the people of course
see now
somehow that has to be the will of the
people and in a democracy we do it by
electing a crowd of jnes from whom you
know none of whom we particularly fancy
but we say well you have to embody our
will in tyranis is somebody comes along
and says well I I'll embody your will
for
you but you can see it's the same thing
with a different sign on it because what
we are doing here in terms of pure logic
my friends and I do want to you to see
this because it's astonishingly
important we are administering closure
to the
system we have spread about a system
here and now we are logically closing it
and we are saying that's it there
couldn't be a system SE
because that's where it all comes to a a
stop if you want to go to something
bigger than that you have gone you are
going to go to the next recursion in
which this is embedded
huh but for the time being
that is the
closure Now quickly look at that in
terms of your own body we are no longer
just looking at the cortex we are
suddenly discovering something that has
bothered philosophers for for 2 or 3
thousand years which is the question of
the nature of
selfhood the notion of identity the the
idea of
self-consciousness it is
closure now that's just to label it so
that won't satisfy a philosopher but
nonetheless it's a way into starting to
think about it in rather different terms
and I would be very happy to give a
mathematical philosopher here a notion
of how we may be able to push on that
inquiry but not for for tonight and the
whole
audience this I think is is the
secret now if the closure
involves determining the way in which
variety is going to be manipulated then
this
is the problem of how to change anything
at
all because the all the varieties in
this system have got to be determined in
the act of closure
because it says this is the kind of
system we actually are and none
other and therefore anybody who says
anything differently is um a parasite or
is a virus in the system is it attacking
it stop
it now very
totalitarian what
does well any anybody in the system who
doesn't recognize the that
closing definition is a parasite or a
virus this is excuse me I'm not offering
this as a suggestion I'm saying that's
what happens and this is why we're in
the mess we're in see it is totalitarian
so although people are saying to us in
Britain well you can vote for somebody
else at the next election it's not going
to touch
it and if I come along and say well what
we really got to do is change the
structure of government in order to make
the variety engineering
different ah now you can't do
that I don't want to be destructive but
you explain the system quite nicely up
to a five and then you say what we want
in there is the will of the people and
it seems to me you then it's a sort of
infinite recursion you need another
system to explain how the people's will
is formulated and fed in at level five
rather than not through the system well
not necessarily why shouldn't it come up
through the system and what do you think
that do line is
for sorry you you led me the the way in
which the the contributions can forward
your own
AR you see the thing is May I just
reiterate this I'm not trying to give
you a the I'm not trying to give you a
prescription and I'm not trying to voice
views on you I'm trying to tell you how
I think viable systems work and what
light this throws on the problems we've
got
H now let me go back to compo
yendi he found his second chamber
corrupt which is not as bad as finding
it idiotic like
ours at any rate he
uh it's not Lord Eric
is it's just that our is idiotic and
corrupt see
it and uh again said to me look
uh I would like to replace the second
chamber
with
a I can't think of the word
now an assembly sorry an assembly of the
people and he said you know the day has
pass when when you just you know
everybody turns up and shouts Viva
outside the
palace we've got technology what do you
think about
that well now it so happens that I had
been engaged in in the United States and
in Germany with with the notion of of
how you can use technology in order to
let people know what you what everyone
is thinking now you can do this with a
telephone with a little bit of an
attachment on it and it's beginning to
happen so on the public television
somebody says uh do you prefer product X
or product Y and you your sample at any
rate as it now is goes to the telephone
and presses yes or no and the computer
operates and within seconds the the
whole viewing public says well what you
the current audience think is
this well now I I've got myself into a
very concerned State about that this was
at a time when I was development
director of international publishing
which is the biggest publishing company
in the world and has the the mirror and
then had the sun and the people and all
that stuff and had all the women's
magazines all the technical magazines
books you name it unbelievably large
affair much larger than the general
public realized and I was responsible
for all research and developing
computers and everything else
now you see let me put it to you this
way if you can gain access to people's
in in in sorry instant reactions to
absolutely anything then you can build
profiles of congregations of people
which
which in which those people would be so
vulnerable it's not true can you not see
that because you would understand
everything about how they
react
moreover I was in the I had I think I'm
right and saying four million names and
addresses in in computers as a result of
all these large
shows so see I I know what magazines
you've ordered I know which offers
you've accepted I don't know why you
want a book on the holy man holy land
and also a hardc corn porn magazine but
I've got ideas about
that see I know you've got three
children otherwise you can't get into a
dress this High even if you are hard for
and so on so you've got all this power
see now I began to getc extremely
frightened by this and I went and gave
evidence about all this to the Congress
of the United States I may say who were
who were extremely alarmed by by this
you know this very practical and
immediate and it can all be done
stuff but of course when I YY asked me
this question I thought
oh you see if you can do it in a nasty
way and here am I going around the world
trying to alert people to this
danger then perhaps we can do it in a
nice way
now part of the problem about the nasty
way
is that when it comes to the will of the
people is the following what are you
going to ask
them you say well we've got some
problems here is a nice television
program on a problem do you prefer that
we do this this this or this press the
knob who whoever said these were the
Alternatives go back to square one on my
map if they were reasonable answers we'd
have solved the problem
already the reason we haven't solved the
problem is that this way of carving it
up is not producing
results so we have produced an
exhaustive categorization thereby
reducing variety which we are compelled
to
do but it doesn't
work that's why I tried to demonstrate
all
even moreover if you ask an unted person
even if it even if the classification
system was right which do you
prefer what the what the ordinary person
says is immediately well you know a bit
of this and a bit of that I I'm not
going plung him into that one that's for
sure hence the don't knows you know who
of course are immediately label as
either blind deaf dumb or stupid
and who ought actually be to be given
medals for being honest
however none of this approach is going
to
operate what is a solution to that I'll
try this on you I haven't offered any
solutions tonight I wanted to make you
think about this thing what I said to YY
was the following this is a
computer 10,000 million
elements £33 perhaps running on glucose
at 25
watts nice little computer let's use it
now if you ask an unted person by which
I mean someone of of good intelligence
and there are some you know who can't
read or right as you go around the
world it's no criticism of their
intelligence and what's more their
intelligence hasn't necessarily been got
at by the mechanisms we were talking
about before and you say to them
what do you think of what we're doing
now no categorization nothing but just
that you see you'll soon get a reaction
you say keep at it mate you know you're
doing that's okay it's a hard world or
if you don't shut up you know we'll come
and throw a brick through your window
this is the kind of thing now that is
the meaning of this term
algedonic which you will find on the map
which talks about Pleasure and
Pain and not
rational reductionist
categorization now it is a way in it's a
possibility and I would like you to
think about that
um it sounds very simple you have a
meter with with an orange and blue card
on it that fold into each other right so
you can set this meter to show orange or
to show blue and orange is I'm happy and
blue is I'm not you can sell it and your
brain does the
computation and the fact that nobody has
access to your brain serves them right
and that's how we see
that now it would be possible to have a
National Assembly wouldn't it where
every community was every person in the
limit but every Community was Voting
this
way and one of the very interesting
things about this
thought is that it carries huge
quantities of information both ways
without any
wires uh try and try and imagine this
and I nearly got to this point that if
you see the photographs of the
operations room in Santiago you'll see a
blank wall and that was intended to
carry an algedonic meter you're the
Minister of Economics and you're being
filmed from the operations room that's
running the country and we've done this
don't forget this isn't all stupid
science fiction we had the operations
room we were running a realtime economy
I told Harold Wilson that no that in
Britain as he knows being an economic
statistician economic data are nine
months out of date I told him that in
Chile there were no more than 12 hours
out of
date you know what he
said any he
offers
C he said Charly
good unbelievably English reply
so I mean that's all he
said he didn't say have you told Tony
Ben or
anything
so
so the idea was what I'm asking you to
imagine is this supposing you're the
Minister of Economics you're trying to
explain to the
populace the will of the people you know
you're saying I'm trying good friends to
interpret what you want and this is what
I'm doing so you begin to explain your
taxations plans and every all the things
you're
doing now they've all got algedonic
meters which are summed to an algedonic
meter which is beside you
see so there you are you're doing your
enthusiastic political bit and this
thing is
going now what I meant about complex and
amazing communication flows is the
following of course you need the wires
to to make me to work but that's that's
quite easy you can do that with a
telephone
system the
complicated thing that I want you to try
and hang on
to what would you feel if you were the
Minister of Economics
knowing that this was going down while
you were
talking what would you feel realizing
that not only do you know this but that
they know that you know
this and what about their knowing that
you know that they know that you know
that this is now this is an amazing
piece of logic it's of course it's
infinitely recessive and it's very hard
to hang on to it you try
sometime but it's you know is's very
very rich because your problem of
adjusting to to what that meter is doing
is hugely complicated and a very high
variety
exercise so where I got to in Chile with
that was I was equipping a factory with
it and every every little section of men
were were to have a meter which would
show up in the managing director's
office do you realize that is the first
time in the history of the world that
the boss actually knows what the men
think and
moreover see the men know that the boss
knows that they ET you see so the
experiments with that I'd got all the
best psychologists and anthropologists
and God knows what in Chile onto this
one because you just look at the the
potency of that idea but isn't it
immensely manipulable yes I mean because
You' got a brilliant oror he would
actually know when he was getting
through that's right and he might be
able to adjust things his way on the
other hand of course he could be swamped
by the negative symbols and change his
policy as that's right well you're
getting through it you're doing what I
asked you to do you know grappling with
this I mean this is a high variety
system of a non rative Ros native kind
it is an algedonic system now I would
prefer a philosopher king as well of
course he would yeah and maybe we'll
need them
yet actually back to that because I'm
still
also back to the question I asked
earlier and if you're going to conclude
with this fine but I'm still unclear
about in L of the
urgency that that we all face and the
planet Bas as it were uh how this system
which uh which I can certainly see the
logic of but I I I think uh is is going
to be to put it to put it crudely very
very uh long term in in in in terms of
its uh in terms of the capacity of
actually
putting how is it going to help us Save
the Planet how about say how is it going
to help us Save the Planet because I
still feel that that that what is
required is an enormous degree of
organization and an enormous degree of
central Direction uh as you said we'll
get further into this question would
someone tell me the time I've realized
that
my God does anybody object to
this you're still
(Laughter)
here well now look all
right isn't all this looking at the the
problem from the outside unless you get
the individual to be uh to have the
ripeness the maturity at to uh feedback
you've been cheating looking at diagram
3 Haven you no I that's it is I'm an
education no seriously that's where it
is I'm coming to that if you know I'm
going to have to hurry up look part of
the answer to the speed thing now you
see what I'm talking about and the way
I've tried to do it in this kind of
format is an is it anti- Paradigm thing
it is anti- paradigmatic it is saying
we've got to look at things in a
different way otherwise we'll just be in
America wrote to the New
Scientist and actually said that this
must be a
lie and he also said thank God it's a
lie because we don't want to live in
that kind of
society now this is you know a he was
wrong and that was because his idea of
putting the economy on a computer would
be to create a a nationwide database
involving an 1108 or some giant machine
in every
village which is absurd and that's the
kind of society I don't
want and secondly he's assuming that I
am making some kind of prescription now
although I like what you have been
saying in you being very helpful there's
just one little thing I'd like to to to
Rattle around with you I am not saying
let's do this I'm saying this is what
happens this is my analysis of a viable
system and the reason we can't induce
Quick Change in it is because the
variety is all sewn up by a whole bunch
of filters of this kind that we cannot
break through and the the things we hope
will help us to break through like good
investigative journalism good education
and all those nice things are actually
making it worse because they are
ingraining the
models and they are underwriting the
solutions that don't work and saying
well maybe if we spend a lot of money on
it we'll get solar
energy that's part of the classification
system solar energy yes great let's have
a go at
that but what I'm calling for is
something quite different and I am
saying that I proved that you can do it
if you change the Paradigm now look AI
only lasted three years God bless him
and I was there for this for the second
and
third we had we had 75% of the social
economy on this system when the balloon
end up we had nearly got the algedonic
leaders to work we had nearly got a
model of the the total
economy and what was that telling us
that was telling us that the United
States was going to Dish
us and there was no answer to that so
the third thing that LD used to say to
me that I wanted to tell you was how do
you have a socialistic econ socialist
country in a capitalist
media now that is a fundamental system
point you see because you've got to have
an anabatic shell around you so not for
nothing did the Germans build did the
Russians bu build the burning War it's
exactly the right thing to do they're
very good cyberneticians the
Russians so anyway what I'm saying is
please not no prescription here this is
my attempt to show you how varal system
works and why we are not able we are not
managing to handle it as to the will of
the people I have written in here
Aristotle's World UD demony which is to
a measure of well-being and I would just
like to say this about it that
electronically one can now do
this well-being we have been forced to
measure in terms of money and
goods because that belong to our culture
it's belonged to our political ideology
and and most of all because it's the
only thing we know how to
measure now if you can one
get a a loop of an algedonic kind you
can put a grading even if it's crude
like a number between n n or even better
my analog system with the green with the
orange and blue will produce feedback in
the system which shows whether there is
emony in society which is another kind
of
stability don't we have these measures
now that some extent that the I mean we
have opinion polls which are which are
close but again they're making the
classifications but we also have this
other question aside from actually
saying are we happy with the government
right there are these other um
comparative studies asking people in
different countries are you just just
the question is are you happy or you
think things all right and remarkably
they time and time again the British
seem to be Remar happy in spite of in
spite of everything going on
what what what what other measure would
this be than that well it would be uh it
wouldn't you see wouldn't be open to the
objections of predetermined
categorization and all those things I
was just criticizing and it would be
built in as a learning system you
see the thing you're talking about is
sporadic and uh and very hard to handle
and is just used of course by
politicians to manipulate things this
would be a genuine to create a learning
system in
society but to interpret
results wouldn't that create the same
problems people come along and say we
have a problem with interpreting very
nice see what you want to try and do is
to make the thing self operating there
is a whole branch of SES dealing with
self-organizing systems which would show
how this works let me let me try and
give you a very quick example if
everybody in this room um entered into a
computer Matrix all the names along the
top and all the names down the
side now every element of the Matrix so
formed would represent a connection
between two people in the room and all
such connections would be
represented now what happens now is that
we put 0. five in every one of those
cells and then we set the computer
working and what happens is the user at
the back
address the computer and you say I have
just read Jonathan Shell's book it's
fantastic you must read it now 0 five is
the probability that you will get that
message so half the people in the room
will get that message from
him now they read Jonathan Shell's
book and they address the computer and
they say don't give me any more messages
like that on a scale not to nine s two
whatever
never the ultimate limit or you'll cut
him out of the system your system so you
you you change the probabilities next
time you come you you just you said I've
read that damn book I don't want that
kind of message but books I've read
after all but the next thing he comes
through is with a recipe for kich line
see now you don't like cheese so he's
going down rapidly but on the other hand
he may suddenly come through with
something now this is a very free system
that I'm talking about and something in
which we are not saying this is a system
for retrieving anything this is not a
system for paying anything it's a system
for using technology for people to
interact and sooner or later if you find
that all your messages are coming true
you two people will decide to meet and
off you go now I'm only using that as an
example of how a system can be
self-organizing because the probability
will change depending on how you behave
and nobody is getting into the system
and saying it's k r this weak
fellas it's it it's just what happens
now you think there 100 people perhaps
in the room that's you know n into n
minus one that's uh that's 10,000
interactions going on on any conceivable
subject look at the Variety my
friends and nobody can stop this
learning even so simple a device as I've
just put forward now this is the sort of
thing that I perceive that we can do now
I of course I could go on for hours
about more intricate things but what I'm
trying to do is break through the
Paradigm to another Paradigm here that's
all I can try to do system you have an
underlying assumption that we understand
what Kish line is or in the case
mentioned earlier of your Minister of
Economics in Chim he would uh State what
he was about to do and he would get a
feedback immediately as to what people
thought about his actions but if he were
to say I'm going to take out a million
pound out of this um system or this
activity to invest it into another
activity right do we understand what he
means what he's doing probably not the
way you well the way you handle that is
you know I have to cut the corners here
I I I was cutting Corners you have the
you have a whole studio full of people
just as you do in this country with some
Chilean in day throwing microphones
around him uh and you get a a discussion
generated now a good chairman will say
look not everybody knows what M3 is you
know would you mind
explaining part what what worries me a
bit is you've had this exciting and
significant experience with a small and
doomed nation and that model may
actually
reduce the paradigms for us
uh because uh well for example your your
exam uh you say if you don't have if you
have a totally hostile environment that
that fetus that newborn baby can survive
without its mother but not if they take
all the oxygen away from it and feed
cyanide at it where whereabouts can one
find the
uh the size the scale in which you can
have a workable model is it perhaps in
in a village that is so isolated in the
third world that uh the CIA won't know
about it until it's actually been shown
that Villages of different casts can
cooperate creatively and form that that
massive number of interactions that you
say is possible in a small community or
are you saying some sort of utopian
Vision which isn't going to save the
planet that says we must change the
whole system
throughout everywhere all at once and
and that's the point where the
philosopher king idea comes in and you
and I am they have to say the way system
5 has got to be run is by the P law and
I decide what's the nasty way and the
nice way and I give me the gun just for
a year and I'll have the solution no no
no no look this is this is far too
important to gloss over I'm not saying
any of that stuff I use the word stuff
just in
time I am not saying anything of the
kind I am trying to to offer you a new
way of looking at this problem
and to to demonstrate to you various
techniques which are available once you
start thinking in those terms and which
I have tried out in various ways now one
of the things I particularly wanted to
say before we left Chile doomed or
otherwise is that if you are going to
avoid technocracy and now I'm building
up to my third chart because we've got
to get this pretty fast by
now
um I'm going to Mexico
tomorrow where were
we
um I do not want you to perceive this as
a technological thing because it's not
you know if you in fenace to me look at
some of the things I was writing 25
years ago do not ask what the computer
will do for us ask how different are we
given that there is a
computer now you know that is the kind
of philosophy so you don't say well
you've all got to have anyon L is what
you say we can do this kind of thing
how's he grab you fellas
you now I mobilized and this is a thing
I very much want to push I mobilize the
people through the artists and the
musicians and the painters and all those
people and I said now let's learn
now once those inputs start going into
the system it's amazing see have you
ever heard of a folklorist who set to
music a song I
wrote called litany for a computer and a
baby about to be
born now that is that's that's true that
was an par who's one of the top Chilean
folk
people this is the way to proceed you
know at least I suspect it is at least
it's something to offer
instead of the miserable bureaucratic
nonsenses we get into now and call is
Consulting the
people see somebody puts out a white
paper and says well now sort that out
how who here has ever actually read a
white Pap
properly one of the things that
I'm I'm still concerned about this
although from a slightly different
perspective I think that if we're going
to sa the plan is going to require a lot
of rational flow and what you've been
saying what you've been saying what you
were saying at the beginning of your
talk was that in in a sense there's a
lot of irrationality going
on uh I can understand why you want to
attack some of the categories that you
want to attack in an over rigid sort of
designation of what can be considered
and what can't be considered but what
what I'm what I'm concerned about is
that I think you're all you're just
about ready to throw the baby uh the
baby out with the B water in the sense
that I can see reason going out the
window as well I mean take the whole
question take the whole question of uh
alternative energy
sources I think there is a
viable uh debate to be had
about and uh I'm really not sure where
where the alic meters come come into the
picture here I mean I'm not really sure
whether or not one can have that viable
debate on the basis of Pleasure and Pain
measurements I mean I think
I don't want to throw the brain out with
a B why don't you use the model of Jame
James you know of the left and right
hand brain just because I'm using my
rightand brain to have a freak out on
the music with an doesn't mean to say I
can't determine that there are 12 rather
than 11 recursions of the viable system
you know we don't have to we don't have
to make those choices we are human
beings I want to restore the human
potential here that's what I'm talking
about danger in bringing the technology
uh techn technological examples in too
much because it seems to be the
tremendous value of this is
understanding that human society is a
system and what and and and the
understanding of those relationships is
gigantically important and gigantically
realistic and gigantically hopeful in
the sense as an
aside uh incidentally uh the problems
that this may raise put those societ
because we have a great resource of
problems which we even can illustrate
from the appalling abuse of human
knowledge which we see all around us
even from that abusive knowledge we can
see some hint of but the actual examples
all often have a very dirty smell about
them I agree look I'm I'm embarrassed by
now about time uh let me have a quick
stab at this last one or or would you
rather go
home um

there are obvious Eastern overtones to
this
diagram Alan Watts wrote a beautiful
sentence where he said if religion is
the Opium of the
people the Hindus have got the inside
dope I very much agree with that hence
my cracks at my learned scientific
friends in India just now earlier there
are three components to this
model there is that big thick ring which
is
selfhood what which is
selfhood now I don't care you see I've
said enough about recursions tonight to
I hope you feel fairly free with what is
a real big paradigm
shift I don't care whether you want to
use this model as yourself or of a
community or of a Nation or of the
entire world what I'm going to say will
apply to any recursion you
like it is an identity it is a
recognizable identity which is this
circle now I don't know if you can see
instantly you very likely can that it is
a consequence of Ash's law of requisite
variety which we were talking about you
know where the varieties have to
balance is it is a consequence of that
which is known as the Conan Ashley
theorem and is proved mathematically and
all that
jazz that a regulatory system is only as
good as the model it contains and what
has to be
regulated now that's obvious
actually but you know we all behave as
if it weren't
true we think think we know and that's
why we get into the problems like saying
he is not himself I don't understand my
son you know your model's no good of
course you don't understand him it
hasn't enough variety and it's it's all
wrong
anyway
now the regulation of the self must obey
at every level of recursion ashis
theorem look at your physical body why
is my arm not W wobbling around all over
the place because I haven't got a taxi
which is a pathological condition my
nervous system is adequate just about to
to uh to keep me under some sort of
control now that's the con and Ashby
theorem and that is providing that there
is enough of a model of the world in
which my body has to behave inside my
nervous system namely my brain that I
can operate in it I see that is there
and therefore I am able to pick it
up now that applies in society too
because if we understand well enough how
Society works then the Conan asy theorem
says well we must penetrate that with a
quote unquote nervous system namely a an
information
setup which will regulate that piece of
society we are considering in other
words you can't catch criminals if
you're the police unless youve got some
information you can't put out fires if
you have a fire service
now what this says is that the Conant
asby theorem says that inside that self
there is a nervous system with with or
without quotes depending on what you're
dealing
with now what happens outside
that there is another level of
action where we try and get into things
which is this circle with its nice nine
dots on it where we're not quite sure if
our nervous system or our regulatory
system at all at any level of recursion
will actually
work so we say well I think I'll take up
painting and we go FL FL C that's hell
that's terrible I haven't been taught to
paint for God's sake so you see these
lines aren't quite making it but you can
be taught to
paint and if Society can't deliver what
it wants to deliver by way of uh
services to the people in answer to to
the will of the people they will have to
develop adequate models now we don't do
this you see we particularly don't do it
in
economics we don't have adequate
set representations of what the economy
is doing they lack requisite variety so
I'm not arguing you see about whether Dr
blogs or
Professor somebody else's theory is
better I'm just saying none of them have
requisite ver they cannot answer to con
and
ashp
trouble so the first level we can cope
with because we've got it the second
level is where we're stretching out and
could get it and all our policies should
be directed to making these lines
stretch out so that they they can do
what what is within our grasp and then
if you ask me what the next one is well
obviously it is what Aristotle called
intelly and I've put it on the diagram
it is it is the ability to fulfill the
wholeness of the
self now in personal terms this is a
mystical concept if if you will or even
if you won't it is the notion that one
can expand one's oneself to fill a
larger
space and if you were a good Buddhist
you would say the whole
universe because it doesn't matter to a
Buddhist whether he infills the entire
univers or
disappears into a grain of
sand Society wise you've got the same
thing what is a caring Society how far
can we go along the road or do we wish
to go along the road of
behaving in a completely loving
way which I would take to be the
analog so this diagram bless its little
heart you see is meant to do as the
caption says for the discussion of
social cybernetics under these three
Notions that there is a self which has
to preserve its identity and must have
adequate regulatory power that that can
be extended by Learning and Development
and
deliberate regulatory extension and
thirdly that there is something beyond
that which we barely Intuit
it but we do in
it so that's it and if you go back to
the first map then see what I'm really
saying to this gentleman here sorry not
knowing names is awkward um I'm saying
what Yung said that really we can only
make the progression by changing our
person personal selves and if that
doesn't sound like an answer to a planet
Doom too bad but really it is the only
practical thing any one person can do
aren our personal aren't our personal
serves formed to real system soci system
you're treating yourself as some no I'm
not for me I'm I'm treating it as I said
I treat it as a recursion within another
LEL
system you you've got
a you've got part of this diagram which
actually contains the secret about which
you haven't said very much because if
that represents the world and these are
countries or that represents the village
and these are casts
or a country and their Northern Ireland
then their religions isn't it that
triangular job that does the smoothing
out of the oscillations can you tell us
what that actually consists of because
isn't that the thing that's going to do
the trick isn't that the thing that that
prevents one half from Gaining um
everything at the ter of the other well
it ought to be now inside the body it's
the that is quite specifically in my my
work the uh sympathetic nervous
system and in society it's a kind of
it's a kind of regulatory thing which
people accept as not impinging on their
freedom now the best example I know of
this is in a manufacturing company that
would be a production control function
which says look I don't want you to stop
you make making all those things old
chat but the fact is that you won't have
stocking space you see because you're
going to interact with everybody else
and that works very well another nice
example because it shows that it doesn't
really subtract from freedom is a is a
school
timable see where where if you want to
change your lesson well he going to you
know it's going to imp impact on him and
the the timetable is piece of Machinery
which enables you to uh to avoid going
into an uncontrolled oscillation and
having all the pupils trying to get into
one room and all the all the teachers uh
off on the same afternoon see so those
are those are examples now World level
you see I find it impossible to get away
from the UN as as this kind of thing
nowy trusted the UN went and made a most
marvelous speech there and everybody
said by God you're right we can't have
this did nothing so we're very very
imperfect now if you look at the
physiological version of this model if
you have no system four or five and only
have a 321 you've got a reactive crisis
oriented deerc cat is what you've got
pegged down on the table you can keep it
alive you can BR it it Waggles its limbs
in answer and that's where we're at at
the international level and as the
manipulation see I had an altercation
with Mr monar in begging begging about
this in April just before he invaded uh
Lebanon those people are move were
moving so fast that nobody in the United
Nations you know they could be forgiven
for not knowing which country they were
talking about because they kept they
were keep kept getting resolutions to
say stop it you know there were about
six going on at once well now that is
very clever cybernetics again that bean
said to me don't you worry about nuclear
war
Wars will be fast and over before
anybody can say stop it and two two
weeks later who was into
leanon now that actually happened and
and you know that's the clever way to
proceed because then you treat you as as
a deser cat now how we can stop that I
don't know I don't know any of the
answers to this but I have really tried
to lay out some tools in front there
real picture though that says that this
is a model of the brain which is okay
but as a model of the real world I mean
there's a lot of conflict that goes on
in the real world which I don't think is
reflected in this So-Cal vial system
well it is because uh the varieties you
see I haven't had time to go into that
in detail the the varieties generated in
those Loops have all to be matched there
are several hundred Loops implicit in
that diagram all of which have to be
have their conflicts resolved in terms
of
ashis uh requisite variety law
so so it does these conflicts are
reconcilable oh yes you may argue the
conflicts are reconcilable within
certain
situ if they're irreconcilable you've
got a pathological State now I use this
model mainly for Diagnostic purposes and
if I'm Consulting to a company it works
like a charm you see you can you say
after about four days usually you know
what is wrong here is that system 2 is
in too too informal and system four
barely exists and H that doesn't work
system 5's collapsed into system three
bedon what you have to do is the
following well that is that is precisely
to recognize a pathological State my
problem is not to do that which I can do
and I was just doing about the UN the
problem is what what how do you do
anything about
it is is sorry to to go on but is one of
the characteristics of the system too
that in in high archical terms it is
superior to the circles and squares and
therefore it will goes well you see it
mustn't be if it's only antiy like it
should be as neutral as the timetable
but of course the trouble is I was a
production controller once myself in the
steel industry and everybody said who is
this young man telling me what to do you
really got that problem I do agree you
should mention that it's really a device
for handling undecidability perhaps
because that resolves the ethical
dilemma once and for all when you as an
autonomous entity can a longer receip
because your your policy has broken down
then you you are learning seeking
finding help me help me I I don't know
what to do next and you say well there
is a formal structure it's the me system
and you go up a level is that fair yes
see the next level of recursion is
always the meta system of the one below
someone was using that word that's quite
right you um you introduced on top of
this objective model your value system
in simple terms you it nice and nasty
which I approve of as a simple moral
philosophy uh and um the dictator is
nasty the people is nice
uh you you've simply assumed that
um I'm wondering whether perhaps you'd
be willing to suggest that really there
is a natural
algic process going on
whereby when the system is functioning
so badly they have to call in an outside
consultant before the business goes bus
like you equally it it's the the
pressure of the pain I mean that you
don't need a moral ethical system to
tell you that
uh a system which doesn't have feedback
the will of the people is bad it simply
is showing itself within our work now
uh I don't know your your model of of
the consultant called in by big business
or
by may not be the only only model of how
system 5 is
reject well that's
true that's true but um most of the
world is starving and most of the world
is being tortured by the boss
so okay it's a value judgment oh
yeah I think has quite a lot to say
about being and having and all of these
kind of things that you were coming on
to who does Eric ER yes sure he and I
think for anyone that hasn't read one of
his books um say to have or to being or
having on this subject can't really get
the concept of that in a circle perhaps
per that's a nice beginning I've dealt
with it very
fast say may I say if I had an algedonic
meter in front of me now I think it
would be reading about half way and I
wouldn't know how to interpret it unless
I unless I felt that half of our hearts
were that we want to proceed all night
long but the other half was telling us
that uh the other demands on us were
were uh calling us calling us away and
that Stafford uh has and out of uh
concern that uh Stafford has been been
uh leading us through this uh
intellectual Journey for the last 2 and
1/ half hours that really is about as
much much as uh as appropriate for one
one evening so but but yet I would have
a problem in deciphering it so I'm I'm
I'm I'm going to assume that the uh
really what I would have to interpret
that uh the latter was was the case and
that hopefully though some sometime uh
in the in the uh in the in the the not
too distant future there would be some
opportunity to follow up this discussion
in in some way um so that all the uh the
variety that we've uh that we've
developed this evening uh could be
harnessed in a productive way i' I'd
like to thank Stafford very much uh for
for for for having this chat with us and
uh
