the best way to spot an idiot
look for the person who is cruel
let me explain
when we see someone who doesn't look
like us or sound like us or act like us
or Love Like Us or Live Like Us the
first thought that crosses almost
everyone's brain is rooted in either
fear or judgment or both
that's evolution
we survived as a species by being
suspicious of things that we aren't
familiar with
in order to be kind we have to shut down
that animal Instinct and force our brain
to travel a different pathway
empathy and compassion are evolved
states of being they require the mental
capacity
to step past our most Primal urges
this may be a surprising assessment
because somewhere along the way in the
last few years our society has come to
believe that weaponized cruelty is part
of some well-thought-out master plan
cruelty is seen by some as an adroit
cudgel to gain power empathy and
kindness are considered weak
many important people look at the
vulnerable only as rungs on a ladder to
the top
I'm here to tell you that when someone's
path through this world is marked with
acts of Cruelty they have failed the
first test of an advanced Society
they never forced their animal brain to
evolve past its first instinct they
never forged new mental Pathways to
overcome their own instinctual fears and
so their thinking and problem solving
will lack the imagination and creativity
that the kindest people have in spades
over my many years in politics and
business I have found one thing to be
universally true
the kindest person in the room
is often the smartest
