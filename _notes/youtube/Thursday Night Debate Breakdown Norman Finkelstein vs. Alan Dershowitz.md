![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FthzjSvHWIQ)

## Transcript:
foreign

thank you

all right I am joined by uh Matt Whalen
who is a writer and oral historian who's
the person who suggested that we do this
uh debate tonight uh by our live show
producer Jordan who lived in Israel for
14 years and has stuff to uh say about
this uh and by one of our favorite uh
returning guests and uh one of the
people who was in the debate that we're
going to watch after our chat with him
uh Norman Finkelstein how are you doing
guys
doing great thanks for having me
I'm fine thank you
can't complain
can complain you're obviously not Jewish
am I
maybe hola quickly not but you know
this is my one of my favorite public
intellectuals against one of my least
favorite public intellectuals on my
favorite podcast so
appreciate that uh so so uh so Norm uh
you want to uh
um I haven't impugn Jordan's jewishness
you want to uh you want to give us some
uh some background on uh on this debate
this is happening in uh 2003 on
Democracy Now
well
I'll try to be brief because obviously
any topic you ask and I can go on
through eternity and but that would then
preempt the actual debate uh when I
originally picked up the book uh the
Case for Israel I didn't attach any
significance to it it just seemed to be
pretty uh
pretty simple-minded and
preaching to the choir
but I did notice something at the very
beginning which kind of amused me and
what I noticed was that he was because I
know the book from time immemorial like
the back of my hand that was published
in 1984 and the book was a hoax and I'm
widely credited with having exposed that
hoax it was a major national bestseller
uh very influential for a period of time
and I basically took it apart and
demonstrated that from many different
angles the book was complete nonsense
and when I picked up uh Alan
dershowitz's book the Case for Israel I
couldn't help but notice that at least
in the initial chapters
uh large sections were simply lifted
from that hoax from time and Memorial
and that to me was was kind of amusing
but beyond being amused by it uh I
didn't attach much importance to it
um but then the books start to gain a
lot of momentum and it became
influential I think it was on the top of
the New York Times bestseller list or
near the top of the New York Times
bestseller list and it was being widely
distributed on college campuses the
campus hallels were buying it up in
large numbers and I think at the time my
memory is I could be mistaken they were
being given away free
and so at that point I realized that
there is
um there is a political
task to be completed namely exposing
this rather silly little book
uh and then I I knew Amy Goodman and I
suggested to her that she'd do a program
uh she contacted Alan dershowitz and he
agreed to be on the program though I
think he was hoping he would be debating
either Professor Noam Chomsky or
Professor Edward Syed
I was what you might call a very low
third
in that ranking
but it was me that he debated
and then he had a second problem
which is not to take away anything from
Professor Chomsky far far be it for me
to do so or Professor Saeed but I am
very conscientious I do my homework and
I do my homework again
which is to say I read the book once I
read the book twice and I felt confident
that I would be able to Prevail in the
court of public opinion in an exchange
with him
now I'm going to just say two more
things uh so as not to belabor my
presence
number one
many people said afterwards
what did you expect would happen namely
after the debate he went after me with a
Vengeance
um as Professor Chomsky put it he went
on the Jihad to try to destroy me
professionally
and a lot of people basically said
I got what was
to be expected would be coming to me
and I would want to respond to that
by saying and I think I could say this
with complete
uh skirt tattoo
I'm not engaging now in some sort of
uh exculpation or cover-up
I honestly believe
that it was going to be a Tit for Tat at
the scholarly level
I would level my claim he would level
his claim he would go back and forth I
did not anticipate
that it would degenerate into a
um
ajihad to destroy me professionally
so I don't think it's fair to hold it
against me that somehow I am feigning
innocence and I didn't know what I was
getting into when I publicly
um claim that large parts of the book
were in various forms fraudulent
um there was a second point I wanted to
make maybe he'll come back to me in a
moment it seems pretty strange like uh
you know to think that doing a debate uh
where you you know Quest like
question the originality of the book and
that seems like the sort of thing that
it's like what you know what I would
expect to be coming as a result of that
is maybe later he writes an article
where he tries to clear his name and
he's really vicious or something like
that right that would be the sort of
thing I would expect you know I wouldn't
I wouldn't expect I mean I think nobody
really at the normal course of things
certainly had most issues would expect
that that would lead to an attempt to
destroy some of his academic career
yes I
I honestly did not that I'm in any way
truthful about what I did but a very
close friend of mine in high school she
since passed away uh she was featured in
a documentary film on my life
now I never actually watched the film
it's called American radical for some
reason I just couldn't summon the inner
wear with all to watch it but many
people told me afterwards that this
friend of mine from high school she
eventually moved to Israel and lived
there for the past 30 years until she
Premed Charlie passed away her name is
Maxine and she says in the movie in the
kind of indignation what did he expect
to think would happen what did he expect
would happen
and actually maybe I was naive but I
expected that we were going to have a
real tit for that points Counterpoint it
would be a vigorous exchange because I
was confident in the end I would prevail
uh so that's what I expected
and uh
okay
so I think that's the background there
was one other point but it'll come to me
just
oh you're muted I think
uh okay what are you what were you
saying in any case oh uh well just as a
side note that documentary is quite
moving I thought
um but yeah just uh
I was I just had a question for Norm if
that's all right uh I was wondering if
uh
you had published anything before this
debate if dershowitz had any awareness
going into it of what uh your findings
were or what you'd or what you were no
no
the last footnote the date in the book
if you look at the footnote excuse me
the end notes in his book the Case for
Israel
the last date was I think June 13th or
June 15th 2003.
we did the debate in September
which means at Max three months elapsed
from the point that he the manuscript
was submitted and we did the debate now
that's important for a certain reason
the reason is some people claim well he
forgot some things he had written in the
book that happens the authors do forget
and that's true I am perfectly willing
to acknowledge that that sometimes I'm
surprised oh I said that in the book I
forgot
but this was just a three-month elapse
between when the book was submitted and
when we met so the excuse of the author
having forgotten
I don't find very credible in this case
now I want to make another Point these
are all my new points where they
actually add up and trying to understand
what happened
publishing has radically changed in the
last 20 years
in particular
when you did a book back in 2003
you had first proofs second proofs third
proofs and then final proofs a book went
through after you've already submitted
your final manuscript
a book went through four stages first
second third and final proofs why do I
mention that because each time in each
stage the manuscript manages to get
botched up by the typesetter or somebody
else you have to read it again and again
and again it was a total complete
nightmare especially because even today
the transition from Say a Word document
to typesetting is not smooth
and so all sorts of things get botched
up
so now you have two considerations
consideration number one at maximum only
three months have elapsed between the
time he submitted the manuscript for
publication
and the actual publication of the book
and number two
by the time you're done with the final
proofs you are dreaming about every page
in the book you've been driven
completely mad by this book you loathe
it you hate it you want to toss it into
the nearest bonfire you are so sick of
that book
so the idea that he quote-unquote forgot
so much that was in the book is not very
credible
had he written it or read it
uh the other point I wanted to make was
after the the date was over
I had made many Brash allegations I had
leveled nutty brush allegations which
obviously in the course of an hour or
two you can only skim this surface in
documenting
and I know everybody knows the standard
debater's trip the standard debater's
trick is to say
this book is complete with arrows as
nothing Hassan said to mataibi ever
after Ever After Ever and then the
standard the Beggars trick is to say but
for reasons of time I can only
illustrate it with two examples in fact
two examples is all you have
but you make it sound as if for reasons
of time or reasons of space I can only
illustrate it with two examples and I
understood that bad faith technique
and so after I completed the debate I
felt I had a responsibility
if I am a serious scholar
too copiously
comprehensively thoroughly
document the claims which as I said
would rather brush in the uh program and
so I produced a rather large book
entitled Beyond hutzpah on the misuse of
that the semitism and the abuse of
History
now there's an interesting footnote to
that story the book was scheduled to be
published by University of California
press which is a very respectable
Publishing House
and then professor dershowitz
went to the governor of California
Arnold Schwarzenegger because he's he
was because it's University of
California press he sits on the
overseers for the press and went to
Schwarzenegger to try to get him to
cancel publication of the book
uh Schwarzenegger refused he said it was
a matter of academic freedom whether he
knew what that meant only God knows or
his lawyers just told him and then
uh Professor dershowitz threatened to
sue the Press
and there was a funny there was a long
uh correspondence which I had access
which I gained access to
so the charge of plagiarism
was ultimately placed in the first
appendix of the book where I document
the plagiarism
so professor dershowitz
or his lawyer
sent the letter to University of
California press
and that he said in the letter quote
if you don't remove the appendix now
it's going to be a very
painful operation later
it was just a kind of Mafia
Mafia like statement I mean it was so
breathtaking if you don't remove the
appendix now it's going to be a very
painful operation later
and I have to say
it through my Publishing House into a
panic
and we reached an impasse a crisis
erupted
because they wanted to eliminate the
appendix
and I said no because then he's going to
go around declaring victory
that even the University of California
press removed the appendix because they
knew the charges of plagiarism were
false
and
um they said to me look Norman we are a
small University perhaps which is true
presses are small operations relatively
speaking
they said to me
if professor dershowitz
sues us meaning University of California
press sues Us in New York
they said we don't even have the money
to fly out our staff for a trial
and so they really feared
that he would bankrupt them
that was a very serious issue for them
how it was finally resolved I don't want
to uh go through the fine details but
the point being
that I not only leveled the accusations
and he was not we can say
uh particularly impressive in his
replies
but I then took the next step
and I fully documented my claims
and rather than try to reply to them
he tried to suppress publication of the
book
I would also add
I always fear I go on too long and there
are three other people here no I also
add about 10 years more than 10 years
about 15 years later
I met him in the Chinese restaurant an
Indian restaurant on the Upper East Side
and I had some Norm finkelstate
meticulousness got to get no it was an
Indian restaurant all right
I I had very conflicted feelings
about sitting with him at the table
and I'm going to tell you why
um maybe you won't be able to fully
apprehend
when the whole issue of
um
that the uh
appendix the plagiarism charge and
everything else
when it arose
uh Professor dershow would start to go
around saying
that my late mother was a Nazi
collaborator a cockroach yeah
and
um
he was he was kind of vague either she
was a capo a Nazi collaborator or I
believed she was his his
um wording was ambiguous there
well
um
I you know my mother was very protective
of me she was a Jewish mother uh
okay
exponential Jewish mother
explanationally increased Jewish mother
very protected me however
and there was one area
where
her personal integrity and dignity
prevailed over her Jewish mother
adulting
and that was when it came to anything
having to do with her experience during
World War II
uh without going into the Gory details
she was a witness at the last major
trial of
Nazi concentration camp guards for my
Dominic concentration camp
there was a trial in Dusseldorf in 1979
and she had to confront the guards
and I unfortunately got in the middle of
it and it got very ugly
so
I knew
that she would lose all respect for me
uh if in the face of that accusation
that she had collaborated
with the people
who had exterminated her family
that if I didn't do anything
in the face of that accusation that was
now posted
on Professor dershowitz's Harvard Law
School website
if I didn't react
I knew her regard for me would
precipitously
plummet
I think that's redundant would
precipitously full or from it
and so
I was very conflicted
about sitting down with him
in a restaurant table
and I'm being very literal here
and not throttling him
because now I it was a part of me that
felt it was a betrayal
of my
parents martyrdom
but I did
and I'm not going to deny it I did sit
and talk to him
and at one point
I said Tim
why did you say those things about my
mother
so he said to me well you wrote and he
started you well you wrote
I stopped him short
and I said
Professor bershowitz don't go there
by the way if you have any doubt about
what I'm saying I have the tape it was
taped the conversation
so I'm retelling it but if you have any
questions I'm happy to give it up I said
to him
Professor dershowitz don't go there
I said to him
I know
your background
and I'm perfectly willing to acknowledge
it's impressive
you grew up in Borough Park a very
modest lower middle class Jewish
neighborhood I grew up I was born the
same neighborhood we were born with an
eight blocks of each other
you then went to Brooklyn College a
month ago but modest College
and then you went to Yale Law School
and you graduate number one in your
class I said I have
no doubt that's an impressive
achievement
I recognize that just as I recognize
Charles Schumer's achievement Chuck
Schumer he went to my high school his
parents were his father was an
exterminator
he was came from a very modest
background
and through sheer brilliance
well also
being a complete crook but the
Brilliance was there the points is there
no question about in this valedictorian
in my high school and so forth and I I
said I acknowledged you I said now look
Professor there schwitz I read
everything you've written in the last 20
years
and
it's obviously worthless
it was interesting his reaction you know
what he'd be how he reacted
he just Shrugged his shoulders like that
like
yeah what could I do about it he didn't
deny it I said
but you're clearly literate
sufficiently literate you know I never
wrote anything like that
you know that
one
and you know how he spawned it
he said after what you did to me on
Democracy Now
what did you expect me to do
in other words
he knew it was for the ESL was a lie
but it was to protect
you besmirched my name
I'll besmerch your name
that was an interesting
don't find him a particularly
interesting personality I find him
rather dope he's um he's a
a
competition of two Jewish archetypes
the Jewish town do this
because what is a Tamil list a talmudis
is commenting on the commentary of the
commentary of the commentary of the
commentary the whole talmud is about
twisting words it is it's about how to
manipulate words to lend them meanings
which are very hard to discern by the
naked eye and that's who the lawyer does
you hire a lawyer to prove black is
white night is day cold is hot
Etc totally short that's what the lawyer
does a lawyer a lawyer is paid to prove
that the text does not say what it
clearly says that's a lawyer's job so
here's a combination of the talmudis
the commentary and the commentary and
the commentary in the commentary trying
to prove this sentence does not really
mean what this stuff it seems to me this
word does not seem to mean and the other
Jewish archetype the shyster
he's a combination talmudist and shyster
and that's what a lawyer is
that's where the lawyer is a lawyer is a
combination of those two Jewish
archetypes and that's why somebody Jews
are lawyers
it's absolutely true no it is it's a
more instructing fact if you go on the
subway nowadays
there's only one group of people who
still read books one group of people
only one
Orthodox Jews
they are sitting there and reading the
Cowboys
it's deeply impressive
it's deeply impressive
the discipline no cell phone no iPhone
and the commitment
it's our religion
and they sit and read and that was you
know we used to call it you would call
it um
Yeshiva yeshiva's the Jewish school
Jewish Day School a Yeshiva Booker
b-o-c-h-e-r a Jewish reader reader and
that was and that's the uh dershus but
he's not an interesting personality no
he said I don't know you know not
everybody has to be an interesting
personality but he he just happens not
to be
um I still found that conversation
insightful even as I I had with him in
the Indian restaurant even as I have to
acknowledge my mother would probably
have loved me
or maybe even to the point of
of disowning mean though
but losing a lot of respect for me
and you know what I think she would be
right
I let my vanity get the better of my
principle
is that uh you said that was recorded as
that is that uh public
uh
I don't know who was ever made public
but I haven't yeah I I there was a
lemony cell who invited me I couldn't
afford an Indian restaurant in the Upper
East Side
I couldn't even afford uh to eat the
leftovers thrown out in the garbage Moon
but he invited me and he quietly
recorded it
wow
at least you had the opportunity to
confront him
yeah but you know what
it's totally meaningless to him
Notions like honor integrity
respect for the Dead
look he's he's a lawyer a high-priced
lawyer
he takes all the dirtiest cases
well it literally is his name is the
image that's conjured up when I think of
a devil's advocate
and a man who's claimed that he isn't
litigious okay you're a defense attorney
a number of defamation suits I have to
say that's one of his funniest lights
I'm not hilarious he's suing everybody
and someone who also is a self-avowed
defender of the First Amendment who
comes after your right to right so
that's that's what I was thinking
because uh I'm old enough that I can
remember a time when I had you know
vaguely positive feelings about Alan
dershowitz because you know this is
before all of this this is before he uh
he started talking about torture
warrants and things like that during the
uh the war on terror uh because back you
know in I don't know I mean like in the
90s when I was a teenager I remember
um
you know he I think
I mean a lot of his branding was that he
was a big civil libertarian that that's
why cases you know it was totally false
you're absolutely correct that was his
branding but it was totally false
he projected himself as a civil
libertarian crusader but if you actually
look at his cases
his cases if you take his book The Best
Defense which was his first major work
the first case in the book
was two members of the Jewish Defense
League
which was a far right-wing Jewish
organization now that doesn't mean
anything because the whole country you
know lunatic right old right but at the
time Jewish Defense League was a
far-right uh Jewish organization
uh without going into all the details at
that time there was a very famous what
was called impresario name cell Europe
and Sal Urich was involved in cultural
changes cultural exchanges between the
Soviet Union and the United States
at that particular moment the whole free
Soviet jury movement had arisen
and so Uric was seen as a traitor
to Jews because he was calling for
cultural exchange when organized Jewish
uh life was calling for a boycott of
Israel and sanctions you know if not
Israel of the Soviet Union to free
Soviet Jews let them go essentially let
them leave the Soviet Union and go to
Israel because these organizations
didn't want them to come here they want
the Jews to go to Israel
uh in any event what's his first case
the jdl these two members of the jdo
they planted the bomb and saw herrick's
office he wasn't there at the time they
killed his secretary
and dershowitz boasts
that he got these two guys off that's
the first chapter of his best known book
at a time the best defense he boasts
about the fact that he got two Jews
Jewish Fanatics off after they killed a
totally innocent secretary in South
huron's office
then what are his other cases in the
book this is not me I'm just growing the
book
he was
um
you remember the Queen the Queen of Mean
you remember
um
where uh Helmsley
um
I forgot her first name
Melissa Helmsley what was it oh melon
what was helmsley's wife's first name
Leona
he was known as the queen of Maine she
abused all of her staff and so forth and
then she was involved in some lower case
maybe taxes I don't remember he got her
off that was another big case for him
then there was this guy Rabbi Bergman
Bernard Bergman
he was uh uh under investigation for
abusing senior citizens in senior
citizen homes actually that was the big
case that got Geraldo Rivera on the map
he reviewed he revealed the abuse of the
senior citizens in Bernard bergman's uh
nursing homes
they're sure it's got him off
then you have the whole slow he did a
lot of the pornography cases he was the
lawyer for I am curious yellow that was
the first porn film to be imported in
the U.S from uh France yellow
he then did deep throat
he was the lawyer for deep throat
then he was the lawyer for Harry rings
when Linda Lovelace
us uh accused Harry reams of having
abused her on set
during the making of deep throat so he
did a lot of the pornography cases
he then did of course
the O.J Simpson case
he did the
Tyson the bike Tyson case
the Klaus van buelo case and Van built
almost certainly murdered his wife
Tyson you know we could disagree on this
but
I just find it look I don't want to get
into an argument here but if something
goes up to Mike Tyson's apartment at 4am
what do you think is going to happen
you've been rereading the talmud very
unlikely but he got accused of having
raped her I see you're giving me a
skeptical look fine I'm not woke so uh I
say these things but Mike Tyson Klaus
Von dulo O.J Simpson
wife murderers wife batterers
can you tell me what that has to do with
civil liberties
read his books which I've read
he did a couple of capital punishment
cases
did that woman disappear on me
well the Sheldon seagull I'll be back
who's having a connection issue oh okay
yeah he disagrees with me he should
disagree
to shut up that's okay I don't mind
trust me
um
so yeah I cut out there that wasn't in
protest I promise
um he did the um
he didn't do anything so he did a couple
of capital punishment cases
and he did he claims he gave like 10
minutes of his time for Angela Davis who
knows I don't even know that's it there
was no civil liberties he got the civil
liberties reputation because he defended
pornography and at that point in time
pornography was technically a civil
liberties issue because it was defended
in the Supreme Court uh on the grounds
of the first amendment I thought the
grounds were completely stupid it's
called the Stanley case
s-t-a-n-l-d-y well that's when the
Supreme Court you know ruled uh uh um
pornography to be legal
uh so the pornography got conflated with
civil libertarian civil liberties in
that era otherwise he had nothing to do
with civil liberties almost all of his
cases have to do with some sort of
abusive women up to and including
murdering them and he didn't have much
care for the civil liberties of
prostitutes who he thought should be uh
taken to court in other John's there's a
lot of information about everything that
you're saying now in an article I think
from 2019 in the New Yorker it's really
yeah I was a car with my Connie Brooke I
had been in touch with her when she was
right She interviewed the main
um party who was suing their shorts at
the time with the whole Epstein Affair
and she said to me she found the witness
credible I didn't know what to make as
you know that case was finally decided
out of court there was a uh out of court
settlement nobody knows what happened
but you know knowing their shorts like
their shorts as a criminal lawyer and
criminal lawyers what do they do they
hire detectives to dig up dirt on the
other side and her lawyer was a guy
named David Boyce
b-o-e-i-b-o-i-e-s boys and boys is as
big a crook as dershowitz
so you can imagine
each is digging up dirt on the other
side and then they finally decide to
settle out of court
um what to me is the most interesting is
okay I will credit you uh Ben Burgess
and I noticed that on your uh
um
your uh website you have Ben slash
Burgess which leads me to believe that
those are your pronouns and I find that
the RSA very peculiar but okay so
now for now
do you have a question for uh for Norman
I just I I wanted to say that you know
Ben you can be excused in the grounds of
Youth but
in the case of Harvard
when he finally left
now they claim he retired I don't
believe that I think that they knew
Harvard knew what was coming down the
pike with the whole Epstein stuff and
they told them to leave us
because he he had
dershowitz's demeanor leading up to
Epstein's let's say for the sake of
argument suicide uh was
um
sort of defensive in a sweaty and
strange way I think it would be fair to
say
um he made a big point of saying that
you know he'd never because was there
was like he'd had a massage but he kept
his underwear on oh yeah let it be known
yes
right uh also I'll note in uh
I want to sleep tonight I want to have
nice dreams
nightmares after we re-watch this
in the late 90s he also uh editorialized
in favor of lowering the age of consent
uh which can conclude from that what you
know
uh what you want but
um but yeah I have uh and I will I will
tell Andy who designed that graphic that
uh he was suggesting that uh that my uh
give it a certain answer my pronouns uh
but uh but Matt it's going to say when
you finally left Harvard they had three
consecutive days three consecutive days
of the who's who of Academia
singing his Praises with Martha minnow
the great feminist legal scholar leading
the the uh Orchestra praising him and
the pretenses you know what's his name
uh
oh God
what's
oh God what's the guy who Jeffrey
oh this is ridiculous the guy who was
caught uh pleasuring himself during a
video in the New Yorker a video
conference in the New Yorker or Jeffrey
whatever you're talking about yeah I
don't remember his name but I remember
that oh yeah Jeffrey
he just came out with a book tubing
tubing
yeah that's right he was caught tubing
um
which is close to gooning but just
that's true
uh well children you know reserved for
the sophisticated
um in any events October writes this
article when uh there should starts
defending Trump what happened
as if he had been an exemplary civil
libertarian who suddenly underwent this
metamorphosis and turned into a monster
it was always a monster
and the stuff he wrote in Israel
Palestine he was defending by denying
defending by denying that Israel was
engaging in massive torture of
Palestinian detainees there was no
question about that and in the book
beyond Hood school I go through the
cases where he was constantly called as
a witness
by Israel or its Defenders
in order to prove that Israel's record
on these sorts of things was exemplary
but they make it out as if he did this
sudden Vault to face and he had become
evil now
it was always evil you knew he was evil
you didn't care
stop with these fake pretenses
of
sudden a sudden about face with uh
Professor there she was just look at his
cases
look at who he defended and you'll get a
very clear picture of the person and I'm
very plausible deniability at that point
for your own defense
I think that's more about the plausible
deniability of whoever is making the
claim that he became evil yeah
uh uh can I just add to you I just want
to jump in for a second
um on this point uh dershowitz also
got his start uh defending the or sorry
opposing the Vietnam War
um uh or at least he was critical of it
uh to my knowledge and he also is as
self-identifies as a civil liberties
lawyer
um and he really like takes every
opportunity to slip that into the
conversation especially I mean it
doesn't happen more it doesn't happen as
much in the debate with you but I've
noticed in other
um you know public appearances or
debates uh particularly where the
audience might be liberal or in the
center he always makes sure to include
that very often make sure to include
that he he was opposed to the Vietnam
War and he's a civil liberties
he does that I think he does that
because uh I think he does that because
he wants the audience to like uh stop
and think about the license that affords
him to argue for whatever uh horrendous
uh uh atrocity that he's about to defend
he also um uh in the years after this
um uh maybe 10 years later uh when the
Snowden leaks came out uh he went around
the country basically defending the
security and surveillance apparatus and
he leaned heavily on his title as a
civil liberties lawyer to do that
um and um
and he then after that uh was the few
years where he went around doing uh TV
talk show tour uh basically auditioning
to be Trump's lawyer and uh the Epstein
stuff happened and um
no I can't prove it
I thought he was defending Trump because
he thought he might be convicted on the
Epstein stuff and he wanted Trump to get
him out he would get to get out of jail
free card I thought that was his motive
otherwise it was very unclear why he
would have defended Trump but but
basically just to to piggyback on your
point um I think uh you know one of the
reasons that prompted me to recommend
this debate to Ben is because I think I
was watching some talk show host that
like a podcaster I don't remember
wouldn't say their name anyways but they
said something like uh they had played a
clip of their she was saying something
really crazy and they said something
like what happened to this guy you know
you know nothing happened to the guy and
yeah for decades before and decades
since this uh decades before and decades
after this debate he's been uh a pretty
disgusting person the whole time and one
other thing I just wanted to say real
quick is uh this goes way back to
something you said earlier about you
were talking about what he'd said about
your mother and he said other pretty
disgusting things about you too and he
also incited I mean there was um
I think a Jewish organization that had
posted flyers in your building calling
on your landlord to evict you is that
accurate yeah I don't think he had
anything to do with that no no not that
he had anything to do with that but I
just wanted to make the point that um
people often use charges of
anti-Semitism to like uh Crush like to
silence arguments against Israel or
criticisms of Israel and some of the
very main people who do that have in my
opinion said like pretty gross
anti-semitic things about you and uh so
I just wanted to note that that was from
way earlier in the conversation I
believe he lumped you in with Holocaust
denial as well
he also called Bernie Sanders a
self-hating Jew he's called Norm that
too he called Norm that yeah yeah
um I mean it's also like
that would be uh I think you know
whatever uh you know whatever other
flaws Norm has I think I think he grew
up in a household would be very
difficult to be a
holocausted
that's been my defense all along I I say
um given my family background
if I were a holocaust and I I would have
to be
certifiedly insane entirely no you've
heard me talk or you've read what I've
written does it sound to you I think I'm
certifiedly insane because that's the
only possible conclusion you can draw
from the fact that uh I'm not that I'm a
holographic denier giving my family
background it's just you know it's so
it's so wild now my friends
growing up they might rightfully accuse
me of being a Holocaust A firmer just to
say shut up about it you know it was my
family or what was left with my family
but Holocaust denial is like
sort of wild
yeah
write a book about the
instrumentalization of the Holocaust and
deny it at the same time
I think you're a prime candidate for
moscope
you can't write a book
the the flooring the instrumental
instrumentalization of a holocaust and
say it never happened
by the way he absolutely did do
something along the lines of the I don't
know Vietnam War uh antagonism I had
never heard of that before but in um the
beginning of of the debate that we're
hopefully going to watch soon
he likes to come out and say that he was
against the Israeli land grabs in 1967
on I think he said
um
did he go on TV to say it was bad did he
uh yeah who knows
were these Just Thoughts

yeah he helped write UN resolution 242.
Lord Carrington
everything out of his mouth you know
they used to say about Richard Nixon how
do you know when Richard Nixon is lying
answer whenever he moves his lips
exactly exactly I think he also called
you a propagandist but he also says in
the interview that he cites in his book
you know some pamphlets from aipac so oh
yeah yeah well that's actually when he's
being accused of uh plagiarizing a quote
from Joan Peters no I took it from
somewhere else no look the same quote is
in the Apex
same Jewish office in Israel for all the
perms live and wrote the book Yeah my
two sources are Joan Peters and aipac
um
all right well I hope you enjoy I
haven't watched it in many years but I
have to say some of the lines still make
me laugh I re-watch values today yeah
my favorite line is
you can book you claim to everything
what do you mean Clinton
uh oh trouble the heck I gotta be able
to get this get out of this before I
have a new lawsuit and I have a lot of
lawsuits
on Natalie Portman come on
and I'm gonna end it there because you
have to watch the debate and I have to
do my homework Natalie Portman is an
interesting story what homework are you
doing Norm uh I'm writing stuff on
affirmative action okay okay
so
um as you know
one of the people think in the
acknowledgments
of the Case for Israel gershwitz's
quote-unquote book
one of the uh persons is Natalie Portman
but with her maiden name hirschlag
hershlog yes
and there's an interesting story there
which I've always wondered about yeah
now Natalie Portman or herschlug was
very smart young woman
she attended Harvard she got her degree
in French literature
and
I always wondered as you know or may
know
she herself did an about face on Israel
because she was one of the researchers
for the case of Israel she was a fanatic
and within a short period of time
she became
hypercritical of Israel
to the point that she was awarded
Israel's highest award
the Israel price
she turned it down
and I've always wondered
whether
that drama that unfolded between myself
and professor dershowitz
and then the subsequent publication of
my book
when I went through the Case for Israel
line by line by line literally
I went through its sentence by sentence
by sentence
and showed it was afraid
I always wondered whether that
particular episode since she was one of
a handful of research assistants
whether that episode was in any way
influential
and causing her to do an about face
to the very endurance smart then
probably yeah because that's what I felt
she's smart she probably was curious
what is in this book
and then discovers
holy toledo
he lied about everything yeah
so
what she might have written it so we
that's all that is or copied it my
personal favorite line from the entire
interview is when you said
that you'd you'd read uh the Case for
Israel twice and then you corrected
yourself and said actually I've read it
four times or six times because I've
read Joan finger's books
amazing of course there was a little
hyperbole there I did read John Peter's
Book fourth I read many more than four
times by the way but uh I said it was
only the in the first chapters which
were played through I but you know for
the sake of a joke you're allowed to
exaggerate a little okay so I hate you
for the snake in the joke we'll forgive
it uh
uh Norm could do your homework I really
appreciate you uh really appreciate you
sharing this much of your time with us
this was fantastic
um I'm a little confused by one thing I
was confused about Ben Burgess with the
slash because I've never heard those
pronouns and I thought I was pretty up
on pronouns but I have never met a Jew
named Jordan especially a woman
that's interesting in Israel actually
yaldin is a very popular name
specifically for women but I made a joke
to Ben earlier and I really regret not
coming on and doing my friend rasher
voice so there would be no confusion
like hello Dr Norman Finkelstein then
you would have just taken but my
grandparents are are from your
neighborhood as well first generation
Americans via uh Russia and Ukraine so
really yes and I did I lived in Israel
for 14 years I haven't even been back in
America for one yet almost so really oh
I know the the nose gets me by you know
you have an interesting trajectory yeah
I live in we recall around here a little
Odessa by the sea
so I uh speak to the ukrainians every
day it's been an interesting
transformation
you know at the beginning of the war
a lot of flags
a lot of people in cars with the flags
honking their horns
now
you'll see in the whole of Little Odessa
by the Sea we counted it yesterday there
were just two lonely Flags
and then the Sunday night
everybody's on the boardwalk they're
dancing they're making music
but it was very noticeable to me
no one was collecting money for Ukraine
that's interesting even though the
neighborhood now is about 80 percent
Ukrainian
a special draft age ukrainians who came
over in the last year well the the uh
the Jewish side of my family uh came
over from Ukraine and uh
you know before I knew that Russia was
actually going to invade but it seemed
like it might be you know it might not
actually happen
the joke I often told that I now feel a
little bit bad about giving all the
Bloodshed in the last year is uh you
know my main my main position on the
situation in the Ukraine is that if they
wanted me to leave out the definite
article they should have been nice with
my family but uh
the different article what if they
wanted me to leave out the definite
article they should have been nicer to
my family
that's a very subtle joke you really
that's way too sophisticated for your
usual audience
until people started to correct me I
didn't even know it
okay
to meet all of you now get your popcorn
because I'm told that this video
the only one that's more popular than it
on Saturday nights is The Rocky Horror
Picture Show
this is a very special moment occasion
for you
sorry I just need to catch my problems
oh God this is the weirdest intro to oh
I see the beginning too there's this
like kind of like Snappy jazz
another thing is Amy Goodman keeps
playing Frank Lowe during every break
and yeah let's just play playing Franco
like she's super excited about it it's
super weird the beginning is really
interesting though just like two two
words on that because this I believe is
in 2003 so a lot of the conversation in
the beginning is about
um Bush and Iraq and the capture of um
yeah journalists and killing of young
people the United Nations and it's just
like I think it's really interesting
framing because you know when terror is
your foe any sort of uses is Justified
right and and validated after the fact
yeah
um and that kind of puts us into the
right mind space for getting into the
debate on Israel yeah I mean I I
remember a lot you know when uh on
September 11th 2001 I was uh
you know coming back to my dorm uh late
at night and I was passing by the TV on
the dorm and there was a rabbi I want to
say hello I want to say it was one of
the kushner's but I could be wrong about
that uh who uh was on TV and was talking
about you know what had happened that
morning and he said that we're all
Israelis now and I and I walked by I was
like oh
that's such a grim prognosis you know
and anytime there were any sort of uh
you know attacks a terror stochastic
Terror anything you know Islamic and in
Europe when I was living in Israel there
was always this like aha well now
they'll see what it's like maybe now
they'll understand it's just disgusting
yeah there's a lot of that in this too
and I think even to people who might be
like pro-israel today it just does not
age well for dirt which for that reason
like he uses this gold in my ear quote I
mean we'll see it so but you know yeah
it was popular to use that quote then
and it's people do that less often now
but
um I just want to quickly say too
um the they're like two two moments
where uh it's like easy to miss was said
uh and
um in general like if you've I feel like
you missed something you need
clarification a lot happens really fast
and at certain points they start talking
over each other oh yeah I've watched it
so many times I can definitely help with
that amazing perfect and yeah one of the
things I was thinking was kind of funny
the other one's kind of important so but
we'll get to it yeah uh
JB says Jordan Dunn a GTA a day
available but you know how long these go
LOL
I think she does well she's getting all
right I know actually the timing is kind
of perfect because this will be about 45
minutes long so yeah I mean not that
we're not gonna stop and talk but I mean
it's amazing it's actually like about
two hours uh yeah because from the count
two part two this is yeah I mean I mean
I think we are in for a long uh hauls
because of that uh we should we should
get started so so let's do that
thank you

out of nowhere by saxophonist Frank Lowe
with drummer Philip Wilson Frank Lowe
died Friday at the age of 60 in New York
you are listening to democracy Now The
War and Peace report I'm Amy Goodman
a 15 year old unarmed Palestinian boy
was killed and 14 Palestinians wounded
when Palestinian militants and Israeli
forces clashed in the southern Gaza
Strip today 20 Israeli tanks and
bulldozers entered the Rafa refugee camp
shortly after midnight after five mortar
shells were fired at a block of Israeli
settlements in the Gaza Strip no
injuries or damage was reported
meanwhile Israeli foreign minister
Silvan Shalom is scheduled to meet U.S
national security adviser Condoleezza
Rice and Secretary of State General
Colin Powell today to discuss the U.S
position on the root of the so-called
Security Fence in the West Bank prior to
the meetings Shalom said during an
interview on the fence that Israel
should quote do everything to defend as
many West Bank settlers as possible and
said the purpose of the fence is to
defend Israeli citizens
meanwhile the Israeli newspaperets is
reporting the Israeli government spends
at least 560 million dollars a year on
subsidies infrastructure and education
for 220 000 Jewish settlers living in
the West Bank and Gaza the figure does
not include military spending in those
areas
arat says Israel has spent at least 10.1
billion dollars on the settlement since
capturing the West Bank and Gaza in
1967.
successive Israeli governments have
refused to disclose how much they spend
on settlements RS says a compiled the
figure after three months of research
including interviews with dozens of
government officials and experts and
yesterday President Bush told the 58th
session of the United Nations General
Assembly quote the Palestinian cause is
betrayed by leaders who cling to Power
by feeding old hatreds and destroying
the good work of others
this comes days after the U.N voted 133
to 4 to condemn Israel's decision to
quote remove Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat the United States Israel the
Marshall Islands and Micronesia voted
against the measure it's always
Micronesia today we're going to have a
very interesting debate and a new book
called The Case for Israel it's by Alan
dershowitz who is one of the nation's
foremost appellate lawyers Felix
Frankfurt a professor of law at Harvard
Law School his articles are published in
the New York Times and other
Publications
his books include hutzpah the vanishing
American Jew why terrorism works
shouting fire
and America declares independence
we're also joined by Professor Norman
Finkelstein he is author of four books
including the Holocaust industry
Reflections on the exploitation of
Jewish suffering his writings have
appeared in prestigious journals like
the London Review of Books the index on
censorship the Journal of Palestine
studies the new Left review the
Christian Science Monitor and others he
is also author of image and reality of
the israel-palestine conflict his latest
book is called the Holocaust industry
today a debate we're going to begin with
Professor Alan dershowitz welcome to
democracy now thank you very much for
having me and uh why don't we start
um with you laying out the thesis of
your latest book the Case for Israel
well I wanted to write a progressive
liberal case for the two-state solution
and the state two-state solution which I
think that most Israelis favor and have
favored for a long time I dedicate the
book to Professor Aaron Barack who is
the president of the Israeli Supreme
Court and for a reason because I argue
in the book that no country in history
faced with comparable threats both
external and internal has ever tried so
hard to comply
with the rule of law I compare Israel
favorably to the United States it's core
in this regard its courts intervene
actively in support of Palestinian
rights um even during fighting in
Wartime during the Janine events the
Israeli Court enjoined
um the Israeli military from engaging in
in certain actions which in its view
violated the rule of law the Israeli
Supreme Court has banned the kind of
rough interrogation techniques that are
now being employed by the United States
in in Guantanamo
um Israel is the only country in modern
history that has never deliberately and
explicitly retaliated against those who
attack its civilian targets for example
during The Six Day War in the 1973 one
the 1948 War its own residential areas
were bombed by Egypt by Syria by Jordan
1600 shells logged into West Jerusalem
Israel never bombed Oman or Damascus or
Cairo they have of course bombed areas
of Beirut and in the process have killed
innocent civilians but there's an
enormous difference between doing for
example with the United States and
England in the Second World War uh
bombing Dresden or Hiroshima Nagasaki
that is deliberately targeting civilians
and going after the way the United
States did in Iraq which I am very
critical but nonetheless what the United
States did going after military Target
knowing that they're going to kill
civilians in the process and so myself I
oppose the settlements I've always
opposed the settlement since 1967 I've
opposed the occupation I think Israel
made in my view a terrible mistake in 67
what it should have done
is it should have made border
adjustments pursuant to U.N resolution
242 which I actually consulted with
Justice Goldberg he was the ambassador
to the UN and was involved in the
process of of that 242 resolution which
which presuppose some territorial
adjustments the problem is Israel should
never have occupied people land is
different from people
today I think unilaterally what it ought
to do eventually if it can't find a
peace partner is to make some unilateral
change to small ones uh end the
settlement
um yeah so obviously we don't want to
start stop for very long now because you
know we've just barely started but
um it is it is incredible that
dershowitz like how dershowitz is
framing himself here
um he wanted to make a you know a
liberal Progressive case for a two-state
solution which makes you wonder what the
Israelis agree on a solution that most
Israelis agree on yeah now one wonders
why I didn't call the both the case for
the two-state solution
it's for Israel and then yes we have
this claim that he was always opposed to
the settlements now when where and how
he expressed this or whether this is
just in his heart as we said is unclear
and then yeah as Jordan points out
occupying land is different from
occupying people I wanna I'm gonna make
a t-shirt that says occupy land not
people and just see what reactions I get
on the street he tries to make this
argument that because he does not
consider Israelis colonialists they are
not occupying land which uh
is uh I mean at the very least the
distinction is not that important yeah
the definition of colonialism here uh in
a little bit and also doesn't stick to
it like within the same sentence it's
insane yeah well I will at least say
that occupy people as confusing as that
would be as a t-shirt slogan is you know
still better than the T-shirt I was
thinking about earlier which is just
like the obvious joke about the stuff
earlier would be you know my I never
took off my underwear I don't like
massages yeah
a lot of questions already answered by
my t-shirt
in fact my peace proposal is that Israel
would have a schedule for ending
settlements that is a schedule for
saying on so and so day the settlement
ends conditioned on best efforts by the
Palestinians to end terrorism that would
create an incentive to ending a
terrorist acts by the way you never
conditioned anything on the end of
terrorism because that gives the
terrorists a veto what you condition it
is on making good faith efforts and if
we can get Israel to end the settlements
in the occupation and the Palestinian
leadership to stop using a terrorism as
a tactic I think finally something that
could have happened in 1917 a two-state
solution in 1936 commission recommended
a non-contiguous Jewish homeland and the
Israelis accepted it and the Arabs
rejected it in 1947 when the U.N
allocated that Port portion of Palestine
that had a majority of Jews in it to a
Jewish State
Palestine that had a Palestinian
majority to an Arab State we could have
had an insurance solution we could have
had a two-state solution in 2002
oh no I was just saying I think it's
always good to flag the use of that that
like uh Collective entity the Arabs
right right yeah you know it's like like
who is the Arabs exactly right
in this sentence that you know is made
this decision and thus must live with it
but anyway wait did we lose Jordan
though
oh is she she might be I just thought
she was being very still yeah uh well uh
presumably that's a connection issue and
she'll be back but let's keep going
hello
2001 when Barack and and President
Clinton offered to be sure a
non-contiguous State on 90 something
percent of the West Bank and 100 of the
Gaza with the capital in Jerusalem with
a 35 billion dollar Refugee package and
when Arafat responded by violence
instead of coming back to the table and
saying well maybe we'll negotiate for a
little bit more so the two-state
solution is inevitable it's going to
happen the only question is how long it
takes to happen
about the future about the Rights and
Wrongs I think there were Rights and
Wrongs on both sides but I'm nervous
because I heard from my debating partner
in the beginning what sounded like it
was going to be simply an ad hominem
attack on me as whether I'm qualified to
teach at Harvard I would hope we could
Elevate the discussion and keep it on
the merits I won't attack uh Mr
I I just it's
too much of a core brand proposition to
let it go that's uh saying something
mean is not what ad hominem means but
whatever well yeah I want to get into
when the plagiarism things come uh thing
the first one comes up I'd really like
to get into uh like the fact that
dershowitz keeps calling that accusation
plagiarism uh
Finkelstein on his merits of his
position let people read his book and
judge for themselves and if he would
refrain from personal attacks on me and
let people judge the book on its merits
I think we can move the ball forward and
have a reasonable serious debate I think
it'd be interesting to know where we
agree where we disagree what facts we
share in common what facts we have
different views on and whether they're
empirical and could be subjected to
reasonable resolution where we have
moral disagreements I really think that
in the end today you read the news about
Israel this other good news there's in
the works according to the New York
Times of prisoner exchange between
Hezbollah and Israel in which Israel
would get back one
person a civilian who was captured by
Hezbollah in exchange for Israel giving
back 400 or so prisoners there's
movement forward let's not destroy that
movement forward by getting involved in
meaningless ad hominem discussion let's
see if we can Elevate the debate and see
if we can really move forward to the
two-state solution that I think
virtually everybody in the world today
wants Professor Alan dershowitz author
of The Case for Israel Norman
Finkelstein your response well I
appreciate Alan dershowitz's
seriousness at least in these remarks I
have no intention whatsoever of getting
involved in an ad hominem debate with Mr
schewitz dershowitz I'm interested in
the facts
I was asked to come in and discuss his
new book
I went home purchased one copy in fact I
purchased two copies I read the book
very carefully
I did what what someone serious does
with a book
I read the text
I went through the footnotes
I went through it very carefully there's
only one conclusion one can reach having
read the book and this is a scholarly
judgment it's not an ad hominem attack
Mr dershowitz has concocted a fraud in
fact Mr dershowitz has concocted a fraud
which amazingly in large Parts he
plagiarized from another fraud
I found that pretty shocking found
shocking coming from a Harvard professor
I could find it shocking coming from any
Professor now we have to cut off at one
point I just want to warn everybody here
that although I'm not a litigious person
when you make allegations of I'm
prepared
um
that's a technical I agree which has
great legal implications I agree and uh
you know I can't obviously sit quietly
by and you shouldn't okay well that's an
alligator let's look at the other then
that's a plagiarism
who's the plagiarism okay let's look at
the evidence
in the first two chapters of your book
you extensively reproduce all of Joan
peters's pages in her book
I read it carefully in 1984 show me I'm
going to show you show me once I'm going
to show you okay I think I have I think
I made available the charts to you no
I've known you you've shown me let's
start with that that's a categorical
lies what you're hearing now on radio is
that a claim that Mr Pickles so what
happened right there this is one of the
things that I wanted to point out that's
easy to miss uh Finkelstein turns to Amy
Goodman and says I made these charts
available to you and dershowitz pretends
that Finkelstein was talking to him yeah
that he can accuse him of lying
basically that's my take on that
um I love that also you see that that um
Finkelstein has n't had a number of
books
books
team have just like endless pages of
talking points it's amazing it's funny
how much is going on
Charlie Kirk's binder yeah exactly like
that yes
um yeah it's pretty incredible there's a
lot going on in the room and get used to
this level of interruption by dershowitz
it doesn't stop oh yeah I think around
this point is where dershowitz starts to
realize like what he just walked into
yes
he takes the tact of like uh uh I'm just
gonna run out the clock and change the
subject as much as I can every time
which is great because eventually Amy
Goodman's like you know what we're gonna
give this little a bit more time yeah
like and then it lasts two hours like
what kind of friends does this guy have
that nobody told him like dude this is
not going well and if he thought that he
was gonna speak with Chomsky I don't
know what exactly he hoped for anyway
yeah right he did debate Chomsky and
that I don't think that went well for
him either but it wasn't quite as like
embarrassing just
well I don't you know I I love like
um you know if if my if my worldview
Encompass Saints you know Chomsky would
definitely be one of them but
um he's uh you know Chomsky I think
would probably not have quite duration
what's his Killer Instinct as far as the
way he's going about this right now yeah
I think they're just a very different
person yeah
Saints have to die to be canonized too
and I'm pretty sure that father time is
is not going to kick it anytime soon
also and I want to just when uh when it
comes up if we could talk about how
dershowitz keeps calling the plagiarism
accusation ad hominem oh yeah and he
also says he's not here for a debate
it's like uh pretty sure that's what
you're I mean it was introduced as a
debate yeah
he didn't object at the time you know
I came here to pitch my book and talk
over someone right
fair enough Christine made available to
me certain charts
okay okay Mr dershowitz I think you had
about five minutes time I wasn't looking
at the clock if we're going to have a
civil debate you're going to have to
wait it's not going to be you're going
to have to I'm not debating you I have
no interest in you Mr dirkiewicz none at
all I'm interested in the scholarship
and I'm interested in the facts and I'm
interested in your book
now in 1984 one jean Peters published a
book called from time immemorial
the book was universally recognized by
serious Scholars to be a fraud
without wanting to toot my own horn
I'm widely recognized as the person who
exposed the fraud
I know that book inside out I read it at
least four times and I went through all
1854 footnotes
I start to read your book Mr dershowitz
I then came to chapter one footnotes 10.
footnote 11 footnote 12. footnote 13
footnote 14 for note 15 footnote 16. all
of the quotes are from Joan Peters
they are so from Joan Peters that you
have a long quote here from Mark Twain
on pages 23 to 24. I turn to Joan Peters
page 159 to 60. The Identical quote from
Twain with
with the ellipses
in the same places
The Identical quote from Twain with the
ellipses in the same places
what's your point is that a correct let
me finish this
is it a direct is it an accurate quote
of Twain did Twain says
the way we can have a civilization here
is that each person will get a chance to
make their point and won't be cut off so
you have a nearly a full-page quote from
one William young a British Council for
May 1839 is it an accurate on page eight
I'm going to finish sir on page 18 of
your book I turn to Joan Peters page 184
The Identical quote with the ellipses
I'm holding it up for the camera perhaps
they can see this is the length of the
quote is it an accurate ellipses in The
Identical place
last point
I'm not going to go through chapter two
where there are 29 plagiarisms from Joan
Peterson
plagiarism to quote Mark Twain correctly
yeah
Mark Twain and not Sean Peters I'm a
professor sir I know what plagiarism is
and plagiarism
so you're using a word I'm gonna get the
documentation and you know what we'll
let everybody else decide for themselves
because the documentation one last
example
and I want to make it very clear
and Joan peters's book from time
immemorial
she coins a phrase the phrase is turn
speak
and she said she borrows it from she
borrows it from from
um
sorry
she coins the phrase you see you don't
know what you're talking about that's
pretty terrible she coins the phrase
turn speak and she says she's using it
as a play off of George Orwell which is
all listeners know use the phrase news
speak right and she coined her own
phrase turn speak
you go to Mr dershowitz's book he got so
confused in his massive borrowings from
Joan Peters that on two occasions I'll
cite them for those who have a copy of
the book on page 57 and on page 153
he uses the phrase quote George Orwell's
turn speak turn speak is not Orwell Mr
dershowitz you're the Felix Frankfurter
chair at Harvard yes you must know that
Orwell would never use such a clunky
phrase as turn speed I like it I think
it's well maybe you like it evidently
Joan Peters liked it but George Orwell
never heard of it to the best of my
knowledge we have to break just one
second we have to wait just one second
we have to break for stations to
identify themselves there's 60 seconds
and when uh we come back uh Professor
dershowitz can respond we're talking to
Professor Alan dershowitz he's author of
a new book it's called The Case for
Israel and debate with Norman
Finkelstein among his books the
Holocaust industry and image and reality
of the israel-palestine conflict you're
listening to democracy now stay with us
let's pause for a second okay
yeah uh
I mean
um
first of all dershowitz uh is claiming
that it's only plagiarism if the quote
you incorrectly cited was made up
I love that yeah I mean we're skipping
over I I love that you know Norm said
about Ben's joke earlier that it's so
sophisticated it's probably going over
the listener's heads but he doesn't stop
for a moment himself here to explain
what he means about the ellipses which
is basically that you know dershowitz
and his book is omitting part of a quote
the exact same way that Peters was and I
keep thinking of Jones also that he
cites Mark Twain and not the place where
he found the quote exactly it's like
what you do when you're an undergrad and
you need to feel beef up your biblical
geography a little bit
um I've seen student and Ben I mean I
don't know if you teach as well but Ben
like you've probably had students make
this mistake by accident I've had I've
been in class with students who
um they found a quote they use the quote
and they attributed it to the person who
said it not knowing that you're supposed
to attribute freshman Senior High School
feeling and
um
124 to 125 yeah yeah right right but the
professor will if an intro student does
that it's forgivable they don't know
anything
they're not supposed to do that if you
are the Felix Frankfurter yeah right I
can't imagine you know you should know
that that's academic dishonesty imagine
if my buddy who did that as a freshman
in college and the professor pointed it
out and he was like uh actually I feel
like that's a really ad hominem attack
what is the quote correct sir yeah
exactly
they'll get to the contents of the
market between uh quote and you know is
the content of the quote correct no I
think it's and we can get into
why later but that doesn't matter anyway
it's just hilarious then he's like oh
you didn't like that one got another one
for you
yeah George Orwell you know that
forgettable character in literary
history
yeah can you never write something so
clunky well I like it
yes
yeah oh man oh yeah I know he's uh well
out of his League already no I mean the
fact that like gershowitz I guess like
it's it's certainly he made it sound
like he thought that turn speak was
Orwell yeah in his initial response and
then you know it's that like yeah I mean
clearly either let's say for the sake of
argument dershowitz or you know maybe
one of his research assistants or
somebody right you know found that in
Peter's and was incredibly sloppy about
it or you know or there was something
you know in between with the research
assistant said what he got out of it
that you know it got telephone games
into uh into this is what George Orwell
said and I think we can safely assume
that Natalie Portman just pretended to
read 1984 in high school
excuse me
someone in the comments earlier was like
wait her name is hirschlag Portman no
her flag was the former surname I'm
sorry that is awesome though
um also I think it's really interesting
that dershowitz like chooses the tact of
um I mean he's basically just acting
like he doesn't know what plagiarism is
but like Norm did a good job convincing
me he was genuinely unprepared but he is
a lawyer and a professor like he must
know
some of these things you know
I don't know I mean that's the thing
because like in a way I mean even beyond
the academic dishonesty it's also how
could you just like as a reasonably
well-read person how could you not know
that the Orwell one was new speak
yeah
yeah
but he couldn't even remember his name I
mean which is true but still like of all
of the authors that one seems a little
bit distilling
yeah yeah and then the Mark Twain thing
like I mean that that quote was chosen
in the Joan Peters book because it
supports these uh claims that she was
largely trying to make about a
demographics which is the key area of
the book that Finkelstein found to be
fraudulent she made up demographic
numbers essentially is my understanding
um so that quote by Twain you know
uh who was not a historian by the way uh
it's my knowledge he was just traveling
and not extensively even it's like they
just completely said yeah there's no
Palestinians here yeah it was a tourist
uh and and he was in the quote I mean so
I should say to back up just a little
bit for you know anybody's watching us
not familiar with the larger context
like Peter's point
which Peters was using this Mark Twain
quote uh to uh to bolster uh and
dershowitz is plagiarizing you know for
the Case for Israel is
trying to support this like classical
like old-timey Zionist than this like oh
it was a land without a people for
people without a land yeah and Mark
Twain who again is coming as a tourist
he's like his agenda as like a satirist
and uh you know a sort of uh critic of
religion Etc is to sort of like you know
put some cold water on like
romanticization of uh of the land and
he's like look this is like nothing
there are like a few Arabs and whatever
that's like the tone of it it's it's not
a scholarly anything right it's it's
it's uh you know and it's being used to
for like you know because I I could see
how somebody could watch this and just
not get one of the context that's right
the fundamental claim is oh it's cool
nobody was here yeah right exactly but
you know he could be easily have been
taken to to an area that hadn't been
developed uh yet or a place that was
inhabited by like no matter
um you know what I mean uh like what
happened yeah exactly and and he sees
some Marsh or some um desert and goes
all right well this is just kind of open
area but we have you know census
statistics from the early Ottoman Empire
that explicitly tell you how many people
were living in what areas there are
portions of of Israel which are
Palestinian Arabic that have been
inhabited since you know like 4 000 BCE
uh Jaffa so just really stupid often uh
cited Zionist claims which are
completely falsifiable yeah also you
know anybody who's I mean
read some Mark Twain which you know you
might have done along with your will uh
does knows that like exaggerating for
effects is kind of central to the kind
of writing that Mark Twain did yeah sure
yeah absolutely yeah
um and he has like a pretty famous
anti-war poem which is just as a side
note
yeah no I think a lot of a lot of twins
you know a lot of twins other views uh
dershowitz uh wouldn't like so much but
he did he liked them since the Vietnam
War actually yeah
since since whatever it was I mean look
this is not this is not any sort of uh
you know Norm would have a lot of
contempt for This research method but
like while we were talking about this
earlier I quickly opened up Josh what's
his uh you know Wikipedia page and did a
search for the word Vietnam and uh
anything he did to oppose the Vietnam
War wasn't significant enough to make it
onto the Wikipedia page so that might
have also just been in his heart uh he
talks about it you know he says it at
the beginning of the Chomsky debate that
like they agreed in their opposition to
the Vietnam War like yeah does is this
like was dershowitz's opposition to the
Vietnam war that like he was on the
phone with his mom and he was like yeah
no this seems pretty bad
yeah all right let's listen to some jazz
I think they're going to a break
it's such a weird combo it's so
up

really strange choice

this is like a sadder Jazz at least it's
a little more solemn than the original
one

thank you

um
more music
from the late Franco here on Democracy
Now The War and Peace report as we
continue our debate on Allen
dershowitz's new book it's called The
Case for Israel Alan dershowitz is
Professor of law at Harvard Law School
in discussion with Norman Finkelstein
who teaches at DePaul University in
Chicago his books image and reality of
the israel-palestine conflict and the
Holocaust industry professor dershowitz
your response for this very serious
charge well it's a it's a frivolous
charge of course what happened was of
course I read the Peter's book anybody
writing a book on the Middle East would
I also read a book called The myths and
facts which is a book put out originally
by aipac and then published separately
and independently and probably 30 or 40
other books which use the same quotes
they're very extensively used quotes by
Mark Twain because Mark Twain traveled
to Palestine Mark Twain's a very
prominent American writer and what he
saw in past is very relevant to the
debate he saw Barren lands he didn't see
a Palestinian
a community he saw empty roads and he
writes extremely vividly and
one scholar is entitled to read a book
as I did of Peter's book and to find
quotes in the book and check them
against the original quotes and find
them to be accurate and then do what I
did I don't know whether or not Mr
Finkelstein read footnote 31 that
appears on page 246 which says the
research of French cartographer vital
Kuntz are relied on physics and queen so
I may have mispronounced that I'm sorry
and then I say see Joan Peters from time
immemorial Chicago
Etc and then I say Peter's conclusions
and data have been challenged and then I
quote
from say Eden Hutchins I do not in any
way rely on them in this book in other
words what I did and it's very common
for Scholars to do that is
um I read her books I read Mr
finkelstein's criticism of them and I
came away with enough doubt about the
conclusions that although I don't regard
the Peter's book in any way as a fraud I
think it was a well-intentioned effort
to recreate and
uh the very difficult to recreate events
that existed in 1890 and 1900
um I did find her quotes as I said used
extensively by uh facts and myths and
other Publications to be quite
compelling and uh she led me I mean I
don't report this this book and none of
my writing report I don't purport to be
an independent historian who goes back
to the Middle East and reads original
documents I'm making a case I'm doing
what a lawyer would do and what lawyers
do
is they find sources they check the
sources I have research staff that
obviously check the sources I haven't
heard a word from uh Mr Finkelstein
suggesting that the quote from Mark
Twain is not an accurate quote now if
Peter's had taken had made up a quote
from Mark Twain and it hadn't existed
Mark Twain had never written it and then
somebody borrowed the quote without
going to check back on whether Mark
Twain had said that obviously that would
be a serious charge I've done nothing
like that the vast majority of my book
deals with current situations in fact I
start my book by saying there has to be
a statute of limitations on grievances I
don't try to base the Case for Israel on
the fact that Jews lived in Palestine uh
before the birth of Jesus or the fact
that Jews were expelled from what is now
Israel in 72 A.D and I argue that
Palestinians can't really make the case
against the two-state solution based on
historic claims that go back 100 years
but in the first couple of chapters
which are quite brief I recount never
purporting to be creative or original in
the recounting I recount what has been
accepted as the traditional history and
that traditional history includes
the fact that the land particularly what
is now west what would be Western
Palestine what was the part of Palestine
allocated to Israel in the 1947
division was land that before the Jews
got there in the first Ali Abbott 1880
something in the second Aliyah in the
beginning of the 20th century was land
that was coming into this use now these
are implies
Mark Twain there's some Palestinians who
say you shouldn't Trust
the various English Travelers reasonable
people could disagree about that I quote
those sources I I lay them out there for
people to read so that they can evaluate
the claims that uh Israel was
established on the basis of colonialism
I make the following argument which I'd
love to hear Mr pinkstein
you can't be a colonialist country
unless another country sent people there
as soldiers to take over that country
for example
transcend its settlers to Algeria
England sent its settlers to India uh
Dutch and other countries sent their
settlers to parts of Africa with guns to
take over what did the Jews do during
the first Aliyah and the second Aliyah
they escaped from countries that were
persecuting them they escaped from
Russia they escaped from Poland they
escaped from Lithuania
they didn't come at the request of those
countries if you claim people or
colonialists you have to say on whose
behalf they were working the Jews who
came there weren't working on behalf of
Russia they weren't working half the
poll and they weren't Lithuania they
came as refugees much like American Jews
came as refugees to America the ones who
went to Palestine went with rakes and
hoes and guns build the land
collectively with the local population
they did in fact improve the land as a
result of work projects in Western
Palestine many Arabs from Eastern
Palestine moved there I cite statistics
Peter cites the same statistics in fact
showing that in various T boots embryo
licion and others the fact that 100 I I
don't remember the exact numbers Jews
moved there attracted 300 or 400 you may
disagree with it but those are the data
that I presented and we can reasonably
disagree with that now now I just want
to make one point about Mr finkelstein's
research well I don't want to get ad
hominem I don't want to get into this
debate but for example
I do quote Mr Finkelstein at one point I
think only once uh in the book and that
is he makes an argument in Edward
saeed's collection that to judge the
1947 partition the only fair way to do
it is to look at either all of Palestine
which I don't know whether he means to
include what became Jordan trans Jordan
or not or you have to look at what
became of Israel after the 1948 War
I disagree with that what I say
respectfully in in the book is that when
you look at the fairness of the 1947
petition you only look at the land that
was allocated to the state of Israel and
in that land Jews were clearly a
majority according to the U.N census to
be sure once the Arab Nations attacked
Israel once the Palestinians attacked
Israel there was a war and Israel
secured more land which was regularized
by a ceasefire in 1949 what Mr
Finkelstein does is he counts that land
and says aha look at how much they got
and look at the proportion of Jews and
Palestinians that's not the correct
demographic to look at so you know we
can have reasonable okay let's go let's
stay away from the ad homers and get to
the merits of the case you know uh
professors I'm not a professor at
Harvard but like you seem to resent I do
but I do I do think elsewhere
and when we discuss issues like
falsifying information
plagiarizing lifting whole cloth from
other books I've never heard that called
ad hominem
for a serious scholar and a serious
academic those are very fundamental
issues but when they're falling so okay
no if they're they're fools then you
dispute them but to characterize them as
ad hominem seems really out of court for
a professor
Jackie you said I don't deserve it
sounds okay
you asked you raised that issue I'll try
to address it and then we're returning
to the substantive issues of your book
first tell me why in you I'm going to
refer to that okay on page 207 of your
book you say that to deliberately
misinform
miseducate and misdirect students is a
particularly nasty form of educational
malpractice which I accuse no I consider
I consider what you have done the book
to be a paradigmatic a quintessential
example of misinform coming miseducating
and misdirecting you'll go on allow me
to finish allow me to finish Mr
dershowitz I've been very respectful of
your time
on page 213 you discussed the Holocaust
fraud by Robert froison and you write
quote
there was no extensive historical
research referring to his book that's
right instead there was the fraudulent
manufacturing of Fool's anti-history
that's right
please don't bring in Mr Chomsky he can
defend himself we're talking about you
and your book it was the kind of
deception referring to for his own's
book now let me quote clearly for which
professors are rightly fired I stand by
not because their views are
controversial and let me underline this
again but because they are violating the
most basic canons of historical Scholars
let me respond to that you can compare
me
I'm referring to your standards occur
I'm referring to yours I have no
interest in foreign
and misdirect to violate the standards
of historical scholarship or grounds for
exposure so it's not an ad hominem
argument it's using your standards no
it's an ad hominem argument I'm going to
interrupt here because I want to get to
something I want to get to some of the
main points
also we were intrigued on
um watching Scarborough country when you
debated Sam husseini the offer that you
make we want to just play it for a
moment please
in your name if you can find historical
fact in my book that you can prove to be
false I issue that challenge I issue it
to you I issue it to the Palestinian
Authority I issue it to Noam Chomsky I
issue with Edward saying every word in
my book very completely accurate and you
can't just simply say it's false without
documenting it tell me one thing in the
book now that is false let okay uh let's
go to the book the Case for Israel
yeah and let me tell you what he came up
with this is really fascinating if you
show the rest of the clip he came up he
said on television I saw a photograph or
I remember I've said a videotape of
Israeli soldiers aiming their guns at
that whatever 12 year old boy who was
caught in the crossfire and uh killed
and I actually upped the offer to twenty
five thousand dollars if he could
produce a photograph or if he could
produce proof that he had seen that why
was I so confident because German
television did a very thorough study of
that one particular incident let's just
spend one minute on that incident what
happened is when that child was killed
in his father's arms the nation of
Israel went into almost Universal
mourning it was as if they were sitting
shiva on one of their own children
died and it looked as if possibly the an
Israeli soldier might have shot him when
you contrast that to how Palestinians
respond to a child dying in Israel from
terrorism dancing in the streets it's a
very striking comparison then German
television did a study and they found
out that the Israeli soldiers were
positioned in a way that it was
physically impossible for the bullet
from an Israeli soldier to have hit that
Palestinian child and it was virtually
certain that the bullet had come from a
Palestinian gun in my view that's not
particularly relevant when a child is
caught in a crossfire fire it's a tragic
death resulting from the crossfire which
bullet actually hit him was not relevant
but that was the answer that he came up
with uh Norman Finkelstein well first of
all I want to clarify the monetary issue
is it now 25
000 it's 25 000 on that issue oh just an
issue in general it's ten thousand
dollars and let me be very clear what I
what I said I heard that we just saw it
but let me be very clear I then made it
very clear I said uh um afterward a
material well afterwards
but we don't we're not talking about a
spelling mistake oh no I mean we're not
talking about a minor no mistake
serious material let's talk about the
fact that I deliberately engaged it
serious material facts
let's start
number one I'm gonna first deal with
just concrete facts which are not
particularly controversial which can
easily be confirmed
um on page 80 of your book you write and
according to Benny Morris between April
and June is starving I have a copy of
his book here which I'll hold up right
two to three thousand Palestinians were
made refugees joined the second stage of
the flight
here's the book in front of you yeah
page 256. can you read what the sentence
says
well uh let me read you what I say in my
book in some areas Arab commanders
no no I'm just reading in some let me
put the context Chomsky says that uh
that he says
Morris does not believe that any Arab
leaders told the Palestinians to leave
and I say in some areas I quote from
ours in some areas Arab commanders
associate the clear to clear the ground
for military purposes to prevent
surrender more than half a dozen
Villages
Etc were abandoned during these months
as a result of such orders elsewhere in
East Jerusalem and many villages around
the country the Arab commanders ordered
women all people and children to be sent
away out of Harm's Way indeed
psychological preparation for the
removal of the defendants had begun in
47-48 when the Arab High command and the
Arab League could periodically endorse
such a move and contemplating the future
of Palestine and I say therefore Chomsky
is simply wrong when he says that
there's no evidence and he says again at
another Point nobody today believes that
any of the refugees were told to leave
and so I dispute that by quoting Morris
himself you seem to have an obsession
with Mr Chomsky but he's not here I'm
here
I agree with you read the next sentence
Morris estimates
in your book I have it right in front of
me the next sentence Morris estimates
that between two and three thousand
Arabs fled their homes during this phase
of the Arab initiated can you please
read what Mr Morris wrote well no you're
talking about one please read what he
wrote If I had the whole book I will
find you walk you want to take time can
you if you want the 3 000 people led
during this phase in fact
okay I'm looking at page 256.
the history of the Zionist Arab conflict
phase two now the same one as you go
ahead and you're talking about right
over together yeah all together about
two to three hundred thousand Arabs
filled their homes during the second
stage two or three thousand and two and
three hundred thousand now you could
check this many times Mr dershowitz but
you're really going to have to pay the
ten thousand dollars
I hope you'll allow me to earmark it for
Janine I would like to give you
oh well what's uh what's two decimal
places between friends
yeah
wow
um so so so Jordan in the part you
missed uh earlier although I know you've
already seen the debate so so you'll
remember the part the um in the
introduction uh Finkelstein uh makes uh
sorry uh joshuaitz makes heavy use of
um
a you know propaganda Trope I've heard
you refer to many times in conversation
that uh Israel has the most moral army
in the world you know I love that
contradiction in terms yeah yes uh he uh
he says that the uh you know Israel is
you know is is you know it's much more
moral you know for example than uh than
the United States and you know and it's
and it's it's uh because it never you
know kills uh civilians and you know
you're gone like you said that earlier
but then uh he repeats that now that
it's like oh the one time that uh you
know that that it looked like maybe you
know there was a Palestinian kid who was
and the whole nation mourned of course
yes yes
uh so
yeah
I mean also I think it's important to
point out here because I don't I think
it doesn't totally get clarified uh
between them
um there's actually like two errors
going on here one is the two to three
thousand to two to three hundred
thousand but uh dershowitz is also
making the claim specifically that that
number refers to how many Palestinians
were told to leave by their Arab
commanders which is like slightly
different from what Morris is saying uh
as far as I understand it she also he
says that it doesn't help his argument
so why would he make that
he's saying that because he wants us to
still think that Morris is saying that
Arab commanders told their uh told the
Palestinians to leave it's just that in
the quote that he cites to back up that
claim uh on that page that's not
actually quite what Morris is saying
he's just saying that that many Arabs
fled in I believe what he calls the
something like the Arab initiated uh
fighting but at least in that sentence
Morris doesn't say two to three hundred
thousand Arabs were told to leave by
their uh by Arab commanders dershowitz
is like conflating two lies one is that
number and the other is the reason that
they left sure there is truth to the
fact that um that uh Arab commanders
told civilians to leave to get out of
Harm's Way which is totally reasonable
because they were promised both by
leadership and by the Israeli side that
they would be able to return to their
Villages and obviously we know how that
played out there is zero right of return
for Palestinians and that has been
something which has been on and off the
negotiation table for decades would be
dead in the water now
um but absolutely it's really it's
really absurd and that is exactly the
the claim that it would help
um and not hinder actually is that this
number is significant to how many people
would be granted the right of return
because there's a huge difference
between 200 and 300 000 and I'm sure
dershowitz does not count you know
children of refugees uh as refugees is
another fantastic Trope yeah among
zionists but something that really
strikes me Beyond just this whole you
know uh Hamas passes out candy in the
street in all of Palestinians are
celebrating when a child is harmed
within Israel from a terror attack which
is absurd and disgusting and racist is
that all Israelis as if there's anything
like Israeli consensus in the first
place such a dumb idea yeah but that
Israelis all mourn when someone is hurt
just this year alone Janine in the last
month and and you know uh January until
now
um there's been about 140 Palestinians
killed in the West Bank and last month I
think we saw
um
I want to say 12 or 13 children under
the age of 16 murdered by Israeli forces
Engineering in this massive
um attack that they have been doing in
the refugee camp there it you know who's
mourning that no one they're talking
about Israeli democracy no one is
mourning that no one is talking about
that there is no and in fact I knew a
number of people who certainly would
celebrate because one less Palestinian
child is one less future terrorist right
yeah that's another thing that's going
on throughout all of this and sometimes
it's so obvious that it's like almost
silly sounding is that dershowitz has
all these double standards like the
first one was like uh the Palestinians
need to stop uh committing acts of
terrorism in order for these agreements
to be made but he never says obviously
the same things about Israel like that
they need to stop terrorizing
Palestinians yeah what is sorry go ahead
yeah I mean to be fair uh to uh uh he
does uh in the opening he he said
um you know he backed off from saying
that right in his opening comments he
said well I guess you can't really do
that because that would give terrorists
veto but you have to you have to like do
certain things to crack down on them
whatever you know it's like of course
um you know oddly enough in the last 20
years there's there's never been a point
where Al dershowitz has said okay you
know that's that's enough I'm satisfied
you know like uh and and there never
will be because it's it's not you know
it's just not a good faith
um
you know I mean there's and it's and
it's silly I mean because there's not
like if you're going to have
um like just the idea that you know the
way to I was I've been watching
um the uh the TV show uh the Americans
uh that's uh that's like the
protagonists are you know all right you
know or KGB agents and there's a uh
there's uh there's a nice scene where a
bunch of Russian uh diplomats are
sitting around a conference table and
they're talking about you know Russian
soldiers being killed in Afghanistan and
like one of them says something that's
considered like really out of order like
he did a big faux pas which is maybe we
should get out of Afghanistan if we
don't want this you know keep happening
right I mean like it's like yeah I mean
I mean people if you have if you have
soldiers who are occupying towns and
enforcing military law and you know
doing things like when there is an
attack uh like like literally like
commandary and like random people's
Apartments you know to uh to use as
military outposts and kicking them out
of their own homes and you know and
doing like of course there are going to
be people who are going to respond
violently to that I mean the idea that
there's a way that like what you're
gonna have like a year of like
occupation with absolutely nobody ever
like shooting at the occupying soldiers
I think the research shows that too that
uh most military a lot of military
intervention
um instigates terrorist attacks 100 and
Israeli counter-terrorist experts know
that very well yeah um the other issue
of course is I think when I was uh not
with you my Zionist uh internet dropped
on me or something uh is that when he
said that um Israel responds with one
arm behind its back oh no that's later I
think oh yeah excuse me
the issue of exactly like the the issue
of um uh what's the word proportionality
is obviously a huge one and I just I
hate that that is one of the the major
tropes and defenses of Israel that not
only are they a moral Army but uh show
massive amounts of restraints I would
say even when that concept is used to
criticize Israel I find it frustrating
when like I you know somebody like you
somebody I like like Bernie Sanders will
use the phrase like disproportionate
force and actually Finkelstein points uh
this out I believe in his book uh on
Gaza where he's like you know if you
shoot a child in the back who's running
away like that's not disproportionate
Force like that's a situation where you
don't have the right to use any Force
thank you yeah and there's no way that
again if we want to play both sides of
the field here that you know Israel has
one of the most advanced armies
militarily of course in the world that
they oopsie accidentally kill lots of
civilians when they're you know doing
um
Air Raids and bombs from above on the
most densely populated place in the
entire world and it's just so convenient
that Hamas is intermixed with all of the
civilians there yeah so the same way
that you know we can question what what
is the definition of a civilian non-uh
militant uh a lots and lots and lots of
the deaths this year have been claimed
you know oh only half of them were
militants but half of those were
children
so it's really absurd and disgusting
yeah and nobody to to your point Madame
nobody would say like
you know it would just sound absurd
rolling off your tongue nobody would say
that like you know if uh you know some
uh you know some military you know
Palestinian group like blows up a
nightclub nobody would say that they use
disproportionate forces
not something you could do right you
know
so so to finkelstein's point that you're
quoting I mean it's not
um you know I mean if you're I mean like
even aside from the operational details
I mean like if if what you're doing is
enforcing what on the most charitable
read-in is a uh long-term occupation of
other people's land and you know and I I
would argue is is more
um you know given how closely integrated
the you know the West Bank uh has you
know has become in almost every way
right to uh to to the rest of Israel
like I think what you know I think it
may be a more accurate way of saying
that would be you know enforcing a um
enforcing a part system a system of you
know of military law and part of the
population and civilian law on the other
like that's that's just not a legitimate
use of violence and so you know it
doesn't you know even if you were trying
to do it you know in the most careful
way possible which is which is
as Jordan says I mean it's not it would
still you know the disproportionality is
is really burying the lead I think uh on
the main problem with that but yeah yeah
uh let's uh let's let's keep watching a
bit more of this yeah the context
we're talking about a variety of The
OJ's trials this is not the o.js we're
not going to play a game well just I'm
playing a game now is your point that
you're citing uh that what you're saying
Norm Finkelstein is in Alan dershowitz's
book the Case for Israel he says two to
three thousand and it's two to three
hundred thousand you're response to it I
urge you that 700
000 Arabs don't change the subjects
obviously the the phrase two to three
thousand Arabs refers either to a sub
phase or is a type of graphical this is
why lawyers have a bad reputation
(Laughter)
because we went like 30 seconds there
but uh if that was obvious why did he
turn down like 10 invitations to read
the sentence from his book why didn't he
just say
urge the sentence from uh from uh from
Benny Morris's book like why didn't he
just say well not sentence he says blah
blah blah and obviously what I meant was
yeah movie hadn't come up with that yet
sure he seems really well prepared for
this point though from the moment that
he starts to change the terms of the the
you know monetary offer to to now
looking constantly at his no it's a not
in a book
it's interesting too that he's he three
things go on he keeps saying uh I have
to check the book yes he wrote and Norm
seemingly has uh like memorized
and uh
yeah and then he all 1854 footnotes in
the Joan Peters book you said but yeah
so then um then he's saying it's either
uh this sub phase that I've like added
to the history or I made a typo
like how how could you not know which
which there is no such thing as this
say two to three hundred thousand yeah
what I was referred to as something yeah
like more of a lawyer than he is a
professor he doesn't have any grasp on
his own numbers he does not have any
grasp on dates truly can we hear about
it like I really want the debate to
pause while we hear about the sub phases
right Betty Boris that you're talking
about doesn't seem to refer to sub
phases no no how are you carving up the
sub phases away and we know from
dershowitz's citation that's how
Finkelstein found this sentence which
which sentence he was talking about the
they're talking about phase two they're
both talking about phase two and
dershowitz is very clear about that in
his book
um
and uh oh what was the second Point
um
uh they're talking about phase two and
also
um Morris is in that sentence he's not
necessarily talking about Arab
commanders asking uh Palestinians to
leave so I think he says it's either a
typo or I was talking about a sub phase
because he just wants to like
sort of leave the impression that
Morris was talking about that and he
said this many people that he goes into
700 000 so he can say well it's just any
little slide within that number oh I was
talking about phase 2A
Texas
which contains sub phase 2A yeah
awesome oh my God all right
because you're playing a game now read
I've read the book twice
that hundreds of thousands in fact I've
read the book six times because I read
Joan Peters four times so if you add the
four times the joke by the way does she
make this point no of course she doesn't
make this point of course she doesn't
because I'm super original now I'm
quoting someone else's book not hers
thank you also I think we skipped over
uh apart like a few seconds where Norm
just keeps saying uh this is why lawyers
have such a bad reputation
is that like a few times he is not wrong
they have to identify so they have to
identify themselves uh we'll come back
uh and uh if you can stay with us for
the show
um we will continue this discussion and
our next guest will ask him to wait and
we'll do an interview after the program
I think this is too important we're
talking to Alan dershowitz his new book
is called the Case for Israel he is
debating Norm Finkelstein his books the
Holocaust industry and image and reality
of the israel-palestine conflict stay
with us

thank you

Peterson


thank you
foreign

you are listening to democracy now
that's the late Frank low on saxophone
I'm Amy Goodman and we're talking with
Professor Alan dershowitz his new book
is called the Case for Israel
um Mario Cuomo writes on the back of it
Alan dershowitz's detailed and
penetrating analysis of the issues that
fuel the continuing war in Israel should
be read by everyone
Norman finkelstein's book The Holocaust
industry has a recommendation on the
back by Raul hillberg who is the leading
Holocaust historian in this country and
he says when I read finkelstein's book
at the time of its appearance I was in
the middle of my own investigations I
came to the conclusion he was on the
right track I refer now to the part of
the book that deals with the claims
against Swiss banks and I'm jumping
ahead he says I am by no means the only
one who in the coming months or yours
will totally agree with finkelstein's
breakthrough
um okay so let me focus on the two the
2000 or 3000 this is such an obvious
point when you think yeah what is the
context
said we're told to leave by their Arab
commanders obviously it's in the
interest of that argument to maximize
the number who would leave only an idiot
would deliberately minimize the number
whose leaves refrain from that homonyms
I'm talking about myself okay I'm
talking about myself now I would have
been an idiot had I used 2000 when the
actual number was two to three hundred
if you wanted to make an accusation you
would say instead of saying two to three
hundred he said four to five hundred
thousand remember the argument the
argument is I'm making is that lots of
the Palestinian refugees who left left
as the result of orders from their
command from their leaders during this
period of time so so my incentive if we
take Mr Finkelstein would be to
exaggerate the number now he accuses me
of reducing the number by a hundred fold
obviously there are only two possible
explanations
why would anyone make
that would hurt their
positions
with all to respect you I would I cannot
understand for the life of me why
someone with your reputation and with
your accomplishments would Cobble
together a fraud that to me is the most
perplexing question let me ask you a
directory
let me just say something we only have
10 minutes
am I right or am I wrong that it would
serve the interest of my argument
rather than to understand
your book is
we're going to go through this in a
civilized way over the next 10 minutes
uh you have uh laid out a challenge
Professor dershowitz on Scarborough
country the program on MSNBC you said if
anyone can find a factual error in the
book and we're not talking spelling
errors
um that you will give um ten thousand
dollars uh sorry yes
okay now I'm going to interrupt um uh
this is a major challenge you've put it
out on television uh Norman Finkelstein
you have laid out one error whoever's
interested served who's ever interested
sir you did respond you said two to
three thousand uh quoting Benny uh
citing Benny Morris the Israeli
historian in fact he said two to three
hundred thousand Arabs now and that and
let me make the point that I do make an
argument here's the argument I make I I
make the argument that the issue is a
complex one of the refugees and that in
fact many of the refugees of the seven
hundred thousand but you're saying of
course and he made a different point
than you he he and he made a point that
strengthens my argument but it's wrong
in Europe whether or not it's
strengthens whether or not it serves
your heart may be very clear if you make
I do make an argument my argument is
very serious when my argument is that
many of the Palestinians were told to
leave by the commanders if the if in
fact two hundred thousand were told to
leave instead of two thousand that
strengthens my argument considerably
that is an argument that I make if the
book says two thousand to three thousand
there are only two explanations either
it is a typographical era or I have to
check the book obviously I was referring
to a smaller phase but it would be
ridiculous for anybody doesn't even know
what is written name
he's talking about it like you would
talk about a book that somebody else
wrote that you were familiar with like
well I assume the author must have meant
either this or that oh if only we had
the author with us in the room so they
can clarify which one they did mean
there's also a book in front of him he
can look at it if he wants to but he
clearly does not they just took a break
so that he could look at his own book
yeah yeah what the he was talking
about yeah yeah I'm sorry I don't know
if I can swear on here but you
absolutely
fine but yes um it's
I mean like again you know like he
should know right if it's Alan
dershowitz either meant to refer to a
sub phase or it was a type of
progressive glare can we ask him yeah
yeah right and not only that like Norm
just said uh the book was published
three months before this that's so
insane you know
wow
like the zero books editing process I
mean this is like uh you know there are
several rounds of back and forth here
yeah I don't know I mean yeah even even
with really small like basically
self-publishing it's like yeah
three months ago you should really know
which one he met if he came up with some
novel system like some novel taxonomy of
sub phases
he shouldn't have just forgotten about
it right
since then and he also maybe should
refer to it in the book somewhere
presumably you remember what you wrote
and what you're citing if you cited it
at all so just unbelievable completely
because I don't believe him that's what
I'm trying to say
no it's amazing that it's like well what
this would have you know this would
strengthen my argument or it wouldn't
strengthen my argument it's like
whatever I mean like like you you wrote
it like it's not true
you know I mean are are you at least
going to take a beat to be like yes
that's not true yeah
exactly if
if Reagan is lying whenever his lips
move then I have the same feeling about
whenever dershowitz Smiles it makes me
really uncomfortable first of all and it
feels really out of place like yeah like
like a little like kid that just got
caught doing something wrong like when
he was talking about it
Sam Hussein
and then he went into this thing about
how that was investigated on German
television oh my God he was smiling like
a madman yeah I'm sure whatever German
television program he watched did just a
Cracker Jack job sure certainly not
biased towards Israel for reasons yeah
yeah which which was like let's really
by the way take a second on that right
because it's like as has any
I mean
like what he's talking about that are we
like yeah like Germany
is I mean you know anybody here is ever
like netany Germans you know that's like
uh you know Germany you know the uh
posts creation of the state of Israel
like the the level of
um enabling enabling like the uh the
level of support like like even even
German far leftists uh tend to be like
crazily pro-israel yeah very few
honorable exceptions like that's uh
that's like the like the German left is
just unlike the left anywhere else
on this topic right so it's like I don't
know I mean the way he keeps saying is a
German it's like I don't know I mean are
there any non-german investigations
always on time and they're always
correct as it happens yeah no and then
the other authority that he cites is
really military like oh yeah we did our
forensics and uh a bullet killed the kid
no can't really figure out where it came
from we they've done that recently with
um the I believe it was an Al Jazeera a
journalist Shireen
who like they're like it was an oopsy
stray bullet but it probably wasn't
meant you know
yeah exactly exactly yeah
and someone else will come out and be
like oh we did research and we you know
consulted with this and that and the
other and like five other organizations
will say that's actually but
you know we'll go with with IDF internal
investigations instead yeah I don't like
the investigation dershowitz's own uh
himself was involved in in the 1990s
that concluded that it was physically
impossible that O.J Simpson's hand could
have you know fitted to that glove right
exactly the same same yeah yeah and
that is one of the moments I think that
creeps me out the most when he smiles is
like it's while he's saying that this
child was like killed what did he say he
also said this like uh 12 year old
whatever kid died
like sad horrifying image and he just
has this huge shit-eating grin on his
face for sure everyone was mourning
about that and making bets on whether or
not it was Israel that makes sense right
yeah we're all so sad and we were all
making yeah mistakes bets on it just
bring me some footage of this please
yeah yeah like a game you know it really
is all just like a game like Finkelstein
is here because he like cares about like
death and destruction you know that's
what it feels like
dershowitz is just like playing around
you know 100 and enjoying himself
yeah I mean if they yeah I mean like the
whole thing is ridiculous I mean as as
you said Jordan it's like given the
number of uh children who have died even
like just this year if uh the entire
nation was was sitting shiv every time
you know like nobody in the country
would ever get to look at a beer you
know ever uh but uh there's also
um and also we should note that over 50
I believe it's over 50 of God's
population is children yeah so like you
know figure out why pretty easily as
well that's something that like we
should think about when it comes to like
the blockade or anything else is like
you you were really like
terrorizing children here yeah you know
and it's it's horrifying yeah totally
all right let's keep watching purpose
would be to overthink okay this is
that's fine okay anybody let's leave
that and go to another point
what I'm going to do for the interest of
time and trying to be respectful of
Professor dershowitz's I'll simply quote
your statements in the book one after
another slowly and you can simply stop
me and say I can prove that or I have
the evidence sure okay simple
page 206 you write Israel is the only
country in the Middle East to have
abolished any kind of torture in fact as
well as in law absolutely okay
absolutely let's start with that one
yeah except that's really Center for
human rights to occupy territories has a
website and I follow it quite closely I
went to the website and I can't double
tending for torture I'll ask again Amy
Goodman rather than myself to Simply
read the first sentence for the latest
issue of that sell them and if she wants
to continue down
um it's called but Salem the Israeli
information center for human rights and
the occupied territories
um please keep in mind he said Mr
dershowitz said in fact as well as in
law please the first uh
headline it says torture interrogation
by torture and absolutely prohibited by
Israeli and international law despite
this Israeli Security Forces breach the
prohibition and torture Palestinians I
don't agree with that I mean we have a
reasonable dispute about that what
Israel does and what Israel did until
1999 the United States is now doing in
Guantanamo that is they put people in
uncomfortable Shabbat positions they put
hoods over their head often foul
smelling hoods they play loud music
there's a cover story in the Atlantic
Monthly this month which talks about
rough interrogation techniques and it
describes what the United States is
doing and it says that Israel used to do
that some possibility continues to do it
that's simply not the kind of torture
that international law prohibits and in
fact my point is
in Jordan torture is routine in Egypt
it's routine definitely the Israeli
Spirit took an extraordinarily
courageous decision in 1999 I command
everybody to read it it's online in
which Justice Aaron Barack said that as
a democracy we must fight terrorism with
one hand tied behind our back but in the
end we have the upper hand because we
comply with the rule of law Israel is to
be commended for its attempt to regulate
and control the torture of ticking bomb
terrorists I'm very stand by yours
and and that the Supreme Court has
abolished it and if anybody were to
engage in an active that cost they would
be in contention
International who I know you think is an
untrustworthy Source Human Rights Watch
that sell them they all reach the same
conclusion and they're wrong Israel
still continues to practice torture oil
you can say they're wrong but let's be
clear describe what Israel does
what are you defining I'm not I'm not an
expert in the topic you certainly are
not making an accusation I don't make
the accusation Mr dershow it's your
confusing things I go to the mainstream
respected human rights organizations and
I look at what they say let me talk
about it by the international City
Amnesty International recently positive
aharan Barack should not receive
um I thought it was really skillful just
as like for people who are like
interested in debating and stuff uh I
thought it was really skillful that
Finkelstein uh made sure to bring uh to
everyone's attention that dershowitz
said in fact as well as in law yeah I've
actually noticed that phrase in like
many lawyer slash historians and uh I
think uh I've seen it in uh Kissinger's
work several times
um it's weird that
um I I don't all I often don't really
know what is meant by it or like why
both are said but I think well I think I
think the idea is just like they're it's
it's very easy like I'm sure like I
wouldn't be surprised in the least if
like in Saddam Hussein's Iraq there were
some like statue in the books that said
you couldn't torture prisoners right it
just doesn't mean anything right you
know yeah yeah does it mean anything and
and dershowitz's point is to claim
falsely that that's
that's not the case here and of course
you know I mean I think Norm is trying
for the sake of time and for the sake of
just like being like not getting bogged
down on the weeds and staying at his
point to just say look here are the most
respected human rights organizations
they all say this this is just a
straight like you know I think I think
he has a good instinct to focus on the
main point but also we obviously know
God damn well that there is lots of
stuff that in 2003 or for that matter in
2023 that the IDF was doing to prisoners
in the West Bank that goes Way Beyond
whatever yeah definitely I just think it
was really skillful that he anticipated
that dershowitz's first counter argument
was going to be it's not illegal sure no
because
it this way then it must be okay no I
think that's a really interesting point
I was also kind of stuck on the uh
that little comment that he made and I
think you know it's like in inferior and
in practice but what good is a law that
isn't in force like that should be
understood necessarily yeah and also
like you didn't say anything about
whether it was legal or not in fact you
specifically said it's not happening
regardless of whether it's legal exactly
sure they don't even they so good they
don't even need
I already just moral you know principles
not to engage in such things but then he
also says that they're making a good
effort for it it's like you know it's
just really hard not to torture people
is this like instinct that you have to
yeah right train within yourself make
sure that you give them like pleasantly
scented um hoods I guess or you know the
Abu gray Hospitality that we know and
love Yeah like he said like they had to
make good faith efforts not to torture
people like what why never happens
no don't torture this time Jordan you
just gotta sit on your hands
yeah
I'm just constantly going through life
making good faith efforts not to torture
accessory
it's not what he said in the book right
you can say in the book Israel's made
good faith efforts out torture people he
said it doesn't torture people exactly
absolutely there's always some sort of
like Niner yeah it doesn't even care for
people legally
yeah yeah
uh exactly I should say since we are
getting close to the end of part one uh
that if you are a patron you should
already have a link to the post game
where we'll watch part two uh in your
inbox or if it's not go to patreon if
you're not a patron patreon.com Ben
Burgess you get uh these post games
after the main shows on Mondays and
Thursdays you get the Discord server you
get uh many many things most importantly
our undying love and gratitude uh for uh
helping uh to uh helping to keep this
going
uh but uh meanwhile uh let's uh let's
watch the last few minutes of part one
an international prize because
he doesn't believe in in human rights he
is one of the greatest Advocates of
Human Rights they also amnesty also let
me ask you a question I'm going to
interrupt for a second because you're on
another point right but selam you just
think that selum is wrong no but selum
is wrong okay
they Define torture in a way next to
conclude what the United States is doing
we have four minutes
so we're just supposed to take it as a
given that nothing that happened in
Guantanamo could definitely count as
torture you're right and again again
even if you are somebody who thinks that
uh that is legal under the letter of the
law
it's still torture
you know yeah if it mattered so deeply
you know you wouldn't ask what your
definition of torture is right there is
torture we're not doing it yeah and
again I mean it's like this does he
seriously think that Bensalem doesn't
think that like anybody gets their
fingernails yanked out you know and
detention cells in the West Bank come on
um that's it is also really funny in
light of recent events in Israel to go
back and watch this how much emphasis
dershowitz places on the Supreme Court
and uh and the the check that it plays
in uh in human rights abuses
um that's uh the the 2023 version of
Alan dershowitz in this debate would be
deprived of that argument
yeah I mean
consistent with the rest of it I mean he
said somewhere in the beginning I don't
remember if he paused for this that he
thinks a two-state solution is
inevitable and it's difficult
that mean Jesus
argue now that it's like maybe almost
impossible now it's completely untenable
and I can't imagine that dershowitz
would would say you know it would always
come with a caveat like it's inevitable
uh except if we don't have proper
Palestinian leadership in which case or
in or if the Palestinians stop using
terrorism or whatever yeah I mean we're
on 20 years straight since he said that
which has continued to be evident right
you know that's not yeah yeah you know
it's uh it sure doesn't seem inevitable
and yes I I'm completely with you uh
Maddie I I wrote a
I wrote an article uh for uh for Jacobin
in 2020 I think it was like late summer
2020 I remember having a huge argument
with
um
uh with David Feldman about it on uh on
on his show uh
what's that a real argument a real one
not like a I wasn't having an argument
with one of David's characters
uh the uh uh called
um Israel doesn't have a right to exist
but Israelis and Palestinians do uh that
like made a lot of you know like made a
lot of the basic points about the
absurdity of uh of the idea of doing a
two-state solution at this point because
we are you know at that point well God
2020 and so that was uh 53 years into
the process of uh integration of this
territory into Israel which it is for
really practically every purpose except
for giving citizenship to uh
Palestinians who uh who live there if
you are a Jewish settler and you live in
any of these same towns the West Bank uh
you if you commit a crime uh your uh
you're prosecuted under Israeli civilian
law uh you can vote in Israeli elections
you're protected by the IDF outside of
the green line as well yeah yeah you're
protected by the IDF you have a uh
you're
um like you could I mean or or I mean
really like to to put a really fine
point on it right they uh if
you know if uh somebody like anybody
who's watching uh who uh who qualifies
under the law of return uh wanted to uh
to immigrate to Israel tomorrow you
wouldn't have to make us like you
wouldn't have to like spend a year first
establishing your residency on uh within
you know quote unquote Israel proper
right you know you could just go
straight to a West Bank settlement and
live there because for every legal
purpose living there is considered to be
living in Israel there's a uh that's
that's like for every legal purpose
except giving the Palestinians well it's
not just for the sake of individuals
it's for the end goal of further
annexation of the West Bank of course I
think the last count we're at more than
um half a million no what am I talking
about yeah I think it's almost three
quarter million um settlers within West
Bank and the local One Heights currently
which is a huge expansion from even the
last five years yeah which is also the
part of the absurdity of of this and um
like
you know don't get me wrong you know
like one state solution is also you know
if anything maybe you know right now
given current realities into harder to
imagine but like just logistically like
at this point a two-start solution would
mean uh that I mean it's it's kind of
funny in a way that that's the sort of
like you know moderate reasonable view
that you know that you're not you know
that you're not considered a possible
anti-semite if you say is the one that
like in order to implement in any
meaningful way you'd have to
so it wasn't just like a two-state
solution for a bunch of disconnected
cantons in uh in the West Bank plus you
know Gaza obviously totally disconnected
for the whole thing yeah and contiguous
how exciting yeah exactly right if it
wasn't just that to implemented any
meaningful way to do the reasonable
moderate one you'd have to deport uh
several hundred thousand people uh from
uh from this territory right like that
which is actually you know on the face
of it much more extreme than just saying
hey you've got this de facto State
that's existed for the longest time
that's been completely integrated for
the longest time just give everybody
their equal rights and you know I
promise you this guy would not fall if
that happened you know they would
um
you know there uh there would be like uh
you know there were there would be more
error parties and you'd have to uh you
know like you'd have to uh to you know
to include in coalitions and stuff and
uh but uh there was uh this this sort of
idea that this would be this apocalyptic
scenario that
um you know that would like somehow lead
to a power to a uh to like a state of
affairs where what would at that point
only be the Jewish 47 or whatever
would be completely disempowered no
that's that that's exactly the issue is
that even in the most like you know
idealistically Democratic scenario Jews
would still be obsessed with race and
demographics
well yeah they would still want to
maintain power somehow yeah and I mean
and again I mean if we're talking about
ethnic voting blocks I mean if it is
like 47 or whatever that's that's quite
a voting block you know that's uh you
know like I I think this idea that it's
like oh that would suddenly mean that
Israeli Jews have absolutely no power in
this state sure and are subject to
possible genocide all this stuff is you
know all this stuff is ridiculous but
well currently Israel you know parties
with era parties that want to form
within Israel have to
um confirm to Israel as a Jewish and
Democratic state which is to ask them to
agree to nonsense
potentially as well and the the ones who
who managed to do that aren't well loved
by the people that they're meant to
represent so good all right let's keep
going number two you write on page 126.
there is no evidence that Israeli
soldiers deliberately killed even a
single civilian in Janine absolutely now
Mr dershowitz I looked carefully at your
book you don't like Amnesty
International I'm a member you don't
like I'm a member I know but that's a
question of Israel
I like amnesty many instances
you don't particularly like that I do
like the challenge if I were an Israeli
I'd belong to those words so don't
characterize I read your book or the
book you purport to have written and now
you're claiming somebody else I hope so
for your sake I truly hope you did not
write that book I proudly wrote it I
think
say I didn't write the book I had no
time to read it I'm sorry I wrote every
word that would be the honorable I urge
okay you've made the
points
quotes Human Rights Watch yes they put
out an extensive report on Janine
now Human Rights Watch you know where in
your book mentioned nowhere
let's see what Human Rights Watch
concluded on Janine quote
there's Prima fascia evidence that
Israel committed quote war crimes in
Janine further quote and I want everyone
to listen carefully
many of the civilian killings documented
by Human Rights Watch amounted to
unlawful or willful killings by the IDF
please listen to the words
and very directly and then and then
Human Rights Watch copiously documents
multiple cases of willful killings by
Israel what did Mr dershowitz write I'm
sorry
there is not a single case yeah you want
not only
but let me tell you why I make my point
I make my point because there is
absolutely no incentive for the United
States or for Israel or for any other
democracy ever willfully to kill an
innocent civilian every time an innocent
civilian is killed it hurts Israel it
hurts it domestically it hurts it no no
no let me finish my point it hurts it
internationally now everything this is
like anthropomorphic Jewish mother that
he makes Israel into every time like oh
my heart I can't believe we oh no not
one of the children yeah also I have no
incentive to smoke cigarettes
uh sure yeah
every uh yeah no uh God yeah no I mean
like look
do you seriously think that this is like
whiskey this class right now I mean like
do you know what every glass of that
does to my liver come on I wouldn't do
that oh
apple juice uh yeah no it's it's
also I was also wondering during during
his uh during like this important part
of his biography where he was bravely
opposed to the war in Vietnam in his
head
um did uh did it did that opposition
have something to do with the idea that
the United States was killing innocent
people in Vietnam like it is why would
this argument apply there I doubt it I
think that he probably was opposed to it
for like strategic reasons not for like
I guess assuming for the sake of
argument that he was actually opposed to
any way she performed
he's clearly demonstrating that he's a
huge humanitarian here he doesn't even
believe in the concept of hurting other
people it can't happen just doesn't ever
happen also why why does this incentive
only apply to Israel I mean when like
would like yeah does it uh doesn't like
Hamas lose reputation around the world
over time it kills the civilian like
like no that's the huge double standard
of course it's always with the
implication that the other side is not
holding itself
the double standards are are Relentless
in part two I you not he will claim
that Newton's law of physics
he he basically argues that Newton's law
of physics uh applies to the
Palestinians and not the Israelis
because he argues that the Palestinians
uh we should count Israeli civilian
deaths when Palestinians shoot guns into
the air uh but figelstein later says
that you should do the same thing with
Israelis and uh
and then he's like uh well people fire
for lots of reasons they've set fire
warning shots like they've you know
gender reveal parties
(Laughter)
uh oh yeah apply to Israel he's like
well the military shoots up in the air
and all over the place for lots of
reasons you can't count every bullet but
if it's Palestinians firing guns off in
the air Hebrew he specifically mentions
Newton's law of physics and then makes
makes an argument right after that that
you should not apply that to Israel it's
not wrong Israeli soldiers fire warning
shots into knees not there
um yeah yeah
but Finkelstein is like by that logic if
you use
a million bullets on Palestine that's by
your logic that's a million casualties
yeah yeah saying wow I'm you know this
is going to be difficult to get through
Urban guerrilla warfare will
inadvertently kill civilians but the
very idea that an Israeli soldier who
are trained in the idea of the Holiness
of arms who get better training about
avoiding civilians
who are punished for killings
there's a very lovely Bar Mitzvah speech
Let's see what the Human Rights Watch
wrote
listen carefully
a 57 year old
wheelchair-bound man
who was shot and run over by a tank on a
major road outside the camp on April 10
even though he had a white flag attached
to his wheelchair that sounds pretty
deliberate to me if it's true the
Israeli the whole world is lying only
Joan Peters tells the truth first of all
Joe Peters uh has never written about
this issue this issue is one where of
course not only the Israeli military but
the United States has investigated you
mean the United Nations has investigated
Janine uh some of this they make up that
example is clear some of the same human
rights make up that example first said
that Human Rights Watch make up their
example no no that was human rights you
said they were giving it to them
I'm not except for shaming your
Instagram
let me ask this question did you
investigate the Human Rights Watch of
course I did and I read you found that
to be English right on that to be
incorrect not only that the United
States government has found that to be
incorrect on that note uh we have to
wrap up the show I want to thank you
both to people for being with us Alan
dershowitz the Case for Israel Norman
spinkelstein the Holocaust industry
um you decide our website
www.democracynow.org I'm Amy Goodman
thanks for joining
hesitation before she says you decide uh
you decide you know what it
(Laughter)

no that okay so uh so yeah there is a
part two so we're gonna go to the post
game for patrons in a minute watch part
two uh I guess maybe you know my last
thought before I go to you guys uh for
the main show is
uh you know earlier Norm at the
beginning
uh said something was funny so it's like
yeah maybe Reed is pretty anti-semitic
if anybody but the most Jewish man alive
had uh had said it uh about you know the
um about you know dershowitz you know
being like a You Know download scheister
and um and and I was just thinking
though during that whole thing about
torture that
um
you know that's his argument actually
there is a very talmotic ring to it you
know there's a uh there's a point in uh
in the talmud where there's like a
specific uh carve out for
um uh you know saying uh that
um saying at a wedding you know that the
the bride is beautiful that like no
matter what she looks like that's okay
because uh all brides are legally
beautiful and uh you can't see their
face anyway so it's a good guess and
whole thing about how nothing that's
going on at Guantanamo Bay could
possibly be torture you know that
there's a uh that like well if this is
what the US does I mean that's that's
not torture that's like uh that that
does very much have the ring to it of
all brides are legally beautiful that
it's like everything that the United
States does is you know is legally not
you know is like definitionally not
torture which is impressive because we
know that the US military isn't even the
most moral army in the world at best it
could be number two
indeed well Israel is a shining example
of the oligoym you know light into the
Nations that's written in in some place
in the Bible so what's probably thinks
that it's legally fact as well
God damn yeah um I had a couple quick
things that
um
uh I think that there's a lot of
crosstalk and
um it's really easy to miss I didn't
even notice this until like after
watching the debate three or four times
uh at some point when they're like
yelling at each other dershowitz uh says
to Finkelstein or he starts to say the
Finkel scene I have hand handwritten
first drafts when Finkelstein starts
accusing him of not having written the
book
dershowitz slips in a comment where he
says I have handwritten first drafts I
can show you he says it really fast and
they're both talking so it's really hard
to catch
um and I actually asked Norm like uh
you know did you ever ask him to like
produce those because uh you know I'm
suspicious of that and
it's a I don't know it's a weird thing
to say uh but anyway Norm's answer was
uh like of course I asked him for the
handwritten first draft and like of
course he didn't produce it it's not
surprising but I did think it was
important to note because
you know it's easy to miss I heard that
Norm got his hands on on some sort of
coffee draft early on where he found
like literally the substantiation of
plagiarism where he was uh telling the
researchers like go to x page of the
um
I want to say Joan Rivers so bad
I would love to hear her take on all of
this too of course no no I was a you
know he really he really did the thing
that he was accused of and denied so
heavily
I also I also really like uh to you so
you you investigated what the you know
the Human Rights Watch example of course
I did it's like really so so because
like we just heard a minute ago that
Human Rights Watch isn't even mentioned
in your book uh where you're making this
claim right so it's like it's weird that
you went through all that work to like
look at what Human Rights Watch had said
that contracts what you said of the book
you found some sort of independent
evidence that you were wrong that they
were wrong and then you didn't throw it
in a footnote or something yeah of
course you would join but sell them uh
if you were in Israel you know I think
they're wrong but I would totally join
the organization given the opportunity
he just likes to join things you know
so I did find when I asked Norm he said
of course I asked him for the
handwritten version and of course he
didn't send it
fair enough yeah all right uh let's uh
let's go to uh let's go to the post game
uh so uh which yes hilariously the uh
the post and patreon says uh I was I was
guessing maybe by 10 30. we uh east east
coast time would be in uh in the uh the
post game uh we have uh sailed right
past that but we do want to go uh we do
want to go now because we do want to
check out uh Parts uh part two so I will
see people on the other side left is
best
foreign

thank you
