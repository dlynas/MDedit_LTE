Transcript:
(00:20) Before the colonization our people had their own life, their own world outlook. Yet, when the colonizers arrived, we lost everything. They imposed a foreign life upon us, foreign thoughts as well. But we have managed to win our freedom back. Mexico is a country with colonial past. Its indigenous population has blended with European colonizers.
(00:58) And this is what indigenous population is today. Currently, indigenous peoples constitute 15% of Mexico's population and include 62 ethnic groups speaking 364 dialects. The share of indigenous population increases towards the south and reaches 50% in the southeastern states. Quintana Roo, Yucatán, Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas are the states with the largest share of population speaking indigenous languages.
(01:35) Those states are the poorest and rank last in terms of socioeconomic indicators, such as… the share of population, whose income is below minimum wage, the share of population without access to healthcare, the share of population without education, … have no running water, … have dirt floor. That is, the indigenous population of Mexico has much lower living standard than the rest of the country.
(02:15) Despite poverty, there is less crime in those states, compared to the national level. Chiapas is Mexico's safest state. Lacandon Jungle is the remotest region of Mexico. Indigenous people from across the whole state have been coming here seeking for land unappropriated by great landowners. This triggered the growth of the towns bordering selva Las Margaritas, Altamirano, Ocosingo, Palenque, and San Cristóbal.
(03:04) However, the new settlers continued facing oppression. Landless peasants were organizing into peasant unions. This is how there appeared a secret resistance group… Zapatista Army of National Liberation, or EZLN. In order for them to see us, we covered our faces; so that they would call us by name, we gave up our names; we bet the present to have the future; and to live... we died.
(03:39) Attention! This is radio Zapata, southeastern front of EZLN. Zapatista Army of National Liberation. The Declaration of Lacandon Jungle. Today we say "Basta!" We are the true heirs of our ancestors. Today we have taken up arms to conduct a revolution, to achieve peace and justice in Chiapas and in Mexico.
(04:27) Long live the Revolution! Long live Zapatista Army of National Liberation! Long live Chiapas! Long live Mexico! Thank you, comrades! What we did in 1994 was yet another battle in the war of the bottom against the top, against their world, in the war for humanity and against neoliberalism. This war gave us a chance to reach the ears and hearts of near and distant geographies.
(05:22) This is an insurgent movement. Our organization is called Zapatista Army of National Liberation. The majority of its commanders come from indigenous ethnic groups: Tzotzil, Tzeltal, Ch'ol, Tojolobal, Zoque, and Mam. We used to be isolated in the past. While in the rest of the world peoples were fighting dictatorships, or what seemed as dictatorship, this country's dictatorship was flourishing.
(05:59) 15 thousand indigenous people are dying in Chiapas each year. The same amount of people died during the war in Salvador. Yet, here, all those who died were on the same side, and what is even worse, the majority died of diarrhea and other curable diseases. Previously, the indigenous did not have rights.
(06:31) They were not a part of society. There were a lot of caciques. Caciques owned the land and employed the indigenous for seasonal work. Chiapas had been living like that for decades. In the past, they would come on foot caring sacks with corn and other goods. Back then there were four or five roads that peasants could use to come to the town.
(07:14) They were humble, did not speak Spanish, only their own languages. And town dwellers were setting the price for their goods. What could be more unjust? How could they know the real price? Previously, only mestizos were allowed to walk on pavements. And that is how it worked everywhere. A lot of bad things were happening back then.
(07:45) In 1994, there spread a rumor in the town that there appeared some people who were preparing for guerilla. And the people from our circle began to talk about a revolution. We participated in forcing Zapatistas back into the jungle. They occupied the town and the government sent us. We were just following orders.
(08:18) We were sent to Chiapas,they said there was an armed conflict there, and that was it. We were asked to walk the streets of San Cristóbal and Ocosingo, and we walked them. Yes, there were casualties in Ocosingo, bodies were being found, both civilians and Zapatistas. The army forced Zapatistas back into the mountains.
(08:56) Chiapas has had this since the old times, the element of repression. The whole of Mexico was one big fiefdom with its wardens and stewards. It was a feudal structure, in which a president and a governor are regarded as commanders. They rule the country and make people work for others' profit. Back in the 1960-s there were attempts to find a new form of relations.
(09:38) They materialized in 1974, at the Indigenous Congress. And this is an ongoing process. 20 years had passed from 1974 until 1994 when people banded together. We would like to speak on behalf of our peoples. We see that it does not matter, whether we are informed, or are given voice by the rulers. We must claim our rights, we need to consolidate from within, consolidate in fight and solidarity.
(10:30) Since 1974, when the indigenous national consciousness was only awaking, since then, the indigenous people's self-perception has radically changed. They acquired dignity. The rights violations are still taking place, but they are being concealed, and this is not normal. Ultimately, all the conflicts and rights violations are connected to land and territory.
(11:02) Based on the territory, they revive politics, society, culture, economy and ecology of the indigenous peoples. We will give our lives for our land, but we will protect it from the ambitions of governments and money owners, who want to build expensive hotels, golf courses and highways. This colonization has been going on since Creoles, Spaniards, then liberals, and now - neoliberals.
(11:39) We are still forced to make decisions that harm people. There will be no more Mexico without us! Comrades, brothers and sisters, thank you! Brothers and sisters from Zapatista Army, from the General Headquarters, we thank you! We, Zapatista Army of National Liberation are telling about everything that is taking place in all corners of our motherland, Mexico.
(12:30) We must protect ourselves regardless of any consequences. This military conflict was never resolved. And I believe that many participants may have no idea about this. The war generates new threats of repressions and prosecution of indigenous activists, who are seeking their own methods of resistance. I had a feeling that we have friends in resistance that, in spite of pain and sufferings from oppression and indignation, there are many active people moving forward.
(13:21) We hope to leave this place, having turned into real revolutionary soldiers, whose weapon is justice and honesty. See you tomorrow at two. Usually this meeting is organized for the orientation of international observers, the participants of civil brigades. So, you come here to learn basic facts, right? I can provide you some general information about the conflict in Chiapas.
(14:12) This zone was considered as Zapatistas' sphere of influence. The army came here and adopted offensive disposition. They set up military camps, which are still there. At the same time various paramilitary groups appeared in different regions. This became obvious after the murder in Acteal. On 22 December 1997, a group of armed people came to Acteal and killed everyone who stayed there.
(14:51) Acteal was a refugee camp. People were leaving their villages, because the were facing an ultimatum: either join paramilitaries, or die. This is why people were seeking shelter. Previously, there were no houses here, just this church. Those are bullets. They were hiding there. Both men and women, everyone who stayed there were shot dead.
(15:50) They were left there, all 45 people. There were 45 people: men, women and children. At that time there were around 14 thousand refugees, and this is only for the north and the state's highlands. The victims were the members of a civil society group called "The Bees". This organization had always declared their adherence to pacifism.
(16:39) They were agreeing with EZLN's demands, but did not accept their militarized methods. Back then dialogues with the government were taking place here in San Cristóbal, in the cathedral. Here it was decided to consider EZLN demands. It was decided to have another round of talks. And EZLN prepared a location for meeting the government delegation.
(17:10) They called this place Aguascalientes. There is a town in Mexico called Aguascalientes. The resolution of the 1910 Revolution was adopted there. This name was chosen to indicate a place where compromise can be achieved. Instead of a compromise, however, the federal government ordered arrest of EZLN's General Command.
(17:39) Lots of soldiers came, they occupied schools and municipalities, those places where people usually gathered. And the people began to leave. It became necessary to organize civil brigades that would help people return to their homes. Eventually, after 4 months of intensive negotiations, the San Andrés agreements were signed.
(18:14) Papers were delivered to the federal government and returned in a month, with "minor amendments." In response, EZLN said: "this is not a game", "this is not what we signed." And that is how the opportunity of a dialog with the government was lost. At that time San Andrés agreements began to be implemented on the territories controlled by the resistance.
(18:38) EZLN presents five Aguascalientes to the world 1 - La Realidad, Border Jungle Zone 2 - Oventic, Highlands Zone 3 - Roberto Barrios, North Zone 4 - Morelia, Northern Jungle Zone 5 - La Garrucha, Jungle Zone They were creating autonomous municipalities, which was in accordance with San Andrés agreements. In 2003, EZLN announced the end of Aguascalientes.
(19:20) This marked a change in their policy. They said that Caracols would be created in the same locations as replacements, they would become the meeting points of EZLN with the civilian population. Caracol, or Snail, is a place not only for Zapatistas, but also for visitors. For example, you are in one such Caracols right now.
(20:01) This is the place from which our words spread around the world Those words originate in this tiny village, but you will disseminate it and the Caracol will become bigger. We have chosen the name of this little animal. It moves very slowly, but it moves forward. This is what we have borrowed from the snail.
(20:31) Our resistance is similarly unhurried, but we are moving only forward. Formerly, this area did not require any observers. But now the situation has become complicated. That is why we are here. The topic of indigenous population's rights in Latin America has always interested me. In San Cristóbal it is possible to get closer to this cause.
(21:02) I like this kind of lifestyle. I would also like other people to know about it. I think one taxi should fit all three of you. I got interested in this topic, because Zapatism is similar to utopia. So much time has passed, so much struggle, and such permanency trying to implement an idea. They will tell you where to spend the night.
(21:31) Then they will pick you up and bring you to the village. Observers, please, come this side, then families will be presented. This is how we are going to make groups I am a displaced person. I've spent 6 months in Acteal Right now we are in the community called Puebla
(22:41) We used to have problems while living here. Two commune houses were burnt together with the walls of our new building. We had to leave, we couldn't stand so many threats to our lives. We couldn't stand the pain. Could you tell me what happened? They came to Juan's home, broke in, grabbed him and beat him.
(23:24) Juan's son was pressed behind the table. Then, community's commissar came. He told Juan "If you join us, you will be OK. If not - we'll throw you behind the bars, since you are a part of the organization." I was told: "You are on Catholics' side, on Zapatista's' side, let's burn them, pour petrol over them, throw them in jail.
(24:01) " This is when I started crying. Maybe they told you about this already, and this is important, don’t walk alone, neither you, nor him. Both of you are in danger. You can't continue living as you used to. That is why you have here friends who share your views. Civil brigades, national and international, accompany indigenous farmers' families that temporarily returned to their lands after being forcefully displaced.
(24:39) Puebla community, Chenalhó municipality, Chiapas, Mexico 99 people, indigenous farmers, men, women and children abandoned these lands in June-August 2013 threatened by prosecution and manifest aggression. They are coming back to their Puebla community, Chenalhó municipality, Chiapas, for harvesting coffee.
(25:22) This is the product that supports me and my family. Profit from harvest is used to sustain the family, to buy maize, beans and clothes. I was away for six months and could not take care of the plantation. It needs to be cleaned three times a year, three times a year it needs to be looked after. If this is done, the harvest will be good.
(25:51) The coffee turns out to be of a higher category. Instead, I lost around 15 sacks of coffee. Each sack is 60 kilos - 900 kilos all in all, that's how much I lost. The price for coffee is 30 peso. 900 kilos multiplied by 30 is… I don't even know how much is it... On behalf of the law enforcement
(27:09) we guarantee political intention to achieve peaceful resolution for Puebla community. This looks like a celebration. They think there is no violence in this community. We will build the peace together, for the benefit of our community, because "Chiapas unites us," as the governor likes to say. I am in a different community right now, and I see all the violence that is taking place here.
(27:57) Because almost the same was happening in 1997, when they murdered people in Acteal Everything started here, in Puebla community. A man called Jacinto Arias headed the paramilitaries, who killed 45 people in Acteal. We know that the government only talks and does not deliver on its promises. &
(28:32) quot;... masks cuase nice ideological effect and correspond to our conception that Revolution must not be individualized." They killed him, ruthlessly, with unprecedented hatred, teacher Galeano. After this the Councils of Good Government decided that violence had crossed all acceptable limits, and handled the problem over to EZLN General Command, which is stationed at La Realidad right now for investigating the incident.
(29:27) You should not pay too much attention to me. As the last 20 years have shown, I don’t understand anything about mass media. The thing is that "Sup" began to attract too much attention. The character has been created and now we, Zapatistas, its creators decided to get rid of it. We began to wait for a suitable moment - an exact calendar date and geography - to show who we really are for those, the real ones, who would understand us.
(29:54) And just now Galeano pointed at this geography and calendar with his death: "here and now, in La Realidad, in pain and revolt" EZLN cannot interfere in community's life
(32:00) at its own discretion. Here, the people rule, while the government merely obeys! That is why we, Zapatistas, do not fight for power, neither at elections, nor with arms. We exist because the people decided to live without politicians, who only lie and disrespect. And we are protecting our own people. The most important for us are our comrades Zapatistas, men and women.
(32:43) They are our strength, our subsistence, our fate. They are us. Comrades, we have come here to resurrect teacher Galeano. Soon you will know how. Our commitments and our practice tell us that for a struggle there is no need in leaders, caudilhos, messiahs or saviors. One merely needs a bit of shame, some dignity and lot of good organization for putting up a struggle.
(33:28) We believe that one of us must die, so that Galeano could live. That is why we decided that Marcos will cease to exist today. When the world was asleep and did not want awake, the great gods gathered to discuss their business. That is when they decided to create the world, and to create men and women.
(34:12) The gods wanted to make people beautiful and long-lived, that is why they made people out of gold. But the golden people neither moved nor worked, because they were too heavy. Then the gods gathered again to resolve this problem. They agreed to create other people. The made them out of wood. They were of wooden color, they walked and worked a lot.
(34:47) And the gods were pleased, and almost started to celebrate, when they noticed that the golden people make the wooden people work for them. Thus, the gods decided to make people out of corn, good people, the real men and women. The corn people had their own language, they could negotiate and come to agreements.
(35:15) And these people went into the mountains to find the right path for all mankind. I asked old man Antonio "What was the color of the corn people?" He showed me different kinds of corn of various colors and told me that they are of all colors, no one knows which for sure, because the corn people, real men and women, did not have faces.
(35:39) if you want to see who's hidden behind the mask, then take a mirror and look at yourself. This organization is standing out not only because of their motives or ideological commitments. They implement their ideas in practice. Productive autonomy. Capability to sustain life through autonomy. Productive autonomy seems to be a key to Zapatista's organizations.
(36:16) They can be totally independent from both the government and the market. They themselves can create everything, they bring forward as a demand. I understood another thing here. We still have a lot of work and self-organization ahead of us to keep up with Zapatistas on our path towards so ambitious happiness.
(36:40) To make a different world possible, a world, which can fit many more worlds. These are, of course, some very ambitious expectations. Our private desires are tiny in comparison. We want a stable job, an apartment and a car. Those desires are so down to earth. We are having a special offer: If you buy 2 bottles of soda, you get a pack of rice, water and a bucket as presents.
(37:15) The strategy of autonomous town projects anticipates the refusal to participate in state activities and the market, it creates new forms of relations, it demands daily creative response to challenges, alternative thinking, which transcends the borders of predetermined logic, the rejection of consumerism, imposed by market society, a new perspective on our life, to have a possibility to reject that what we don't like and to recreate what we love.
(38:06) Most of the people here are not locals. Oftentimes, they are attracted by the forms, and not the meaning, which is not always visible. Attractive forms become the protection from the governments' military aggression, be it in Mexico or Chile. Zapatism cannot be exported. That's what they say themselves.
(38:28) Everyone has to fight in their own locality. In any kind of struggle, one could use the example of Chiapas' resistance, organization and the fact that
(39:34) people can actually unite and fight for their rights. If everyone is here, let's call the comrades. Is everyone here? Yes! OK, we'll call them now. Here we will meet the people in charge from all three levels of Zapatista's autonomous government, while we are here at school. Very good afternoon, comrades, men and women
(40:59) from different countries and states I am happy to share with you. Bad capitalists are telling us, that women are useless. But this is not true. Sometimes our women don't know how to read or write, don't speak the second language, Spanish. But we still can carry responsabilities and find new ways to improve women' participation.
(41:49) One important achievement of the armed rebellion was the freedom for all Zapatistas to build our own autonomy and self-government with both men and women. We declared that we would no longer depend from the corrupt system. And there emerged a need to form three levels of government. We are referring to three echelons: local government, municipal government, and zonal level.
(42:35) The first, local level is a group of comrades. The local level is a group of families living in a particular locality. Yes, there are villages, where only 2-3 comrades are living, while the majority is party-affiliated, we don’t consult with them. Those who participate directly in EZLN's internal proceedings are called "support bases.
(43:12) " So, they choose their representative, and that is what we call local government. The local representative coordinates and promotes people's will. Then, there follows municipal government. Autonomous insurgent municipalities. Every municipality has a he adquarters, where its employees meet, and where one could come to raise issues and bring suggestions.
(43:45) Those who work at the municipal level are resolving the problems that were not resolved in the villages. And every issue requires consultations. If necessary, the village representative goes back to the village to consult with village-mates regarding municipality's suggestions. Representative says: "we decided so and so, but we are not sure if the villagers would agree with us.
(44:15) And the next level is the Councils of Good Government the most advanced one. This level is formed by groups of autonomous municipalities. Some zones have 5 municipalities, some - 4, 7 or 9, depending on the size of a zone. This is the structure of our government: local, municipal and zonal levels, the latter being the Councils of Good Government.
(44:53) All the government at all the three levels must operate in strict accordance with seven principles called "Govern, while obeying". Suggest, but do not impose; Represent, but do not replace; Build, but do not ruin; Obey, but do not dictate; Descend to the people, but do not dominate; Persuade, but do not defeat; Serve the others, but not yourself.
(45:26) These are the principles that any government must comply with. A - autonomy E - education I - ideas O - organization U - unity Many people are joining resistance here, but it needs to be serious.
(46:30) We must reject government's help. Many people receive pensions here. 500 or 1000 peso. They fight for other things, because they are paid, and they are happy about it. We are different. If we have money, it is for our work on the land. This is where prosperity comes from, from constantly working on the land.
(47:26) In villages, in municipalities, at the zonal level, all Zapatista's zones. We organize collective work. While working collectively, we produce goods. When we sell them, we earn money. Most of the profit from collective works goes for representatives' transportation, for petrol and fees. For instance, works in corn fields.
(48:04) If a comrade is a part of the committee and needs food, we help with grain. If a collective is doing handicraft, their products are being sold, and the earned money can be invested into other products. If there is some profit remaining from the works, the representative gathers all the families of the support base and they make a decision how to use that profit, where to invest it.
(48:47) My name is Anna Aurelia, I am a representative of my collective. We breed cattle. Initially we bred birds, but this did not generate profit. Then, we made a decision to sell all the birds, and to buy a calf. But this was not enough. And then we made another decision to grow chili. Having sold the chili, we bought more cattle.
(49:22) That's why we have all those animals. In the Border Jungle Zone we have created a bank, called BANAMAS. This is an autonomous bank of Zapatista women. It supports financially our women, who work for the autonomy. We also have a coffee cooperative. We have been working for eight years, renting warehouses and equipment, paying for coffee transportation.
(50:02) Then, the zone made a decision to repair a warehouse for storing coffee. Our method of decision-making is general assemblies. Our understanding of democracy differs significantly from the democracy of the corrupt system. In the corrupt system, democracy exists only during elections. For us, however, democracy is a daily routine.
(50:42) This is how we make decisions, analyze problems, and eventually come to conclusions about how our life should be. Thanks to our organization, all 5 Caracols could gather here. When there were no Zapatistas, we did not know each other. Tzeltals lived separately, spoke their own language. Tojolobals lived separately as well.
(51:10) This is not how it works here. Another thank to the organization for the opportunity to get acquainted, and to share our experience of self-organization. Here we can hear our comrades speak, we can learn how to live differently. We have to show good example And follow our own slogan That we will live for Motherland Or die for freedom And we are going and going and going forward To succeed in our fight, Because the Motherland needs Zapatistas' efforts.
(52:00) Attention! Long live Zapatista! God! I've been to a different world, for real! A beautiful world. There were gods there. They performed magic. They are so heavy! Walk as you normally would. I can't! Bend your knees! No, I am too old for this. I saw myself as a protector of spirits, And I was shown how to summon them, how to help them, how to protect.
(53:02) I have an important announcement for the kids. Tomorrow at 8:30 they should show up at school to begin their classes. I think that they look at me in the village as at the most active one. That is why when there emerged a need of an autonomous teacher someone said "I think Juan would suit us" Does everyone agree? Yes, yes. Everyone said yes.
(53:29) Everyone voted "aye." That is how I began to work with children. Parents wanted a new life and new future for the whole San Isidro community. That is why they proposed to create an autonomous school. Before the armed uprising there were almost no state schools. We were forgotten. Teachers would not come for weeks.
(54:09) Many of them drank, and showed up drunk for classes. Our people began to think what education should be like. This is how there appeared a project involving incoming comrades. They helped us to build schools. Now, there is a school in almost every village. We want our children and youth to think differently, to appreciate collectivism, to learn about their reality, about how people live.
(54:53) And when they understand the situation, they stay with their fellows, they also serve the people. The corrupt government will perish! But the people should live! And the children will be free! I know that children are very open-minded, with them we can create many things. That's what happened to me. I was confused, lost my way, but, thanks god, I am again where I should be.
(55:45) Our organization is a form of Zapatism. We are on the same path: we fight for our rights, we fight for our tradition, so we would not lose them. We are living in accordance with San Andrés agreements. We know very well what was the deal between the government and the General Command. Although the government refuses to admit this, this is still necessary.
(56:35) Our ancestors had similar forms of work, forms of self-organization. They were not told by anyone how they should live. They did everything on their own. And not just this. We have birth certificates, we issue them for autonomy without government's involvement. Driving licenses as well. Here we … fabricate them? Is this the word? What do we have to ask forgiveness for? What do we have to be forgiven for? For not dying of hunger? For not being silent? For not accepting humbly the gigantic historical burden of disdain and oblivion?
(57:37) For rebelling with lethal force, while all other alternatives were closed?
