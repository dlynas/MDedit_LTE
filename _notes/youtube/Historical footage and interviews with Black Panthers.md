(00:13)  in America black people are treated very much as are the Vietnamese people or any other colonized people because were used with brutalize the police in our community occupy our area our community of the foreign troops occupy territory and the police are there not to in our community not to promote our welfare or for our security our safety but they're there to contain us to prove Eliza the murderer because they have their order to do so and just to the soldiers in Vietnam after their orders to I destroy
(01:05) the Vietnamese people the police in our community couldn't possibly be there to protect our property because we own no property they could possibly be there to see that we receive the due process of law for the simple reason that the police themselves denied to due process of law and so it's very apparent that the police only in our community Matt frier security but the security of the business owners and the community and also to see that the status quo is kept intact people aren't here to that yet
(01:39) they're not really aware that they know some  going on in this country somewhere but a lot of people out there don't know where it's at they think it's the black people do it at all those riots are causing my life to be miserable in all areas you know and they really have a focused in on the fact that it's the peers and their mentors the people who control the P the power structure it was ball headed businessman at the Chamber of Commerce see he's not turned on to that power structure he did
(02:12) we just know that life is becoming increasingly miserable for everybody but when they find out who it is it's causing the trouble and who it is that make life miserable who it is this is possible for all their sons being murdered in Vietnam when they get tuned in they're all gonna be just like Panthers because this is what we're chewing into we see what's going on and it's just a terrible situation more and more people are turning onto that I think they're gonna do this dog right here in Babylon
(02:44) when we first started we had a police alert patrol and we would close community which if we saw the police brûlées anyone we put a man to this usually the police wouldn't booth laughs anyone if we were on hand because we were armed and I fleeced the rest of the individual we follow him to the jail and bail the individual out whether it was a pass or not and we would gain many recruits like this so therefore the community started to say that well these people are really concerned about our welfare I think the basic reaction to a
(03:16) passage like experiences that I don't mean who sees a guy go by at a black jacket or a parade I mean if I can see the pathways in action with their lives on the line when he sees that that's the end of it you know like he do they're scared to death before ego never commits Nobel Prize there's nothing wrong no you know jaywalk you go find a guy black hat just remain the same after good a team guys on the black out there man they never have been too impressed by that they don't stand in fear of a cop and this is the reason
(03:59) one of the reasons like the Panther Party focused on the past so if the cops are out there and we're visible you see and this is the direct contact by the black people with the power structure you know it's the man fatigue battery but the other thing that has been lacking was a method by which she didn't move against us be sensitive and those other organizations are still programs and those Don balón tactics and those appeals to divert line whoever better didn't want to hear that and so here all of a sudden here comes
(04:36) two  and guns stand for the type of talk to the table just a copy check that out we really want to know what that's about if they don't decide this their life is too precious you know they must feel forever be on the side that they come in opposed to party  we're not a self-defense group in the
(06:06) limited fashion that you usually think of self-defense groups I like to use examples when Fidel Castro dr. revolution long with Che Guevara with 12 of them all together they realized that they wouldn't be able to topple the oppressive regime in Cuba what they were essentially what the educational body they are engaged with the army they fought with the army and they showed the people that the army was not bulletproof that the police were not bulletproof and that's my teachers regime not a regime that was impossible to topple so the
(06:38) people started to feel their strength the Black Panther Party feels very much the same way we think that this educational process is necessary and it's the people that will cause a revolution and it's the people that will cause the change in the country the Black Panther Party is simply the vanguard of the Revolution and we plan to teach the people the strategy and the necessary tools to liberate themselves      
(07:54)   and the needs and the demands if you said please but we feel that the only way that he can really be take it out of the hands of those who own it it is relentlessly trying to kill anything it's for the people some aware of what it's all about this is why I like this idea about them because people to get to know more about that I can see things you know if the people have to stand up and demand and they have to understand if they have a right they have a right to demand that
(08:58) the judicial procedures the carryover in the right manner     which is primarily a white group necessary to fight on two fronts we will SCI liberate the colony as well as stimulate revolution in the mother country I think the revolutionary Suton play a great part in saving America if it were not for the white students the Black
(10:00) Panther Party would react to the racism in the country and therefore respond with racism white students have been very interested in the past of the foreign policy of the United States they're demanding that the United States withdraw from Vietnam stop brutalizing the vietnamese people and we feel that the white students should relate if they more attention to the colonized situation here of the blacks first because after all this is home and they should this is not to say that they shouldn't announce America's
(10:36) treacherous actions abroad I think they can be done at the same time that just a matter of placing emphasis upon the criminal activities of America here in the homeland let's get into the inner workings in the meaning of this let's get into the inner workings in the meaning of a black revolution and why black people have our right to take what's theirs you can read the platform in the program and it's a basic program and it simply says exactly what black people have been crying for for 400 years
(11:10) one we want freedom more power to determine the destiny own black community to want full employment for our people three more decent housing pick the shelter of human beings for one in the end to the robbery the black community by the white racist businessman 5-1 decent education that teaches about the true nature of this racist decadent system education that teaches about our true history and our role in society in the world a day6 want all black brothers to be exempt from military service 7/7 we want an immediate end to police
(11:54) brutality and murder of black people hate we want all black brothers and sisters held in federal county state city jails and prisons to be released because they have not had a fair trial they've been tried they've been tried by all-white juries we have no understanding of the average reasonable man in the black community now my 9 this is where brother Hugh is being caught we just want the courts make sure we have peers on the jury people from the black community as defined by they jive constitution so
(12:34) called United States the chin summary with the major political objective that is we want bland bread housing clothing education justice you want peace major political objectives want a black clever sight you in black colonial subjects would participate dealing with analyzing rejecting medically upon the races atrocities committed as black people in this nation   
(13:46) so the concept is this basically the whole black nation has to be put together as a black army and we gonna walk on this nation you're gonna walk on this racist power structure and we're gonna say to the whole damn government stick them up  this is a holdup we come for what's ours
