The Grassroot Leadersâ€™ Dilemma | Why Grassroot Movements Fail
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7BIcjuOXRA)

## Transcript:
why do Grassroots movements tend to fail
to gain traction like why do they tend
to Peter out and have an increasing
amount of their leaders energy going
toward just getting people to show up
instead of actually making the good
things happen that they have in their
Visionary Minds
and I think this is related to the
question of why do volunteer-based
organizations never really have as much
societal power and social power as say
corporations and businesses and I'm
actually going to coin a term the
grassroot leader's dilemma which is
exactly this it's exactly the Dilemma of
how do you get people to show up when
um it's when they don't have to and then
I'd like to compare it to corporations
and to the power of you know economic
actors and then I wanted to think about
the relationship between financiers and
the economy and these grassroot leaders
because a lot of times if leaders of
these social causes want their Visions
to actually be enacted or if they want
to gain traction they depend really
heavily on the financiers who could
allow them to hire people to work under
them and that of course creates a power
Dynamic that
um maybe potentially destructive of the
Grassroots causes that they're trying to
lead first let's just explore this
notion of the Grassroots Leader's
dilemma
and when I'm talking about grassroot
leaders I'm talking about people who are
Visionaries who care a lot about a cause
and have some creative ideas for how to
address that cause
and this could be all over the map I
mean it could be environmental it could
be educational it could be related to
sort of Children and Family it could be
related to
um technology there's a lot of different
causes that uh that many people might
get behind the cause and many people
might actually get behind this person's
vision
and if you mix that with a little bit of
leadership ability where some of these
leaders might not just have a vision but
have skills at picking people for
certain roles and inspiring people and
organizing groups and normally you would
look at a leader like that and you would
say actually it's people like this and
groups of people like this who have the
power to change the world and really
transform things for the better however
in practice what often times happens is
that these people start off with a bang
like maybe they have a big event where
they get lots of people riled up and
they get people to sign up for their
cause and they sort of start to wield
the energy of people who are on board
with their creative and transformative
vision
but what oftentimes happens after that
is they'll have these follow-up events
that are based on sort of people showing
up and nose to the grinder working doing
the the boring details that don't feel
like you're making immediate progress or
maybe you work a little bit and then
something goes wrong because things
always go wrong and no movement is going
to take off unless you have a little bit
of persistence in the population to sort
of persist through uh through the
shortcomings of the the people in the
group perhaps persisting through some of
the shortcomings of the leader
persisting through setbacks you need
that sticking power and that commitment
like that is sort of people showing up
and saying I'm going to commit to doing
this
through the ups and the Downs through
the problems that we run into
unexpectedly and have to figure out
workarounds I'm going to do the dirty
tasks that nobody really wants to do but
have to be done if this movement is
going to take off
and you need people to be on board with
that
so I think what what oftentimes happens
is when you rely on volunteers
who don't actually have to show up like
they show up out of the goodness of
their hearts
a few of those setbacks can cause people
to throw up their hands
um and that sort of diminishes the
momentum of the movement
people see like members of the community
falling off like that person no longer
thinks this endeavor is worthwhile
that that leads to this uh this
disengagement from the rest of the
community or at least a little bit of a
ping in their commitment and when you
combine that with the fact that
sometimes people don't show up just
because they're not feeling great that
day or they're just not feeling
motivated that day like you add human
mood and human tiredness and all that
into the equation you get times when not
as many people show up that leads to
this disappointment that can spread
through a group and in some ways that
can almost escalate causing more people
to not show up
and I think oftentimes the grassroot
leaders
think that they're going to spend their
energy sort of wielding the power of
group dynamics because group dynamics
when people are inspired are amazing
like when humans come together they can
do things that no one single individual
could ever do
and leaders start off thinking that they
are wielding the full power of that
group dynamic but then once this
downward spiral happens because people
don't show up for whatever reason and
there's fewer people and people are
disappointed and discouraged leaders
oftentimes find themselves spending more
and more of their time and energy trying
to convince people to show up rather
than spending that brain power actually
shaping the vision and making the vision
happen it's more about inspiring people
and that can be a losing battle
especially when putting your energy
toward getting people to show up pulls
away from the Visionary thing that
people were committed to in the
beginning so that's going to be the
grassroot leaders dilemma
and I would like to talk about this in
relation to financiers
because I'm starting to think of
financiers as these key spigots in the
economy and if we're rethinking the
economy in a creative way then we need
to really think carefully about the
nature of those spigots
but before I do this I want to point out
something that a conservative friend
recently told me about that really got
me thinking
and it it's the notion that this person
was sort of looking back at say the
1950s and 60s and they were saying
during that time a lot of the Civic
organizations and the grassroot
movements and the you know powerful
social causes
we're led by women who were essentially
Housewives
where these women didn't have to work in
the labor force they perhaps spent some
of their time raising their kids but
eventually those kids get old enough and
these women could devote a lot of their
time to these social causes
and there the conservative argument here
was of course that that was really
important and that without
um those women in those roles anymore
we're losing a lot of the important
social Fabric and that the Civic
organizations that makes communities
whole that was their argument
now of course Liberals are going to hear
this and respond to this by being like
that depends on this power Dynamic
within the family where these women even
if they're serving these social roles
depend on their husbands in a way that
has this power Dynamic that we would
like to get out from under
and I think a lot of the people who
support for example Universal basic
income they're kind of hoping that okay
instead of having people's Time free
um because they're women who have a
husband supporting them instead of that
Dynamic creating the labor for these
social movements we're sort of giving
everyone this base income to where they
could say if I don't want to work if I
want to serve one of these social
movements then having the universal
basic income frees me up regardless of
my gender regardless of my marital
status
to lead these movements
and so that's sort of one of the hopes
of Ubi now Ubi is complicated and I'm
not going to talk about the pros and
cons in this video
but I wanted to bring up this notion of
the power dynamic between for example
the housewife who might be leading these
causes in the 1950s and 60s
and her husband that power Dynamic and I
want to map that onto the potential
power dynamic between
Grassroots movement leaders
and financiers
because I think a lot of times these
grassroot movement leaders figure out
after a while that they actually need
the money to hire people to work under
them rather than relying on volunteers
like eventually if they try to do this
enough they're going to realize okay
unless I can hire workers to work
underneath me
this is just not going to happen
and at that point they start to turn to
the financiers and when I say financier
I'm talking about anybody who is
responsible
for giving out enough money for people
to hire people underneath them
so this includes Bankers it includes
bureaucrats and the government who can
give out money for various social causes
it includes rich people who are wealthy
enough to actually finance
not-for-profits and organizations
and of course I think for these leaders
to do what they want to do to to bring
their Creative Vision into being
they know they have to depend on these
financiers
and that in and of itself creates a
massive power dynamic between those two
groups in which case I think if we're
going to bring out the White Rabbit and
of course on this channel the White
Rabbit is going to be
um me delving into new ways of thinking
about the economic structure that are
not fully baked ideas but rather sort of
pulling apart different mechanisms in
the economy and looking at them and
having weird academic thoughts because
we know we need some creativity in
redoing our economy like in redoing our
system and understanding new economic
systems requires the kind of creativity
that Alice in Wonderland experienced
when she went down the rabbit hole so
this rabbit just represents okay yeah
let's take a minute and just go down a
rabbit hole here so the rabbit hole I'm
just thinking about in this video is
I think the spigots of that money from
the financiers that is a key place for
us to restructure power dynamics
like would there be ways to let smaller
communities and smaller groups of people
control those spigots of money that goes
into these Grassroots organizations
in a more organic way
in a way that perhaps you can't
eliminate the power dynamic between the
Grassroots leaders and the financiers
could change the power dynamic between
the general populace who might support a
lot of these Grassroots causes
and who gets to embody those financier
roles
