GIMMS Presents Warren Mosler, London 1st September 2023
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8xHwX3VoMo)

## Transcript:
we're delighted once again to be in
London and very excited to have Warren
mosa with us it seems a very long time
ago since our event in Birmingham when
still in the first flush of enthusiasm
for our past
so much has happened in between
which is rather suffered our plans but
we are nevertheless very pleased to be
here and still eager to deliver the
educational aims we set for ourselves as
an organization
Warren as you will know is one of the
contributors to our recently published
book modern monetary Theory key insights
leading thinkers so we are looking
forward to his presentation of his
chapter as well as a discussion on
framing the job guarantee and trade and
real wealth which will sure will provide
much food for thought and no doubt
present many questions
it seems that life it always sends us
small hiccups to deal with and I'm
hearing that a rail strike had been
announced whilst clearly standing in
solidarity with striking workers there
was some initial palette on my part of
the least
we have to cancel and if not how many
people would still be able to get to you
or would Warren be presenting to an
empty room as it turns out we needn't
worried and we are delighted that so
many of you have been able to get here
one way or another
it doesn't seem possible that in just
under a couple of months it will begin's
fifth birthday
whilst prior to its formation the first
stirrings of a UK MNT movement were
already underway
it was a meeting at the vowel room at
UCL that really decided that we must do
some
and from small seeds in time countries
growth not quite there yet but today we
have along with our colleagues at the
mmt podcast
played an important role in raising
greater awareness of monetary reality
our book was an unexpected icing on the
cake
and we are very proud of what we have
managed to achieve and grateful to all
those who have given us the
encouragement and support
but there is much more to do
we are without doubt living in uncertain
unstable times that will possibly Mark
the beginnings of a global revolution in
terms of the structures of power and
wealth which currently dominate
who can predict what comes next
a pandemic and a war are changing the
rules of engagement as the global South
begins to find its voice and seeks to
break the shackles that have hitherto
kept it impoverished exploited and in
service to the needs of the West
as Lula the president of Brazil noted in
a recent speech at the Amazon Summit
the top 10 percent of the world's
population holds over 75 of the wealth
and emits nearly half of all the carbon
released into the atmosphere
one cannot he said discuss tropical
forests and climate change without
addressing the historical responsibility
of developed countries which have been
the biggest squanderers of natural
resources and the largest contributor to
planetary pollution
a global economic system run by the view
through institutions such as the IMF and
the World Bank along with national and
supranational governments captured by an
idea economic ideology
has wrought huge damage in terms of
people's lives
growing poverty and Rising inequality
paying public infrastructure and the
growing threat that is posed by climate
change and ecological overshoot
this is therefore a moment for a radical
reasoning about how we live our lives
and the role that government plays in in
achieving that we can no longer talk
solely about domestic concerns without
understanding a geopolitical context of
our existence and the interdependencies
which are being exposed
a viable future for us all we rely on
cooperation and collaboration on the key
challenges of our time along with
respectful treatment and our neighbors
and fair trading Arrangements between
nations
as the central bank takes the media
Limelight and the flag in terms of the
winners and losers of monetary policy we
need to bring Greg's of parity and
greater understanding of the power of
government to effect change through
policy and spending priorities
those are the real measures of a
government's economic record what it did
and who benefited
we have witnessed with our own eyes the
beneficiaries of government spending and
we need to challenge the monetary
mechanism Acker household budget
accounting that is used to skew the
distribution of wealth pouring it into
the hands of the few and leaving the
rest to Scrabble with the crumbs or sink
under the burden of lack of adequate
support
after a period of vast government
spending to support people to the
pandemic and the global supply issues
resulting from the war in Ukraine we
seem to be Tracing Our steps backwards
with the same old spending narratives
being hammered out like they were going
out of fashion by politicians of all
Stripes government institutions think
tanks on both the left and the right and
Academia all aided by a media with a few
exceptions which reinforces daily those
false narratives
after the vast sums of money spent to
support the economy now comes the
austerity again as political parties
instead of fighting to serve the nation
and its citizens fight for the dubious
title of being the most fiscally
responsible
at one end of the scale poverty and
inequality is being reformed reinforced
through government policy and at the
other action on existential crisis of
climate change and ecological ownership
is to be postponed until some undefined
time in the future or dependent on
growth and increased tax revenues the
leave it to the Market's approach and
all will be well
we are at a critical moment in history
and never has it been more important to
increase our determination
and Target our efforts effectively to
raise public awareness of how government
really spends
show that the real constraints to that
spending are resourceled and that it
isn't money in itself that determines
what a government can do but political
will
as the established order aims yet again
to shore up the near Liberal Fortress
plugging the breaches yet again in favor
of the status quo the question for us
all now is how we can more effectively
challenge the prevailing narrative and
reverse the tide of ignorance that is
holding back the change we need
small organizations like gyms and the
mmt podcast do and can continue to play
a role however the biggest obstacle that
we face is a media that keeps the
narratives alive and well in the public
consciousness
is therefore for us to explore every
Avenue that we can to bring mmt to an
Ever wider audience so that we can
secure an environmentally sustainable
economy and a fairer Society for future
Generations
um thank you very much for listening
um I'm going to pass you on to fill our
first speaker and just before I do I
need to sort of do a little bit of
health and safety so you all know where
to go in case
um
in the event of the fire alarm going off
the exits through the doors here and
here and you just need to follow the
signs to the fire exits don't use the
lifts please I'm not sure that you'll
know not to do that
um there the news you probably found
them already and
well first of all just to say it's a
great pleasure for me to be here and to
be working with Peru and Sarah
and Claire of course and of course what
a day to be welcoming our founder the
nnc found Warren next to me and uh is uh
with Lady wife Elizabeth is there uh in
the audience to see him so you have to
be on his best behave here today I'm
sure
um
I'm not really going to speak very much
because uh I'm well known to like the
sound million voice being a teacher so
today you're going to say Warren and
just to say that um Warren itself he
introduced me to nmt in about 2010 he's
fantastic communicating you send him an
email and you get an answer straight
away unlike academics so some of you may
be well around more over 40 some of you
and you probably sent a question 20
years ago through an academic and you're
still waiting so Warren is a great
communicator he answers everything
fantastically without Warren I wouldn't
have any understanding at that City uh
if you're new to MMC you know get ready
to be challenged when he when he starts
you'll get your brain going of course if
you know about MMC Warren really doesn't
need an introduction uh
one thing I will say I'm currently
engaged in trying to write Warren's
biography I think I'm going to divide
into two volumes the first one is kind
of about is early life
ability to act in lots of fields the
second one relies on me communicating
with academics
yeah it's tough and so it's quite slow
getting a response so that one might
going back to that earlier point you
know don't be rushing for that one but
I'm gonna try and get something out
reasonably quickly because you you want
to find out a bit about our Warren seize
the world and uh I've gotta just four
little chords to from the people I've
interviewed from Warren's life and first
these is Warren malls there is an
example of a rare type of person a
polymath see he can operate in a lot of
fields he he you know he's obviously
built his racing cars and apparently you
know he's just right up in a garage and
embarrass Ferrari uh he builds more
beholds
um uh fairies that are still working out
in the Caribbean and it caused the
advanced his own School of Economics
Smalls or economics which is now moved
on I've been coming mmt
um
one sees things all the people doing CC
looks at things
and you can look deeper at what's
causing what you see but he doesn't
always know how or why you can see
he just sees it
um
the other thing you you ask him why how
does he do it and he goes well we don't
need we don't realize what we need to
know until we actually need to put that
knowledge into effect
and basically my final word is
um
he's a man in some ways a few words
people said he can convey a very small
in a very small amount of words some
very deep truths but fortunately he's a
man of many stories
in the moment so I'm gonna
be quiet now and I just want you to give
Warren a very warm welcome as he's come
a very long way
thank you
okay I'm going to get closer so I don't
have to speak quite as long
and no one had a pencil so I took some
notes on my uh
um I Heard
so why is everybody here about mmt and I
think it's because it opens up policy
options that weren't considered viable
before that are attractive to a lot of
people such as sustaining full
employment
where it's always been assumed that that
there's a trade-off and if you have high
levels of employment you're going to get
high levels of inflation but once you
understand monetary operations you
realize that
full employment policies such as a job
guarantee is how you get lower inflation
and so it just changes that whole
dynamic it changes the whole society
once it's understood the trick is to get
other people understand it and the other
thing that was said that I thought was
is you know let the markets do it
okay the markets can take care of this
and what we understand is
when you understand monetary operations
you understand the currency itself is a
monopoly it's a public Monopoly
and once you've got a monopoly at work
if you don't have markets anymore
markets are working in the context of
that Monopoly and so all the mainstream
theories assume competition pure
competition if there is a monopoly
is doing
um
you know they point it out and show how
it distorts markets and it's problematic
such as a labor union
but they don't recognize the currency
itself
and I've just been after them for
30 something years now I've been doing
this to just look at your mainstream
models and add something to them start
with an assumption that the currency
itself is eventually the government's uh
puts tax taxation in place coercive
taxes they don't even have that and
the tax credit the thing you need to pay
the tax the currency
the money to pay the tax comes only from
the government through its agents put
that in your models and then everything
will be fine they have um and they won't
do it they've just fought that they
haven't done it I've talked to a lot of
people or
Paul Krugman Michael Whitford top
monetary economist
Point LSC you name it
who else should we talk to business guys
from Columbia who's the Nobel Prize guys
stay Glitz spent two days with that guy
in catechism
they just won't do it and uh so anyway
so
this paper is about inflation I'm a
little bit hesitant because I see the
questions and if there aren't any
questions about that now I'm here
because you are all proponents in a way
and I'm here to the way I see my role is
to help give you the sound bites that
you need to answer questions you get
from other people to help get your ideas
across
so I'll go through this relatively
quickly from the questions it seems like
that's not I'm not quite answering your
questions and helping you with this
presentation but it's I'll go through it
it's a program unless you want me to
skip to the question
so number one
purpose of this chapter is to prevent a
framework for the analysis of you'll see
mmt my papers
are oftentiled this is a framework for
analysis mmt is a framework for analysis
it's not a policy that you do
and the Republicans started a campaign
saying the Democrats are doing mmt and
they've ruined the country vote for us
of course Democrats I don't even know
what mmt is but but that was a political
employee that they're doing it and then
the arguments get over why are they
doing mmt or not and you'll see these
discussions about people doing or not
doing mmt it's a framework for analysis
you already know that uh
we are the only School of economic
thought
that specifically identifies and models
both the source of the price level and
how it changes
mainstream economics and noticeable
exchange on Twitter not too long ago a
couple of weeks ago yeah still
discussing that after 50 years the
problem is they haven't identified the
source of the price level
because they don't know why prices are
what they are except that that's how
they were yesterday
and because of something somebody did
they went off but because something just
happened it went down but they don't
know where this price level came from I
started this thing called the fiscal
theory of the price level which is
interesting and they dropped it because
they couldn't get to the source of the
price level it's always
you know so what they do in all their
models is that they assume
prices are at a certain level
uh but okay and then they try to figure
out what makes them change up or down
but they don't have a starting point
right and that's what
we have the starting point the currency
is a monopoly monopolis is at a price
I'll give you an example of that
um here
markets and mainstream knows this is a
problem this is that they can't get past
markets can only set relative value
they will tell you how much is a chicken
worth versus a turkey two chickens is
one turkey or something like that they
can tell you how things exchange for
each other and what the ratio is but if
you get uh
places where they don't have a currency
like a monastery or the American Indians
before
Europeans came in or Africa before the
Europeans came in they would exchange
things and things would exchange at
certain values kind of like a barter
system okay and it wasn't a huge amount
but there was Exchange
they could never figure out how much a
chicken cost in terms of yen
okay how are they going to do that there
is no he has everything it's in Japan
somewhere or whatever in terms of
dollars or British pound they had no way
to put a new mirror on these things that
type of numerator all they can all
markets can do is come up with relative
value and all the mainstream economic
models are relative value models Aero
dupres models and all these General
equilibrium models are all relative
value and then they come in they say now
we're going to start with we're going to
prices of this morning's price level at
the open this is what everything cost
has a 9 A.M this morning and then they
assign everything at price level and
then because of these Dynamics in these
relative value models that show how
prices might change
they don't know where that price come
from so prices in terms of
currency can only come from the outside
they can't be generated Within
a group of people
okay it has to come from the outside
group of people can only determine
relative value if they want to if you
want to know if they want to start
pricing everything in yeah and they need
an exchange rate they need to know that
somehow what can a Yen by somewhere
could be anything you say oh you know 10
Yen will buy
a marble
well now we can figure everything out
because they know what marbles are
relatives you know or they're 10 yen to
buy a piece of one yard of concrete oh
okay now we've got it but it needs some
information from the outside to get
started well how about a Turkish lira
how is how do you price everything well
tell us something that a Turkish lawyer
is worth and then we can figure it out
but we can't do it unless you tell us it
or British pound or US dollar they need
external information okay and that's
what we've contributed that's what this
paper contributes right up at the
beginning that
where does that information come from
about how many dollars or how many
pounds is worth something so that the
markets condensed figure it all out
how much rent should be how much weight
it should be where does it start okay
and it starts first the government we
start with the mmt money store we've got
a nice little money story for you to
start and you want to use this for all
your explanations number one the
government of Washington well the whole
purpose is for the government to
provision itself the one's labor wants
jet plans it wants Public Health that's
all these things for itself so it
imposes a tax liability
it doesn't collect the tax first it puts
a tax liability in place without that
nothing happens
and for purposes of example I assume a
property tax tax on everybody's house
because you can understand that you can
keep track of it
if you say a tax on everybody's income
or people don't work they don't report
it and you know how do they don't get
paid you know it's complicated it still
works but I'd have to spend two hours
explaining how an income tax translates
into this a house tax everybody can get
right away so just start with that and
and to uh
you know to get for the example so we
start with a property tax and once the
property tax is in place whatever it is
100 pounds a month per house or
something
now you've got a population that needs
those pounds or they're going to lose
their house
some people are going to lose ours not
everybody's a homeowner but the
homeowners are in trouble they need
those pumps up and so they are willing
to sell things to work to get pounds
because they need the tax and so the
first thing is that tax liability which
creates people who need the money to pay
the tax
people looking for paid work are called
unemployment so in the first instance
the tax is there to generate
unemployment the government can now pay
those people to come to work
and now the market has an idea of what a
pound is worth
the government is paying 30 000 pounds a
year for somebody to be in the army
now it can get started and from that all
the other prices can fall into place in
a perfect world with perfect markets
which we don't have without that you
have nothing
so what I say is
the source of the price level
prices government pays when it spends
and it would have to be what they call
at the margin just because you paid
something yesterday if you pay something
else today probably should pay yesterday
is old news it's it's what you have to
do to get that money on a continuous
basis to get those problems on a
continuous basis
right so
so we have the source of the price level
we know what makes it change
ultimately now there can be a lot of
relative value changes the Peaches die
so the price of peaches go up and
there's a surplus of computer chip so
they go down there's relative value
chains but we know that it's a the price
level is a function of prices paid by
government if the government starts
paying more for the same thing it's it's
revaluing its currency downward
right now to get back to the
if you go to any Central Bank
and you ask them uh
what inflation is
they can't tell you that
they can tell you what what
this Consumer Price Index did last month
it was up 0.2
okay they can tell you what their
forecast is for next month we think
it'll be up 0.3
they can't tell you what the continuous
change of prices is right now
okay that there is no such thing
and in fact
they can't even tell you what the price
level is they use an abstraction they
call the Consumer Price Index which is
the cost of living
which is something very different than
the way academics
Defined inflation
and so not only do they not have a
source of a price level they don't have
a
a
I don't know what it exactly is and
they'll tell you that so they come up
with these abstractions to try and
reflect the cost of living
and then somebody will come to me and
say well how do we bring down inflation
I'll say well it's a consumer price
level one way you could bring it down
would be to eliminate the value added
tax which is what 25 or something what
that would drop all these prices 20
percent
well no apart from that how can we bring
prices
you know and so it's like what what are
we trying to do here why not just
eliminate that and then
well I can't can't give you an answer
you know so where the prices coming from
in the United States we had president
Trump put a 17 tariff on lumber from
Canada because they weren't charging us
enough
don't ever send that guy out shopping
but that's what people do uh and the
price of lumber went up 17 President
Biden comes in decided that wasn't
enough that we need to punish Canada
more so we're going to because they
still weren't charging us enough so he
puts another 17 on so now it's up 35
percent
then they noticed the price of Lumber's
gone up 35 in housing and now we have
inflation what are we going to do about
this inflation
you just legislated the higher price how
about unalleged well we can't do that
but we have to raise the price through
legislation then bring it down by uh
doing something else anyway don't don't
get it started
all right if you can scroll up
we've already done the bunny story
currency itself is a monopoly this is a
micro Foundation the fact whether
there's a monopoly or not is something
you learn in microeconomics it's your
first
day of micro they teach Monopoly takes
about 15 or 20 minutes
then they move on to oligopoly that
might take the rest of the class
then they go to competition which takes
the rest of your life use these
asymptotes of the math and all that the
good news is the currency is the easy
one that took 15 minutes it's a case of
Monopoly the government has the tax
credits the pounds that are used to pay
taxes we need them it tells us what we
have to do to get them
find some value that's currency that way
and uh
now what
is it about a government
that allows them to do this they have
taxing Authority
they have
they can punish people for not paying
taxes
anybody who has taxing Authority
can then tax
and then they tell you what the tax
credit is the thing you need to pay the
tax
and that's it now you can call that
monetary sovereignty if you want but
then you're throwing and I don't like
doing that and I don't know that I've
ever done that because you're throwing
in another word for somebody to think of
and try and remember the definition of
just makes it harder
okay what we have is taxing Authority
and then the thing to pay the tax and
that keeps it at a level where you can
understand it it's not something you
have to keep coming back and whether
that monetary sovereignty mean again
okay and governments who have taxing
Authority have policy options
taxes in place they can create an
appointment they can hire all the people
that just
cause to become unemployed right and uh
so those are policy options they can use
up or take away their policy options
with different policies they can decide
to fix the tax credit to goals well now
they've restricted themselves
they've eliminated certain policy
options because now they have to have
gold to give people for the money might
be a good thing or a bad thing they can
debate it but
to say that that takes away your
monetary sovereignty
it doesn't take away your
policy options that's a policy option
you employ so I don't like to this whole
thing about degrees of sovereignty and
degrees of being able to do it by
by engaging in policy options that
restrict yourself again it's second
order it complicates it it's uh I think
it's counterproductive and trying to uh
understand to promote an understanding
of what's going on the the other thing
about
too many people I think weed off with
taxes don't fund them spending
okay and what they mean is the
government's not Revenue constrained it
spends first before taxes are paid but
what comes first are tax liabilities
if you if you if you don't start with
that you can lose credibility once you
tell people taxes don't fund spending
they think you don't need taxes you're
crazy and they walk away you're going to
lose a lot of people right off the bat
even though technically you're right the
word funding is ambiguous so you don't I
don't use that kind of an ambiguous word
because it I find it counterproductive
but you know other people have found it
productive it's
it's fine I just find it problematic and
much easier not to use it all right so
uh
let's change
Okay so
the tax liability creates a need to pay
taxes
but it creates a larger need be in
addition to that and that's the need to
save
people want to have more than enough
just to pay their tax liability and so
it if the government
tax liability would cause people to
become unemployed to seek paid work the
government when it pays them
well more often than not observed that
it's going to pay out more than just as
needed to pay the tax because there's a
need to save have money in your pockets
have a money supply to have cash in the
cash registers to have reserves you know
people lose them in the wash parents
take them home as souvenirs there's
reasons that people will accumulate more
at the macro level than just what's it
you certainly can't collect more than
you
because they're not there
so let's see
and here we can look at more closely
what the
where the value of the currency comes
from and where the inflation comes from
right so if I um
AC is my old business card example you
guys want to hear that one more time
I don't have business cards anymore I
have somebody else's
so if I take out my business card
what's this thing worth in this room
it's not worth anything
okay nobody's going to pay me any real
money for this business
and there's nobody looking for a job
that pays in these business cards but
what I tell you there's a guy out this
door here and it's the only way out of
the room and he's got a nine millimeter
and you can't get out here without one
of these cards
now you can all feel the pressure
that you're unemployed okay you're
looking for paid work you get one of
these cards that you get out of here
all right so my tax I got the tax that
on here but you need one of these cars
to get out of here has created
unemployment you're all unemployed
and
uh
and now you're waiting for me to tell
you okay what do I have to do to get one
of these cards
if I say you have to stay and work an
hour to clean the floor now you've got
an idea of value
the first thing you're going to say to
the guy next to you is hey I'll give you
20 pounds you know you go to work for an
extra hour for me I want to get out of
here now okay there'll be an exchange
rate based on uh you know what you think
it's worth it to not have to stay an
hour to clean the floor and now these
cards has an actual value
okay and it came from me telling you
what you have to do to get you have to
work an hour
clean before you went to no net if I
hadn't said it said that
right now if I say and let's say that
number is at 20 pounds this could be the
exchange rate because so you don't have
to work an hour people would be willing
to work an extra hour
if I say you know what you only have to
work a half hour to get this card
now it's only worth 10 pounds
because it takes half as much effort to
get it if I say you have to work two
hours to get it it's worth 40 pounds
right that's what I mean by the
government is setting the value of this
now is that
tell you how much a bottle of water will
cost based on
in terms of cars yes but can that change
if it turns out there's only one bottle
for everybody that might go up to 10
cars
if there's a case of 500 bottles of
water
you know if
it'd be a fraction you know be like
cheap the tenth of a car or something
like that and so
you're going to have relative value
changes but the source of value of this
card is me telling you what you have to
do to get it and then after that the
markets can figure out what everything
else will be worth
okay it's called somebody wants to buy
your jacket you want to do it in terms
of cards you can figure it out once I
tell you what you have to do
okay
let's move down here
notice this if the tax is one card per
person
and I say you have to work one hour
and there's 50 people in this room
I know I'm going to get 50 hours of
Labor at least I might get extras if
people want to earn some more I get at
least 50 hours of Labor if I say I'll
pay two cards an hour
I'm only going to guess 25 hours of
Cleveland because the old guys
collectively only have to work 25 hours
so when the government raises the prices
it pays for things it's increasing the
price though
but it's also then able to buy less in
real terms unless it raises attacks
it's a very important Dynamic that's not
expressed
now normally when you have prices going
up and people are paying income taxes
and the tax is going up automatically
in this case it wasn't was a fixed head
text or as a fixed property tax if they
start paying more they're going to wind
up getting less
if they wanted to get more labor they
would pay less
if I want more than if I want 100 hours
I'll say a card's only worth a half hour
inverse relationship okay there's a
paper on my website by pavelina did this
in 1996 she was an undergrad at
Gettysburg College
it's very good it goes into how Monopoly
pricing works
okay here's another point
in the economy
I assume that savings desires the reason
people want to save
is because of what that savings can buy
so you might want to save enough
to live for two or three weeks if you
lose your job
Apple computer might have 200 billion
dollars in
savings and cash on the balance sheet
because they think that's what they need
to run the company for a certain time
don't want to have liquidity problems if
price is doubled
they would need 400 billion
if you need uh 200 pounds to go grocery
shopping
the price is doubled you need four
okay so as
prices increase
as you get inflation with the conflation
prices increase
you need to the the need to save the
need for some kind of money supply grows
accordingly
and so what happens is that
inflation creates a money shortage
Phil and I did a paper on this in
Germany the Weimar inflation inflation
what happened prices were going up and
created this enormous money shortage in
which case government had to you know
print money for people
to exchange for the bank accounts and
everything else just to just to run
their lives because prices are going up
so fast you just need more money
corporations needed more on hand do we
do payrolls and everything else and then
when the economists look at it and
retrospect they say oh see how the money
supply went up that caused the inflation
it's the other way around
if I start you know in a place where I'm
paying more and more cards for the same
work
you know your savings and cards has to
go up the money supply you need to carry
around to walk around goes up as the
value goes down the demand for cash goes
up
we talked about the source of the price
level right there
okay
now the other thing people will tell you
is why you can get the money from the
banks
which is true but in this case it's
because the banks are agents of the
government
their licensed
they have a chartered in the U.S they
have Charters they're members of the
Federal Reserve they're fully regulated
by the U.S Regulators the FDIC and the
fed and they can only operate under very
very tight restrictions which has to be
otherwise the system could function
which is flawed to hyperinflation I
think some people imagine and uh
and so they are authorized agents of the
government so the loans they make can be
used to pay taxes
okay but only because the government has
decided they can and it's all under the
Federal Reserve Act of Congress which it
changes as needed and it means the rules
like you saw with the SVP Bank problem
within a week they changed the rules and
those problems went away
so
um
uh you have to think of the government
and its AIDS when the government gives
you a
social security check you are now the
government's agent when you go spend the
prices you pay
are as an agent of the government it did
buy something that defines the currency
it gave the currency to somebody to go
do it for them so when the military goes
out and buys things they're acting as an
agent for the government that whole
military procurement system the whole
public procurement system is critical in
the price level and the U.S almost to a
thought has got its expenditures on the
public expenditure side with competitive
bidding and everything else is it
actually a deflationary force
Been instrumental in keeping it
price level in check to the extent that
it has so again prices paid by
government is always through its agents
the congressman don't go out and pay the
soldiers it's done through agents okay
okay it's going to give you one more
example how do I do it for time okay
okay so this is a good story that you
can use Elizabeth and I were in pate
and uh
we jumped on one of the tours they had
there's a tour guide there about 30 or
40 people and he showed us the coins
from Pompeii and he said Pompeii was a
very nice place to live because they
would collect these coins for tax and
then they would pay spend that they
would use them to
um pay government employees to for
sanitation and for Public Safety and
they had good public services so people
wanted to live there even though the
taxes were high
so I'm a bit of a troublemaker so I go
to the guy and I said well you know
actually they would pay the people first
and then collect the tax
and he goes no no you are
you know collect the tax and then you're
paying the people
I said well where'd the coins come from
they said well the government made them
the state the city the state Pompeii
made the place
so how did anybody get a coin to pay the
tax
he said so they would pay a first and
then collect them I said yeah how else
can it work he grabbed and said he goes
no no no no no
I walked away the guy wouldn't talk to
me for the rest
that's a true story you've been a guy
for 20 years right now uh I assure you
everybody in Pompei knew how it worked
they had a tax on everybody's house or
something everybody owed money and then
some people would show up to get paid to
be police officers and sanitation
workers they get paid and then people
didn't want to do that would sell them
pizzas or whatever Tomatoes or perform
services and the place was monetized and
that's how it worked and everybody knew
that they would pay the people first who
would then pay the taxes now they found
20 000 coins in the street
or what would have been in somebody's
pocket because it was buried under the
ashes or in some Merchants coin boxer
are under a mattress somewhere
um
so how did they get there how did 20 000
coins get in the street because people
can imagine that you're talking to
somebody they have to understand this
well they came from the discovered the
government paid all these people more
than were used to pay taxes they were
earning coins to
pay the taxes for the society and to
save that was the Savings in the society
the government spent twenty thousand
more than it collected so far they're
still finding it
right that's the government's deficit
they spent more than they collected the
public debt are all the coins the
government spent that haven't yet been
used to pay taxes
public debt are all the pounds that the
British government has spent since
Inception that haven't yet been used to
pay taxes
where are they they're in the street or
what's the street today the street is
cash and circulation it's it reserves
which are bank accounts at the central
bank and it's guilts which are bank
accounts at the central bank at the back
of England
so they're either in bank accounts or
they're on pieces of paper which are the
positive Slims you know for bank
accounts at the Central Bank they're
back to Central Bank liabilities that's
the street today
now did anybody in Pompeii say I have 20
000 coins in the street are we ever
going to repay all those
it's not an applicable question it's
called the public debt the accountant's
called public debt it's a liability
we've got coins out there that can be
used to pay taxes that's that's called
the liability you owe people the right
to pay taxes for them they've earned a
right to pay taxes they were police
officers they're just saving it that
right to pay taxes
and it's public liability but it's not
something that gets paid back how do the
guilts get paid back when they mature
they transfer those pounds from one
account to Central Bank to another
and uh
if anybody wants to see exactly which
accounts but that's all there is there's
no like paying it back it's already the
money there is no such thing as paying
it back so if you use that example you
can do it now what were the coins worth
okay well depends on how much they paid
the police officers
you know if if the day's work was worth
you know 10 pizzas because it a guy
could make 10 pizzas a day and you paid
the police officers 10 coins a day
then Pizza might be one coin each I
don't know something like that because
it's uh you know tenth of a day's work
right if you start paying the police
officer uh five coins a day then
it would mean the pizzas would have to
cost more they'd be worth more coins
right so the government if it paid 20
coins a day the price of the pizzas is
half as much it's what you have to do to
get the funds from the government
that's what it's worth the same as I use
with the cars that's what this paper is
about okay and there's examples in here
that you can go through
now now the next thing I did was look at
the academic definition of inflation a
continuous increase
and I say in the term structure of
Crisis faced by economic ages today
where purchases and sales for future
delivery debts I was trying to figure
out what the academic definition means
they say it's a continuous increase in
prices
what prices
kind of all the prices
what a continuous increase implies they
must be going up right
well if the price is increasing it means
if I want to buy
you know for delivery next week it's
going to be that much higher that would
be the continuous increase if I want to
buy for five years forward let's say I
have a jeweler I want to buy my gold
supply for the next five years
I want to know what the prices are for
delivery dates all the way out
Okay so
what I pondered on this academic
definition this is what I came up with
this thing called the term structure of
prices
and that's always a function of the
interest rate
policy interest rate so if you have a
zero interest rate policy and announce
the goal today is uh
with me let's say two thousand pounds
it's about fifteen hundred pounds
an ounce of gold is 1500 pounds
I know in dollars
uh it's fifteen hundred pounds let's see
if there's a zero when rates are zero if
I want to buy gold for next year you
come out right Lauren it is actually 15
minutes
so it's fifteen hundred pounds if I
wanted to buy it for a year from now
what would the price be what would be
the same 1500 pounds and let's do his
insurance or something because the
interest rates are zero if I'm a
Salesman and you know you I give you the
money and you're not going to pay for it
for a year I'm not losing anything I get
my 1500 pounds a day I can't earn
interest on it anyway if I get it a year
from now it's the same value
but let's say interest rates go to uh 10
percent
okay so now if you want to buy it to me
for me today is 1500 pounds but if you
want if I've got to wait a year for my
money I could be earning ten percent of
my money I'm going to want 1650 pounds
for that coin
otherwise I'm not going to sell it to
you for a year I'm not going to wait a
year for my money if I can't earn the
interest okay and the and the person
buying it would be willing to pay them
because he can take his 1500 put in a
bag for a year and earn 10 he'll have
1650 so it's fair it's an indifference
level it's a market price it's where
buyers and sellers come together based
on the 10 interest rate if the 10-year
interest rate is 10 the price 10 years
from now would be 10 compounded for 10
years
see that in the Futures markets when
they trade
it's called forward prices
and so you could say that the price of
gold right now if interest rates were 10
percent
and the tenure was 10 percent
term structure of prices is increasing
continuously at the rate of 10 a year
I would say that's a 10 inflation rate
that exactly fits the academic
definition of inflation
so under the academic definition of
inflation it is the policy rate the
interest rate and so with the Central
Bank raises interest rates they're
raising the forward price of gold versus
the stock price so if the spot price is
fifteen hundred dollars and they raise
the rate to um
one from zero to one percent in the
10-year rate we would face the same one
percent for 10 years
the price 10 years forward might be uh
10 higher 16.50 or something like that
but you'd see a continuous increase of
one percent
If they raise rates to two percent
there's a continuous increase of two
percent so what they're doing when they
raise rates is they're adjusting that
term structure of prices to be growing
at a steeper rate as they raise rates
they're increasing the rate of inflation
by the academic definition
okay
and so
they don't even discuss that
but they know that they know how forward
prices were
or they lower grades they've lowered the
term structure of prices they've reduced
the rate of inflation faced by all of us
when we try and buy something for
forward delivery so when do we ever do
that if you want to buy a house that's
under construction it's not going to be
done for a year
if interest rates go up
the cost of building that house for the
year all the money tied up uh in
materials everything else it's going to
go up
by that amount and so suddenly the price
of the house
right now versus a year four it's it's
gone up okay the term structure of
crisis has gone up everything we do is
affected on the on the cost side by the
term structure of prices that the
central bank is doing so it's actually
increasing inflation when it's raising
rates
it's just it's just a mathematical
expression it's not even there's no
debate here they all know that
and so that that's it in the paper also
talks about that
okay now the other thing is
they do something else that's very
important when they raise rates
and a year and a half ago
I was uh
where's the gentleman from Ontario
I'm sitting here somewhere there we go
uh
I did a presentation today
to the uh
Ontario's teacher's pension 200 billion
pensions
and I said did Central bank's going to
be raising rights the feds raising rates
they've already announced the policy
but that's kind of a and all the
forecasts are now for recession
I said but that's going to make the
economy stronger not weaker
all the forecasts were for bringing it
was going to cause unemployment to go
higher to bring inflation down I said no
it's going to cause unemployment to go
lower
okay it's not going to class they've got
it backwards and even the mmt proponents
thought I was out to lunch and they said
I was completely alone on this position
I probably still am
the reasoning was fairly simple
um
the government is a net payer of
interest to the economy
if you look at the economy in the
banking system for every loan there's a
deposit for every borrower there's a
safe when they raise rates they're
shifting money away from borrowers who
have to pay more towards Savers to get
more it's a net wash it's zero the only
way that'll affect the economy is if the
borrowers get hurt more than the Savers
get helped and maybe they do
you know maybe a borrower Cuts back more
than a saver increases his expenditure
maybe if rates went to five percent
borrowers cut back I don't know 30 or 40
percent Savers don't increase their
spending by all that much they save a
little maybe there's a difference
but in addition to that
the government's a net payer of interest
on the public debt all the money
industry decided to pay interest on this
why that's another question
again Pompeii never paid interest on
those 20 000 coins in the street it did
cause inflation or anything in fact they
had paid interested more coins
flooded the market with coins don't you
think that might have caused the problem
that might reduce the value of the money
people don't have to be police officers
anymore they're just getting interest
it messed up the whole system
which is my point the government's
paying interest on all these coins in
the street in the U.S
25 trillion held by the public
oh and it pays interest that's income to
everybody now some of you might be in
favor of basic income
okay I can give you give you reasons why
it can be problem atic
okay but
how many of you think we should pay
basic income but only to people who
already have money in proportion to how
much they already have yeah
that's what happens when they pay
interest the interest only goes to
people with money in proportion to how
much they already have
it's just kind of an Abomination
okay and the U.S government is now
paying out over a trillion dollars
annually in interest after having zero
rates has gone to five and a quarter
half
okay only to people who already have
money in proportion to how much they
have
paying interest on all these coins in
the street to fight inflation
okay
and it didn't matter so much when the
public debt was lower it was still bad
but it kind of neutralized the
difference between borrowers and Savers
what they do by the way is called the
propensity to spend interest income
and I actually had a friend Steve owner
who was at the that that was his job
consider this album
I had Steve how is there a difference he
says yeah we believe there's a
difference We Believe borrowers are hurt
more than Savers he said but I've been
doing the econometrics for the last 10
years and I can't detect an adapt
in addition to that the government's
paying interest now back then it wasn't
so much so when chairman Bernanke raised
rates
the economy didn't slow down but it
didn't explode either and in fact it
collapsed when the societies raised oil
prices to 155 and then it collaps okay
but the rate increases did cause a
damage
oh that came down and cause damage but
that's a different story and when he cut
rates it did help the economy we did
have the big explosion in inflation and
everything that everybody saw we'd have
when we went to zero rates Japan's
better zero raised for 30 years and
hasn't had any kind of an explosion in
the economy but they're just an
exception then the US did it well that
was an exception that Europe did or
that's just an exception okay
so what happens when Bernanke cut raised
to zero he eliminated 400 billion of
income from the economy because that's
what the savings to the treasury was
well the treasury saved money wonderful
but the economy doesn't happen and so it
was a weakening so this time around
after covet
that's a GDP went from 35 to 100. the
public debt held by by the public by
Generations in the U.S 100 of GDP so
when they raise rates one percent it
increases federal spending to pay
interest by one a full one percent of
GDP not the first day it's not all short
term but the present value of that is
functionally equal to one percent
and so by increasing rates I think the
government interest payments are now
larger than the military spending
there it's the largest item in the
federal budget it's uh the federal
deficit has gone up to eight or nine
percent of GDP I can't get an exact
number half of that's interesting
and it wouldn't have been there if they
hadn't raised rates so by raising the
deficit spending that high
unemployment went down and not up GDP
growth went up and not down right now
fed Atlanta is predicting projecting 5.6
growth for this quarter this is Boom
time
so we're running massive deficits
during a period of ultra low
unemployment
okay and it's feeding this boom in the
United States and it's couldn't be more
regressive Rolls Royce sales are
backlogged for four years 450
000 car wasn't enough they got a 20
million dollar car they're selling them
all this money's you know it's
trickle-down economics in the worst way
you can imagine but it didn't it has its
effects and it's causing this
growth okay exactly the opposite of what
the federal reserve's done they've got
it backwards
so uh that's in the paper too now where
does this go
because why did they raise rates the
last time
they raise rates because
you know contrary to their forecasts
which were for recession which have been
for recession for the last year and a
half the economy has been growing for
year now
and the more it grows it's because they
haven't raised rates enough so now they
raise rates and more and so it grows
some more so they raise rates some more
so it grows some more this has been
going on for a year and a half
and you have to ask where does it end
they're saying well eventually they're
going to cause a recession or a crash
the financial structure the cracks are
developing now there's always winners
and losers so they pick a few losers and
say the cracks are developing then the
macro numbers come out and it's growing
because they're flooding the economy
with money right and they and the more
it grows the more they add to them
so Elizabeth and I were in Australia
Australia Argentina a year and a half
ago
I met with the head of the Central Bank
there for about four of us and uh first
thing he says is you don't need to
introduce yourself I've been reading it
for 10 years that was nice
and I
we went through it and he had one of his
economists said yeah Sergeant Wallace
did this 1987 paper in the U.S they
found the same thing you do it's like
but we've got this IMF agreement there's
nothing we can do about it
okay
interest rates were like 30 percent
because inflation had gone to 25 so
they'd raise rates to 30. they've been
doing this for a year sound familiar
okay after we left
inflation goes to 35 so they raised
rates to 40. the place it goes to 45 so
they raise rates to 50. last week I just
saw 118 interest rate inflation I don't
know whether I'm getting them confused
it was 90 a month before
okay unemployment's down the economies
doing just fine they're flooding it with
pesos
right there's like no end to this
and what they've done
stay assumed I've been talking to the
mainstream of Congress you've seen the
things on Twitter I assume people don't
spend any of their interest income so it
doesn't count for deficit spending
well then why are we growing at 5.6
you've got to like fine-tune your model
here this this money
is being spent because GDP the economy
is spending that's all it is
okay if it wasn't being spent growth
would be a zero you're you're your
recession forecast would be correct
but it's not correct it's wrong adjust
your model assumption
well I don't know if they're starting to
do it because they just stopped
forecasting a recession now
but we'll see what happens okay so
anyway that's in the paper here too
sorry about the interest expense
to summarize I see the interest rate
policy is both backwards and Confused
first the rate of inflation academically
defined as an expression of the central
bank's policy rate so rate hikes
increase that measure of inflation now
I'm not saying that
because the price of gold today is 1500
and the interest rate is five percent
it's going to be
22.50 or something a year from now that
doesn't mean it's going to go there
but that means right now if you want to
buy gold for your forward you're going
to have to pay five percent more
thank you
it's five percent
so you're gonna have to pay more
dividing your phone does that affect
where prices will be a year from now I
think it does
but I don't have any tools to do the
economists the central banks do they
haven't even begun to look at that
to see how that will will affect next
year's prices but it gets baked into how
contracts are made for purchases for
next year now
it's got they're willing to pay more for
labor
because they're going to get a higher
price they're willing to pay more for
all the supplies you know you have
markets that sort out relative value
giving get getting this information due
to Central Bank policy that and for
right now to buy things forward you've
got to pay more and now markets are
discounting all that so it's in there
now I can't tell you
exactly how to play on it's not what I
do
but I know it's a factor
okay go ahead
this further implies that if wages are
indexing a general price level
in the context of positive interest rate
an increase in the wage will cause a
larger increase in the price so
which will then trigger a higher wage
this is on the cost side
so we've got it on both sides and right
now of course wages need to catch up a
lot they've fallen way behind so I'm not
saying this is a problem I'm just saying
it'll happen
okay and uh so we've got the interest
rates and we've got the aggregate demand
coming from the added expense to support
those higher prices implied by the
interest rates
and we have incentives for higher wages
so that
it will circulate and be sustaining it
will self-sustain there's nothing in
there that's going to break is what I'm
saying this is going to keep going
forever which is what's happened in
Argentina
however in the concept at a zero percent
see that that
fact is not there
and if you notice Japan's kept their
zero percent rate throughout this whole
thing and they've had the lowest
inflation and the highest deficit it's
250 or so percent including interagency
about 160 or 70 without it but it's
still the highest deficits in the world
and the lowest inflation rate and
they've got other policies that keep
prices down
and they also are ruled by their
exporters they have the export like
growth narrative
those people try to make sure that
domestic prices are down including Wages
that's another problem
uh
just a quick word on the hierarchy of
demand
all aggregate demand starts from the
state
once there's a tax in place the funds to
pay that tax come from the state if it
doesn't spend them there is no aggregate
demand outside of the state so that's
where it starts and it goes through a
filter
and I've gone into this in another paper
not so much here
it makes a difference where if the
government hires everybody and pays it
to do work versus gives all the money to
one contractor in the U.S the whole five
trillion or Six Trillion and has him go
hire people and keep a trillion for
himself
that I call that the demand filter how
the demand gets from the state to the
ultimate people who spend it makes a
huge difference
conclusion
okay the chapter provides a framework
for the analysis of the price level this
is how to analyze the price level
and inflation so
it doesn't give you all the answers but
it gives you the correct starting point
in the correct framework to come up with
a
to use to come up with an answer so at
least the answer is going to be grounded
on reality AS Plus these other answers
that wind up with results where they're
just doing it backwards
the right way around
framework is that the currency itself is
a monopoly
the state is setting nominal Demand with
its tax liabilities
as well as providing the tax credits
that allow compliance with those tax
Cycles it's not complicated
I didn't give you any higher Mass the
understanding entirely explains the
source of the absolute nominal
value price level over time
it implied as the role of interest rates
with regard to academic definition of
inflation
and the influence of public policy rates
on Market determined expressions of
relatively
so that's the paper
how many times has this been cited by
other mmt academics
how long has it been out a couple of
years yeah
I tried to help out with another paper I
did it
2017 with professor
damianos of Calabria we was a very good
Economist here we collaborated on and
it's called maximizing price stability
in a monetary economy it got published
in a peer-reviewed mainstream journal
the journey the Journal of policy models
modeling is the number one two
mainstream journal in the world
and it shows it was designed for the
European Central Bank to have uh better
meet their single mandate or Price
stability
it shows that an employed buffer stock
gives you better price stability than an
unemployed buffer stock which is what
they're using now and how to implement
it and it's published in this mainstream
Journal so it's fully accepted by the
mainstream community and nobody uses
that
I haven't seen anybody beside that one
in fact they don't like it because
what it shows is that if you want to
have maximum price stability if you want
the best inflation fighting policy
possible you'll use an employed buffer
stock rather than an unemployed buffer
stock
which is the job guarantee
but it doesn't say it's a
you know
part of you know it's a human right to a
job or anything like that
it doesn't give any bleeding heart
argument about why you should have full
employment it just says it's a central
bank if you want to do your job and hit
your price stability targets you need to
have this full employment cost
that okay and so it's an entirely
monetary grounds
for fiscal responsibility monetary
responsibility absolute price stability
this is how you do it now that I think
that's the way to successfully
get this thing implemented but
apparently nobody agrees with you
I'll leave it at that okay thank you
said you're going to be challenged
I think you're all thinking that that
guy was right so it could be a lot of
things going around in your head now if
you think me well I think I understood
the most of that
good job all right it's complicated and
it'll challenge you
um now you probably have a sense maybe
of empowerment you shouldn't because you
now know
more than most of the world's Central
Bankers all right seriously you do now
that's kind of frightening though isn't
it because so you've got the empowerment
but you've got oh no do they nearly know
what they're doing so it slightly makes
you feel a little bit uneasy as well so
I'd what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take some questions as Warren said
sometimes the the questions that we have
some pre-prepared ones and but I'm going
to try and blend them
so if you've sent the question in I'll
try and make sure it's asked from these
but I'll sort of blend the two so what
I'll do is I'll probably ask a question
for the audience uh that's been
presented then I'll open it to you so in
the meantime if you want to ask Warren
about how come these central banks don't
know what they're doing or anything else
from his presentation you know please
ask him that now obviously if you've got
more general questions you might kind of
want to kick them down down the road a
bit because Warren did mention the job
guarantee just towards the end and after
you've had your your coffee and your
cake and your brain some covered a
little bit you can come back and ask him
about the job guarantee so I've got the
first question
um which is from Andy Andy Verity and he
says um
in the last in the UK last October the
bond market sell-off accelerated sharply
following a mini budget where tax cuts
were announced without any matching tax
Rises or spending cuts
that episode was taken by those who
supported auster of the 2009 and 2019 as
Vindication prove that if you don't
adopt at least what some minimal
physical targets EG have a debt falling
as a percentage of GDP then you can lose
confidence in markets and bond yields
therefore interest rates mortgages Etc
or job or the pound will fall worsening
uh inflation of employing goods it
doesn't like us the UK you can't count
on them unlimited demand for pounds
around the world it's seen as vulnerable
the currency shocks are bond market
sell-offs if it doesn't subordinate all
the policy goals fiscal targets now how
do you respond to that view it's quite a
long question so I'm going to give
Warren the paper if he's forgotten what
I said
yeah okay
all right good okay so
question is by market sell-off
what does that even mean
so you have these long-term securities
the price went down the yields went up
they're tied to mortgages
same thing happened at the banks and
people would make mortgages they got
scared what were they afraid of they
were afraid these policies would cause
inflation
why do they care about that well because
they believe that the central banks the
back of influenced response to inflation
would be to raise interest rates
so I'm not going to make a mortgage at
six if the central bank's going to raise
them to eight I'm caught with a six
percent loan on my books when rates are
an eight and now I've got to pay people
eight for deposits today I'll be making
mortgages at eight at nine just six
percent mortgages like bad investment
so they were afraid of What's called the
central bank's reaction function how are
the central banks going to react to
higher inflation
okay now the bank of Japan inflation
went up and rates are still zero they
pegged them at zero the whole time so
that doesn't happen in Japan
because their reaction function was
different
okay and so what has happened in the UK
is what you're looking at is
our response to a central bank reaction
where does that come from
that comes from
people who've been appointed to the
central bank and what their opinions are
of what they should do in certain
circumstances
and they've been approved by Parliament
or whoever approves these people and now
you're you've got this institutional
structure that causes exactly what
you're talking about and bless you the
answer is
you know to change that institutional
structure
okay because number one theft GDP is 100
in the UK they've got it backwards also
the higher rates aren't going to do what
they think they're going to do and
number one and
uh
let's see let me get the rest of the
questionnaire
and I think the markets were probably
not wrong given the participants that
will be responding
to what happened I think that if they
had done that
to enough of a degree it would have
caused inflation itself to
it could have caused inflation to go up
and it could have caused the central
bank to Rich race now what's happened
subsequently to that
is that I think the new government the
government actually is in there did
something similar right and the markets
didn't respond that way
because again
they did see the central bank as
likely to react under this government as
it would have under the previous
regime now is that
Fair statement I actually followed the
UK particularly because it's now up to
the point where the the bomb deals are
as high now as they would have been last
October they are yeah okay so they're
back up there yeah so it turned up into
policies were kind of similar yeah
basically one was shot one was faster
right right so uh you might want to say
that the office for Budget
responsibility was not consulted about
that many budget yeah and you know so
you know there was a political notebook
in the near term markets can do anything
so so what I could do is give you an
Institutional structure you don't have
to worry about this and like in Pompeii
it's pretty hard to come up with a
reason not to have a permanent zero rate
policy
when you're not on a gold standard or
some fixed exchange rate
which we aren't haven't been in a very
long time uh
and you know Pompeii never paid interest
on
time had anything to do
was never an inflation problem okay
because they understood it was about
prices paid by the government so once
you understand it you have a permanent
zero rate policy and the other thing you
don't have any government bonds you just
leave all the uh the deficit spending
just piles up in accounts at the central
bank that are
reserves demand deposit accounts
overnight yeah
okay
you basically called some kind of well
it should be called open activities
declaring down okay that's that's what
they used to be called okay
this episode of social supporters here
if you don't adopt at least some of the
minimal physical targets then you would
lose the confidence in marketing plan
which is very possible and so uh and
this has happened in numerous places so
you but you set yourself up for that
okay and you've put yourself off balance
so that if somebody touches you you're
going to fall down you haven't set
yourself up in a solid foundation where
that doesn't matter and we see the same
thing in the U.S where somebody will say
something or do something some news
comes out and you'll see
you know what the Traders call large
jobs
how much did he actually yield to jump
at the announce the Atlanta to the
announcement went
for 4.75 I think it's somewhere from
about two yeah yeah
that means right the long-term race
jumped 200 isn't yes
okay so they don't have two percent no
they didn't go up 30 or something like
that two percent's a lot they probably
would have adjusted after that it was
probably uh you know Panic Traders
you'll see stock markets drop a lot and
come back in the same day you know it
happens all the time where
um
when when markets become a liquid and
nobody knows what to do you get wild
swings
and that can happen and
and the other thing you can do which I
propose is you have you can have your
mortgage funding
directly from
government it does through government
policy so we have uh Fannie Mae Freddie
Mac we have housing agencies which give
mortgages that fixed rates and those
rates can be set by the government and
if they make a mistake and they're will
hire a little while they are but but you
get a stability that way and if you if
you have a policy of let's say a
permanent zero rate
you know a policy of three percent
mortgages from your federal agencies and
don't forget the banks and federal
agencies who just have different rules
that these other agencies I'm talking
about
then you can have stability in those if
you feel that it serves public purpose
and nothing bad is going to happen from
there
it's not going to be any negative
followers from there but we don't have
that given the institutional structure
that the UK has right now this stuff's
going to happen over and over again
until it changes and it's going to be
very disruptive you've got a disruptive
institutional structure and
that disruption has real costs for
convenience just to be clear you're
saying that the market correctly happens
yeah yeah the market anticipated this
what the central bank they believed it
would do which I'll tell you is the
wrong thing but the market maybe thought
was the right thing
because the Market's just people so look
in the U.S
if you Market collectively we've had a
negative yogurt the market has been
assuming that the governments the
Federal Reserve is going to lower rates
okay
within six months you can that's where
rates trade they trade 100 or 200 base
points lower six months forward
and they've been wrong because all the
yield curve is is a vote by the people
who are in the markets and you're asking
somebody to to land forth 30 years on a
mortgage
tough decision and if you panic him
by saying oh we're going to have this
program where we're going to run the
deficit up and do this and he backs off
and says I'm not going to do no more
three percent mortgages they're going to
be five because you guys might do that
he's acting perfectly reasonable given
what he knows what they know doesn't
mean he's right
okay but it's a reasonable thing so
you've got an Institutional structure
that's set up
to have this kind of volatility on
uncertainty uncertainty is going to be
matched with this tremendous volatility
Time After Time After Time you'll see it
in the currency itself
see the currency fluctuate
big numbers because somebody does
something or says something and then
down the road you'll turn on it it was a
false alarm and it corrects it but you
don't know at the time this is a market
response to uncertainty
and you can set up structures
to eliminate that type of thing it
doesn't have to happen okay so that's
the first part of your
question do you have any any more uh
there was another amazing but yeah
somebody else things with Trish anymore
actually okay or the power will fall
worst thing inflation sorry I just
wanted to ask something related to that
question because I think when uh the
issue of loss of confidence many um
commentators interpreted what happened
as the markets thing the government is
going to default on that
yeah which okay so it the way you look
for that is that um
credit default swap premium
which is a direct risk premium and that
went up in the U.S you know during that
crisis and governments can default okay
they can always make the payment they
don't have to box a check they just the
academic could make the payment but in
the U.S the Federal Reserve could always
make the payment but they have to be
instructed by the treasury by Congress
to make the payment and if Congress is
up against the debt ceiling and struck
hitting the debt ceiling is instructing
the FED Reserve not to make the payment
okay in 1943 Japan defaulted to the
United States on a Yen payment
okay it was the middle of the war
but it wasn't because they didn't have
the Yen it was just a credit and a
central bank you know they could do it
they decided not to so
so solvency is too thin you know credit
risk is two things it's ability to pay
and willingness to pay
ing about the UK institution structure
is that
illegal for the government too
the debt of the present because the law
requires that they do so the wise in Act
of power the law is not so Parliament
decided to not pay they can over
activate
and if there was a bill in front of
parliament to decide to not pay yes
because so many from one some monetary
crime group
and convince them not to pay
then you'd see the fault risk going up
not because it can't but because
the willingness isn't there
so in that and I believe the US was
downgraded based on willingness to pay
don't blame it we get that close to a
default because of
Congress won't vote to pay there's a
there's a real possibility that that
could happen
so
um how many people like
I try to pick on anybody it's well known
Donald Trump would complete a
construction project they wouldn't pay
for it
and then they'd negotiate a lower one
because they didn't want to go to court
all right so it's not because he didn't
have the money it's because he didn't
want to tell you
that's how we believe you negotiate
better prices
um
the other thing that was physical
science now let's look at this other
thing this is important the pound will
fall
worsening inflation of imported goods
prices would be a one-time increase in
Imports because unlike the U.S
they can't count on unlimited demands
for pots it's not about not being able
to
count a conference limited demands
the the
for pounds it's more about
worrying about the value
people have they or may not have a
certain size the US doesn't have
unlimited demand nobody has Unlimited
but it's it's about the value and about
the reasons for that people collect
foreign exchange so um
so it's vulnerable to currency shocks so
let me just add this thing in general
about the currency
real wealth of the UK or any other
country
is let's call it its pile of stuff
and your pile gets bigger with more
domestic output
the domestic output is mostly a function
of the number of people working it's
working plus productivity productivity
is fairly steady but there's employment
so when employment goes up that's what
comes up
and so to get your maximum wealth if you
want your pile of stuff to be as large
as possible so you want full employment
the the loss of wealth from unemployment
staggering you know the loss of wealth
unemployment in one year is probably
more than the real losses from all the
wars in the history of the country
because of lost output from these people
it's done for inflation
imaginary
you know people believe it but for
inflationary purposes whatever but
there's a huge loss with my lack of them
the other thing is your Imports make
your pile larger
so the more things you import your pile
gets larger export
iconic example right and so you bring a
your mind goal that South Africa you
take a gold coin and you bring it up to
London you come home with a man of soup
okay
they don't care in London what the value
of these South African currency is Iran
could be up down they don't care if
there is a currency
one gold coin will exchange for one
men's suit and that price is not
determined in South Africa that's
determined in World Markets
in Australia I used to say the coal
boats for coal leave Newcastle for Hong
Kong and they come back full of
television sets and they exchange a call
for television sets as World prices it
doesn't matter what the level of the
Australian dollar is or if it goes up or
down or even if there is an Australian
dollar they just don't care
what what the currency does matter for
is who has to dig the coal and who gets
to watch the television set who has to
mine the Gold and who gets to wear the
men's suit that's what the value of the
currency is about it's a distributional
issue in your car donation and that can
always be addressed with fiscal policy
with which is entirely distributional
right and it is addressed continuously
in the fiscal policy and with other
legislation and so if the drop in the
currency the drop in the currency is not
going to alter the real wealth of the UK
the real wealth is still going to be
there you're you're still at full
employment you can always sustain that
domestically your exports will trade for
certain amount of imports while you know
they don't care what the level of the
pound is that's not going to change and
uh but what will change is its
distribution who has to do the work and
who gets to
drive around in the imported cars
and that can be addressed by internal
policy if it's adverse
and you can have things in place to
ensure that it works in favor of the
elector or whatever that means and so
yes the currency can go up or down
and it's not a desired thing it's
disruptive I understand all that but at
the end of the day
it's not affecting your real wealth
affecting your distribution and that's
easily remedied or
you know readily remedied by
domestic policy
okay so it's not as big a deal as you
think and if you look at
um
you know the pound's gone from five
dollars to 1.25 over the last 100 years
or something yeah the real GDP has gone
up the real standard of living is going
on
it's not it hasn't like crushed your
real wealth or anything has it affected
sure
you have internal policies for
distribution here
okay so again be careful about
where you put the emphasis on when the
currency moves
it's not taking anything away from the
nation
and I'm not saying it is a problem but
it's a different problem
okay okay a question
I do agree with you what he's saying
about about the real currency what that
word buys and doesn't buy but I think
more importantly in the UK we are we are
energy importance right yeah so if you
can't see Falls in plummets you will end
up paying more in energy Imports how do
you how do you sort of how describe that
too because at some point we feel that
and we felt that right so yeah yeah
Energy building economy you have to be
wary or you're buying in dollars right
yeah you know energy you're not yeah but
you're you know you're getting more for
your exports in terms of power so the
average person they don't care about
that right that's what I'm saying it's a
distribution exactly so I think the
problem is in this room we all
understand that the the tactics of macro
economy right yeah but you talk to the
average block who works you know who's
right delivering Parcels it's critically
important exactly right and it's
regressive right exactly so my point is
that I think we're talking like right
yeah but you don't want public policy
necessarily to stabilize the power if
it's going to reduce your real output
your real wealth what you want is to
have some kind of a a subsidy for energy
exactly transfers physical transfers
yeah that's what Japan did right which
you already have you know we've had we
had enough what's the tax now on energy
coming in it's probably
if if how much does like a leader cost
and what's the cost of the product
I've said probably about nothing taxi is
about 60 70
tax so you could you could have the tax
adjust
so the price stays the same right
because the tax now is 70 you can have
the tax adjust exactly the price to
States but then that's the problem the
problem is this mess around the entire
policy making you know yeah yeah you've
gotten drink taxes done because that's
people stuff right right that's the
problem I understand what I'm saying is
there are the tax you have now is
already causing it to be a lot worse
you know it's worse than the Palm going
down you put a 70 tax that's like the
pound going down you know 70 if you
didn't have the tax right so
you know you're already creating a worse
problem with this text and the pond
appreciation is ever created all I'm
saying is you can reverse some of that
regressive taxation
you've got a hugely regressive tax on
fuel it only affects people of low
income in fact and then the pound goes
down to affect people oh so now we have
to have policy to stabilize the pound
and we're going to put you out of work
on top of not being able to on top of
taxing you for fuel it just adds insult
to injury
okay so that's why I'm saying a domestic
policy adjustments make a lot more sense
than anything that's going to take away
your real wealth
uh we've probably got chances of the
chap at the back I think he's way
I've got a question
speaker
this will have to be the last one yeah
examples
the first one is do you act
ual action post that on your children
did they actually accept it you know I
did it for a couple of days and then you
know I got I don't want to deal with it
the currency that we're using now is tax
driven yeah
yeah given you've got examples you know
Pompeii Virginia pound yeah calorie
sticks yeah
yeah you know it's it every there was a
time when everybody knew this right
Render unto seizure that which is
seizures I mean everybody knew this
thousands of years ago trivia money from
Rome is all this
is pretty obvious it got lost about
a couple 100 250 years ago somehow the
knowledge got lost
Mitchell Innis wrote about it but he was
a note until somehow he got on my
website
it was a wire I think but I don't know
how I found that somebody less assembly
but uh
I I think I got lost when they started
making the money the funds convertible
gold standards when you had Kings who
apparently weren't the
sharpest people
and then the bankers around them got
them convinced of what they had to do to
fight a war and it was you know
we think we had lobbyists then those
were pretty serious lobbyists because
it's the king they needed to go into
death to a money broker and uh
I don't know it just got lost but even
then you know I was when I was in
Cambridge for a while working
people there I ran into a guy who
studied Alfred the Great
and I started mentioning this to him he
says yeah that was interesting because
he had coins like that and the further
he got from London or whatever the less
they were used and yeah they were tax
driven coins
you know as everybody knew about this
this was not any kind of Mystery
it was pretty simple but somehow it's
got lost
it's just
killing us I don't know what else to say
but all these obvious policy options are
right there at hand are considered not
viable because we've got the money story
backwards right I think that's why
you're all here
yeah well we'll see you back maybe
sort of content or of course and Warren
and then that's really over to you I've
got a few more
questions I've already said now maybe
and I'll interchange those with your own
so I'll hand over the war and bit on job
guarantee maybe a little bit more on the
trade question then it's it's over to
you for questions uh in terms of uh like
the exchequer stuff I've got Neil is an
expert on the British executive system
how it fits in with you know Central
Bank and everything else
everything else other than that well
we've got the great money here so
that'll be able to hit so I'll handle it

okay so
um first I'll go back to
my business card here
and I put a tax
I one of these to get out of here you're
all unemployed
and then I offer you a job
why do I do that because it's a human
right for you to have a job
no
it's got nothing to do with it I don't
want this carpet cleaning
you didn't have to do that before I put
the tax on I've added
something in addition okay and then
there's 50 of you but I said but I'm
only going to spend
45 cards
first 45 get jobs the last five don't
now there's unemployment residual we had
50 unemployed now there's five
residually unemployment
like whose fault is that
that's my fault
I did this
almost malicious right
it's some kind of wrongful imprisonment
to have you in this room because I put a
tax and then I wouldn't let you come
earn a card
how do we ramify remedy this
give you a job turn a card
or give you a card or lower the tax
I say the tax is only half the card for
everybody and now there'll be jobs that
pay 45 cards okay but
to have these people out of work and
then have people demanding that I give
them work because it's a human right
isn't the strongest argument in the
world to get this done
the argument for the job guarantee at
the monetary level is the government has
created 10 million unemployed only hired
3 million
now there's 7 million still out there
and it's like oh you know these people
are entitled to work because it's a
human right to work and it's not me you
can look up the legislation in front of
Congress put out help
beginning to end by mmt proponents and
the reasons they have this job guarantee
is because under some United Nations
it's a human right or under Franklin
Roosevelt said it was a human or
something like that and it's just
immoral
to not let people work well work is a
real cause it just sort of perverts the
whole thing and I'm not saying people
don't have a human right to work I know
the literature they think they do okay
but there's a better stronger first
order argument going on here that
was left out and that is should be
saying whereas
people are on the government created the
unemployment by Design in the process of
provisioning itself
and then
created more unemployed than it wanted
to have than it hired
it has an obligation maybe even a
constitutional obligation because it's
like it's almost like wrongful
imprisonment it has an obligation
to either hire those people
it costs to be unemployed in public
service or to transition them back to
the private sector
because you are all in the private
sector doing something whether it's
shopping or working or something until I
put a tax on here and then I extracted
you out of the private sector your labor
now belongs to me because it's my tax
collector with a nine millimeter
I've either got to give you a job to let
you out of the you out of the room
somehow or it's wrongful imprisonment
right
right and so that's why I think the when
it's framed that way
and it's easily understood that way it's
not hard to understand it's actually
easier
that you know and a good example is you
know I had that debate with Robert
Murphy remember that at NYU throwing
Grace set it up it was masterful on his
part
legal department really well done John
Carney was a moderator CNBC and he is
now a Breitbart I think that's
pronounced
could be more right-wing and he fully
supports the job guarantee because he
wants to see these unemployed back in
the private sector
and when they're back into private
sector they're producing more useful
output and it makes everybody it's
adding to our pile of stuff it makes the
nation wealthier
so like why aren't we doing this well we
don't understand the monetary system
expense will go up you might get too
intensive adjustment the price level one
time you won't get any inflation okay
but it's not getting done so he wants to
see it get done and
and yet the left that's actually getting
these things up front won't
present it that way and when I actually
went on Twitter and said
you know I think you know to me I would
lead with the monetary side of it
showing that to hey it's enhancing price
stability we've got inflation problem
and B um
the government caught by say hey the
government caused this it has a
probably a legal obligation to like make
it right
and B it's anti-inflationary so let me
get into the anti-inflationary part
right now we use an unemployed and I
touched on this earlier we use
unemployment to fight inflation
and the Federal Reserve starts raising
rates they're saying yes unemployment
will go up a little bit but that's the
cost of bringing inflation down that's
our buffer stock the more unemployed
they feel uh
puts downward pressure on inflation when
unemployment gets too low like it is now
three and a half percent instead of
50-year low
telling them it's because they haven't
raised rates high enough I can tell it's
because they did raise rates but they've
got a backer track they've been trying
to push it up and it's been going down
and they were severely criticized for
engaging in a policy that was going to
cause higher inflation including a lot
of mmt performance
and they should be criticized for
intending to do that but the actual
effect of the policy is to bring a
unemployment down right
they are petrified with unemployment at
this level because that's the net you
know it's like a trapeze trapeze artist
their net is unemployment that's their
buffer stock against inflation and once
that's gone that any price pressures
just turned into runaway wage demands in
their mind let me get we get something
we haven't seen and we still haven't
seen in a night they agree we haven't
seen it which isn't
wage driven inflation the reason we have
it is because there's excess in their
minds excess capacity and um but now
they say inflation hovering around the
lows unemployment claims every week at
ridiculously low level they're petrified
that if they've made a mistake and
inflation comes back they have nowhere
to go they're stuck so um
anyway so we've got unemployment as a
buffer stock
if we can make the case that an employed
buffer stock which is what you have in a
job guarantee it's a buffer stock
it's a better inflation fighter
than unemployment
that's all you need it doesn't have to
be perfect it's not going to stop the
Saudis from raising the price of oil
right
but if it if it stabilizes the labor
market it acts like an employment agency
so business can hire these people it's a
transition job and so it keeps you know
wage pressures contained
at least as well as unemployment does
it may be better
it only has to be as good really then
there's no reason not to go to that
okay it doesn't have to be perfect you
know you know the story about you know
you don't have to outrun the bear
these two guys are walking in one of
them is what if we come across the Bears
and all I've been a run
you can't outrun the beer he says I
don't have to I only have to outrun you
I'm the employed buffer stock only has
to outrage unemployment in fact the
unit's equally good because unemployment
has so many uh negative externalities
they call them of crime and everything
else that goes with it broken families
and all kinds of issues even if it's
just as good but we can show that it's
better okay because it's more liquid
because you can interview businesses if
it's studies done that show business
prefers hiring people already working it
doesn't want to hire the unemployed and
then the last cycle famously there were
signs in the news help wanted you know
must be employed I just don't want it
because people once they're unemployed
they might be on drugs they don't clean
they get fights or something unless
somebody's working comes in every day
the supervisor their odds of being
employed are way up and it's costly
today to hire somebody Labor's protected
which it should be but it adds a cost to
hiring somebody if they don't work out
problem okay so
those are the two ways that I think it
could get implemented immediately
because most people are in favor of it
okay so understand it's far better than
unemployment and controlling inflation
number two it's caused by government
policy and all we're asking to do is
stop that policy of putting on a tax to
create unemployment and then not hiring
those people that you just cause to be
unemployed presumably because you wanted
to employ them as Government why else
would you do this
when the Europeans went into Africa and
put a hot tax where if you didn't pay
your tax you're going to burn your house
down
people showed up to work at the
plantations
it gave them all jobs
let them earn all the cards they wanted
to use some kind of script
and then people paid their taxes
they didn't do this and then not hire
the people so they could go burn their
houses down
why would they do that I didn't know
they did that but that's what we're
doing that's what the European unions do
okay
putting a tax on everybody's house
they're not
playing people aren't enough money to
handle it and then they'd go and burn
your house down no they're not burning
them down but they're burning your life
down with this unemployment thing that
they've created
malicious it's wrongful
say it's unintentioned
okay because they don't know this story
now if it was intentional I'd be giving
them more credit than they deserve
because I know a lot of these people and
they're not that good to be able to
figure this out to do it
there and it's more damning to call it
you know innocent fraud than than
malicious about who these people are and
what they're doing
um
so that that's the um
job guarantee and so how does that
affect you like
I saw pavelina a few years ago actually
I think she'll do this anymore so but
it's a good example she's on Bloomberg
television
she talks about the job guarantee and
they but we said what are all these
people going to do
and she says oh there's lots of useful
work out there
wrong answer
they're going to transition to private
sector jobs that's what they're going to
do
when they hear that it's like okay who's
against that
but giving them things to do it says
whatever they're doing it's going to
help them get back into the private
sector because the private sector likes
to hire people already working that's
how you lead with that kind of a
question so they said well what about
what are they actually going to do
well uh one thing I've suggested is
qualifying non-profits can be allowed to
to pay the job guarantee wage whatever
it is 15 an hour to anybody who comes to
work for them
okay and then those people will
transition and why would we do that so
those people can transition into private
sector meantime they're working for
qualified non-profits not just anybody
and so then oh uh we'll let agents of
government hire assistance knowing they
can't give them raise they're temporary
because these people are going to be
very attracted to the private sector and
they're going to transition back to
private sector so
keep it out front at the point of this
whole thing is to transition people to
the Privacy well what about all the
things that need to be done in a public
sector those people need to be hired
anyway in the normal course of public
sector housing not some kind of job
guarantee program why because you're
under biting hard-earned gains and
well-deserved gains in the public sector
whatever you think a nurse is making at
the NHS it's not enough
it would be half that with all the work
and labor and organizing and everything
else that got them to levels that we
still think are too low for example and
if you start hiring job guarantee people
to start being their assistance and
working in different positions at half
as much you're just undercutting this
whole thing
and you don't need to do that
okay the government can hire people at
the normal going public sector wage
without any problem whatsoever with no
damage to the economy in fact it helps
everything
okay and you're getting much more
professional staff in there doing what
they're supposed to be doing and so you
know Bill Mitchell wants lifeguards that
can help people
learn to swim and teach them guitar fine
just have it regular public sector
people under Normal public sector wages
you don't bring in 15 an hour people and
the answer is well yeah but they're
never going to do that well that's a
different question
answering in the first order getting
people
stand what it's about is different than
what might wind up as a compromise and I
don't know that it will
not get any of this but
so this little talk is about framing
this thing so first fully provision of
public sector the government's caused 10
million people in the U.S to become
unemployed it's hired 3 million
hire whoever you need to fill in
government to do what it's supposed to
be doing
police officers or whatever you want
have enough Public Health people
whatever you want
School teachers Crossing
you got 7 million you've already cost to
be unemployed to use it if there are any
left which there will be you actually
don't want even though you can afford it
let's get them back into the private
sector by offering them a transition job
so they're attracted to private sector
move those people back and when you do
that
private sector output goes up because
the private sector is going to have
three million more people than it has
now working and everybody knows private
sector jobs are real jobs that produce
real output
they'll never you don't have to worry
about arguing now because nobody's going
to challenge you on that one
no
so uh and so the real wealth of the
country will go up according to their
output because their output will go up
more than their consumption
the guy who takes this job is he going
to consume more in real terms or or well
he's already eating three meals a day
probably
he's probably already driving around
it's already got some place to live oh
it's additional is he going to have it's
going to be less than his output because
the private sector only hires you if
they're paying you less than your output
right
so we know there's going to be more
output for the rest of us by having
these three million back to work plus
he's not going to consume
anymore by the amount of his income
it'll be a lot his additional
consumption if anything would be a lot
less
you know say well
it's going to import more you know
it's like
okay so the distribution of imports will
change slightly and these people are
going to have more cell phones than they
have now that are imported on this is
trivial it's not anything anybody would
care about total wealth has gone up
total Imports that we can as innate our
exports will go up and the Imports will
go up it'll get dwarfed and
pays for itself here's the wrong term
I'm trying to give this you are just
anecdote about Argentina when I was
there
So Daniel Kazar
he was at the labor Ministry in
Argentina and in 1998 he had read my
paper full employment price ability
which is where the job guarantee came
from which came from self-currency
economics I had one paragraph Paul
Davidson
that's not enough you got to expand it's
good pay for self-continent but you got
to expand on that so it's all right
there
he said no no so we make a paper and
show the debits and credits and all this
and it's called Full Employment price
stability
1997. Daniel Comes finds out about it
1998 comes to UMKC studies it
three years later in 2001 the what's one
peg for the peso breaks 32 deadness
Street in Argentine Buenos Aires so it's
a horrible scene and they float the peso
and Daniel comes in with the job
guarantee it's called the Hefe student
guard plan
they are offered a heads up a job to all
heads of households in Argentina
and uh
they got like
and these were people nobody ever
thought would work and came to and took
this job they had two million people
come into the program over the next
couple years and the whole population
was only like 33 or 34 million people
uh and they were having little we went
down and had a little like soup kitchens
for kids and they were digging
infrastructure water projects and stuff
for themselves and over the next couple
of years one million of them
transitioned into the private sector and
a wealth of Argentina went up they had
the best economy in the world they're
growing at nine percent
doing well so anyway a few years later
Daniels leaves the guy behind him he had
a budget decided he wanted to use it for
something else ignored the program it
was kind of a residual program let it
wind down and they start facing labor
shortages again
and so Daniel's there we need to come
down and make a presentation
about what they can do with these labor
shortages reopen you have Facebook
so I go down there we flew down in with
young crago and his wife he's a U.N
economist
and uh
Daniel you know we go into this meeting
about 20 people were all in our suits
and this was a progressive Institute in
Argentina
and maybe half of them were from the
central bank and the other half were
from this institute start explaining
what
going to my presentation about they
should they can offer a job to anybody
willing and it will work and the person
frontman says to me says well how much
would you pay these people
so I said well what's the minimum wage
in Argentina and he said 600 pesos a
month back then it was 200 a month which
nothing even back then
back then and I said well maybe half
that
because what we discovered in the
program is that people came in
because they wanted to work and one of
the interviews pavelina who went down
there
it's a research on the program said
would you rather come in and work or
just get the paycheck and stay home and
every one of them said they wanted to
come in and work
and half of them transitioned so it's
just a big myth that people just wanted
to get paid at least there with that
group of people
so uh
that's what I said maybe half that you
know
it's 300 pesos a month which is 100 a
month or so and uh this guy says to me
quote are you listening carefully here
if those people cause them those people
get paid that much money
he said some of them might eat some meat
this is Argentina right
so he said so Daniel who's Argentina
he's a you know at the middle shift
he just turned from and he said Greg
Leon from the un's car I told you about
these people this is supposed to be a
you know you don't think it's a real it
looks like a first world country I can
Buenos Aires on the surface
so uh you know I don't miss a step so so
I I said to him I said well look if the
person if the the purpose of your
current institutional arrangements or to
make sure a substantial portion of your
population can never afford to eat any
meat
you know you're already doing a good job
and you really don't need to hear the
rest of this music
so he's not faced by that he turns
around to the others he talks in Spanish
for two or three minutes and I ask you
on later when he was saying he said he
was talking about whether people should
eat it
I didn't know what he's talking about he
turned his back and he says well
we've decided that it might be okay if
those people ate some meat so we'd like
to hear the rest of your presentations
but you're up against some institutional
structures here that are pretty serious
right
and they never did this
because they really were worried about
some people eating something so uh
and in the UK particularly don't
underestimate what's left of the class
structure
because it's working back there I don't
know it is it might be lurking back
there
okay at some level
now I know it's a democracy here
I know you have a house
it's a hustle words but it's a democracy
we have a monarchy as well so and you
have a monarchy that doesn't spend all
that much money ten percent of GDP or
something
and uh
you know so yes you do have this element
there so anyway and that might be part
of the job guarantee issue
then some people might eat some meat and
that never gets mentioned you know there
they just sat in public here nobody
would even dream of hinting at that but
it could be what they're thinking and
impacts of their minds okay
any important questions
think I better open
for already mentioned the trading real
Wells earlier so again we're only 20
minutes left we
may take some questions
um I'll take one from the gym could you
say something about the importance of
the design of the tax system and
achieving public purpose
I mean
that's that's about 10 minutes which I'd
like to do but I want to see if there's
anything else quick and then yeah that's
important that's right
uh yeah the chap here yeah one quick
question Warren could you could you
explain
from the left there's a big bush about
Ubi and why drop Gandhi is better than
Ubi okay so that's queries I'll do that
first yeah so
you all owe me one card to get out of
the room you can earn one card to do the
floor but you know what I'm gonna give
you all one card for Ubi
but he leaves and I four doesn't get
time it threatens the ability of the
government to prove
if I give you half a card Ubi
okay I'll get half as much time on the
floor
all right now what it can do is if you
have a tax
if you're a society that's so
complex because of the tax codes and
everything else that rather than try and
undo that you can put this kind of a
Band-Aid on it
that
some issues that that's okay that's fine
but the risk is if you let that thing
creep up high enough where
everybody walks out the door and
nobody's cleaning the floor the
government has lost its ability to
provision itself with the currency it's
called hyperinflation
and it's pretty easy to understand how
it happens when you look at it at the
model level
same thing in Pompeii they said oh we'll
give Ubi to everybody so it's enough to
pay the tax and they don't get any
police officers the whole exercise is
about the government trying to provision
itself that's what the monetary system
is about that's very important I'm glad
you brought us up it's
it's the mainstream will say money came
around to facilitate trade and it was
better than barter was complicated and
it helped people organize their lives
and to save and all this stuff
the government
worser system
how does the government provision itself
well you used to have a system where you
know you go out to a bar and you wake up
on a boat with a bump on your head right
here in the Navy that's one way the
government can produce we pretend to be
more civilized right we put a tax on
everybody's house and if you don't work
for the government we burn it down
sorry sorry I'm taking you next the chat
in the far column I'm saving your okay
foreign
money in the bank bank of England in
this case you're taking you take you're
saying your balance has gone from a
million pounds to zero right
now you know now maybe that requires
Parliament to vote it as a tax it's part
of your taxing Authority maybe that's
actually a tax rather than I don't know
but it's uh anybody who understood what
they were doing they were doing because
you don't gain anything what is the
state gain by doing this yeah there's no
gain all you lose is all you causes
disruption
it doesn't help
it doesn't
there's no gain of real wealth in the
economy it's just disruption which
causes people not to work and you'll
lose you real well so it's just kind of
a suicidal move that's why nobody
actually does it even in the worst
Banana Republic with the highest debt
they go into the central bank and it's
zillion trillion pesos to pay today just
print it you know credit the accounts
like why not if you credit the accounts
you can keep the thing going you can
keep paying the Army you can keep people
in you redenominate the point is to run
the government why would you do anything
that causes you to not run your own
government
I'm not saying well Russia didn't in
1998 Russia
the Central Bank when they ran out of
reserves instead of just floating the
currency because they didn't understand
they just got up and walked out they
didn't even turn the lights out there
were no rubles cleared for like three
months or something by the central bank
and people started trading what they
called arrears it's a very interesting
name to put on debt call it a rears
which is clever and then when they came
in they credit all the accounts and
everything was okay so uh now
I left my firm at the end of 97 Russian
crisis was 98. August 98 and I had a
talked to the guy who was running the
book with that stuff I said we should go
to Russia talk to the central bank like
we did with Italy just so that things
happen they run out of reserves they at
least know which buttons to push
he said no we don't want to do that
because the spreads will go away and I
said
anyway that's that's why I left I didn't
just want to deal with this guy in my
firm who had that attitude of not
recognizing that that would have
protected and instead his fund went from
500 million to zero right because of
that
lectures like people talking about uvr
and stuff like that and as soon as you
start they're all coming at it from the
socially yeah
and as soon as you start mentioning
economics they look at you like you're
some kind of a devil yeah they're
speaking in tongues
as soon as you're making economics they
just don't want to know because they
think you're there to to to talk but
that's your problem not mine
yeah and it might happen because it
might happen
yeah
but you know I can tell you why it
doesn't work fundamentally but you it's
okay at a limited point but it goes past
the Tipping yeah it's not just life okay
so now the real thing
so I was just thinking I ought to see if
Michaels see he's fine because Michael's
politely submitted his question early so
I also ask him that then I'll go back to
the floor
um
it's about inequality
mmt argues that trade deficit is a good
thing for the Western Warren
specifically mentioned this in Israelis
however if exporting countries like
China either
good I would say it's an economic
benefit
okay you got to be careful
there's a difference yeah it's been a
good thing Warren yeah
I thought of that yeah
they're all long questions
um
so how everything sport you think
sporting countries like China either fix
the currency artificial raw Ray I'll
keep wages low relative productivity in
order to be competitive doesn't this
automatically mean that live in the west
will also be faster and set lower wages
uh is it logical to say the fundamental
source of inequality in the west is
princely due to predatory practice
overseas which have destroyed
well-paying manufacturing problems short
answer I'd say is no the U.S has some of
the highest wages and the largest number
of imports
so it doesn't need to do that at all
it can be completely the opposite if you
look at the high-wage countries the
reports are alive
so uh no you can have
an Institutional structure that does
that
it's not necessarily the case it's not
the Imports per se that would cause that
yeah is it fair to say the firms
themselves can use overseas competition
the cheapness of Labor overseas as a way
to drive wages down you know I know
that's not a macro question but like you
know that's you know that does happen
yes but um
it's still you know again the US is a
pretty high wage country and the average
wage for an auto worker and there's
plenty of competitions probably 60 70 an
hour
offshore all they're manufactured into
China yeah because so but what happens
if you want to pay the salaries to be
American Engineers right right so what
yeah so what happens is the remaining
jobs
more
it's a matter of Market forces
and that could be jobs that Google or
Facebook or something whatever they're
doing there yeah yeah they're a lot
Source but then the remaining jobs pay
more and if you look at our unemployment
rate three and a half percent if you
look at wages over time I think going up
you know and so you can confuse the
micro for the macro so to speak
and uh so it's not
it's not the case that the total wage
thing is held down by that now you can
we've got a more important thing going
on
the more important thing going on just
obviates the whole Phillips curve which
is that people uh work to eat business
only hires if it feels like it if it
likes to return on Equity so it's a
disparity of power so as your first
Elementary Game Theory it's not a fair
game yeah okay and so that tends to keep
wages suppressed over time unless
there's some kind of outside support
which used to be labor unions which
isn't anymore because
subject to unionization for smaller as
far so those places will do okay but the
rest isn't and so you need some kind of
support in this case from government
because there's nobody else left I don't
think
which would be the job guarantee and you
can set that minimum compensation in any
level you want
to ensure that real resources are
you know going to the bond to the lowest
income groups and so if you and it's
used interestingly in a place like
turkey
you'll see this wild inflation going on
then you'll see the government raise the
minimum wage by 50 or 100 to make sure
that their constituency who's working
people are in minimum wage keep up and
everybody else has to fight for the
scraps
there's actually a progressive thing in
that country in that context a lot of
other things aren't Progressive they'll
do that and they'll sustain their uh
constituency to vote for
you know and the inflation allows them
to do that because if crowds everybody
else it allows them to allocate real
resources to their constituency
foreign
it was running in 2004. let me uh
get to this
so Stephanie Kelton had me come to her
class at Stony Brook
she had all these sizes
left-wing activists in the class
I dressed for tonight anybody knows yeah
so um
so I get up there
and I talk about
um
why we should eliminate the income tax
and sales tax transaction taxes income
tax I go into the real compliance costs
so the real compliance cost of income
taxes
I thought were at least 10 percent of
GDP these are all the people tied up in
record keeping which is including
individuals all the tax preparers all
the tax
departments and all these major
corporations and minor corporations all
the universities that teach tax all the
overseas structures and all the lawyers
and put JP Morgan spends like 10 billion
dollars a year on Tax Matters you know
accounts and
taxidermists or whatever else they use
and uh
the um
all the legal system with tax law and
all the time spent there and the people
going to school to learn tax law lawyers
comes out to like 10 percent of GDP and
I talked to a friend of mine Raj side
University of Chicago I've been in a
business school
appointed us he says well I think it's a
lot higher
the dead weight cost to think of Texas
it's like 15 of GDP and they're smart
people so it's a huge Braintree
so if you
eliminate on the income tax all those
people are out of work
okay and they will get redeployed into
the regular economy and let's say you do
it into public services
Transportation Education Health and
everything else
who benefits most from those Services
what's the lowest income groups benefit
the most because people at the highest
income groups got their own
transportation their own health care so
so the lowest income boost benefit from
Ohio
and I said nobody's expects business is
happy because they don't have to deal
with this income tax they don't have to
keep any records the government doesn't
even have to know who you are I replace
it with a property tax I don't want to
get an argument with that but with real
estate taxes where they don't even have
to know who owns the house if it doesn't
pay they just sell them right so we
already have it set up there's zero
compliance costs
it out if you look at
the percentages you're increasing the
real standard of living
of the lowest 30 40 percent of incomers
by I don't know 50 to 100 percent okay
in real terms by eliminating the income
tax which is there because it's
Progressive to help the lowest income
people because they don't have to pay it
well it's actually hurting them because
they're paying the real compliance cost
because these are real people that would
be performing services that they'd be
using
okay and um
and so the tax is critically important
and nobody looks at the real compliance
costs which are taking away our real
wealth it's all dead weight stuff it's
all people digging holes and then
filling it in
and so when you look at attacks look at
that look at the least costly in terms
of real resources and I come up with
just as flat property tax to replace
everything which might be pretty high it
might be 10 or 12 but the other thing
that that does
is it for the resident he's not paying
any more it's all in his property tax
but he's not paying anymore because
um it's the same money roughly
but for the non-resident
who didn't pay income tax they didn't
live here he just owns a house in London
now he's paying 12 percent of his you
know 10 million dollar place that's a
lot of money it takes away its value as
an investment to have 12 being a voted
so you get rid of that Distortion of
having the city half empty with all
these absentee owners who would now have
to subsidize the queen directly you know
their taxes and all the other overhead
of the country rather than just whatever
property tax is doing locally this
property taxes have always been welcome
so um
is it Carol
so anyway so the question is how
important is taxes to have proposals
I've had that since soft car to
economics to replace it all with a
property tax Carol thinks just landed
not property would be better I don't you
know I don't wanna into that here but go
ahead did you have another question
you know you said about abolition of the
incomes yes which I
wish between earned income and unearned
income income tax here it's paid at the
same rate
so but anyway I finished the class and
they are dead
okay they recognize the most Progressive
thing we can do
drop the Yankees It's a simple thing to
do replace it with a property Tech which
is already in place so you just change
the one percent local property tax to 10
or 110 give it to the federal government
send a check so it's very very simple
and getting rid of the income tax makes
it but they were just they were
speechless okay because it just went
against the grain to not tax higher
income people at a higher rate even
though they know in practice they only
pay 10 or 12 anyway
they just couldn't bring themselves to
do it and it just got lost and they've
never
they acted as if they never heard it
okay
what when I when I applied to do an
economics degree of a mature student I'd
call it in trouble I wrote I had to
write an essay
um but it was based on the um definition
of economics by Lionel Lionel Robbins
which is that the um it's the um
is
so
so I is it not true
that there are two ways that resources
are allocated
either by markets or by government
is that not true yeah so it's either by
Price which is working with markets yes
requires by something else
yeah so for example we can we can tax
gasoline so people use less
or we can have a law that says cars have
to get everything has to get 50 miles
against it so there's even if you have
money you still got anybody can can
drive around so they're regressive and
Progressive organs say you can't use it
at all
okay and you have to so they're they're
you can legislate uses or you can okay
by price some things make sense to
allocate by Price other things you know
to me make less sense in her

but is it not true then you know the the
Communist believes in a command economy
but that's how you can command the
economy yeah but
band economies have underperformed yes
regular company you know market
economies in that they lose the war if
you lose a war it's too bad here's too
late they're gone so on a practical
level with human beings who fight each
other we want an economy that's going to
win the Warfare but yeah so you have
elements that are command economy and
elements that are left in the market and
that's how they all are they're all
mixed but what you can say for the
Communist party that Marx never
understood that MMP has introduced in
is that unemployment is created by
taxation by Design they have don't have
that in there they've got capitalists or
somebody creating it or markets creating
it it's not a market thing it's done by
a monopolist restricting Supply the
currency monopolist is not spending
enough to cover the need to pay taxes
the desire is the same it's the money
store
they need that to understand
unemployment
Warren in boxing defense under Marxist
time there's no shooting currency though
it just go back yeah but there was tax
yeah it was tax but yet you have to have
a tax to keep the I mean you couldn't
spend like you spoken you could spend
now because it wasn't fiat currency well
there were you know at least of a
commodity no well only for a few years
but you know before that it was all Fiat
you know Alfred the Great was all fiance
but yeah I mean he might have had a
restriction there but still the
unemployment is coming from the same
place right from the taxation it's just
the government you couldn't spend to
hire the people that it caused to be
unemployed but it did have to
Rockets currency to Gold either right so
that was a policy choice to have gold
and unemployment
okay so they were doing that because it
was mercantilist they was an export that
played growth narrative
Champion I think so Warren we can't have
a session on inflation without talking
about asset prices so how have we got to
the point where people cannot afford to
buy a house and in fact we can't afford
to build them is it bad Bank lending
policy and how do we extricate ourselves
from this housing problem that we have
everywhere
so um
you know people are renting them so they
can't afford to own rather than rent
serves public purpose to own rather than
rent
that you can go ahead and do something
so we decided in the U.S
I don't know 50 75 years ago that
families would be better children would
be better offers the parents were owners
rather than renters
right or wrong I don't know so we set up
this Fannie Mae Freddie made these
government housing agencies and
gave mortgages at lower rates from the
federal government than the banks would
have done based on
bad Capital requirements which were set
by the government that's why the rates
were different so it's still
institutional structure so instead of
changing the capital requirements so
thanks it'll end up over inside the
housing agencies do it and for 30 or 50
years we had millions and millions of
people moving to their own houses
raising children and
I don't know if it was better or not but
presumably it was better then in 08
we have an issue where
um the economy crashes
and the markets panic and the stocks of
these companies go down and the value of
their bonds goes down
or Mark to Market basis
and the opposition says look this
program has been a complete failure
these people are going to lose money
it's like this has been 50 70 years of
putting people in houses you know
because it was public policy
to do that benefits to do that and of
course two years later after they
heavilies
you know chain modified or whatever you
can attack them they were making profits
and paying back the liquidity laws that
the government made which weren't real
lows it would just back up the case they
needed it and they were profitable again
so yeah you know yes it can all be done
with housing agencies if you'd rather
have people own rather than rent it can
be done with public programs fixed rate
programs and the real benefits if there
are any having ownership over renting
are there and they will be
you know gained by the society if you do
that
the criticisms will be things like
after 50 years of success it has a
Market to Market loss for a half hour
see we never should have done this
so it you know and it's just political
swings back and forth so the short
answer is yes you can do that it's not
hard to do there are plenty of models
where it's been done to do it and it's
just a political will to do it it's
nothing more than that
don't oh
do you remember your own question on the
Steve King
um
you mentioned this was a deflationary
currency the food the burgers the
vertical yeah yeah well Steve King has
the story about Burger in Austria in the
depression where they have a deflating
currency yeah and so they went from 30
unemployment to zero I mean
so we told penetration which is kind of
kind of like a deflationary currency
so I mean now that you have comments
about deflationary currencies
you know people do that I don't know I'm
not sure what the
public purposes Japan's had a
two percent on a plane for a long time
and no inflation in the zero percent
rate in a regular normal currency if you
want to call it it's not a deflating
currency you know in terms of
self-destructing I think that's just a
your money expires or something right so
the other part of the question now that
I remember it was we have huge
inequality so don't we want to
so why are we avoiding inflation
wouldn't inflation actually help us
reduce the inequality we have in our
economy we wanted we want to reduce some
of the wealth why is everybody in favor
of the lottery that creates more
come on I asked Bernie Sanders to his
people what's his position on the
lottery they wouldn't answer
I want a quality but the lottery is a
good thing okay
I guess I just don't want it inequality
that's
earned that you know where there's
favoritism you know where it's inherited
or
somebody's started a company that does
bad things and made a lot of money or
something
as opposed to a guy bought a lottery
ticket because anybody could have done
that so it's fair I don't know how they
think about it they don't seem to be
against an equality per se it seems to
be something about the means that I
can't quite keep track of no I I don't
you know this
the biggest thing we can do is go back
to a zero rate policy this interest
payment
it's exacerbating it it's a pretty easy
thing to do
and it gets rid of the inflation and it
gets rid of
it in the quality screen and nobody will
even might consider it
so I think you're answering the question
all not enough people are asking
examinated yeah I mean there's inner
interest rate policy we've had super low
interest rates yeah
and over that period we've had a massive
increase in life
arguably you get a super cheap credit
card massive price which redistributes
wealth Outlets from young to old it's
Rich yeah so isn't there a risk that if
you Advocate zero interest rate policy
you know aggravate that effect
I I suppose originally it did happen in
Japan
they've had it for longer than anybody
so I'm not sure it's a zero report in
the U.S it started to go the other way a
little bit the last four or five years
is a zero rate policy because of the
be interesting so I think you have to
look for other parts of the
institutional structure that are causing
that and the zero rates will cause a
one-time adjustment NASA prices because
then they reflect the risk adjusted
uh returns that they're making and yeah
if you discount them at a different rate
you get it but I look at asset prices
under a zero rate policy as the base
case for asset prices that's kind of
where they start out like Pompeii has
already policy they didn't have asset
prices running away and uh
and then if you raise rates now you're
starting to Tinker with them and then
when you drop them again you're causing
all these distortions so you know we
haven't been
one of the distortions there's a lot of
the finance Market relies on guilt at
the foundational level for a lot of
collateral and leverage and what will
happen or what has happened there is in
this country the private pension
industry is suffered and if you want a
really low risk
pension fund for drawdown you rely on
government bonds and if they're sitting
at almost zero you've got that you're
forcing your investment company to put
more into the stocks and shares and then
your risk level you can't get a zero to
level one risk now they're all at level
three or four risk if you think risk in
theory that should affect the price
I know it does short term but you know I
can go through that with you and uh
and there are other things you can do
about this stuff now if you look at just
the stock market that's different there
are other things you can do there and
there are other
things that cause that
in fact that doesn't need to be there
either that's just all the institutional
structure
but you look at anything other than the
stock market because when I looked at
the they said it forces people into
lower quality bonds or something but if
you look at the number of lower quality
bonds the total did change
so if somebody was forced into it
whoever had the lower quality Bond was
sold at the bus higher quantity you know
they were always in difference levels
they changed the spreads between the two
of the narrow them but it didn't cause
any excess issuance I didn't see any
excess of debt growth in the UK during
that time I didn't see excess credit
growth or excess mortgage growth I just
didn't see any of that so you had
adjustments in asset prices if you look
now the p e ratios on U.S stocks are
about the same as they were when we had
lower rates and the rates are much
higher now that's supposed to cause them
to go down
it didn't happen because the income
affects on the other side are
you know adding to growth prospects so
yeah there's a lot of like
things in here and
the stock market creation doesn't need
to be there that way I've proposed that
all the issues come in ten dollars a
share for this example I got a billion
proposals and the company will also
issue unlimited shares at 20. therefore
the stock can never go over 20. you're
Investing For The Returns on equity as
you buy more from the company at 20 if
you want to as it's making more money
you're getting a share of their earnings
and you're getting your fair return on
investment but you don't have a price
that subject to speculation and options
and everything else and so you've closed
that room in the casino so to speak but
you've still kept your investment
Channel
so there are things that in the system
we have that Foster this type of stuff
that you're talking about and I think
that uh
the interest rate's been given too much
credit or detriment for for what's
happened by a wide margin but under the
policy right now yeah so we did see
across the world you know massive asset
presentation not in Japan
is it
inflation regardless so we should have
started talking Japanese than we would
have it but Japan has two things going
on Japan have they have massive fiscal
transfers yeah protect protect the
people who need that production right
and the central government they they go
against the market and they maintain the
yield curve
better against the ggbs right but even
if they did it would only be a few basis
right so my point is you see that
undeserved the massive asset pass
inflation it was happening yeah but
their stock market didn't go
oh go ahead so given the fact that
and their their real estate didn't have
that
you know the real assets
what is going to happen to the the
political situation when these budget
deficits start to exceed become a
double-digit I think it's eight nine
what's equals to ten eleven twelve
how does this
what's the end game here what what
happens how do we make the payments
what's going on oh you tell me
they're going to keep praising Grace to
make it worse you know that was just
because
yeah Argentina yeah I mean
Central Bank just sees the rates go up
for any reason they raise inflation rate
go up they raise the interest rate
I just got it backwards on it that's my
concern is not where does it end because
they all say well if they raise them
enough there'll be a crash in anyone but
it doesn't cause a crash it causes it to
keep going
there's going to be a crash in Argentina
what happened before 118 percent
turkey had like 15 years of 100 interest
rates they had like I don't know eight
percent or four percent real growth the
whole time
something in the U.S no in Turkey in the
80s yeah
it's the same spreadsheet
don't reason why it can't I mean they
have other policies going on
you know all kinds of index Securities
that add to it but the US has a lot of
index tip spots now it's up to
on the ability or something
and the UK has a lot of index funds yeah
so as they raise rates rates the deficit
goes up on those index bonds I don't
even don't think that's part of the
deficit okay
sorry carry on Chris no I was just going
to say can you just say what the tip
spawns are oh yeah the inflation index
US Treasury
they're paying two percent over the
inflation rate so if inflation rate goes
to 10 they go to 12. there's no policy
decision to go to 12 it just happens
um
so that you pay out 12 it causes rates
inflation to go to 14 so then they go to
16. yeah you know they're not large
enough to do that now but they're
getting there
because it keeps growing exponentially
when it first came on our 10 15 years
ago I remember the whole thing about
this this is like external debt
I've seen about three hands goals I
think it's this chat with the B here
today
so
I want some um I want to be sure that I
understand your
um your idea when you say that taxation
causes unemployed
uh do you mean that if somehow the
abolition all form of taxations then
suddenly everyone finds a job that
satisfies their own I mean standards or
so if there's no yeah if there's no
taxation
then there's no tax credit there's no
money because the dollar is just a tax
credit so the tax credit is not worth
anything without a tax but so if you
have a non-monetary society you never
have unemployment you don't have people
looking for paid work
you know you might you have families you
have a sheep station in Australia with
non-monetary everybody's working doing
something uh you have a monastery uh
Africa before the Europeans went in
no people looking around for paid work
which is vital
10 of their population or something you
might have a couple kids who are
hiding you know but you don't get
unemployment so you don't even begin to
get anything like people looking for
paid work until there's something to pay
it with and that happens as a
consequence of Taxation
so it's kind of a tautology definition
but it's it's revealing as to who's
responsible for what's going on it's not
the market create unemployment or it's
not because you
didn't go to college or something like
that
the tax create cause you to become
unemployed
college graduate might have took your
job that you could have done but he's
more qualified so he got it okay that's
different
um okay continuing on from what's going
to happen with the interest rate
inflation in the 70s we had high
inflation yeah and high interest rates
yet something caused them both to come
down so
just recently it's only been very
recently where inflation is going over
there but we had the governments trying
to get the inflation rate up again
because the interest rates were hurts
a half percent
something happened in the meantime to
bring this all down
well what happened I don't know how can
that happen again what happened when in
the 70s between the 70s and now where we
had high inflation a plane dress okay so
it all came down in the 70s we had the
oil prices
it's always been a while it went from
three dollars
to Fifteen to three dollars now why with
oil
at 250 or three hours because the Texas
Railroad Commission had quotas for the
U.S oil companies who had excess
capacity they could produce more than
the world needed more than the US needed
and so the price would have gone down to
nothing
and so to support prices the Texas
Railroad Commission put quotas on the
American oil companies to keep the price
around 250 or something
well as the band picked up
okay the price isn't going to go down
anymore now there was more demand than
they had and the the quotas got smaller
and smaller by 1970 71 quarters were
gone
Global demand was high and so prices
were then in a position where
you head to Texas oil commission trying
to keep prices
uh
support prices now that price support is
moot right because now instead of excess
capacity there's a charging pad now the
excess capacity switches to Saudi Arabia
okay so now Saudi Arabia becomes the
sway producer they're the ones who set
price and let quantity adjust
so they set the quote on themselves so
to speak so they set a three dollar
price they'd sell maybe three-fourths or
seventy or eighty percent of their own
but American companies were now
producing their full output so they no
longer needed to have quarters to
support prices because prices demand is
up well the Saudis had different ideas
than the Texas Railroad Commission about
where prices are going to be Texas
Railroad Commission held prices steady
for I don't know 14 years or something
which are the golden years of Economics
you read about the golden years nobody
talks about the Texas Railroad
Commission keeping oil prices constant
with their quotas hi
above market value but flat so there's
no inflation and people could plan and
everything else the Saudis decided okay
our job is to get as much money as
possible not to stabilize the US economy
and the price went from like 3 to 11.
a couple of years
tripled or something like that and so we
had a big burst of
prices going up because cost of
everything went up because power
companies utilities were all using oil
benefits
okay and then by 1980 or 79 79 they've
gone up to forty dollars so the price
went up
from 3 to 40.
what's that 12 or 13 times that's like
today going from 80 to a thousand
okay and that caused through the cost
side and everything to adjust up you
know globally everybody's one of them
and the uh
the FED under Boker decided to fight
this by raising interest rates now what
what interest rates did initially was
keep add more money and keep prices up
but what happened was this is important
if you're analyzing things today
1979 the inflation rate was like 12
percent
but the budget deficit was six percent
so what happened to the public debt
public debt went up by six percent
because the budget deficit was six
percent
but the real value was down by 12
percent
because of inflation inflation pushed
until 12. so the real value of our
savings went down six percent
this is like running a budget surplus
and a zero inflation Market okay our
real savings dropped so companies that
inflation is creating the money shortage
I talked about where companies need more
money and the amount of net Financial
assets out there is dropping because of
inflation is not being replenished by
deficit spending caused a horrible
collapse 1979 and it rippled for a
couple of years we had a double tip
recession and everything now they gave
volcker credit for having caused the
recession but it was the budget going
into in real terms Surplus that causes
huge drop okay the way I looked at I was
in a you know
actively in marketspect and I started in
1973.
and uh so it's another time I think the
mainstream got it completely wrong
and he kept the rates high and so the
inflation lingered now the other thing
that happened is once the price got up
to 40 and the economy crashed because of
the budget surplus
the demand dropped
and so now the Saudis had to cut prices
to keep
OPEC cut they all got together they cut
production like 15 million barrels of
things huge and this wasn't enough and
the price came down to like 10 or 15 and
stayed there for a long time until the
man picked back up again
and so that that was that cycle so we
haven't had anything that severe and the
other thing is Jimmy Carter did
something he
deregulated natural gas in 1978. now it
did change the supply a lot right away
but it changed like companies like
public utilities
to go from oil to natural gas because
now it would be available before because
of the regular regulator price was too
low nobody drilled for it it was capped
all the wells were capped well then they
started producing it again and contracts
started being signed and it started
replacing oil and we got into all kinds
of substitutes called natural gas and
things like that and
we successfully uh
to fight the next Glacier that's coming
one thing you get from Warren is
probably happens you just over the last
five minutes you start to reassess your
whole like
how you view the 70s inflation I don't
know you're thinking well yeah I don't
realize that and so that's the danger
but remember I warned you
I just wondered if Vincent's Gomez is
here ah can you remember your old
questions you might be nice if you if
you can't yeah my question was
when I when I talk to people about
money creation
accidents around the facts of you know
how government spending works and it's
the economy and normally the pushback I
get is that it's a theory
have you ever have you ever done any
work or do you have any
guide to how we can separate the facts
about how money is Created from some of
the more theoretical ones
I don't know that there is any
theoretical which which Theory no well I
don't know yeah it's called modern
monetary Theory because somebody on Bill
Mitchell's blog blog started saying that
10 years ago none of us liked it but
they all started calling
I guess things people
make sense
although now I think
I think it's better understanding
yeah yeah so my theory is for a job
guaranteeing my theory is for a basic
income yeah yeah yeah just call it your
proposal yes but no
one question there is no Theory you know
money is created you know government
spend well first you have to Define
money yes okay so how are you defining
it as
as
you know dollars in accounts at the
Federal Reserve Bank dollars in the
accounts of a Commercial Bank
piece of paper in your pocket you know
somebody asks you like which which which
stuff are you talking about so nobody's
spending tokens in the private sector
yeah well you know they all come from
the government they treasury secretary
signs them so you know who creates those
20 bill you know it says right on it who
created
unless it's counterfeit
the money in the bank was created by the
bank the bank changed the number up in
your bank account
yeah score keeping it's like points on a
scoreboard right do you do you know
nails
book
yeah that is extremely comprehensive
it's got it all
yeah
it's riches yes and they've got the
whole thing explained there's also the
the original very large
hits
website as well but you know that it
takes a while but the the first chapter
of the book is available for free on
Elgar online which has got all of the
basic facts about what happens I'll give
you a 30-second version yeah if you
borrow money from a bank you sign a note
they buy that from you
serious that they pay for it by putting
a balance in your account
and that's money creation that's the
whole thing
okay now if you use that to spend it it
goes to somebody else's account
but it doesn't change
I think all I can do is move back and
forth between accounts unless it's used
to
pay off the loan or buy it from the bank
account and uh
there's nothing else to it same thing
whatever I speak about this they say oh
you're talking about a monetary Theory
it's just a theory
yes
there may be some things that are
theoretical but there are some things
well you can just say there isn't it so
you think Evolution isn't a theory
no no but it's shot none of it's none of
it's theoretical that I know
I think
Ben Mitchell I've probably got time for
one short question gotta be sharp though
in your ideal world what would Central
Bankers do
it's a short question
they would regulate the banking system
um
concentrate on that
there's room for improvement
there shouldn't really be any more
important than the head of any
government Department taking ahead of
the department for transport Department
of work internships is all they are but
they're elevated to this position
because it's got the work banking
arguably they should be just as
Anonymous as well yeah they get paid a
lot more to speak after they retire
after they retire to speak
I don't know why anybody even speaks to
it because
yeah
he probably knows more about monetary
passage right I think we've kind of run
out of time so let's do one around
wow what can I say
it's been a real real pleasure to have
Warren with us thank you so much for
coming we're very grateful that he was
able to stop over in London on his way
to Berlin for the mmt conference very
sorry that games aren't going this year
but there we are I'm sure that you all
agree that it's been really informative
and engaging
um food for thought as Phil said to take
away with us for later
thank you two for the all to the
audience for actually uh coming despite
all the obstacles that have been thrown
under our feet
I hope you'll agree that it was worth
the extra hassle for some of you to get
here and also for Warren's presentation
and an opportunity to get together after
some very very difficult times it's
really nice to see some of the old faces
in this room again so thank you very
much
now we need more than ever and I keep
saying this I know but I'm going to say
it again
to work together and build greater
public awareness through the written
word through video through audio
podcasts I've got to suit everybody's
learning needs that's that's absolutely
key and it's simple terms we've got to
educate the future
now we really hope you've enjoyed the
day and if you want to keep in touch
