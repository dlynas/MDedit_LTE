Economic Update: A Corporatized America with Chris Hedges
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnv1VRwLS04)

## Transcript:
Welcome, friends, to another edition of Economic 
Update, a weekly program devoted to the economic  
dimensions of our lives and those of our 
children. I'm your host Richard Wolff.  
Today's program is going to be talking 
about collective bargaining for public  
employees…about a strange old billionaire, 
Bernie Marcus, who founded Home Depot and  
has something to tell us that we will be 
able to smile about. A little less funny  
is the failure of the corporation Southwest 
Airlines over the Christmas/New Year holiday  
and we’ll have quite a bit to say about that. 
Then a little bit about that remarkable George  
Santos candidate from the Republican Party. In the 
second half of the show, we will have our guest,  
Chris Hedges. I think we have a really good 
show for you today so let's jump right in.
The National Labor Relations Act gave workers 
in the United States, back in the 20th century,  
the right to strike. It was understood 
to be foundational to democracy—putting  
aside how long it had taken this so-called 
democracy to give workers that right—but,  
if you read the National Labor Relations Act you 
will quickly see that one very important group  
of workers was not covered by it. In fact, 
several groups of workers were not covered.  
Domestic workers—people who work in situations 
like that—that had a lot to do with non-white  
workers in this country…female workers in this 
country…but the group I want you to think about  
now are public employees. That's right, millions 
and millions of people who work for cities, towns,  
government, states, the federal government weren't 
covered under the National Labor Relations Act.  
That was left up to each state so it took even 
longer—decades in many cases—for public employees  
to struggle long and hard over lots of opposition 
to finally get that right in a democratic society.  
Some states still don't have it. North and South 
Carolina have banned public employees from being  
in unions and that may have something to do with 
the fact that union membership is two percent  
of the labor force in those states. Virginia 
allowed, a few years ago, public employees but  
they left it up to each individual city or town 
or region and so that has to be fought for too.  
Why am I mentioning all of this? It’s a commentary 
on how slow and difficult it is to get democracy  
for working people and that's always been true in 
capitalism. I'm hammering at that. Let me give you  
the worst example, in a way that I can think of 
from the top of my head, we have a minimum wage,  
a federal minimum wage, in the United 
States…seven dollars and 25 cents an hour. Yeah,  
not only is that horrible to imagine—trying to 
live on that—but it hasn’t been raised since 2009.
Well…14 years… over that time prices have 
risen 20-25% at least but not the minimum wage,  
so the minimum wage could buy less and less and 
less as well as being horribly low. Why is that?  
Do the mass of the working people of America not 
want to get paid better than $7.25? Of course  
not. The overwhelming majority of Americans want a 
higher minimum wage. Who blocks it? The Republican  
Party…number one…the business community number 
two. Why do I tell you that?…because it has always  
been the case…the capitalist—the employer class 
has voted against and worked against every step of  
improvement for the mass of the working people. 
When they couldn’t stop it, they delayed it.  
When they couldn't delay it, they would reverse 
it. Basically, this minimum wage story is a story  
of reversal. You had to give them the minimum 
wage and it's only back to the 1930s when it  
first began… but by not raising it with inflation 
you are in a way reversing it. You're making it  
worth less and less—that seven dollars and 25
cents an hour—and why am I telling you all of  
this?…because, in the year just over, 2022, 
a remarkable number of people who defend  
capitalism—that's what they do, often for a 
living—came up with this one. It’s not new.  
We are all supposed to like capitalism, they 
tell us because over the last two or three  
centuries people's standard of living has risen. 
Well that's true, it has…but that's not to the  
credit of capitalism—that’s outrageous. 
It's been the capitalist who blocked it,  
who slowed it, who reversed it at every step—like 
with the minimum wage. It takes a certain amount  
of arrogance to block the improvement of the 
condition of working people and then when you  
lose your effort to stop it—to slow it and to 
reverse it. You then want to claim credit as  
if you had done it out of the goodness of your 
system. You didn't and nobody should be fooled.
The founder, or one of the founders of Home 
Depot, a man named Bernie Marcus, a 93-year-old  
billionaire according to Forbes, he's worth 
five and a quarter billion dollars at least,  
in a recent year. He made a lot of headlines, 
recently, not for supporting Donald Trump and  
the Florida governor, DeSantis, to whom by 
the way among other Republicans he has given  
64 million dollars in recent years. No, he got 
a lot of notoriety because he said, “American  
workers,” hear me out now, “are fat, lazy, and 
stupid.” Those are quotations and when he was  
asked why does he feel that way, what's causing 
this, he said, “It's socialism that has caused  
all of this.” (He) didn’t quite explain how that 
works and that— the mystery—will stay with us. He  
also blamed creeping wokeism. They just don't work 
hard the way they once did and Bernie doesn't like  
Harvard and he doesn't like people with Master 
of Business Administration degrees. He thinks  
Joe Biden is the worst president in American 
history. Wow, you know what comes across listening  
to this? A billionaire elderly gentleman—he 
does understand that capitalism is in trouble  
and so he wants to do what strikes him as 
the important thing to do about capitalism  
in trouble…blame the workers…blame the 
working class. That's what he is doing…so  
now let's go back, he gives 64 million 
dollars to Republicans to fight what he  
opposes—fight socialism, fight wokeism, fight 
the horrible President Biden, all of that.  
I want that to be understood by everyone because 
that's where the Republicans—and a good number of  
Democrats too—that's where they get these ideas. 
You might wonder, why do they say those things?  
They say them because their donors believe 
that—because their donors give them money  
because they repeat what the donors believe and 
the big business donors in this country are more  
like Bernie Marcus of Home Depot than you might 
imagine. That's the type and that's where these  
ideas that you may find bizarre come from—maybe 
out of the mouths of the Republicans—but the idea,  
the source, the cause— (is) big business. That’s 
the way it's been. That's the way it is now.
I turned next to the horrific stories, you 
all saw them on television or heard about  
them. Southwest Airlines, across the 
Christmas holiday New Year season—they  
canceled vast numbers of their flights, 
stranding huge numbers of people in airports for  
unmentionable numbers of hours or days…messing 
up people's Christmas travel… their Christmas  
time with relatives and friends. The horror was 
everywhere. I want to talk about that so that  
we are clear about what the problem is here—and 
like with Bernie Marcus at Home Depot—the problem  
is with big business not with the weather. The 
lame effort of Southwest Airlines to blame the  
weather which, by the way, was the same weather 
that didn't do the same thing to Delta, United,  
American, and all the rest of them. What 
an effort…blame the weather…extraordinary.  
Well, it turns out that and I want to get these 
numbers…right, 38 States out of the 50 attorneys  
general had written months earlier to Southwest 
saying, “You are in bad shape. You are not in a  
good place to service the people of America 
who need to fly. Change what you're doing.”A  
few weeks before, 34 attorneys general 
sent a follow-up letter. The union  
complained about insufficient union workers 
to manage what could happen—they knew…they  
knew. Did they spend the money to hire the extra 
workers they might need? Did they spend the money  
to have the backup in the event that weather 
became a problem? This is not the first time  
we've had bad weather in the United States. 
I'm trying to be polite here…no they didn’t,  
but they did have time to do something else—they 
increased their dividends to their shareholders.  
They made sure to pay their CEO his nine 
million dollar a year salary right on time—and  
you know during the pandemic they got—just 
so you know—3.2 billion dollars of American  
taxpayer money to help them through. Their 
payback…give more money to their executives…give  
more money to their shareholders and strand tens 
of thousands of people across (the US). You leave  
these important functions in the hands of big 
business—that's what you get…but I'm not done.
I want to turn next to the Secretary of 
Transportation in the Biden government,  
Pete Buttigieg. What did he do when the state 
attorneys general were talking to the airline  
about all this? Nothing. What did he do when 
they sent a second letter follow-up? Nothing.  
What did he do even as this was unfolding 
in the week before Christmas?Nothing.  
When it blew up…oh yeah …then we heard how he's 
concerned…concerned how he is going to make sure  
that the airline reimburses people. What? That's 
it? This is like sending a message to every other  
transportation or any other company that this 
government is not going to punish you. Here's  
what he should be doing—he should be going around 
and saying, “if a plan isn't forthcoming in three  
weeks from Southwest that guarantees this 
will never happen again, we're taking over  
the airline. We're gonna reorganize it. It's 
going to be run by the workers. on the one hand  
and the customers— the flying American public. 
We're going to have a council and they're going  
to monitor the airline and they're going to 
make sure. They're not going to pay dividends  
and they’re not going to pay fancy salaries 
unless and until they do what they're supposed  
to do….” Then we would have a government that 
regulates. Pete Buttigieg should be ashamed of  
himself and the Biden administration. Failure 
to do your job…that’s what all this is about.
And what can I say, finally, about George Santos,  
the phantom Republican in New York's 
third congressional district who has  
lied apparently about literally everything 
in his life in order to win that election.  
For me, it's just a sign of what advertising has 
done to our culture. Advertisers don't want to  
tell you the truth about whatever it is they're 
selling—they just want you to buy it. They tell  
you whatever is good and they hide whatever is 
bad. That's what Mr. Santos did and when he didn’t  
have enough good to tell you about—he hid the bad 
and he made it up. It's just the next step in what  
advertising has done. Advertising is the creature 
of capitalism and that's why we're critics.
We've come to the end of the first part

Welcome back, friends, to the second 
half of today's Economic Update.  
It is with great pleasure that I bring to 
our microphones and our cameras a frequent  
guest on this program, Chris Hedges. He 
needs no introduction. I'm sure many of  
you have seen or heard him speak on countless 
occasions (or read) what he writes but let me  
go briefly through it. He's the author of 
14 books including several New York Times  
bestsellers. He’s also a Pulitzer Prize-winning 
journalist who was a foreign correspondent for 15  
years for the New York Times, where he served 
as Middle East bureau chief and Balkan bureau  
chief as well. He hosts the Chris Hedges 
report and is a columnist at Scheerpost.com.
RDW: Ok, let me jump right in. Chris, thanking 
you for your time which we all appreciate.  
You're a seasoned journalist, to say the least,  
how do you assess the urgent issues that 
are addressed these days by the likes of  
the New York Times, and the Washington Post? 
By urgent issues, I really mean three things:  
the Ukraine war, the U.S-China conflict, and the 
risks, these days spoken of—of a nuclear war.
CH: Well the New York Times does 
what it has traditionally done—along  
with the Washington Post and all of the 
other mainstream media outlets—that is,  
served as a cheerleader for the war 
industry. That's nothing new. Go back  
to Iraq—the invasion of Iraq. That is the role 
that they have always played and continue to play.
The coverage out of the Ukraine is quite 
disturbing. I covered many conflicts. It’s  
very clear that it's tightly controlled by the 
Ukrainians so that reporters and camera people are  
taken out to visit a town that's been recaptured 
or driven up for a couple hours to the front line  
and then driven back. It's the old system of 
minders…the traditional dog and pony shows…that  
really shapes the message or allows the Ukrainians 
to completely dominate the message in terms of the  
war. I mean we have pretty credible reports that 
there's been reprisals by the Ukrainians against  
people who are suspected (or) accused of being 
Russian collaborators. I've spent enough time  
in any war zone to tell you that once the chaos 
envelops a landscape at war, both sides lie like  
they breathe. Both sides commit atrocities. 
Sometimes those atrocities are dominated by  
one side or the other—that was certainly true in 
the war in Bosnia but we're not really getting  
any serious coverage. When there is an attempt 
at more nuanced coverage such as CBS did when  
they filed an investigative piece that estimated 
that only 30 percent of the weapons being shipped  
into Ukraine—remember the United States has 
now provided a hundred billion dollars in aid  
to this proxy war. That's almost double the size 
of the budget of the State Department. Of course,  
utter insanity, but there's no accountability 
for these weapons once they cross the border into  
Ukraine and they are, I think, according to the 
CBS report which they hastily had to take down,  
they are ending up in the hands of warlords, 
black marketeers and the Azov Battalion. Who  
knows? it's not controlled, there's no audit. 
Even the Pentagon admits there’s no oversight.  
In terms of Taiwan…you know, Nancy Pelosi's 
visit to Taiwan…this is a way, of course,  
to create tensions with China and that's what 
keeps the budget—especially for the huge budget  
handed to the Navy. It's all about creating 
enemies. I mean, I go back to 89. Gorbachev…I  
was in Eastern Europe—Gorbachev wanted to build 
a security and economic alliance with the United  
States and Europe. But, if there was no enemy…if 
Russia wasn’t an enemy… they were going to make  
it —Russia—an enemy because there would be no 
excuse to expand NATO. Indeed NATO—which was  
designed to prevent Soviet expansion into Eastern 
and Central Europe—should have been disbanded  
after the collapse of the Soviet Union and all the 
revolutions which I covered in Eastern Europe. So,  
it's the war industry (that) unfortunately drives 
policy. The two parties are completely captive to  
it. We just passed this gigantic military bill—850 
billion dollars—45 billion more than the Biden  
Administration requested and that, if you read 
traditional accounts…so how empires self-destruct,  
hollow themselves out from the inside…it is 
unchecked, unregulated, and rampant militarism.  
That's what destroyed the Roman Empire…I mean by 
the long list, the Ottomans and everyone else. So  
we are following that trajectory and on the issue 
of war and on the issue of militarism. Of course,  
we militarized internally our own society as 
we've destroyed it economically. There's no  
daylight between the Democrats and the Republicans 
with this caveat, there's more opposition to that  
budget among the Republicans now than there is 
from the Democrats. AOC to her credit voted down  
this big 1.7 trillion dollar spending bill 
that included that military budget that I  
mentioned. She voted against it and Tlaib voted 
present but you had far more opposition among  
the Republicans—some of them are nut cases 
like Marjorie Taylor Greene etc. But yeah,  
the Democratic party is fervently behind the war 
and controlled by the war industry and that is  
utterly disastrous because of course it's flirting 
with, too, nuclear powers. I mean, I cover wars,  
I can tell you you don't control them once they 
start. They control you. One mistake, go back  
and read Barbara Tuchman, I mean you can stumble 
into global suicidal conflicts very, very easily.  
I never thought I'd be in this position to hold up 
the words of Henry Kissinger who has warned that  
there have to be negotiations quickly—that the 
whole idea of allowing Ukraine to recapture all  
of Ukrainian territory including the eastern part 
of the Donbas where you have ethnic Russians—even  
the New York Times said this is not a reality or 
a realistic goal. Yeah, we're in… just to end,  
I mean there's no…like the 20-year debacle in the 
Middle East. These people have no thought as to  
where this is going to lead. There's as far as 
I can tell, no goal other than degrading Russian  
military forces and hopefully driving Putin out 
of office. Of course, that didn't work too well  
in Syria and Russia is a much bigger country. In 
fact, the economic sanctions have hurt Europe far  
more than they've hurt Russia. So yeah, it's 
just another debacle by the profiteers—the war  
profiteers—who unfortunately are driving policy 
and it's a very dangerous policy to follow.
RDW: All right let me switch the focus 
a little bit. Donald Trump, it appears,  
is in a process of some sort of decline 
as a political force in the country and  
there is a governor in Florida who 
seems to be aiming to replace him.  
How does all of this strike you?
CH: Well DeSantis is more dangerous because,  
unlike Trump, he's competent. You know, like 
Pompeo or Tom Cotton or these others. Trump…  
with or without Trump… it doesn’t…we still live 
mired in this political divide… political morass…  
with these political distortions because of what 
the two parties have done to the economy and to  
the livelihood of working-class men and women. I 
mean that's what's driving this…largely—the white  
working class that feels dethroned…displaced…which 
they have been. The incredible accumulation of  
wealth by this oligarchic elite which is 
unlike anything we've seen. I’m, you know,  
going back…we'd have to go back to…I don't 
know Rome or you know pharaonic Egypt or  
something to see this kind of wealth. I 
mean the Rockefellers had a few billion.  
Our billionaire class has 180-plus billion and 
that's social inequality. You don't have to  
take even political science 101 to understand 
that social inequality creates these kinds of  
messianic right-wing populist-neo-fascists. 
That's what is vomited up from a society that  
no longer functions. It's what I witnessed when I 
covered the war in Yugoslavia and go back and look  
at Weimar Germany. It’s the same. So Trump…with 
or without Trump the problem isn't going to go  
away until we address the social inequality, the 
political stagnation, and the fact that corporate  
power has seized every institution—including 
of course the media—and deformed them to serve  
their predatory interests on everybody else. We've 
got inflation. The Biden Administration has been  
unable to fulfill even its most tepid campaign 
promises—Build Back Better or the $15 minimum  
wage. You know… the ability of care to be provided 
to the working class, etc. In fact, in some ways  
it's worse than Trump because the supplemental 
packages have all evaporated including,  
of course, they’re lifting the moratorium 
on foreclosures and bank repossessions. So,  
it's a very fraught and difficult time…2024 with 
or without Trump is still going to be very ugly.
RDW: Do you think it will include the 
white supremacy dimension of all of this?
CH: Yeah, that’s key because this is what 
happened in Yugoslavia—the economic collapse  
of Yugoslavia—you strip people of their sense of 
place and dignity and work within the society then  
they reach out, often for a fictional identity. In 
the case of Yugoslavia, that was a Serbian ethnic  
nationalism or Croatian. I mean they resurrected 
the Ustasha and all the old symbols and everything  
else. In this case, it is the idealized golden 
age of white supremacy…Neo Confederacy. That is  
what has attracted the white working class and 
created this fast divide…where how many people  
voted for Trump?…was it 74 million or something? 
I mean it's a lot of people and like Yugoslavia,  
once people fall into that fantasy world—which 
it really is—there's no communication because  
…with the other side…they’re both grounded now 
in separate realities or even, I would argue,  
in non-reality based belief systems. The Democrats 
are guilty of this with Russiagate as if Russia  
was responsible for electing Trump. You'd have to 
pluck your eyes out or something to believe that.  
It's a very precarious moment. It's very 
fragile. It's very dangerous and we can't  
ignore the fact that the country is awash 
in weapons—not just weapons but automatic  
weapons. I grew up in Maine. My relatives 
are all hunters. You don't carry AR-15s into  
the woods—they’re useless for shooting down a 
deer. The caliber of the bullet is too small  
so unless you…I guess…you want to pepper the deer 
with…you know 10 or 15 bullets or something. So,  
these are weapons—they’re assault weapons…and 
that the school shootings…what they’re  
averaging…more than one a day…school or you 
know, mass shootings are averaging more than…
Well, this is a society that’s deeply,  
deeply disturbed and unfortunately the 
Biden Administration—other than funding,  
you know, pumping these massive resources into 
Ukraine or the military—is not responding.  
There's this political stagnation. It is 
extremely dangerous coupled with the fact  
that because we have an uncontrollable 
militarism romping around the globe…you  
know talking about defending Taiwan and bringing 
down Putin…it's a really, really dangerous time.
RDW: Yeah, you kind of wonder how long the fantasy 
can keep generating its own raw material before  
at some point it begins to dawn on people that 
this is all one kind of large dead end. We're  
running out of time. Do you see anything on 
the horizon that might break us out of this?
CH: Yeah, labor. The one, the only weapon we have 
left by which we can begin to push back against  
these forces is organized labor and strikes. We 
do see movement but unfortunately, we just watched  
the Biden Administration revoke the collective 
bargaining power of the railroad union—one of  
the few unions that retain that right. So, we 
know where the Democrats are from…but I would say  
strike, strike, strike… History has shown that is 
an effective weapon and the only one we have left.
RDW: Could not agree more. Chris Hedges, thank you 
very, very much for your time, for your insights  
and I know that my audience 
appreciates it as much as I do.  
To all of you, I look forward to 
speaking with you again next week.
