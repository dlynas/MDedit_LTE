Helmut-Harry Loewen, Gabriel Rockhill & Julian Sempill, "Critical Theory & Fascism"
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqBNK8ndrb4)

## Transcript:
um so for today's discussion we're going
to focus on fascism I'm thrilled to be
joined by uh Hellman Harry Lewis who's
here joining us uh via Zoom who's a
sociologist at the University of
Winnipeg in Canada and uh an expert on
the history of fascism as well as the
anti-fascist struggle and Julian Semple
is going to moderate and kind of
facilitate the conversation Julian is a
legal scholar who teaches at Melbourne
law school he is currently completing a
book entitled power and law which will
be published by Cambridge University
press so I thought it was the perfect
setup for Rich conversation concerning
these issues helmet hair is going to
start us out with some opening comments
I'll follow with some myself and then
Julian's gonna begin the conversation by
addressing a few questions to us after
that point in time will open up for a
more General conversation so Hellman
Harry with no further Ado I'll turn it
over to you
thanks very much Gabriel and let me also
congratulate you and Jennifer as cool
directors of the critical theory
workshop on the 15th anniversary of this
project I'm speaking from Winnipeg and
I've been set up in the studio of my
Conrad in anti-fascist movements of over
30 years Mr euron Walter and I
appreciate his solidarity in getting us
going despite power outages within the
past half hour or so I'm going to speak
very briefly
about some liberal approaches to fascism
briefly uh as well
concerning some of the more
Anarchist oriented theories of fascism
and then basically argue
for Marxist approaches which take into
account the political economy of
cannibalism and fascism as a response to
metabolism and crisis in 1976
Terry Eagleton
the British literary theorist wrote a
paper called what is fascism
and he offers an interesting definition
which really wasn't picked up by
Scholars at the time
at a context to do the context in which
theories of totalitarianism
were threadment
what Eagleton argues is this fascism
signifies a massive offensive by the
bourgeoisie in a time when the working
class is disorganized and defensive
when the working class is betrayed by a
reformist leadership when a
revolutionary alternative is lacking he
then says the ingredients of fascism are
multiple
there are ingredients include economic
and political crisis proletarian defeat
failure of social democracy absence or
impotence of revolutionary leadership
and that includes very telling this is a
theme which we find in many marks as
theorists from the early 20th century
right through to Rob work quote Eagleton
says fascism is never far beneath the
surface of War
now one of the most influential academic
approaches to Fascism was devised by
Roger Grifton the political scientist at
Oxford Brooks University who developed
starting around 1919 1991 a definition
which he says forms the basis for a new
consensus International Studies
and part of his definition claims that
fascism is quote a revolutionary form of
ultra nationalism which is based on a
core myth the myth of national
regeneration or what he calls a
palogenetic myth of the word column
Genesis
denotes National rebirth or regeneration
Griffin goes on to say that fascist
ideology has a number of features and he
claims that these features are part of
what he calls an ideal type A viberian
ideal type of fascism which can be
applied to fascism's quote
he says is a revolutionary ideology
in other words he positions as do
totalitarianism theorists fascism and
communism as occupying a species of
revolutionary ideology and of course
this claimed that fascism is
revolutionary is contested by
revolutionary Theory informed by
historical materials
so his pairing of fascism and communism
is common among many of the liberal
approaches which are still dominant in
Academia and in the media who look at
the work of Yale University philosopher
Jason Stanley
whose best seller on a fascism how
fascism works the politics of Us and
Them
was a bestseller and has elevated to
Stanley into a kind of a guru of
neo-liberal uh commentary on fascism or
we can look at the work of Paul Mason
the British celebrity journalist his
recent bestseller how to stop fascism uh
makes a number of what I can only call
compostress claims he says for example
that recently a quote new
Anti-Imperialist personality has emerged
an Anti-Imperialist personality
because he merged on the left it is full
of hatred for liberalism I quote it does
the bidding of Vladimir Putin he says
and it spreads the same disinformation
that Fox News and other right New Media
disseminate in other words you have
again this uh denunciation of the left
by in the case of Stanley a left liberal
the case of Paul Mason who describes
himself a radical Social Democrat it's
interesting to note that Paul Mason was
caught up in a scandal last year when it
was revealed by a number of journalists
that he had worked hand in glove with
British secret Intelligence on campaigns
against this information so-called and
that he targeted academics and left-wing
politicians lending his services to the
British security stage so again this is
an interesting Dynamic that we find
among some Scholars who purport to study
fascism journalists who are also part of
the National Security State and this is
especially prominent in the social
sciences in my discipline in sociology
and criminology there's very little talk
about fascism that talk about extremism
hate crime and so on and many of the
leading Scholars of hate crime so-called
are sponsored by the federal governments
of various states have closed
connections to the security services
but really operate as academic
collaborationists
so with these liberal approaches we can
then also look for example at they are
related but operate on a different level
and you will all recall Michelle
Foucault's famous 1983 preface to the
English translation
and Felix pottery's anti-edicus and in
this text very influential
two pole writes about an introduction to
a non-fascist life let me just put a
couple of sentences from that practice
because it sets the stage together with
watari's work on micro fascism for
approaches which again which are
re-emerging with some popularity in
academic and activist circles which
focus on for example gender
and not on Dynamics based upon class for
example your school code the Strategic
adversary is fascism the fascism in us
all the fascism in our heads the fascism
in our everyday Behavior
it is the fascism who claims that causes
us to love power
people's obviously it is easy to be
anti-fascist
and not to see the fascist inside of you
the fascist you yourself sustained
nourish and cherish
in other words we have here a rejection
of anti-fascism a rejection of
collective movements
guided in many cases in the 20th century
by communist parties and proletarian
formations in the fight against fascism
whether it was in Germany Italy in
Yugoslavia and so on
there is a rejection of anti-fascism as
a project anchored in an individual
struggle we have here an individualized
approach and for food coal uh
emancipation is not a collective project
the one that is based upon the so-called
care of oneself
and of course this notion of care of
oneself has a number of neoliberal
Integrations which are translated very
nicely into uh activist therapeutic
cultures uh therapeuticist approaches to
anti-racism and anti-fascism which adopt
concessional models but which have
absolutely nothing to say about fascism
as a response by capitalist ruling
Elites to the system in crisis
so through Paul's approach which is part
of his introduction to Duluth and gatori
they claimed fascism is a cancerous body
using these biomedical metaphors micro
fascism according to guitari encompasses
what he calls micro formations that
shape postures adipoos percept
perceptions and so on
now particularly odious
example of this approach we find in a
book by Brad Evans and Julian Reed
published so 10 years ago on the Liz and
Fascism and Evans had reclaim
fascism needs to be re-problematized in
ways that quote do not reproduce the old
formula such as Marxism and these other
narratives
they argue evidence and his co-author do
that we need to recognize new
symptomologies of fascism
and that and this is my point before we
begin any analysis of fascism
they say we must start with accepting
quote that we are all
always
fascists of multiple kinds we are all
fascists at all times of multiple kinds
finally
an even more recent book by the Rutgers
uh journalism Professor Jack rapich
he's published a book in the comment
lotion was called on micro fascism
gender war and death
he makes some of the assumptions of this
anti-marks approach it's clear all the
way patient lip service to the Marxist
fatigue of capitalism at times but he
says the focus of his approach which he
calls do lose feminism
that approach focuses on the ontological
structure of Western masculine
subjectivity
and the primordial mean concept
in this analysis is patriarchy
patriarchy says is primordial
patriarchal is patriarchy is the prime
order it is the most fundamental
structure of Oppression which precedes
capitalism which operates below the
state and Beyond the state and in the
other collectivity it is a primordial
phenomenon although it goes on to say we
have difficulty in actually
establishing uh to what extent this has
operated throughout human history what
if we look at Societies in which uh even
Hunter and Gathering societies we see
evidence of what he calls a war against
women
so he proposes what he calls a micro
anti-fascism and what does that consist
of a micro anti-fascism involves
culminating what he calls gender
radicality
affirming gender mutations
combating toxic masculinity and after
the circle and so on and so forth okay
so we have that broad tradition where
liberalism meets and meshes anarchism
by contrast let's look briefly at the
Marxist approaches
now I'm going to pull here from an
interesting article about Jennifer Ponce
de Leon our co-director who published in
2021 in the American accordingly after
the Border was closed a very good
definition and overview
of marxist approach to Fascism let me
briefly quote a couple of sentences
fascism names are reactionary repressive
and anti-democratic form of capitals
political management that has assumed
varying forms in different social
formations
fascism sometimes opportunistically
makes use of the institutions of
Bourgeois democracy to continues
historically capitalist Elites have used
fashion to defend and enforce capitalist
social relations to expand the rate of
profit and so on
as an expression of capitalist political
class Consciousness fascism is
fundamentally opposed to socialism
and has been used as a weapon against
socialism and against other
anti-systemic movements he was on to say
that Fashions are globalized is racist
nationalist sentiments
in order to gain followers and she then
will draw to an atmosphere very very
soon to draw attention as many marxists
do including Rock Hill in his many
papers on fascism
she draws attention to the work of
George Jackson who was a political
prisoner Who develops a Marxist theory
of fascism from behind the walls at San
Quentin prison
and in 1971 just before his
assassination by state agents
in a number of essays
from his prison notebook if you will
which are collected in the volume blood
in my eye Jackson makes some crucial
points here
he says the United States is the
Prototype
of the international
fascist counter-revolution that gives a
number of examples of that he points the
way in which the United States United
States foreign policy the foreign policy
of U.S imperialism which we can add is
enforced
by 800 military bases throughout the
world by the most powerful armies
systems of surveillance and so on that
fascism in the United States
is connected with the parcel gula with
the prison system of course we all know
that the United States has approximately
four percent of the world's population
but 20 percent of the world's population
of prisoners
and we also know
that the loaded prison populations in
many ways are connected with the rise of
neoliberalism in the 1980s and 90s
and guided by policies under President
Clinton continued with subsequent
Democrats and Republican
presidents and let us know that current
president Joel Biden as a senator was
one of the key architects of the
prisonization of the United States so
Jackson points to the personal ghula to
mass incarceration
um he recognizes that fascism involves
attacks on organized labor
he recognizes that there is collusion
between the police and Paris State
Vigilantes that is even more the case
today with as we've seen the
a street fighting groups organized as
proud boys and other militias and then
of course going back to the long history
of the kkt in many ways as the
prolotypical fascist formation and a
recognized as fast as by Mussolini the
pupus clan
um as part of this long history of
fashion in the United States Jackson
then notes that U.S foreign policy
supports every fascist and racist regime
in the world
so there's much more to say about
Marxist approaches Beyond Jennifer Ponce
De Leon's definition and article I would
encourage students if they've not done
so to look at Gabriel Rock Hill's
extensive
Archive of articles on different aspects
of fascism and anti-fascism
also Rock Hill's Theory concerning a
materialist political economy of fascism
or more broadly a political economy of
ideological production distribution and
reception
that this materialist political economy
is a framework that can be developed in
a number of directions to explain for
example the current
fascist iterations not just as they play
out in the United States but also how in
Ukraine for example and I think we'll
talk about Ukraine at some point today
so Ukraine has emerged as a major
International of of Neo-Nazi organism
there's one example
according to olena seminyaka who herself
is a fascist organizer for the as of
um movement she's also a PhD student
who's written a work on Carl Smith
Heidegger and um
it's a very interesting and important
figure she argued she knows for example
that over the past six or seven years
some seventeen thousand neo-fascists
from 40 to 50 countries have traveled to
Ukraine to engage in military training
and ideological documentation we know
for example that the New Zealand mosque
shooter Greg muteron was among them or
the southern california-based Robert
Rundle was also in contact with Ukraine
the fascists but there's also a lot that
we don't know about who has joined the
fascist movement in Ukraine from Canada
with its large
nationalist Ukrainian diaspora
or from other countries
so leave it at that as inadequate as
these comments are there was more to say
about it I want some points it will just
briefly reflect on what I'm working on
these days I'm very interested in
Gabriel Rocco's concept of intervention
how intervention as a theoretical
practice differs from interpretation
and what I want to argue is that and I
have to work this out more fully that
the concept of Intervention which has a
prehistory going back
to the late 1920s in the work of bear
told rest and Valium
wrecked and then he means speakable I'm
quite understand
right interventionist thinking the word
Einstein this Dinkum uh is based on the
word growth and which means to grasp to
latch to get a hold of something and cry
apart
systems that justify
Injustice and part of this
is a place out on a much more
sophisticated level in Rock Hill's work
his book on on interventions in a
contemporary thought especially in the
methodological excorities in the early
Angels it's just fascinating and I would
argue very generative
approach which really hasn't been picked
up by other Scholars but which is very
much in keeping with Marxist approaches
right on Marxist approaches intervene

in Liberal Anarchist libertarian liberal
conservative of use of fascism
your dreams of approaches that move name
fascism because leaving fascism is to
recognize that concepts are part of the
class struggle on the level of theory
as possibly on point so but as many
others have noted as well right that to
invoke fascism and a theory of fascism
is part of a class struggle on the level
of theory which intervenes in these
liberal discourses which do nothing but
justifying imperialism and dishonor the
legacy of courageous anti-fascist
Fighters throughout the century
so thank you very much for that and I
look forward to the discussion
thank you so much uh helmet Harry that
was an excellent starting point for my
own comments I am going to sum up six
I'm sorry Five Points regarding the
current work that I'm doing on Fascism
and the first point overlaps uh somewhat
with some of the things that you touched
on it is that fascism is a concept in
class struggle there's no Essence to
Fascism there's no Universal definition
that all parties would agree to but it
is instead a site of struggle that is
extremely important because of the
tensions operative between the dominant
concept of fascism which uh helmet Harry
was talking about in his opening
comments which is the Bourgeois concept
of fascism versus a conceptualization of
fascism that actually Roots it in the
political economy of the capitalist
World system and regarding the Bourgeois
concept of fascism I think it's
important that one of the dominant
Tendencies is idealism that fascism
amounts to a system of bad ideas to
microaggressions to moral corruption all
of this basically guts the material
reality of fascism and its connections
to the economic forces that are driving
it and instead places fascism on an
idealist terrain just like the quote
from Foucault that Harry just read and
the work of Duluth for that matter which
ultimately means that if you want to
fight fascism it's a battle of ideas
usually waged within your own mind and
of course Foucault and some of his later
interviews said well his definition of
Liberation was was self-liberation it
was
knowing oneself so the idealist project
of clarifying one's own ideas is
supposed to somehow miraculously keep
fascism at Bay you could also think of
all of the Myriad discourses on
totalitarianism that have been marshaled
by French Theory and by German style
critical theory that consistent saying
that fascism comes from a bad way of
thinking from trying to think the
totality by trying to explain things
trying to develop science all of this is
just bad because it's totalizing and the
word totalizing happens to share an
etymological route with totalitarian
therefore you can engage in a kind of
metaphorical thinking and assume that
they go together and if you think in a
fragmented way in which you don't see
the totality somehow you're struggling
against fascism obviously in the world
that we're living in this is more than
laughable another aspect of the
Bourgeois concept of fascism is its
insistence that fascism is fundamentally
a cultural phenomenon so fascism is then
described as for instance or reduced to
things like anti-Semitism things like a
set of cultural symbols and orientations
would they be swastikas or jackfruits or
other such things and what this does is
it invisibilizes the material practices
of fascism that don't abide by the same
cultural codes that the Bourgeois
history of fascism has Affiliated
fascism with so you can't for instance
see fascism operative in a state a
settler colonial state like Israel you
couldn't see fascism in the Ukraine
because as many liberals have argued
zielinski has Jewish ancestry or you
know uh roots in the uh in the history
of Judaism or for instance you couldn't
see fascism operative in Islamic
fundamentals because it is of a
different cultural configuration by
looking only at the superstructural or
cultural level what the Bourgeois
concept of fascism then ultimately does
is it evacuates the material forces that
are actually driving fascism as a force
of capitalist governments and so the
historical materialist approach
recognizes that fascism is driven by the
base in the great words of Michael
parente he said that fascism is the
final solution to class stroke it is
when class struggle reaches a fever
pitch
any uh elements that are the fish's
thick elements operated under capitalism
are given full control of the state
apparatus in order to wage what amounted
to in the case of Nazi Germany for
instance a genocidal war on socialism
the second point that I'd like to make
is that in order to understand fascism
from a materialist vantage point I think
it's extremely important to develop a
multi-scalar analysis and a multi-scalar
analysis looks at different levels at
which fascistic practices have operated
historically the Bourgeois concept of
fascism as I touched on in the article
that we pre-circulated often traffics
and and ideology of fascist exceptionals
fascism is this extraordinary thing that
appeared maybe only one time or twice in
Mussolini and Hitler and thank God the
U.S Democratic forces were there to
defeat it and it's been held at Bay or
it is Manifest in kind of gross
personalities like Donald Trump and
therefore we should line up on the Biden
Administration and that will save us
from fascism what this does is it
reduces the complexity and the different
scales at which fascism operates to
something very idiosyncratic it
exceptional and a break with the normal
order a multi-scaler approach takes a
very very different perspective on this
and in my own work I've distinguished
basically between three different levels
and these are heuristic distinctions so
they're not distinctions that exist you
know actually ontologically in the real
world but they allow us to see certain
things so fascism can be understood
conjunctual meaning in a very specific
space time you can look at the
manifestation of fascist practices like
in Germany in 1933 or in the United
States in 2023 or in France in 2023 like
the fascist bands that have been roaming
the streets during the most recent uh
riots that are going on but fascism can
also be analyzed at a structural level
and one of the most important things I
think that people need to see is that if
you only look at conjunctually and
assume that fascism Rose in Germany and
Italy and that was kind of it what that
erases is that there is a structural
crisis in the history of capitalism and
the threat of an alternative system
which was a socialist system with the
Soviet Union and that in the wake of the
Great Depression there were fascist
movements in every single capitalist
country
So structurally speaking
fascism is something that emerges and is
given full force within capitalist
States when they're in moments of crisis
the highest level though of analysis is
systemic and so the term and concept
fascism of course emerged in Italy in
the interwar period uh Mussolini himself
said very clearly we don't have an
operative definition of fascism fascisms
first and foremost a movement and
activity it morphed and changed very
significantly if you know the history of
Mussolini's uh politics he was actually
he kind of had a foot in each camp in
which he wanted to keep a kind of
fascism that was a parliamentary fascism
on the one hand and then the black
shirts and the terroristic bands on the
other hand he had to consolidate that at
one point in time but he was doing a
balancing act between what ROM she
called the two faces of fascism
uh if you only uh reduce fascism though
to these forms and assume that when the
word emerged it somehow necessarily
referred to a new ontological reality
like a new thing that existed that
hadn't existed prior to that point in
time then you erase the Deep history of
capitalist Violence by state and
parastate forces that imposed capitalist
social relations by any means necessary
and that share the fundamental material
attributes of fascism so if it be the
militias that were run against the
indigenous population on the part of the
U.S Colonial regime if it be the Deep
history of the Ku Klux Klan or of you
know for that matter death squads across
Latin America
those types of practices need to be
understood in terms of the deep history
of fascism if we understand by that the
systemic nature sure of capitalist rule
that has engaged in the most heinous and
violent forms of colonialism and
imperialism so we have to be able to see
Colonial violence as akin to what would
later become in a more conjunctual and
more specific form fascism in the
interwar period And if you know anything
about history this is actually crystal
clear because Hitler modeled his
Colonial campaign because it was a
colonial campaign on the east on the U.S
settler Colonial
Colonial Rampage against the West the
Wild what the Wild Wild West was to the
U.S settler Colony the East was to the
Nazi regime and he's crystal clear about
this right and so if Hitler's saying it
we should understand that he actually
means it because he's drawing on a
colonial Heritage in order to extend it
against the true enemy of capitalism and
that is socialism
the third point that I wanted to make is
that and I'm not going to go into any
detail about this because I think it'll
come up in the conversation I've also
written extensively on it is that one of
the objectives of the Bourgeois concept
of fascism is to create an ideology of
false antagonisms and that ideology is
one in which uh we're encouraged to
struggle against fascism by embracing
liberalism and one could extend that in
the case of what Helen Harry was saying
a moment ago two various forms of
libertarianism anarchism other kind of
political ideologies that ultimately
share quite a bit with the core of
liberal ideology we've seen this of
course very recently in U.S politics
with the major media campaign saying
that you had to vote for Biden because
he was a bulwark against Trump and
anyone paying attention to geopolitics
should have a very clear idea of how
that project has worked out because now
Biden is funding to the tune of millions
and millions of dollars fascist regimes
or fascist brigades in the Ukraine and
for that matter continuing just U.S
imperialism around the world
and if you look at the history of
liberalism's relationship to Fascism the
true history of that relationship is
that they've been Partners in capitalist
crime
there's differences and I think we'll
talk about some of these differences
between living under a liberal State and
living under the terrorist dictatorship
of fascists when they see state power
that's a very important difference and I
think we're going to unpack it hopefully
in the rest of the conversation but at
the same time that difference is a
difference in modalities of capitalist
rule it's not the difference between
Fascism and non-fascism uh and proof
thereof is the endless series of
discourses on the part of liberals
concerning the need to be tolerant of
fascists to listen to to give them a
platform to not exclude them from the
debate but why is that it's because
ultimately as Obama the former president
of the United States said explicitly
about Donald Trump when he was elected
they're playing on the same team what
team is that it's team capital and the
Liberals need to keep the fascists in
the wings because if they can't maintain
capitalist rule through hegemony through
rule by consent they need people who are
able and willing to do the Dirty Work
and they've done that systematically
through history and I'd be happy to
share multiple different examples of
precisely this phenomenon this is one of
the reasons and this is the fourth point
that I wanted to highlight that I think
that a logic that is very helpful for
understanding how liberalism and fascism
relate to one another if you push back
against the bourgeois conceptualization
of fascism is as the good cop and bad
cop of capitalistic rule
the good cop as we know is going to
bring you a cup of coffee uh allow you
to make a phone call ask you questions
nicely and say look I don't want to tell
the guy to come in and start roughing
you up and we know where your family
lives and so why don't you just turn
over the information and allow me to
rule you by your own consent that's the
liberal mode of governance
metaphorically of course it's more
complicated than that but it allows us
to see something the bad cop is brought
in when people aren't easily ruled by
concept and the bad cop is going to
bring it in the muscle rough people up
and make sure that at the end of the day
the job gets done but what's essential
for people to see is that the good cop
and bad cop play on the same team right
it's not because someone engages in
Liberal tolerance and says very nice
things and is a good public speaker like
Obama was that somehow the policies and
the practices are radically different
than what you see under a trump or
someone else for that matter and so the
good cop and bad cop or both policing
the general population one through
hegemony rule by consent one through
repression but they're trying to do the
same fundamental thing and if you look
at history and I was glad that helmet
Harry mentioned Jennifer's important
piece on this as well as in your book
you deal quite extensively with this
that the history of capitalist rule is
one in which one will toggle back and
forth in different ways between
modalities of repression and modalities
of hegemonic rule and so in my own work
I've dealt developed a kind of
conceptual framework of dual modes of
governance George Jackson again Harry
referenced here is so important in this
regard because there are certain
populations that are quite clearly
principally ruled by repressive State
and parastate meaning parallel to the
state forms of violence if you look at
the indigenous population in the United
States you look at the Immigrant
population in the United States you look
at the African-American population you
look at many other examples basically of
poor working class class racialized
groups
the principal modality of governance is
very much one of mobilizing state and
parastate violence to make sure that
capitalist social relations are imposed
by any means necessary
if you look at the professional
managerial class stratum and those who
are uh uh largely kind of participate in
the general kind of charade of liberal
governance they tend to be ruled by
consent
in that regard once you see the tool
mode to dual modes of governance you can
see the good cop and bad cop aren't
simply alternating in certain cases they
do when Jennifer's pointed out this very
poignantly in her work on Latin American
politics when there are moments when the
dictatorships beat back and crush the
working class to such an extent that it
then actually made sense that the level
of a cost-benefit analysis to bring back
democracy because there was no longer
the threat of socialism and so if it's
toddling back and forth chronologically
or using these two modes of governance
simultaneously I think we have to kind
of peel the Bourgeois scales from our
eyes in order to see the more profound
mechanisms operative in the history of
capitalism the fifth point that I'll
highlight and I'll leave it at this
because I've done quite a bit of
research on this is that
the dominant historiographical account
that we have of fascism within the
larger Imperial Academy I don't know why
I'm getting so much feedback
maybe you could mute yourself I don't
know if we're getting feedback for that
or it's because I'm yelling like I'm
talking my children into the uh
microphone
I can also talk a little quieter
my kids would appreciate me learning to
do that
um so the fifth and final point is that
this the dominant history of uh fascism
that is
put forth within the Imperial Academy
and for that matter within the
imperialist Corps in general is that
fascism is this exceptional modality
that emerged and that liberalism is the
bulwark against it and so that the
history is one in which there were these
breaks at certain moments in time but
that the U.S defeated Nazism and
therefore now we have Democratic rule if
you actually know the history not only
of the spectacle of the U.S state but if
the U.S national security State it's a
very very different story
Truman the president at the time when
the United States was having debate over
whether or not to enter World War II is
on record saying well if the you know
Soviets are winning we should uh maybe
enter on their side if the Nazis maybe
we should enter on their side he
basically wanted to make sure that there
was bloodletting on the part of the
principal axis in World War II which was
the battle between Fascism and socialism
uh during that very same time Alan
Dulles it would become the very famous
head of the Central Intelligence Agency
in the wake of World War II but was an
operative in the OSS working in
Switzerland at that point in time was
regularly meeting with Nazi officials
with plans to sign an agreement with the
high Nazi uh leadership those who were
just under Hitler in order to sign a
pact with the West so the full force of
the Nazi war machine could be Unleashed
in the East because that was the plan
the World War II was primarily about the
attempt to finish the job that the 14
capitalist countries that invaded the
Soviet Union in 1918 had failed to
accomplish this is one of the reasons
that the capitalist ruling class not
only in Germany and Italy but
internationally the likes of uh Ford and
Dupont and Morgan and others funded the
rise of fascism within uh within Europe
in that regard then it's not only during
during the war but in the wake of the
war the Central Intelligence Agency
discreetly but forcefully integrated and
incredible number of Nazis Italian
fascists and Japanese fascists both into
their own modalities of governance uh 10
000 Nazis according to Eric Whitlow were
brought to the United States in the wake
of World War II and in addition to that
there were the 1 600 that were brought
who were Hitler's doctors of death the
scientists who were brought and given
university physicians at 14 different
universities in the United States but
they did the exact same thing in Germany
and in Italy setting up as the head of
the intelligence services in Germany a
man by the name of Reinhardt Galen who
had overseen the intelligent surfaces of
the Nazi third right that was directed
against the Soviet Union and he
proceeded to then stop the intelligent
Services of Germany with Nazis exact
same thing happened in Italy with
operation sunrise and if you knew
anything about the history of Japan it's
incredible in the case of Japan they
were just so crass and so open about it
that they took the man who had issued
the declaration of war against the
United States
brought him to CIA headquarters or
trained him within the Central
Intelligence Agency
along with the other fascists and he was
the man who had overseen as well the
colonial project of the Japanese in uh
in in China
and then redeployed him set up the
liberal party in Japan and he became the
Prime Minister of Japan in the wake of
World War II and so and this is not even
to mention planned Condor and all of the
Nazis who were given free passage to
Latin America through the rat lines that
were set up uh Klaus Barbies the most
famous but there were many many others
and so the true history of the
relationship between liberalism and
fascism if we only look at the
conjunctional manifestation of fascism
in Japan Italy and Germany is that
liberalism didn't defeat it it
discreetly redeployed it in a veritable
fascist International that was
continuing the same war that Hitler was
undertaking and the same war that had
been waged by the 14 capitalist
countries against the Soviet Union
that's the war on socialism
that gives us a very different portrait
of how fascism has operated historically
but it also raised the fundamental
question and I'll leave this this will
be my final statement and that is that
in the case of the final solution in
Nazi Germany there was a moment in time
at which
the Nazis became very explicit about
what they were doing killing at least
According to some counts you know six
million people in gas Chambers and they
were planning to kill 60 million of the
Slavic slaves in the East that was the
plan
it didn't work out
and it didn't work out for one primary
reason and that is the Red Army
Rich gave 27 million people as well as
the 20 million Chinese who were killed
in World War II the war was in the East
80 percent of the Nazi war machine was
waged in the Easter was was deployed in
the East and so it raised the question
about the specificity of the Bourgeois
state in the form that it takes in
particular within the United States
and one of the things that the United
States has been incredibly good at is
the development of an extremely powerful
cultural apparatus again this is the
system of production distribution and
consumption of culture
that provides such a powerful Veil
that the fascist International that I
just mentioned I'm sure a lot of you are
already aware of this but to some people
in the room it's probably somewhat
surprising
that should be common knowledge it's
part of the public record there is an
unbelievable level of documentation that
is crystal clear on this front the fact
that the overwhelming majority of people
are not aware of this
is largely due to the power of the
us-driven cultural apparatus to create a
spectacle of liberal governance in order
to better maintain the fascist
International and so this raises
fundamental questions about the
functioning of the Bourgeois State and
the absolute centrality of culture in
the world war on socialism I'll leave it
at that and turn it over to
Julia
okay so my job is not to present my own
work I'm going to offer some comments
some observations the idea being that
these will help to stimulate discussion
and I thought I'd just begin the effect
of mix very clearly with what Gabriel's
been talking about I begin with some
questions about what's at stake in this
discussion
and I think actually Gabriel outlined
very clearly then one of the things
which is at stake and I've come to that
in a second but just taking a couple of
steps back
um as Gabriel mentioned in the
introduction I work in in legal and
political Theory I teach and write in
that field and what I do is in different
ways to critique different strands of of
liberal thought and so as a writer and a
teacher in this area it's very
interesting to me to deal with Gabriel's
very powerful inside which is a critique
of a monolithic approach to regime
classification and one of the first
things you're taught as a political
theorist and even as a student of the
history of history or the history of
different regimes even in secondary
school is that regimes have one label
that you should attach to them you can
classify a regime you know as either a
liberal
tarian
and so on and that part of what you do
when you study a regime is just assume a
particular monolithic character and then
all sorts of things just follow
automatically from them as a kind of
unquestioned premise of what you're
doing and so it's very fundamental in
the sense of basic and to to take on
board the critique that Gabriel's
offering which is to say well look if
you look seriously at the actual reality
of a particular regime that's history of
a particular polity in its history what
you see is not a monolith but multiple
modes of governance and that these
multiple modes of governance are
addressed often to different populations
at a single time within a particular
social order are often in ways that are
highly racialized uh often connected
with colonial projects and so on and
what you end up with is a much more
complicated picture than the sort of the
standard textbook regime classification
project and that already is I think a
huge Insight which not only complicates
the theoretical exercise but does
something very important politically
which I'll come to in a second
um I think another thing that's at stake
in the critique that Gabriel has offered
is it fundamentally challenges the moral
Prestige which is associated in our time
with the attachment of the label liberal
democracy to particular regimes
there's almost an overwhelming consensus
that it makes sense in a way that we
shouldn't question to attach the regime
to attach the label liberal democracy
say to the United States and its allies
if you think about it in light of the
real history and reality of a country
like the United States that's just an
enormous propaganda victory
it's an enormous Victory because of the
moral Prestige which is unquestionably
associated with the labeled liberal
democracy it stands for
Freedom it stands for equality and so on
and so once you start looking at those
two things the idea that regimes are not
monolithic but employ multiple modes of
governance but you start to then of
course question the moral Prestige and
the uncomplicated
um the uncomplicated nature of the
attachment of a label like liberal
democracy to the United States and
that's it's very in a lot of the
indicate that so stick with it the case
of the United States
a simple list
of the multiple modes of governance that
have been employed in the history of the
United States does extraordinary damage
to the moral Prestige and the simplistic
attachment of the labor liberal
democracy so the indigenous genocide uh
in the United States which as Gabriel
correctly said was an inspiration for
him that he wrote about in my account
and James Whitman who gave her all
sights in his work at Yale legal
historian has written an amazing book
it's really an incredibly interesting
book which is based on careful archival
research looking not only at Hitler's
writings and speeches but at the period
before the policy of extermination
became the Nazi policy for dealing with
unto mention where legal Scholars
bureaucrats and so on have the Nazi
regime
studied the U.S system of Jim Crow and
segregation to try to learn
how to pursue a policy of white
supremacy from what they thought was the
best example available
uh and one of the Staggering facts is if
it's revealed in Whitman's book is that
they actually have to reject certain
aspects of the U.S example because they
consider them too radical at that point
now this is obviously before Nazi
extermination which is much more radical
but at that point in time uh the Nazis
were looking at what's sometimes
referred to as the one drop rule in the
gym Pro rating so one drop of incurable
blood is enough to mean that you are
then a colored person and
ought to be segregated the Nazis looked
at that and said well that's too radical
for us because if we did that with
Jewish blood it would include too many
people that we'd actually like to call
Aryan so let's not go with that that's
too radical all right that's it
Whitman's revelation of that of that
parallel does obviously have great
damage to that simple classification of
a regime like the Nazi regime as soon as
generous as radically other and as
having no parallels in in so-called
liberal democracies of course there's
slavery mass incarceration militarized
policing U.S imperialism all its various
guises all of these are different modes
of governance that exist within a single
political framework at a particular time
and over time in the US case so I think
that's a hugely uh important Insight the
political effect of which is to
immediately well is to to force
interlocutors people we're speaking to
not to proceed on the basis of the lazy
received wisdom of the United States is
a liberal democracy but to be put on the
back foot and forced uh into a
discussion of the reality of the United
States and its different modes of
governance and and that I think is is a
very important thing politically so it's
one of the things at stake and another
thing I think again I'd like to commend
to you an essay by Ernest Mandel it's
he's a Belgian Marxist who wrote an
introduction to trotsky's Collective
works on on fascism
and he also wants to point out which I
mean in a way it's quite obvious that
what's at stake when we study the nature
of fascism when we try and understand
fascism is is not just a sort of
exercising idle theoretical curiosity it
departs from the assumption that the
more precisely we can grasp the nature
of fascism the better we are able to
combat it and I think if that is
obviously an important background
assumption in Harry's remarks and
Gabriel's remarks as well so this is it
is theoretical but not in a sort of idle
sense it's it's profoundly important for
the real struggle against fascism now I
wanted to raise a couple of things that
I hope are in in some tension with
Gabriel's pieces that you've been set
for this for this Workshop
I think there's a degree of overlap
um between Gabriel's position and the
position I've been on that line now but
they're also important differences that
as Gabriel foreshadow require us to to
unpack difficult questions about the
nature of fascism
so the target of Gabriel's critique is
what he calls the Bourgeois concept of
fascism
or uh Harry Potter the liberal dominant
concept of fascism
Harry's list
Griffin Mason so there's all Madeleine
Albright also has a a book length
um and work on on the nature of fresh or
something how to find it which I would
add to that at least so

I would like to I guess as I said to
raise
um some points of tension by looking at
an alternative concept of fascism uh
alternative to the Bourgeois Concepts
not a liberal concept but a Marxist
concept that was put forward
by Trotsky in his writings in in the
1920s and 30s
now Gabriel mentioned yesterday that we
inhabit an intellectual culture in which
name checking branding
and so on is is absolutely prevalent so
I should say I'm not a trotskiest and in
fact I should I should add as well
that I'm probably more of an eclecticist
which in the idiom of 20th century
Marxism is this majority of terms and I
sort of compliment but I actually avoid
it as a vegetables defend at another
time but certainly on on the subject of
fascism at one of the great
writers is Trotsky and of course he was
writing at the time in the 20s and 30s
as as the fascists were taking power in
Germany and his insights are incredible
um given his his lack of the the
privilege of hindsight that that we have
it in those respects so just to give you
a little bit of context
um he's writing in the first instance
about the response of Communists to the
the rise of Hitler's fascism as a
significant political force in the in
the Bible Republic which uh was a
context in which social democracy was in
many ways ascended and he's writing in
the context of uh the the common terms
of policy that emerged from uh the sixth
Congress of the commentary which was
labeled social quite often is associated
with the label social fascism
that policy and this is obviously going
to allide lots of important details and
distinctions involved the common terms
saying to the various communist parties
uh that that were affiliated with it
this is a time to fight both social
democracy for example in the Social
Democratic party in the Bama Republic
and fascists and not to draw a sharp
distinction between those two different
battles to see that social democracy
Works hand in glove with Fascism and
that there is no profound radical
difference between the two things that
the brown shirts and the social
Democrats are both agents of capitalist
accumulation they work in different ways
but they work for the same end
and obviously there's a large area of
overlap between that particular view
that's as I said often associated with
the label social fascism fascism and the
analysis that Gabriel offers in the
pieces that you've read for this
seminar
um
so Trotsky offers a critique of this
particular view of the common turn
espoused
and
his concept I'll give you a quotation
from Trotsky who focuses on insisting
that although
there is absolutely and he is very clear
about this a relationship of enabling
and let's call it allyship between
Social Democratic elements and fascist
elements there is also a distinctiveness
to a regime which involves a fascist
takeover of state power that if fascists
succeed whether by a push or an election
or some other method in grasping for
themselves all the important levers of
state power importantly full control of
a police the military and you know the
organs of a modern State what you get
there is something different and
distinctive and in that particular
historical context different from the
Weimar regime in a way that he thought
really mattered politically and I think
also morally so let me just give you a
quotation about that describes what he
thinks
is characteristic of of fascism
in that kind of
in its distinctive Incarnation as a
particular type of regime
says after fashion fascism is Victorious
Finance Capital directly and immediately
gathers into its hands as an advice of
Steel all the organs and institutions of
sovereignty the Executive Administrative
and educational powers of the state the
entire State apparatus together with the
Army the municipalities the universities
the schools the press the trade unions
and the cooperatives
when a state turns fascist it does not
mean only that the forms and methods of
government had changed in accordance
with in accordance with the past about
Mussolini the changes in this sphere
ultimately play a minor role but it
means first of all for the most part
that the workers organizations are
annihilated that the proletariat is
reduced to an amorphous State and that a
system of administration is created
which penetrates deeply into the masses
and which serves to frustrate the
independent crystallization of the
proletariat
and so one way of looking at this
particular concept of fascism which
emphasizes its distinctive character as
an agency of the total Destruction of an
independent working class or any kind of
independent population is to distinguish
between it and what Mark's called
bonapartism
right which we could consider modern
language or contemporary language think
of as an authoritarian or police state
and to bring it
into the present and there's great risks
of anachronism involved in transposing
what Trotsky is saying to to our present
conditions
there are important differences even
between mass incarceration militarized
policing in the United States and even
between you know cointelpro and
political assassination of of Black
Panthers and so on and a situation where
you have
the complete and relatively stable
control of the entire state
by fascist forces who then set about the
systematic destruction of any kind of
organized opposition so that's not
cointel pro as a particular kind of
tactic used against a particular radical
wing of
of a population within a state it's
something much more thorough going and
systematic
and what he thought was at staking in
insisting on the distinctiveness of
the fascist takeover is is really well
too I mean more than two things but two
things I'm going to emphasize
um first of all
uh he thought that if he didn't see the
distinctiveness of the Takeover
then the effect of it might be
to demobilize and disorientate
forces which actually might be capable
of preventing a takeover
if the view is that we already have
fascism if we're already living in a
state where fascism is in some important
way present
and I'm not you know his psychologist
he's open to question here but he says a
lot of people might say well look I'm
surviving
I'm still organizing I'm still speaking
I'm still able to meet and resist
that's something that
means that I can tolerate this maybe
this regime maybe I want to work to
overthrow it but I don't need to step up
my uh my activism or my combat to a
level of urgency that says we have to
say arm ourselves and fight now
the second suit corollary of
of this problem in history this
political and problem in his View
and this is again highly historically
contingent was that his view was that at
the time between let's say like 1928 and
1933 when Hitler took over it was
plausible
for the Communist party which is
extremely large in Germany at the time
millions of supporters
to organize itself to arm itself and to
defeat the brown shirts and the militant
fascists before they had taken state
power now this is where obviously think
transposing the lessons to the present
becomes you know highly problematic but
just to give you a couple of Statistics
that trusty decides which are you know
very very striking

um
in 1930 the elections in Germany the
Communist Party received about 4.6
million votes
staggering number
that was up on the 3.3 million votes
that they received in 1928
but in that same period
the Nazis had gained enormous electoral
grounds so in 1928 the Nazis got 800 000
votes in 1930 they get 6.4 million votes
and Trotsky
wants to a trip in uh up much in terms
of the subsequent history to the era of
conflating
the presence of different pressures
activists and different fascist
Tendencies and modes of governance
including militarized policing and so on
which he writes about with the fascist
takeover he wants to say well it's
because of that social fascist view that
the commentator propagated
that the millions strong Communist Party
of Germany didn't say we actually are
much stronger right now say in 1928 then
the brown shirts
let's see what's let's see the writing
on the wall let's see them what for what
they are let's see that they want to
take over and they want to destroy
any possibility or independent social
organizing
and let's use violence to defeat them
now
and trotsky's contention is that the
failure of that particular tactic
Faithfully led to
that growth that is illustrated by those
electoral figures that make possible the
the subsequent Nazi takeover and on his
definition of fascism
the Nazi takeover means the complete
Annihilation and destruction of working
class organizations and independent
political organizations
so that's the trotsky's position and as
you can see that there is a substantial
amount of overlap between that physician
and a physician outlined in Gabriel's
work but there isn't a sense there an
important Challenge and a call for a
response to
the Insight that what a response
let's say from from Gabriel to the idea
that
we might we might make serious political
errors if we don't focus sufficiently on
the distinctiveness of fascists taking
state power as distinct from fascist
forces and tendencies being identifiable
and present within a context which is
labeled liberal democratic
I'm really curious your thoughts on this
as well should I go ahead and share a
few thoughts yeah and uh in the interest
of time because uh you've packed a lot
in Julian I love to have a debate about
social fascism in the third period but
maybe I'll just focus on this the real
core I think of your question which is
the difference between a fascist
movement a fascist State and I think
that it is absolutely important that
when you have a fascist movement that is
aided and abetted by a state apparatus
in order to deploy repressive violence
against certain populations this is
distinctly different than the full
seizure of state power and the common
tournaments I'm sure you knew know as of
the seventh Congress in 1935 took that
position very clearly that the liberal
State historically in order to try to
rule hegemonically has had to make
enormous sessions to the working class
if you look at the history of the United
States of course uh the U.S population
in couldn't vote for the president when
the United States was founded couldn't
vote for senators and could only vote
for certain members of the House of
Representatives in particular States if
there were property owners and paid a
poll tax it was not a democracy it was
an anti-democratic Republic what had
transpired between the founding of the
oligarchic Republic and for instance the
1940s is class struggle from below and
concessions on the part of the liberal
State this is the reason why there is
voting right increases and and things
like this in that regard the position at
dimitrov in particular who was the one
of the most important speakers at the
seventh Congress of the commons
International in 35
insisted on defending the gains of
workers within the liberal state of
course this makes perfect sense because
if we can actually mobilize and continue
to organize because the state hasn't
gone full-on fascist it gives us a
margin of maneuver that is extraordinary
and unbelievably important and so in
that regard I couldn't agree more with
that fundamental point the second issue
I think is and this is what you're
alluding to with uh some of trotsky's
analysis is that there's the risk if you
simply look at fascist movements and you
say oh well the United States is already
fascist and therefore our Shucks nothing
is to be done there's the risk of a kind
of ultra leftist position in which you
say that well the liberal state is as
corrupt as anything else and therefore
you don't recognize that there's class
struggle within the Bourgeois State and
there's a class struggle within the
capitalist system what we need to do as
people who are interested in hopefully
dismantling capitalism is uh mobilized
as much as possible the conflicts within
the Bourgeois State and within the
capitalist surround class and to short
up and support tactically speaking not
strategically but tactically in certain
moments the most Progressive elements of
the liberal State and not simply
conflate uh you know liberal State
apparatus with uh the with Fascist
governments that said and I think this
is an important element that uh
trotsky's analysis doesn't fully give us
uh an adequate picture of is that the
dominant liberal Bourgeois states in the
imperialist corps are not only allowing
fascism as a movement to operate
domestically
they are in particular in the case of
the United States mobilizing fascist
forces International and so you always
have to approach the question of fascism
internationally so if you would say you
know for instance that certain
Democratic administrations would be
perhaps slightly better on particular
domestic questions and certain
Republican administrations you also have
to recognize that they both share the
same basic imperialist project if not in
certain instances Democrats actually
being much more aggressive right because
their orientation now is war with Russia
and with China whereas Trump's position
is well let's kind of shore up relations
with Russia so we can really wage the
war against China and so in that regard
you have to also pack in an analysis of
fascist and periods the last thing that
I would say and this of course goes
against some of what you've highlighted
is that trotsky's own political
positions were one in which he was also
against the uh what he identified as the
more kind of totalitarian elements
within the Soviet Union and the work of
Grover fur and a I can't remember his
name off the top of my head but it's an
analyst who he works with who uh has had
access to a whole series of Russian
archives has demonstrated quite clearly
that there was a conspiracy that was
actually spearheaded by Leon Trotsky in
which the trotskyite element within the
Soviet Union decided to Ally with the
Nazis and the Japanese fascists in order
to try to overthrow Stalin and put
Trotsky in power if you read through the
documents that are the first person
testimony on the part of those involved
in the conspiracy it's quite incredible
and extremely damning and so there's a
deep deep opportunism that saturates the
history of trotsky's own organizing and
that even Lennon himself planned out
very very early on and has also played
the history of many elements within the
history of trotskyism in fact this would
be my last word I'd encourage all of you
to see the movie mission to Moscow if
you haven't it was produced by Hollywood
and it's an extraordinary document
because it's based on the ambassador to
Moscow his Diaries concerning his own
personal attendance at the trial that
was the conspiracy trial against Trotsky
and the position that he took and the
basis for this U.S produced movie is
that there was a conspiracy overseen by
Trotsky in order to overthrow Stalin and
what Stalin ended up doing and I should
say not Stalin but the the Soviet
Administration that point in time was to
arrest the conspirators and this was at
an extremely dangerous point in time
because it basically meant decapitating
a significant segment of the Red Army at
a moment in time at which the Nazi war
machine was uh building up its power and
going to wage war and so in that regard
I think that's also an important aspect
to highlight I'll leave it at that
there's a lot more but Helm and Harry do
you have some thoughts and then maybe
after we'll open it up

both the uh criticism that Julian
outlines is interesting and you've
really covered the um our response to it
and I think part of what Trotsky
oversimplifies is the extent to which
the KPD the Communist Party in Germany
did in fact in the period that was
mentioned in the late 20s early 30s have
armed militias
um some of which eventually uh went into
the uh anti-fascist underground for the
duration of the second World War uh that
is a history with a really rarely
recognized or acknowledged even among
both anti-fascists and specifically
marxists
um surely more Trotsky really downplays
the extent to which the social Democrats
in the modern Republic were complicit
for example in the murder of Rosa
Luxembourg and Carl leave Knack in early
1919 right you know that after the
Democrats under Chancellor
um uh Ebert
um that there was collusion with the
fried Corps these proto-fascists
uh street gangs which are described in
great detail uh in the two volumes of
male fantasies by Klaus tevelite
and you know part of the criticism or
tension between Communists and social
Democrats is rooted in that history
right in the history of Social
Democratic governance during the Bible
Republic which was actively colluding
with elements of these proto-fascists
and emerging uh street gangs but a lot
more to be said about that and I won't
get into it now that a lot more else to
be said about the concept of social
fascism which in my view does have some
strengths although it can play a role in
contemporary organizing efforts
um which may inhibit reaching out to
social Democrats and liberals and
perhaps radicalizing them towards a an
anti-fascist uh view of government but
again I think both Gabriel and Julian
don't support who made a very
interesting
um survey of the history of some of
these arguments
well great thanks so much I know we've
gone on a little bit longer than I'd
anticipated but why don't we open it up
for questions that you can raise your
hand if you're online or in person you
can raise it as well
foreign
political information that has a
function of you know dealing with crisis
and with
resistant forces in capitalism into to
deal with them for repression I think
while in general agreement with this
account I think that there are two
things maybe that sort of this functions
to conduct this can may not account for
and the first one is
the length and the extremes that fascist
violence you know comes to so for
example I think you cannot explain
something like the sure so the killing
of six million Jews through the fascist
of Germany
it merely functions terms because it was
actually
not functional to the war efforts or to
the to the heightened exploitation of
operating it as a refresh is nothing to
to really go to these extremes of
killing so many people uh in this point
in time where it was decided on it was
actually some resources were taken away
from the war fronts in order to be able
to kill more people in the Conservation
Camp so you might argue that it was
actually anti-functional in a sense to
to certainly like material projects and
political projects that that the Nazis
had and so I think you should also take
very essentially into account you know
subjective and psychological dynamics
that are at play here and then can kind
of go out of hand at certain points and
I think and this is my second point this
sort of maybe is an
is a is a
this is why I take a different approach
to to things like the the fuconian
approach that you Mr uh criticized in
the beginning where it is where he says
we have to talk about the fashionable
inside of us or we have to talk about
masculinity and fascism for example I
think these are very uh crucial point in
understanding and Conjuring fascism
because for example nowadays I think
student forms but actually just young
men just wanting to know how to flirt
with women and then going on the
internet and finding on YouTube this
whole toxic manosphere Universe where
they are taught that you have to
dominate women you have to be a stoic
man that is rock hard in body and soul
and it doesn't show his emotions and
this is sort of a pipeline into a sort
of yeah fascist
Viewpoint and also into the fascist
organizing it so these are maybe two
like critical questions that I would
post you thanks great thanks so much
maybe we can take you know three or four
questions then
I think there's one online uh go ahead
and unmute yourself be honest
ly talked about a mighty scalar analysis
of fascism
and so I want to talk about its
strategic uh implications uh
how do we determine the relation between
the different scales that you've
outlined what are the precise conceptual
operators for that to take an example in
India the natural light movement
criticized the postcolonial congress
party
and its developmentalist origin as
fascist which the ominous party of India
Marxist forced uh so what are the
conceptual operators for the
relationship between the multiple scales
of fascism
great other questions yeah go ahead go
ahead yeah just make sure you get to a
microphone
uh can you hear me a lot
okay actually this question also ties in
a bit to the like who is being labeled
as fascists what what are the discursive
operations that take place and I'm very
grateful to Ahmad are you looking to
also mention uh Jason Stanley in this
regard because he is I mean one of the
best-selling and very very influential
academic authors uh writing popular
books and being able to sell them uh in
this game of Cosmos of course it's also
known to uh noteworthy that he's worked
very closely with the gay historian
Timothy Snyder they've taught classes
together on incarceration of the prison
system comparing to I mean you can guess
which which uh prison systems neither
would bring up as follows Eastern and
Europe but
um what I find in in this bubble in this
particular academic Cosmos very
important is that Snyder himself also
went on a huge media tour last year in
the spring ring
roads objectives of the New York Times
and went on gave interviews to dozens of
European newspapers
talking about the fascist nature of the
Russian state of the current Russian
state so this this framing of Russia as
as the new fascist uh uh Empire of the
of of of of the world and framing Moon
of course in Consequence the Ukrainian
struggle is as the true anti-fascist
struggle of all times
um then tied in with uh Biden's signing
of the land please act for the defense
of Ukraine on May 9th the Victory Day in
the
Moscow time
um which of course mirrored or
repeatedly famous and massive land in
his program of
world war in which the U.S landed made
it impossible to lend in lease massive
amounts of military equipment to UK
France and the Soviet Union so this
discursive operations that take place
there where basically the academic
political complex builds up a narrative
in which now a
somewhat a new fascist threat is Builder
on on through this symbolic or
discursive operations I mean I think
this is a very important aspect and I I
would be interested to to to to to also
ask how like what kind of strategies or
tactics we can come up with to to
counter this uh gigantic also publishing
machine because it's actually the
academic media and political sphere that
works handed that and how how can we
disrupt people like Snyder for instance
who have millions of viewers on his on
his uh introductory classes that all
broadcasted on YouTube and I mean
I don't see any any
um
productive or strong strategies that
could counter this this this Monopoly
basis
of the new fascist narrative
great question maybe we'll take one more
in the helmet area I'll turn it over to
you and we're both gonna have to be as
concise as possible but answer any ones
that you want and then I'll take
whatever's left over I know there's at
least one more online or there's one
here okay yeah we'll take this and then
we'll take Michelle you we'll take your
question in the next round of questions
yep
all right I'm just so I uh I I I'm
having a bit of a difficulty with some
of the um the conceptions of Fashions
I'm looking I'm thinking about from the
sort of third world perspective and I
think someone online brought up uh India
for example and you know something that
I I would like perhaps the speakers to
address is uh you know there's this
European American history that we're
sort of laying out and you know those
sort of psychological thing my friend
here was sort of laying out but then
there's also the question of sort of
Cold Hard Cash so when I think of uh for
example you know the East India
companies we're talking 15 1600s to me
that is and sense of form of fascism
because there's money behind all of
these things there is a concerted effort
into you know colonialism was about
breaking into markets and creating a
capitalist regime before we may be happy
words for something called capitalism
and you know to use India for example or
you know Pakistan which you know days
ago after overthrowing Imran Khan you
know took a gigantic loan from the World
Bank well in India for example the big
thing when Modi was
uh was campaigning was this phrase
foreign direct investment and the point
of foreign direct investment was that
India had this sort of hybrid system in
which you know you had foreign direct
investment but there was a limit on it
you couldn't just have these
corporations from the West pushing in
like they do in Latin America the
Coca-Cola company and people like that
uh you know you had suddenly This
Promise in the Modi regime in the
fascist regime of uninhibited Capital
that Capital wins at the end of the day
how do you buy off young leftists from
the third world with money you give them
positions at Amnesty International you
give them scholarships to iodic schools
you you know you buy them off
essentially and I think that was a bit
of what I think is missing in this
conversation which is part of the
colonization of the third world Africa
Asia Latin America to this day if you go
to Ecuador who's the Prime Minister of
Ecuador the former president of
Coca-Cola you know money is very much
part of this conversation so while there
I think there is a psychological element
or these pipelines all these things
there is a sense in which for example in
the Weimar primary Republic Mercedes BM
you know BMW the people who are
essentially the capitalism Mussolini was
a socialist before he became a fascist
he was a socialist organizer he was an
editor of a socialist magazine he became
essentially bought out by a certain
industrial class in Italy that saw the
Socialist as a threat to what to
Industrial power so I would like someone
just to address that because from the
perspective of the global South what
we're really dealing with is uninhibited
capital and the capital is coming from
one place to another in Mexico Carlos
Slim and the Spanish Banks essentially
still run Mexico the UK still runs many
Industries in India and are becoming
more and more able to enter into those
markets and so fascism becomes a tool I
think to allow for this right fashion
design for me fascism is almost sort of
like a byproduct of something else it's
sort of a way to get everything in
uh really great questions helmet Harry
yeah thank you I'm just going to address
very quickly two of the questions uh the
first one and I didn't get the name of
the uh Kushner so the speaker makes it a
very important point to vote
um uh an analysis of subjectivities
within fascism specifically uh how
um constructions of masculinity play
fundamental rules as he pointed out in
the recruitment of young men uh through
online space and on
example
of improvisable forms of masculinity my
quibble was the approach
via food called delivers and so on is
claims about the Primacy of patriarchy
or the Primacy of gender relations in
explanations of fascism we need to
understand fascism within broader
relations within broader structural
regression and those can be sorted out
in a Marxist political economy approach
the later question I very much
appreciate
about the role of Scholars like uh Jason
Stanley and Timothy Snyder while both of
whom I follow very very closely and in
fact the questioner makes a very good
point that Timothy Snyder went on a
speaking tour last year last year he was
a guest scholar at the very prestigious
vienna-based Institute for the Sciences
of man in fact one of the students who
was initially accepted to work for him
was the woman I mentioned earlier oleana
Simon
Kaiba who is the international Oakridge
officer for the fascist as of movement
in Ukraine one of the top Fashions
organizers in Europe and she was going
to work with Timothy Snyder Snyder
didn't pulled out who claims he didn't
know who she was apparently he didn't do
any vetting apparently and I took a
professor from the University of Ottawa
cochinoski who approached the Vienna and
students say look this woman is one of
the major fascist organizers she wants
to work on Heidegger Schmidt and Yuna
with Timothy Snyder what gives and
eventually her step and him was
withdrawn now the broader point is this
Tim Snyder and Jason Stanley who
collaborate very closely are sort of at
the spearhead of this very misleading
narrative that posits the Ukraine with
its current reality the actually
existing reality of fascist forces
supported by NATO
and others
he trained with the long history of
fascism in which currently fascist
leaders from the second world war like
Bandera are glorified as National Heroes
all of that is whitewashed by Stanley
and
Snyder Snyder has the speaker rightly
points overnight it's just so much
appreciate this point Snyder argued as
it argued misleadingly that Russia is a
fascist State I draw your attention to a
very interesting analysis
a book called is Russia fascist Cornell
University press
published by Berlin Laurel from George
Washington University and she
painstakingly takes apart Snyder's
arguments shows how he distorts the
evidence is ideologically driven
Snyder has never responded to his
criticisms in fact his wife was also
professor of Yale said something like
while these criticisms simply washed
over him he doesn't respond because
these are fundamental criticisms but his
very misleading approach and yet this is
what his soul
in the university and in the mass media
CNN and so on as informed analysis of
fascism highly misleading and we need
more Scholars to look very closely
at the ideological function that is
served by these collaborationist
academics and it's more disabled that
nothing will leave it all right thanks
so much uh really great questions I
would like to touch on the first and
last one to start with because and I'm
glad that both of you kind of brought
this to the fore I don't consider my own
approach to be functionalist I think
that the driving mechanisms behind
fascism are rooted in the political
economy of the capitalist World System
Of course dimitrov said this very
clearly when he defined fascism as the
open terrorist dictatorship of the most
chauvinistic and imperialist elements of
Finance capital and of course Finance
capital is the driving mechanism behind
imperialism as Lenin and others have
demonstrated quite cogently and so there
are elements of course of fascism we
talk about toxic masculinity
ultranationalism there's a lot of
different ideologies that are mobilized
in order to recruit fascists and things
like this but every single fascist
movement has been AstroTurf by the
capitalist forces that are operated
behind them you could look at for
instance if anyone knows the the famous
business plot in the United States in
which in 1934 it was decided that they
were going to set up a fascist
dictatorship and they sent a gentleman
to study four different examples of
fascism in Europe they decided that
which is a fascist organization France
was the best model and this was funded
by Morgan Dupont Rockefeller q and melon
why did they fund it because they wanted
to overthrow FDR set up a fascist
dictatorship so that they could maximize
profits and so absolutely 100 it's the
political economy that is driving
fascism not fascism as a cultural
phenomenon or a super structural element
that is somehow driving the economy and
we have to see those uh operating in
that way for that matter in the case of
Ukraine we know that zelenski right the
current uh president who abolished
elections now so basically the dictator
of what is more or less a totalitarian
state at this point in time was funded
his rise to power was funded by the
third richest man in the Ukraine called
myoski who also funds so many of the
fascist battalions and is someone who
also has a a controlling interest in the
platform on which zielinski's TV show
was run and so zelenski in many ways is
you know a sock puppet who was trained
as a speaker by playing in a TV show as
the president of the Ukraine and so the
man is both funding the cultural
apparatus and then funding the front
figures while simultaneously funding the
fascist battalions on the ground in the
name of what in the name of the
maximization of profits right and so we
absolutely have to see that as integral
too and of course there's so much work
on this Daniel guerra's book on big
business and Hitler uh Jacques Powell's
where there's an enormous bibliography
that documents this in great detail the
other two questions questions I'll touch
on quickly so how does one decide about
the conjunctual structural and systemic
levels at which one would analyze
fascism when I say that these are
heuristic what I mean by that is that
they're helpful for distinguishing
between different levels of analysis
within a world that of course is much
more complex than those levels of
analysis they don't so they don't
correspond to the world ontologically
and the issue of whether or not for
instance the Modi government is fascist
or that Trump is a fascist or you take a
lot of other examples right Orban or uh
take your pick these are complex issues
because a lot of the ways in which
fascism operates is that it is
qualitatively differentiated based on
the state in question I think it is
undoubted that Biden supports various
forms of fascism internationally and
it's uh Beyond question that there are
fascistic dimensions or elements to many
of the authoritarian regimes around the
country or around the world I should say
deciding whether or not so there's a
kind of difference of degree if you will
often rather than just a difference of
kind like it's fascist or it's not
fascist no there's a lot of different
degrees and you have to look at the
different levels in the Ukraine
currently for instance right sector and
the Parliamentary manifestations of
fascism are microscopic it's like 2.2.5
uh so at the Parliamentary level there's
not much fascism in that sense but at
the level of cultural fascism the sport
of the fascist battalions Etc it's very
explicit and so you need a
multi-dimensional analysis of the
different levels at which things operate
and ultimately this is going to be
sorted out in class struggle so someone
mentioned the CPI the cpim's position
for instance on Modi these are important
decisions that are taken by parties
based on a concrete analysis of a
concrete situation in which the Primacy
of practice is the most essential and if
you decide that a particular government
is fascist there are consequences
they're going to follow from that what
are the tactics to struggle against it
what are the strategies Etc and so we
have to be I think very attentive to the
need for those refined analyzes uh on
the inside we guarding just very quickly
the point on stage this is all of these
questions were excellent I've been
jotting down a lot of things that I want
to explore and learn so thank you for
the quality of them uh regarding pushing
back against the cultural power of
people like Snyder Jason Stanley and
others like this I do think it's uh very
important to recognize that culture is a
site of class struggle theory is a site
of class struggle we are hopefully
engaging in it now the scale at which
we're engaging with it in it is not the
scale of someone at Yale who has you
know tens if not hundreds of thousands
of dollars in an enormous set of
contacts but doing that is extremely
important building institutional power
so that you can do that much more
effectively it's by publishing houses
media platforms uh institutions like the
one we have with the critical theory
Workshop a lot of other platforms
International Manifesto group and
Western marks there's lots of people who
are doing interesting things but what we
really need to develop is an alternative
cultural apparatus and we are developing
we just have to do it a lot more quickly
and a lot more efficiently and uh but we
have to do it in under resourced ways
right because we're not going to get
Finance Capital to fund that and we also
have to support and recognize the
central importance of socialist cultural
apparatuses and if it be Cuba is a great
example of it but there are a lot of
other great examples and which if you
control the means of cultural production
the means of communication you can
operate at a much higher level than
people who are trying to scrap things
together on shoestring budgets in order
to try to make a difference to some
extent and so I think there are
different levels if you will at which we
can organize the fight back I'll leave
it at that we'll turn things over there
were just two hands up online and then
we got some hands here so there was a
hand that I think disappeared to Sabrina
you're the first one to be safe
okay
um real quick I guess uh so I'm
interested in the discussion of the
inter uh the early 20th century
um particularly in the U.S context
um I kind of see the development
historically of like the potential for a
black uh in white uh solidarity class
struggle in terms of the class struggle
and this is between World War one and
World War II
but I also see how this is divided
um
and the possibility of black socialism
um developing more in the early 20th
century than simply being it is kind of
described as just being crushed by the
Great Depression in the scholarship that
I'm studying
um and I guess I was just thinking there
might be another reason I mean you're
tracing 1928 to 1933 is when Hitler took
over this is also the period period that
I'm studying so I'm just wondering about
the role of fascism in
um particularly and as it relates to Jim
Crow white supremacy black white worker
Union solidarity in the Northern
Industrial us and the kkk's involvement
in being this sort of
um like
pre what we see as the police state but
also uh police policing black workers
and their potential for black socialism
great question uh Jonathan and then I
think there's a few questions here
can you hear me yes
okay great um I was just wondering um I
know we're operating very scholarly and
how to combat fascism and I know
Professor lowland's article on just
three lessons for anti-fascist touched
on it and
um Professor Rocio you just did a little
bit of speaking about Cuba
um but I'm an alternative cultural
apparatus I'm wondering about how to
remain practical and organizing
um in these streets against these
fascist elements whether to be a
movement or a state
um you know I live in Texas and we can
see that happening in real time so I'm
wondering if you all had any insights
about how to go about it I know
Professor broccoli you just mentioned
some examples
um
and your previous comments and so
um just how to um against these fashion
elements because then like we said
before they are backed by Capital
um they do have the cultural and Germany
behind them so I'm just wondering for
any insights about how we can really
make some movement like you said we
we're operating with shoestring budgets
versus unlimited finances and so just
insights that you guys have that maybe
you've learned or come across that I can
take back in real time for people on the
street to say you know who we need to do
let's try this concept what not happy or
is the nature of fashion to the point to
touch that you know
um we're going to have to do it in spite
up if that makes sense
yeah that's great I think there's at
least two questions here one yeah yeah I
basically my question I'm just going to
talk loud because we don't have a mic
over here but my I'm really concerned
about this kind of debate that YouTube
are having like you usually were having
said my debate about the nature of
baptism have a philosophical point and
then an analytical one and I think the
first Optical one is that liberalism
ideology or as an organizing Philosophy
for capitalism
has many names but I think the most
important General category is of
Bourgeois individualism this is like
primarily what it is it's a brand of
individualism and in that way it's not
very distinct from fascism qualitatively
I mean philosophically speaking it's
hyper-individualism it's saying like
we're going to reinforce the philosophy
of individualism with the iron fist of
the fascist movement of which we recruit
primarily from Petty Bourgeois social
basis this is like one of trotsky's I
think appropriate analyzes it's like the
people carrying the Torches the people
who are flying to the White House middle
of the week are not necessarily
working-class people they're primarily
uh educated business small business
owners and then generally white so I
guess like the first also points that
there's Bourgeois individualism and the
the inverse is a kind of collectivism
which we call socialism that's why
socialism is itself the critique of
capitalism it's not it's not something
it's not something that can be
incorporated the same way that fascism
can be incorporated in capitalism the
analytic point I think that you were
making Julian which I do appreciate and
I and I loved Rick Jackson I'm a
formerly incarcerated person I have
tattoos of George Jackson I'm glad about
it
um I do think that it's fair that he
does kind of one time they start calling
things fascists and we make this
distinction between democratic
governments and authoritarian
governments but you know George will say
well the choice between two fascists is
the choice of how they die it's not a
democratic choice because again this is
a Bourgeois democracy it's not a
democracy of resources or a democracy of
uh housing or democracy of Education
it's a democracy of the vote in a very
narrow sense of oligarchs of extremely
rich people who have no relationship to
the broad Mass supposedly voting for
them so the analytic distinction is that
okay well now the fascism is here it's a
meaningful different kind of thing
because we can't organize it well I
think the mass incarceration system or
the colonial system are both still
appropriate analogs in this case when
you're in prison you cannot organize
this is an extreme infraction and
because you're trying to break Bourgeois
individuals and you're trying to do a
kind of collectivism the punishment is
solitary confinement it's more isolation
it's more it's getting people further
and further away from each other so I
just I think that in some sense your
arguments are compatible in this way
which is that fascism can adhere to
certain segments of the population or in
certain contexts of economic necessity
be it the colony or the mass
incarceration system which like the
speaker about the about Auschwitz or the
concentration can't be saying is not
profitable the mass incarceration system
in America is extremely not it's a huge
blight economically but it's socially
necessary as both a race-based form of
social control but also a control of the
reserve Army of Labor which is which is
people who cannot participate in the
system and working professionally and
getting people out of jail which is what
I do now
you see that no one goes into jail
owning their house and having a
well-paying job they just don't I mean
like there's some exceptions but these
are extremely marginal fractions so I
guess my my just wrapping it up
philosophical point is that Bourgeois
individualism intensified as a kind of
fascism so the Liberals will just like
Pokemon and do SNL skits about fascists
for now
but they're actually not so on bed
pillows and then analytically yeah of
course fascism achieve is a is a
fundamentally maybe a qualitatively
different kind of thing than the liberal
uh order but uh it's already happening
here to of many people right here I'm
sorry here everywhere in France Katie
there's something would be a great
example but in America you know the mass
incarceration system
I will address Professor low wind travel
yeah thank you yeah
yeah thank you um I want to insist in
Public's question that was the first
question raised and he mentioned the
criticisms to Foucault a professor lowen
said that for Foucault emancipation is
the color of the soul but I was
wondering what is your point of view
regarding his political works uh just to
give one an example in discipline and
punish he mentions and he emphasizes the
collective resistance of the workers
movement in France in the 19th century
and it was a resistance again the
carousel apparatus so I'm trying not to
lose like the picture and in them in
both the articles that we read for today
you mentioned that there is a connection
between the prison complex and fascism
so God does mention uh a case of
collective resistance of workers
movement against the country
and also Professor Roxio mentioned this
interview about the practices of freedom
but in this interview
um
I want to know what is your point of
view when he states that practices
ethical practices of Freedom articulate
with political practices of liberation
and yeah
great I think in it it's just a time uh
if if there are if there's any like
fundamental impressing very concise
questions we could take them otherwise
uh maybe we should just respond quickly
y'all go I see you have your hand up
online
Do you have a
pressing into size question my question
will be just pretty quick um I would
just like to ask as this development
that we see in the in the world right
now this concept of the multi-polar uh
politics and how that could impressively
possibly pose any threat to the fascist
movements that we see even if you guys
see that as this quote-unquote
um they are doing a lot of different
types of powers against
um the imperialist powers in the world
how they can pose any threat to the
Awakening of fascism or the building of
the fascist movements that we have right
now around the world that's pretty much
it
great question element Harry do you want
to take whatever questions you want and
we're both going to try to be as concise
as possible so we can wrap up at 7 10
gross
certainly
um to Sabrina's Point very briefly
um and you may know this work but the
work of American historian
and Sarah Churchwell
who teaches in London achina's written
extensively on the long history of
American fascism
uh she's essentially a liberal historian
which makes a lot of sense uh and she
places
um the KKK within the history of
American Fashions that's a very
important move that she makes I would
also mention the work of Gerald horn the
very prolific uh youth University of
Houston historian in his most recent
book on Texas slavery and fascism
uh there's an interesting discussion
which may be of use in terms of placing
fascist movements in Texas within the
broader history of the and the horn does
this brilliantly and poignantly the
genocide of indigenous peoples in the
state of Texas and how about that
morphs into such policing institutions
as the Texas Rangers for example and
which also goes a long way to explaining
why Texas to this day is one of the uh
Central hubs of fascism in the United
States and we've been going to a whole
point about that so hopefully it's
useful you know Gerald Gordon who I
mentioned at the end of my article and
Sarah Churchwell Jonathan's palatable
anti-function organization appreciate
the question I've done a lot of this
over the years
um I was involved for many years with
anti-racist action a or a
um and the era developed principles of
unity once one of which was Regal where
they go in other words the anti-fascist
movement has as one of its precepts the
confrontations or direct action against
outbreaks of fascist violence on the
streets of their community so that
presupposes extensive research and one
thing that people and 19 fascist
movements of militant anticipation
movements do very well
this has been acknowledged even by the
German Parliament For Heaven's Sake is
the detailed research that anti-fascists
have
um generated about fascist movements in
their communities now that's an
inadequate answer and I called Jonathan
before that
very quick point the full code question
sure full coal as a historian has to
point out that there were Collective
resistance workers resistance to prisons
and so on and so forth my time for
criticizing true Cohen that whole line
is that a from Colt his own
um the biography does not provide a
sterling biography of activism yes he
did some work with the prisoner
information group and so on the full
quote is a fake rattle as well for the
points over a number of pieces right and
to position them as a radical activist
does not conform to the record
also quotes in discipline and punishment
from a major work in the Marxist
political economy of punishment Lucia
and her Steiner's work
and you know recognizes the importance
of that but and this is the very last
point so cold the problem with full call
from my perspective from a Marxist and
activist anti-fascist perspective is
that his full approach literally
undercuts the basis for any Collective
organizing either against the state or
against fascist movements in this or
that Community it's it's an anti-marxism
at its core and it aims to defuse any
radical Potentials in the anti-systemic
movements that Jennifer uh discussed in
her piece at the ulcer so I'll leave it
at that
great thank you so much I'll be quick as
well just in the interest of time
Jonathan thank you for raising the most
important question in many ways because
the idea of this conversation is not
just to understand fascism but to figure
out how to practically struggle against
it we could do a whole session on this
but I do think there are a few tactics
I'll highlight very quickly the united
front is a tactic by which Workers Unite
in spite of particular strategic
differences that they might have against
the rise of fascism the popular front of
course is another very important
historical model in which various
political parties be they you know
liberal parties Social Democratic
parties uh Marxist parties or for that
matter even Anarchist groups would unite
in order to defeat a common enemy that
has proven that tactic or those two
tactics the United popular front have
proven to be extremely important there's
also the development of what's referred
to as a popular front from below a
popular front From Below particularly in
situations in which the leadership of
particular political parties is
recognized as thoroughly corrupt and
thoroughly in bed with the fascists the
goal is to organize the members of those
parties
against the leader the positions taken
by the leadership so to connect with the
workers in those parties uh not
necessarily to have that mediated by the
leadership a few other quick tactics one
is the central importance of and here
I'll give a shout out to uh George
Jackson he referred to the development
of revolutionary communes to having a
communist culture a socialist culture in
which people are exposed to a different
set of ideas a different set of Horizons
and uh very different modalities of
interaction and practice and so building
communal spaces uh political spaces
leveraging power for the working masses
is absolutely essential and cultural
struggle I am not of the school of those
who say well someone has some fascist
leanings or might even be fascists
therefore we should just exclude them
entirely and not try to actually recruit
them in various ways now of course this
depends on the particular circumstances
I grew up in rural Kansas and the
majority of the people who I went to
school with are pretty fascist leaning
they're white supremacist and they they
have very right-wing views the thing
that's interesting in certain fascist
orientations is that some of them are
very correct about fundamental social
problems the fat cats are out to get us
uh you know the government is no good we
have to change the system in some
radical way you go through a long list
and those elements need to be taken
seriously but they need to be reframed
and given an alternative Gestalt to say
yeah you're absolutely right the fat
cats are out to get us government's bad
but the reason for this and the overall
framework that could actually explain
the things that are frustrating you in
your life is one that we can take from
Marxism I mean you might not use that
word because there's an affiliation with
it no of course I'll just add quickly to
that you know fascists with bats and
machine guns this is a different thing
I'm talking about people who show a
certain ideological disposition toward
fascism the last thing that I would say
is that ultimately all of these are
tactics for defending against the growth
of fascism but what we always need to
keep our eye on is the strategy the only
way ultimately demolishing fascism is to
develop socialism to such an extent that
the capitalist system and the driving
mechanisms behind the capitalist system
namely Finance Capital at this point in
time uh no longer exist and so socialism
is the ultimate solution to Fascism and
we need to be able to agitate on that
front uh Stephen you raised some
excellent points of course I won't be
able to touch on all of them but one
thing that struck me in what you said is
that if we use a different kind of
spatial Logic for our analysis and this
resonates with Julian's point that it's
not one state one mode of governance
right but within a particular State
there are different sites of governance
the mass incarceration system in the
United States the detention system in
the United States the uh reservations
that have been set up for the indigenous
population lots of other examples of
this are themselves internally they tend
to operate in terms of fascist modes of
governance for the people who are there
therefore we have to be able to see that
there are institutions operative within
the Bourgeois state that are thoroughly
fascist institutions even though they
operate within a state which maintains a
kind of appearance of Bourgeois uh you
know Bourgeois parliamentary facade in
various ways the only other thing in
relationship to the collectivity of
socialism versus Bourgeois individualism
there are certain fascist movements that
have really mobilized and they fed off
of a very false image of what socialism
is in order to try to generate a
quote-unquote collective project of
regeneration and of renewal because
people are hungry for something new and
something different because their lives
are crumbling and threatened by
proletarianization and so in that regard
there is a kind of full collectivism
that's often operative in fascist
movements just like there's a faux
revolutionary Dimension to so much of
the uh so much of fascist organizing
yeah written a detailed piece on he's a
violent anti-communist in 1968 in the
wake of 1968 because he was opposed to
68 because he was actually involved in
the governmental commission that signed
basically capitalist reforms counter
reforms of the University uh that
sparked the student movement in the wake
of 68 he like many other uh radical
recuperators saw the writing on the wall
and said well apparently now it's
fashionable to be Lefty and so there was
a brief moment of flirtation with the
kind of maoist anarcho-communism that
was very lucrative at the level of his
career because the way in which he was
then marketed in the United States is as
a man with a leather jacket and a
megaphone who's somehow radical he's not
read his biographies he's a violent
anti-communist that's a quote from his
leading uh French biographer
and in the wink of 68 after the kind of
his flirtation with radicalism burned
out in the early 1970s he not only
returned to his earlier forms of violent
anti-communism he got fully on board
with his closest political collaborator
he's Andre
Luke's man was a maoist in 68 and then
was one of the intellectual and
political leaders of the
anti-totalitarian movement and is
extremely was an extremely powerful
force in all of that and so if Foucault
was dedicated to some form of radical
organizing in the sense of a radical
change or in the sense of collective
organizing it was organizing against the
quote-unquote totalitarian regimes of
the East and support for the dissident
movements against actually existing
socialism right so he wasn't only
theoretically anti-communist he was
practically anti-communist there's lots
of examples that I could point to in
that regard so if his ethical practices
are linked to a politics those are the
politics
uh the final point I think is really
great Iago the multi-polar uh War the
multi-polar world as it's merging is
this weakening the grip of kind of
fascism in various ways obviously we'd
have to go through a very concrete
analysis of all of the different
circumstances and and look at them but
hopefully if at least one thing has come
out of this conversation it's that we
always have to think of fascism in
relationship to imperialism and this
resonates with what we were talking
about yesterday and part of the project
of the multi-polar world is to develop a
world in which the Imperial hegemon in
the United States is not dictating the
nature of governance around the world so
as I mentioned last time I am highly
critical of certain of the governments
that are part of the emergent
multi-polar world if it'd be Russia Iran
Etc do I want Iran under the Shah and
under a puppet CIA government in which
there are basically you know the
equivalent of the Gestapo uh being run
and overseen by the central
do I think that would be free and
Democratic no not at all and so if we
look at fascism and it's kind of an
imperialist manifestations the
development and emergence of a
multi-polar world I think is a rich way
of struggling against imperialism but if
we want to go all the way to the end we
can't remain at the level of a
multi-polar world the multi-polar world
has to be a stepping stone for a
socialist world
I don't know if there are any other
comments at this point in time thank you
for your patience we got started a
little late we're going to always try to
keep the sessions to two hours as much
as possible uh I'm glad everybody's
increasing their intellectual stamina
I'm gonna thank helmet Harry and Julian
for first
and thank you all for the wonderful
questions I have tons of notes lots of
work to do have a wonderful evening
we'll see you tomorrow same time same
place
