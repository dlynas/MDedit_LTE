Mixed Strategies Nash Equilibrium: Intuition
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RiZiTz2hWA)

## Transcript:
in this video i'm going to talk about
mixed strategies equilibrium and
specifically i'm going to try to give
you some intuitions about
what's going on here so here we have a
game
where we have two players and you might
think of these as players in a game
like a like a sports game of some sort
where they're choosing go right or go
left and different versions of this
might be the goalie in a soccer game has
to choose anticipate right or anticipate
left based on a player kicking the ball
their direction or it could be a tennis
player who's having to
serve right or serve left and their
opponent is having to anticipate right
or anticipate left so that's one
version of this and the payoffs in this
table are set up in a way that might
perhaps match a game like that um this
isn't perfect because it's not exactly
zero sum but i think this is the
clearest way to understand what's going
on so before we get going we should
remind ourselves what is nash
equilibrium
and nash equilibrium is a no regrets
equilibrium where after everything is
said and done both players can say
given what the other player did i'm
happy with my choice in other words i
have no regrets
if either of them say wait a second
based on what they did i wish i would
have done something else if that happens
then you're not in nash equilibrium then
you're going to have
rejiggering of the outcome if you play
this game again and again
so we want to find a situation where
both players are like okay this is the
best i could have done given their
choice
that's nash equilibrium now if we solve
this using the classic way of solving
nash equilibrium which i'll post a link
to below if you don't know how to do
that but i'll do that really quickly
here you solve for regular nash
equilibrium what you're going to find is
that there's no pure strategies nash
equilibrium
and in which case is there still a nash
equilibrium and the answer is yes
but the nash equilibrium is going to be
a case where the players mix between two
strategies
and
you have to think about this as the mix
as being random so each player doesn't
decide this time do i go right or this
time do i go left rather each player
says i'm going to decide what the
probability of me going right or me
going left is
and if the probability is one-third then
i will roll a die and if it lands on
what a one or a two then that there's a
one-third probability of that then i
will go right if it lands on a three
four five or six i'll go left and you're
letting the die the random die decide
for you
or the way i like to picture this in my
head is with a tennis match i can kind
of imagine someone in the stands being
the randomizer for the tennis person so
if you've calculated that you should go
left with a 44 chance and right with a
uh with a 56 percent chance based on the
strengths and weaknesses of that
particular opponent and their
right-handedness or left-handedness then
you would have someone in the stands who
would randomly
make a decision right or left based on
some random calculator on their phone
and they would hold up red if you should
go right and blue if they should go left
and that's the way you serve when you
serve the ball that's the way i think of
it
because it's not about which choice do
you make it's about what's your
probability of going any given choice
now for these players we're going to
have p is the probability that player
one will go right and of course one
minus p is the probability they will go
left same with player two we have q is
the probability player two will go right
and one minus q is the probability they
will go left all right so this diagram
down here this little simple diagram is
p the probability of going right so if
we're at zero that means we're going
left a hundred percent of the time
if we're at a hundred percent p equals a
hundred percent we're going right a
hundred percent of the time if we're at
seventy-five percent then we're going
right 75 and left 25
so you can slide this probability up and
down
and that's what we're going to do in
this thought experiment however i will
start the thought experiment
by imagining what if we only go left
because we see that if we go left our
payoffs are four and zero
if we go right our payoffs are zero and
three
so your first guess might be what if you
went left with a hundred percent
probability or what if p equals zero
what would happen in that case well if
you're always going left your opponent
is going to figure that out pretty
quickly right they're going to be like
oh it seems like they're always going
left and your opponent is going to say
what's my best response to that
and that means their best response to
that of course is to go left as well
and that puts you in this box over here
you as player one do not like that box
because you get zero in that box so by
going left all the time you know exactly
how your opponent is going to respond
and it is not in your favor so if we are
down here
the response of our opponent is going to
make us sad and i like to use sad faces
to map out this kind of diagram in which
case you're going to say well given what
they did they're always going left in
response to me i wish i would have gone
right a little bit more so i wish i
would have been a little bit higher up
on this p diagram and let's also write
down the opponent's response
so if p equals zero our opponent takes
advantage we're not happy we wish we
would have played p at a little bit
higher rate than zero if that happens no
the problem is we don't yet know how
much over zero we should put p
so we might overshoot in fact we might
completely overshoot by saying well what
if we let p equal a hundred percent in
which case we're always choosing right
in which case we have to ask ourselves
if our opponent notices that
what are they going to do and of course
if we're always going right their best
response to that is to also go right
that means we're going to be in this box
our payoff is zero in which case we're
also not happy and our opponent is going
to be taking advantage of us
so we're not happy at 100 if we end up
at 100
we will wish we would have had a p
that would that mixed a little bit more
between left and right so we've drawn
arrows in between now the next thing we
might do is we might take another guess
we might say
well what if we chose p equal to 25
well i won't do the math per se here but
what what you're going to find if you do
the math is that if you go
right 25 chance and left 75 chance
your opponent's best response to that is
to always go left because most of the
time you're sort of on this bottom rung
they get more on the bottom rung by
choosing left than they do by going
right so just getting this to
75 of the time is going to be better
than any other choice they can make and
they'll always go left you're not going
to be happy in which case because
they're always going left you're going
to say well i'm not happy i feel like
i'm being taken advantage of
and i wish i would have
increased the probability of going right
moving in that direction
and of course you do the same exercise
at 75
at 75 percent you find the same thing
now i'm going to do the math in other
videos but the math is going to tell us
that we should set p at exactly three
sevenths
and what that means is if we actually
check the 50 line we're going to not be
happy and we're going to wish we would
have moved down
as a matter of fact any random point we
choose for p on this map
we're going to find that the other
player has a best response of always
going left or always going right and
taking advantage of our bias in some
ways and that's true of every point on
the math except three-sevenths where
every point above three-sevenths we're
going to say man i'm pretty unhappy here
i wish i would have set p lower at every
point below three-sevenths they're going
to say i wish i would have set p higher
and 3 7 is the equilibrium now the rule
of thumb for figuring out the three
sevenths seems kind of counterintuitive
specifically you set the three sevenths
to make the other player
indifferent between going left and going
right
and
the reason for that is if the other
player is always going left they're
going to be taking advantage of you
unless you're going in a direction
that's going to cause them to switch
so you're going to be in a situation if
you're not in equilibrium where you're
constantly moving back and forth so
basically if you set your p your
probability of going right
at any point above three-sevenths in
this diagram your opponent is going to
take advantage of that by always going
left and
giving you that zero taking that two for
themselves more often than not
and that's not going to be good for you
and that's going to cause you to
decrease your p
if you decrease it too much and you're
on this side your opponent will take
advantage by always going right and
giving you the zero you're not going to
be happy with that that happens too
often
so by making your opponent indifferent
between going right and left
that's the only way to stop this
weird cycle that's going on so the rule
of thumb is that you set your
probability to make the other player
indifferent between
going right and going left and i'll show
you in other videos linked to below the
mathematical ways of doing that both
using calculus and not using calculus
