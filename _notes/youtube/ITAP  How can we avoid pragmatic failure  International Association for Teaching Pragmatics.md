## Transcript:
hello
i am andrew cohen a member of the
consultation board for itap
and i would like to do a brief
but hopefully significant
video clip
on
strategies for avoiding
pragmatic failure okay
the first one
get coached on the function of greetings
in the given language it's crucial to
know the when how and why of using them
fascinating how textbooks teach you
bonjour or buenos dias buenos aires but
they don't necessarily teach you exactly
when to use them in the target language
community
second strategy
find how verb tenses are actually used
in the target language community
and if relevant check on conditionals
and on subjunctives

really interesting that these
are
not necessarily
well taught
students memorize the forms but don't
necessarily know whether
that particular speech community is
using them
in the way that they would like to use
them
and
it can get really weird
three ask about gestures early on don't
assume you know what they mean when you
are not sure for example this is one in
the middle east or in israel you don't
move your hand it just means wait a
second
do you know these gestures and do you
know how to use them using them wrong
can be a real problem
four
inquire about the role of silence in the
target language
it's possible that you got the
strategies wrong or in comprehending
others they're being silent you think
they don't know and they're actually
being polite given that that's the way
it's done in their culture so you really
want to find out about the role of
silence
five take a friend acquaintance or
co-worker aside and get briefed on
cursing
what what do curses mean who can use
them
when to use them and how to use them
don't make any assumptions here it can
be very strange when you curse wrong
also it may be
life-threatening not to understand what
a curse means when somebody uses it at
you
six
check with local peers as to the most
appropriate ways to respond to a
compliment
in your culture for example you may
brush it off and say no no that's not
true
but in the target language community
it's important just to be modest and say
thanks
seven get models for appropriate ways to
make requests depending on the level of
acquaintance social status and age
again you don't want to make any
assumptions about how requests should be
made
because otherwise they could come out
weirdly formal
or
ingraciously
informal
in both cases alarming the person you
are making the request of eight
check out acceptable excuses to use in
review in refusals in the given target
language context
it may be that the excuse you've chosen
does not work it's totally unacceptable
perhaps it's necessary to tell a white
lie so as not to hurt other people's
feelings
nine
identify areas of speech behavior that
could annoy native speakers of the
target language
for example filling pauses incorrectly
this is a great one because again
textbooks don't necessarily teach you
how to fill a pause
in spanish it might be an fda
in
japanese it might be ano
so it's crucial to know
how to fill the pauses and also how
often to use these fillers
whether silence is also possible and
finally in my romp through some
strategies for avoiding pragmatic
failure
it's possible to choose to opt out of
conforming to the pragmatic norms
in japanese i don't like the honorific
verbs the
use of
meshe agato
for to eat as opposed to taberu
and
if you're
talking about
somebody of higher status like the
president of the university perhaps you
need to ask whether that person ate by
using meshe
and
as opposed to tabe mastica
so
a strategic approach would be to find
out what the repercussions for doing so
are
because it might be fine not to do
not to use these honorifics but what are
the consequences find out what what you
what you need to do
i assure you it'll make you more
comfortable pragmatically as you
interact with people in the target
language community thank you
bye-bye
