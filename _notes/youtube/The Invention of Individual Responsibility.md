Transcript:
(00:06) Humans love to fix things, to find the  cause of a problem, to probe, tinker,   and mend. We ask, in many different ways,  Why does this happen? What’s the root cause?   What’s the origin? What or who is at  fault? What or who is responsible?  But there are three subjects that have intertwined  with the topic of responsibly more than others. 
(00:33) The idea of responsibility has many forms both  historically and culturally. Philosophers have   debated whether we can be truly responsible for  our actions in the context of discussions about   free-will; theologians have wrestled with the  idea of taking responsibility for our sins;   scientists have joined the discussion  by searching for causation and exploring   the psychology and neurology of our brains.
(01:09) But today, the idea of individual responsibility   is often invoked in discussions about  welfare, poverty, and enterprise.   Increasingly, throughout the  liberal and neoliberal periods,   we’ve – in politics and the media, at  least - emphasised ‘responsibility for  
(02:18) ourselves’ at the expense of other types of  responsibilities, moral obligations, or duties.  For example, in his best-selling 2012 book  Stepping Up, John Izzo, PhD, promises his readers   that “taking responsibility changes everything.” Personal productivity author Laura M. Stack,   insists that “the fundamental responsibility that  each of us has is that we are completely, 100%   responsible for how our lives turn out.
(02:55) ” Jordan Peterson has written that ‘we must   each adopt as much responsibility as possible  for individual life, society, and the world.’  The focus is on responsibility  for oneself – atomised, isolated,   entrepreneurial – rather than on obligations  to others or duties to our communities.  Philosopher Yascha Mounk has suggested  that we live in an ‘age of responsibility’  The idea that we should each make something  of ourselves, stand up on our own two feet,   take control of our lives, adopt  maximum responsibility, all sound,   on the surface, powerful and innocuous.  They appear to be good lessons. 
(04:08) But as we’ll see, the rise in emphasis on  this type of responsibility has weakened   social bonds, justified the dismantling of welfare  programmes, and encourages inwardness and blame.  And it’s almost always associated  with one central topic: poverty.  If someone is to blame for their own behaviour,  their own actions, and their own condition,   then only they can be responsible for  their poverty. Interventions are useless. 
(04:49) If we look to history, we’ll see that  this particular interpretation of   individual responsibility is relatively  new, has serious flaws, and ignores more   nuanced interpretations of responsibility. Of course, the idea of individual responsibility   has always existed, its just taken different  forms, has been interpreted in many ways,   and that the nuance – in how the concept  is composed – has important consequences. 
(05:20) Is poverty a personal inadequacy? A  problem of persons? A problem of character?   A problem of culture? Or is it a problem  of place? Of systems? Of society?  First, let’s look at how the idea of  the deserving and the underserving poor   arose out of older ideas about responsibility.
(05:40) First, lets take a look at how the concept of   responsibility has taken many different forms. Shapes of Responsibility For most of history, poverty was a fact of  life for almost everyone. Death, disease,   and disadvantage were the norm. And  most at the mercy of nature, droughts,   storms, dark winters, or bitter frosts.
(06:21) Blame and  responsibility for the ‘natural condition of man’   took very different forms than they do today. It was often not a question of who was responsible   for their own poverty, but who was responsible  for care. The term obligations was often used.   In the 13th century, the moral philosopher and  theologian Thomas Aquinas wrote extensively   about the Christians obligations  to provide support for the poor. 
(06:46) In England, when the Poor Laws were  established after the decline of monasteries,   parishes and local officials were obligated and  duty bound by the crown to provide poor relief.   Feudal landlords, whether they complied  or not, were expected – morally and   politically - to provide protection and  sustenance for tenants in times of need. 
(07:09) A 1536 Act of Parliament insisted that  local authorities ‘exhort, move, stir,   and provoke people to be liberal and  bountifully to extend their good and   charitable alms and contributions, as the poor,  impotent, lame, feeble, sick and diseased people,   being not able to work, may be provided, helped,  and relieved so that in no wise they nor one of   them b
(07:41) e suffered to go openly in begging . . . .’ Families also became legally responsible for   each other after 1601: ‘"The father and  grandfather, and the mother and grandmother,   and the children of every poor, old, blind,  lame and impotent person, or other poor   person not able to work, being of sufficient  ability, shall, at their own charge, relieve   and m
(08:06) aintain every such poor person . . . ."’ In the Italian city-states of the 14th and   15th centuries, as capitalism began to emerge, a  cultural ideal prevailed that it was the religious   and secular authorities that that were  responsible for the public good, the   security and sustenance of the city’s inhabitants. And In China, the Confucian tradition stressed   obligations and relationships rather  than responsibility for the slef. 
(08:29) As capitalism released people from their  dependency on the land and weakened feudalism   across Europe, labour markets became more  fluid, jobs came and went, and the grinding but   somewhat predictable work of agricultural  tillage was replaced by an unstable rise in   modern industry. Modern capitalism, for all its  dynamism, created a new class: the unemployed. 
(09:09) Take one state: Philadelphia. IN 1709, there was only 3 men   and 9 women who required assistance. They  were provided for by the local officials and   the expenses were met after through a poor tax. It took the creation of wealth for poverty to   become unpredictable and more widespread.
(09:34) It’s  not surprising, then, that as it did, poverty   increasingly became a moral condition. IN the nineteenth century being labeled   a pauper – someone in receipt of poor relief  - became a stigma, a sign of moral failure.  The president of Harvard Josiah Quincy  wrote in 1821 that there are two classes:   ‘“the impotent poor; in which denomination are  included all, who are wholly incapable of work,   through o
(10:09) ld age, infancy, sickness or corporeal  debility.” Second were the “able poor . . . all,   who are capable of work, of some nature, or other;   but differing in the degree of their capacity, and  in the kind of work, of which they are capable.”’  At the same time a committee in Philadelphia  declared that ‘“The poor in consequence   of v
(10:38) ice, constitute here and everywhere, by  far the greatest part of the poor . . . . From   three-fourths to nine-tenth of the paupers in  all parts of our country, may attribute their   degradation to the vice of intemperance.’ Reverend Charles Burroughs preached that   ‘In speaking of poverty, let us never forget  that there is a distinction between this   and pauperism.
(11:02) The former is an unavoidable evil,  to which many are brought through necessity,   and in the wise and gracious providence of God.  Pauperism is the consequence of willful error,   of shameful indolence, of vicious  habits. It is a misery of human creation,   the pernicious work of man, the lamentable  consequence of bad principles and morals.’  Biology, too, was becoming a very modern problem,  the ‘inherited organic imperfection,—vitiated  
(12:25) constitution or poor stock’ – as the Massachusetts  Board of State Charities put it in 1866.  Throughout the 19th century, the growth of  interest in eugenics linked biology, heredity,   and destitution as a problem that was unresolvable   for those incapable of contributing  adequately to the common good. 
(13:00) Charles Davenport – a leading US eugenicist  – wanted to “purify our body politics of the   feeble-minded, and the criminalistic and the  wayward by using the knowledge of heredity.”  Davenport thought that immigration of lesser  races would ‘rapidly make the American population   ‘darker i
(13:27) n pigmentation, smaller in stature,  more mercurial. . . more given to crime larceny,   kidnapping, assault, murder,  rape, and sex-immorality.’  The idea of ‘feeblemindedness’ took  hold. Immigrants at Ellis Island were   given a simple puzzle to solve and if they  failed were sent back across the Atlantic.   When the IQ test was invented at the beginning  of the twentieth, it was administered 2 million   in the army and a national crisis insued when  40% of recruits were declared ‘feeble minded’. 
(13:56) The idea of national degeneration was a  topic of concern across Europe and America.  Indiana passed the first state sterilization  laws in 1907, 24 states followed, permitting   the sterilization of the ‘mentally unfit.’ According the American Eugenics Society,   Hitlers sterilizations laws ‘showed  great leadership and encourage.
(14:22) ’  The focus on biology in the nineteenth century  – a ‘lack of vital force’, as some put it,   or ‘an inherited tendency to vice, according  to others – started the idea that poverty and   feeble-mindedness were an inevitable part of many  individuals’ make-up, that it was unavoidable,   that they were not only responsible for  their condition, but there was nothing   they or anyone else could do to help them. But poverty was of course everywhere.
(14:55) Decent   paid work hard to come by. Harvest failures,  famine, disability, and illness continued to   be widespread. The nineteenth century was a period  of great change, low wages, and unstable markets.  And modernisation happens at varying speeds.  While some areas – elite, while, and part of the   metropole – got richer other areas lagged behind.
(15:25) This observation called for a new understanding   of poverty. It could no longer be  simply a matter of singular lazy   individuals. Entire groups were being left  behind. A sociology of poverty was needed.  In the 1860’s, the idea of a ‘criminal class’  emerged. Organised, professional and lurking  
(16:46) the streets of England’s cities, the idea of  a distinct group became popular in the press.  These delinquents had no understanding  of Christian morality, duty, or virtue,   were irredeemable, and could be responded too  only with a growth in the numbers and power of an   organised modern police force.
(17:10) This was  despite the fact that the majority of crime   was linked to hunger, poverty, and unemployment. A 1904 a Scotland Yard report concluded that  ‘The so-called unemployed have the  appearance of habitual loafers rather than   unemployed workmen. The poor and distressed  appearance of numbers of persons met in the   East End is due more to thriftlessness and  intemperate habits than to absolute poverty.  
(17:34) Poverty is brought about by a want of thrift’ The physciatrist Henry Maudsley argued that   teaching self-control to these criminals was  as foolish as ‘to preach moderation to the   east wind, or gentleness to the hurricane’ Criminality, according to a Royal Report,   was the result that those that roamed the country  in search of hand outs: ‘the prevalent cause of  vagrancy was the impatience of steady labour’.
(18:06) 36 The Times in London described the criminal   class as ‘are more alien from the rest of the  community than a hostile army, for they have no   idea of joining the ranks of industrious labour  either here or elsewhere. The civilized world   is simply the carcass on which they prey, and  London above all, is to them a place to sack.’  This backward and lazy group required explanation.
(18:35)   And in the 20th century, the idea of inherent vice   in distinct groups gave rise to a new  area of study: the culture of poverty  The Post-war Period: A culture of poverty As the Cold War began, theories of   development became important in the West  as communist and capitalist societies   competed to improve their societies. Hesitant to criticise structural factors,  
(19:45) many academics in the West blamed what was  termed backwardness on a ‘culture of poverty’.  These theorists took one of two routes: That culture was a problem of   people – that the cause for their poverty  came from inside – or that culture   was a response to outside, structural causes  that they often had little to no control over. 
(20:10) In the mid-fifties the American political  scientist Edward Banfield travelled to a   Southern Italian village of Montegrano –  a pseudonym for Chairomonte - to try to   understand how poverty was perpetuated in  the village. He saw what he described as a   cultural pattern or ‘amoral familism’.
(20:34) The villages, he argued, lived by the rules   “maximize the material, short-run  advantage of the nuclear family;   assume that all others will do like-wise” In his influential book – The Moral Basis   of a Backward Society – Banfield argued that  the Italian villagers were inward looking,   indifferent to improving their infrastructure  and hesitant to provide aid to their neighbours.  
(20:57) He described the cultural atmosphere in  the village as ‘heavy with melancholy.’  Banfield became an advisor to three presidents:  Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Ronald Reagan,   and argued throughout his career that  the American lower classes had a similar   cultural attitude to the Italian villages,  sharing ‘‘distinct patterning of attitudes,   values, and modes of behavior,’’ But the America underclass was even worse,   they ‘attached no value to work, sacrifice,  self-improvement, or the service to family,  
(21:31) friends, or community.’ He argued that any attempt   to improve their condition through social  security programmes was doomed to fail  He wrote that ‘The lower-class person lives from  moment to moment, he is either unable or unwilling   to take account of the future or to control his  impulses.
(21:53) Improvidence and irresponsibility are   direct consequences of this failure to take the  future into account . . . and these consequences   have further consequences: being improvident and  irresponsible, he is likely also to be unskilled,   to move frequently from one dead-end job to  another, to be a poor husband and father.’  Around the same time, anthropologist Oscar Lewis  argued that the culture of poverty was a way of   life that was passed down through generations.
(22:38) He wrote that poverty ‘is a culture,   an institution, a way of life…The family structure  of the poor…is different from that of the rest   of the society… There is a language of the poor, a  psychology of the poor, a world view of the poor.’  There was, he continued Banfield and Lewis typified   research that emphasised individual fault and  character deficiency over structural factors   like unemployment.
(23:40) But two other authors in the  postwar period took a more nuanced approach:  In 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan published The  Negro Family, one of the most controversial   reports on poverty in America’s history. Moynihan, a sociologist and politician working   under Kennedy and Lyndon B/ Johnson, argued that  the ‘subculture’ of black Americans was stuck in   a ‘tangle of pathology’ and their progress  in society was blocked by two main factors:   The ‘racist virus in the American bloodstream  that still afflicts us’' and the ‘toll of three   centuries of sometimes unimaginable mistreatment.’ But the problem was a cultural one and a lack of  
(24:21) family structure, and the goal of federal  intervention should be ‘the establishment   of a stable Negro family’ that was integral to  ‘shaping the character and ability’ of children.   Absent fathers and matriarchal families  had disastrous effects child raising.  The report was instantly controversial,   setting the terms for debate that’s on-going  today.
(25:56) It attracted criticisms from many liberals,   including feminists, and was  accused of ‘blaming the victim.’  Contradictory in places, liberals used the report  to justify intervention – the subtitle, after all,   was a ‘a case for national intervention’  - while conservatives used the report to   argue that only racial self-help could  bring black Americans out of poverty. 
(27:04) Sociologist Richard Cloward published  Delinquency and Opportunity in 1960.   In a study of gangs He described a new youth  subculture – one that many commentators were   afraid of - that was the result of the structural  conditions afflicting many young Americas.  Modern American aspiration, Cloward argued, was  impossible for a huge number across the country.  
(27:30) The impossibility of the American Dream reduced  the legitimacy of American values in the eyes   of many and lead to a frustrated youth rebelling  and searching for ‘non-conformist alternatives.’  But since the Great Depression and the  New Deal, conservatives were on the back   foot.
(28:16) Even Republican presidents Eisenhower  and Nixon couldn’t ignore the structural   factors that led to poverty and supported – as  the country did – social security programmes.  After the Great Depression and coming to terms  with the allure of Communism in Eastern Europe,   in both Europe and America, it was impossible not  to argue that unemployment, market cycles, and   misfortune had a major effect on an individual’s  life in ways that were out of their own control. 
(28:44) While the idea of a culture of poverty  was becoming popular in some circles,   in political life, structural constraints and  social programmes dominated the conversation.  Kennedy talked about olbigations – 03.08 After his election in 1960,   Kennedy was determined to attack the poverty  problem in America, and after his assignation   in 63, his successor, Lyndon B.
(29:41) Johnson  adopted Kennedys policies and announced an   ‘unconditional war on poverty’ in 1964. LBJ told congress that ‘our joint Federal-local   effort must pursue poverty, pursue it wherever  it exists—in city slums and small towns,   in sharecropper shacks or in migrant worker camps,  on Indian Reservations, among whites as well as   Negroes, among the young as well as the aged, in  the boom towns and in the depressed areas.
(30:08) Our aim   is not only to relieve the symptom of poverty,  but to cure it and, above all, to prevent it.’ LBJ’s war on poverty focused  on community initiatives  Operation Head Start, for example, created  thousands of jobs in community support roles with   training. The first Summer employed 100,000 alone. Community action was to be key. 
(30:54) Joseph Califano wrote that ‘the war on poverty  was founded on the most conservative principle:   Put the power in the local community, not in  Washington; give people at the grassroots the   ability to stand tall on their own two feet.’ In 1968 CBS produced a powerful documentary on   hunger in America which inspired senate hearings  and sparked widespread public interest.
(31:42) The power   of the television put the plight of millions in  front of the eyes of the comfortable in new ways.  LBJ’s War on Poverty – the launch of medicare  and Medicaid, an increase in social security,   and the development of welfare  states in Europe coincided with   the largest decline in poverty rates in history. But beneath the surface a revolt was developing.  
(32:10) Critics accused Democrats of being communists,  anti-american. While the political debates were   diverse, one topic began to emerge that was  well-suited as a supplement to the idea of an   intractable culture of poverty: genetics. Educational policies had, according to   conservative commentators, hit a wall.
(33:04) In  the Harvard Educational Review in 1969,   Psychologist Arthur Jenson asked ‘“Why has  there been such uniform failure of compensatory   education programs wherever they have been tried?’ The answer? Biology  Some children simply lacked the  innate intelligence and no amount   of intervention and political policy could  address what was inevitable in the genes. 
(33:27) Psychologist Richard Herrnstein wrote  in The Atlantic that “the tendency to be   unemployed may run in the genes of a family  about as certainly as bad teeth do now.”  LBJ’s economic advisors the Council of  Economic Advisors pushed back. writing that  “The idea that the bulk of the poor are  condemned to that condition because of innate   deficiencies of character or intelligence  has not withstood intensive analysis.
(33:53) ”  But by the end of the sixties the stage was set: On the one hand, individuals, their genetics and   their culture could be blamed for their  condition. While on the other, structural   conditions had to be addressed, and  could be addressed by those in power.  The Decline of Government &  The New Individual (70s & 80s)  LBJ’s War on Poverty cost the taxpayer no extra  money, instead relying on pre-existing federal   funds. But by the early 70s spending began to  rise. The discontent of the 70s – the Oil Shocks,  
(34:45) the Vietnam War, Union disputes, and economic  stagflation gave ammunition to critics of   big government and social security. As historian Michael Katz has written   “Great Society poverty research proved to be the  last hurrah of twentieth-century liberalism. It   rested on an expectation with roots in the  Progressive era that reason, science, and   expertise could inform public policy and persuade  a benevolent state to engineer social progress.
(35:15) ”  Critics of big government – like the governor  of California, Ronald Reagan – wanted to “send   the bums back to work”. The 1970’s were  the decade of a conservative backlash.  But the idea the poor were held back by a culture  of poverty came under attack in the 70s too. And   Instead, the idea of an ‘underclass’  emerged, still with a distinct culture   but constrained by structural problems too.
(35:46) On the left, the structural problems included   racism and economics, but some commentators also  pointed to poverty being a problem of place.   In 1977 Time Magazine reported on a  underclass nurtured by a ‘bleak environment’   producing ‘highly disproportionate number of the  nation’s juvenile delinquents, school dropouts,   drug addicts, and welfare mothers, and  much of the adult crime, family disruption,   urban decay, and demand for social expenditures.
(36:19) ”’ In his book the Black Underclass, Douglas Glasgow   wrote that ‘structural factors found in  market dynamics and institutional practices,   as well as the legacy of racism, produce  and then reinforce the cycle of poverty   and, in turn, work as a pressure exerting  a downward pull toward underclass status.”’  But conservative critiques pointed to a structural  constraint too: welfare itself.
(36:44) Handouts,   they argued, undermined the rational incentives  to work in a productive well-balanced economy.  Reagan famously declared that America had  fought a war on poverty and poverty had won.   Government intervention had failed. But the  rhetorical shift in the 80s didn’t just place the   individual at odds with government, but atomised  that individual from the rest of society, too. 
(37:36) Thatcher famously declared there is no such thing  as society and Reagan said that “We must reject   the idea that every time a law’s broken,  society is guilty rather than the lawbreaker.   It is time to restore the American precept that  each individual is accountable for his actions.”  More than this, it wasn’t just that  individuals were responsible for their   own lives, but that government was responsible  for holding them back.
(38:07) Welfare, laziness,   and moral decay were all contributing to  economic stagnation, making everyone worse off.  Reagan had two bibles: George Gilder’s Wealth  & Poverty, and Charles Murray’s Losing Ground.  The bestselling Wealth &  Poverty was published in 1981.  It was a reimagination of capitalism,  not, as Adam Smooth had interpreted it,   as the pursuit of self-interest, but  instead as an altruistic endeavour. 
(38:38) “Capitalism begins with giving.’ Gilder argued.  ‘Not from greed, avarice, or even self-love can   one expect the rewards of commerce but  from a spirit closely akin to altruism,   a regard for the needs of others, a benevolent,  outgoing, and courageous temper of mind.”  The cause of poverty was an absence  of ‘work, family, and faith’. 
(39:02) The burden he placed on the poor was that ‘in  order to move up, the poor must not only work,   they must worker harder than the classes above  them. . . . But the current poor, white even   more than black, are refusing to work hard.”’ But while Gilder placed responsibility on   individuals he interpreted that responsibility  as one for others, not for oneself.
(39:28) He wrote   “Capitalism transforms the gift impulse into a  disciplined process of creative investment based   on a continuing analysis of the needs of others.” In Murray’s Losing Ground, however,   the emphasis shifts more towards the idea that  ‘American society is very good at reinforcing   the investment of an individual in himself’ Murray argued that poverty & delinquency had   increased after 1965 despite an increase in  public spending to address those problems.  
(40:02) Black unemployment, he said, was the result of  a ‘voluntary’ withdrawal from the labour market.  Both books were instantly controversial.  The central theme of both books was   that government intervention had failed. However, while it was true that poverty had   gotten, this was because the economy as a whole  had gotten worse after 1973.
(40:26) Studies also began   to find that those living under the poverty  line had halved between 1965 and 1980, and   welfare benefits had decreased throughout the 70s. Historian Michael Katz writes ‘Murray distorted or   ignored the accomplishments of social programs.  He did not recognize the decline in poverty   among the elderly, increased access to medical  care and legal assistance, the drop in infant   mortality rates, or the near abolition of hunger  prior to the Reagan administration’s policies.
(40:53) ’  Other interpretations By the 90s, the idea   that the individual was responsible for  their own life was culturally entrenched.  Clinton promised to ‘end welfare as we know  it’ and the ‘Personal Responsibility and Work   Opportunity Act’ restricted welfare entitlements  and emphasised individual responsibility. 
(41:24) Genetics, IQ, and race were In 1994, Murray’s The Bell Curve   reinvigorated discussions around race, IQ,  and genetics. Murray and his co-author Richard   Herrnstein argued that because cognitive ability  was heritable, many policies aimed at improving   the condition of the worst-off were misguided.
(42:23) Whatever was responsible for poverty,   for the authors, was inside  the head, not out in the world.  Almost every claim the book has made has  been criticised or rejected. The authors   misunderstood and misused statistics, and  today, epigenetics – the discovery that   environment can influence genetics themselves –  has meant the book is almost entirely obsolete  In Inequality by Design, several authors  criticized Murray and Herrnstein, writing that   ‘“social environment during childhood matters  more as a risk factor for poverty than  
(42:58) Herrnstein and Murray report and that it matters  statistically at least as much as do the test   scores that purportedly measure intelligence”’ Despite this The Bell Curve sold – and continues   to sell - hundreds of thousands of copies. Much of the rhetoric emphasizes stricter welfare,   genetic limitation, an inward culture of poverty,  and fatherless homes.
(43:26) Murray wrote that ‘The   moral hazards of government programs are clear.  Unemployment compensation promotes unemployment.   Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)  made more families dependent and fatherless.’  Sara McLanahan and Christine Percheski point out  that a substantial body of research demonstrates   that living apart from one parent is associated  with a ‘host of negative outcomes’ as children   score lower on tests, report lower grades, drop  out of school, display a higher prevalence of   behavioural and psychological problems, and  are more likely to live in poverty as adults. 
(44:01) Through his presidency, Obama  frequently referred to a crisis   of responsible fatherhood and healthy family. He said to one parish ‘“If we are honest with   ourselves, we’ll admit that . . . too many  fathers are also missing—missing from too   many lives and too many homes.
(44:30) They have  abandoned their responsibilities, acting   like boys instead of men. And the foundations  of our families are weaker because of it.”’  What was dominant by the 90s, was that these types  of studies and comments were used and referred to   in the context of genetic claims like  Murrays, cultural criticisms, a lackpersonal   responsibility, and the dismantling of welfare,  rather than in a conversation about structural,   economic, social, or political issues.
(45:40) Conclusion/Legacy/Today The shape of responsibility – how its imagined,  interpreted, and implement – has a complicated   history. One that escapes any simple  interpretation. But it seems clear that   a trend has accompanied the modern history of  liberalism and neoliberalism – the invention   of a particular type individual responsibility.
(46:07) When Kennedy encouraged Americans to  ‘“ask not what your country can do for you;  ask what you can do for your country.”’  He seemed not to be talking  about the atomised individual,   responsible for themselves, but an individual  with obligations to their country and to society.  Mounk has called this ‘The shift from  a notion of responsibility-as-duty   to a notion of responsibility-as-accountability’.
(46:37) Philosophically, individual responsibility of this   type is an often incomprehensible  and contradictory concept.   The original meaning of the phrase pick yourself  up by the bootstraps was meant as an absurd joke,   it being impossible to use your own bootstraps  to pick yourself up. And this irony tells us a   lot about the incomprehensibility of the concept.
(47:02) Almost all the factors that contribute towards   the condition of poverty come from  outside the individual – education,   upbringing, culture, environment, economic and  unemployment. Even genetics are something an   individual has no control over and cannot be held  responsible for. Even if we grant that some are   lazy, delinquent, in need of cultural reform,  we have to simultaneously acknowledge that   the education, encouragement, and solutions to  those problems cannot come magically from within   but must come from the guidance and aid of others. It’s for this reason that mutual obligations  
(47:46) make much more sense as a concept  that individual responsibility In Why Americans Hate Welfare, Martin  Gilens found the most important factor   was the “widespread belief that most  welfare recipients would rather sit home   and collect benefits than work  hard to support themselves.”  And this myth endures despite  there being no evidence for it   and an abundance of evidence against it.
(48:16) First, unemployment aid, for example,   is not expensive. IN the UK, for  example, it accounts for about 0.25%   of the total government spending budget of £800  billion. Most only claim for temporary periods,   and only about 1% of the country are claiming  jobseekers allowance at any one time.   Furthermore, the majority of people experience  poverty at some point during their lives and most   only experience short-term impoverishment.
(48:46) And in their study, the OECD concluded that:  ‘Reports have suggested that the benefits  system has disincentivised work and encouraged   a culture of dependency (see, for example,  Centre for Social Justice, 2007). However,   the OECD (2011a) has shown  that falling relative values   of benefits have increasingly contributed  to rising poverty rates across countries.
(49:03) ’  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare%27s_effect_on_poverty And the evidence shows that the War   on Poverty, the Great Society,  and Federal intervention pulled   millions out of poverty. Poverty declined  to its lowest point in recorded history.  This N-gram shows the rise in occurrence of  the phrases ‘individual responsibility’ of   ‘personal responsibility’ in books since  1800, with a sharp rise since the late   90s. This one shows the parallel decline in the  occurrences of the more outward looking ‘duty’. 
(49:39) What I hope it clear, is that I have not  arguing that we should not be talking   about our responsibilities, only that the  particular form ‘individual responsibility’ has   taken – atomised, asocietal, ideally  self-dependent, culturally ‘backward’,   genetically limited – is a relatively new  historical and political concept which is used to   justify the dismantling of welfare, the rejection  of altruism, and the unravelling of community. 
(50:13) Any cultural interpretation of responsibility  is bound-up with politics, language, culture   and society, and, has a history that’s  not simply progressive and linear.  Jordan Peterson has written that ‘We must each  adopt as much responsibility as possible for   individual life, society and the world’.
(50:38)   Instead, maybe we should remember that we’re   all dependent on one another in some way, that the  responsibility should be placed on the powerful   not the powerless, that the dispossessed are more  likely to succeed with some kind of external aid.  Instead of being responsible  for ourselves, the concept of   mutual obligations or duties includes  responsibility to work hard and improve   ourselves, but can also better accommodate  contributing to the world, aiding others,   remembering no man is an island and  turning our gaze not inwards but outwards.
