Transcript:
(00:00) this episode is brought to you by ground news we begin with the deal to raise the debt ceiling the agreement raises the debt ceiling until 2025. there's not a hundred percent of what everybody wants but when you look the country is going to be stronger this is going to be transformational Congress just passed an agreement to increase the debt ceiling if you didn't hear about it after the big Panic Congress has not prudently done its job they're off the rails well that's done now Republicans and Democrats came to an
(00:29) agreement they'll raise the debt ceiling for two more years and in exchange work requirements for food stamps and Welfare are going to get worse there's going to be a 1.5 trillion dollar spending cut over the next 10 years which will put a ton of strain on programs like affordable housing new fossil fuel projects we'll have an easier time getting permits meaning more pipelines and you gotta love that and of course the student loan payment moratorium will be coming to an end the government is just spending too much
(00:52) money and we need to tighten our belts and make compromises except for the military because it's just cool as hell you guys get it it's so sick man it's awesome with all the guns and the tanks and the domestic spying and the we got to give those guys more money at least 886 billion dollars next year three percent more than in 2023 if I've had to randomly pick a number hey you maggots understand that nothing we can do about it it's just the coolest thing we can spend money on foreign 
(01:30) this whole episode is about government spending which is a very familiar theme in American politics with the 2024 election season starting like every cycle one of the things you'll inevitably hear is the how are you going to pay for that question like with the debt ceiling stuff this question will never come up for defense spending obviously that money is special and totally different and unrelated and stop worrying about it we've got hospitals to bomb come on now but over the next 14 or so months every single Progressive
(01:59) candidate proposing Universal Health Care will without fail get scrutinized for their budgeting despite the fact it's estimated that Universal Health Care would save Americans 450 billion dollars a year and less importantly tens of thousands of lives but none of that matters what matters is if it would create a budget deficit more money going out than money coming in in taxes and therefore more debt and this sucks this selective scrutiny for Progressive spending I mean it creates doubt in a lot of people's minds about the
(02:31) viability of good projects like free health care and this doubt rarely ever gets resolved by the truth the truth being that the government can absolutely afford these programs more than a Ford the government has a long long list of good reasons to spend money like this and almost no reason not to as you'll see throughout this video these questions about government spending create a lot of Doubt though and keep us from embracing Progressive policies we believe in including me for a while social programs like free
(03:00) healthcare always sounded good to me but they also sounded expensive and for a long time constantly being told that the government spending so much already that the debt is in trillions of dollars made me believe we actively needed to give up on stuff like free health care and scale back our spending and in short no we don't and in Long that's what the rest of the video is for what I'd like to explain today is that government spending isn't a bad thing there's no debt your kids will have to
(03:29) pay back nor is it Reckless spending by well-intentioned but ultimately kind of careless bureaucrats we can afford to pay for social programs like Universal Health Care and Welfare and new infrastructure and High-Speed Rail and sustainable energy because government spending is a not funded by taxes so more government spending doesn't mean less money in your pocket and B there is no hard limit on government spending so long as the government spends money on something the real constraint on government spending isn't money that it
(03:58) has an unlimited Supply the constraint is physical resources it isn't more responsible to spend less because all that spending less means is not taking advantage of the resources at our disposal it wouldn't cause massive problems if we spent more because for a country like the US which has something called currency sovereignty increasing the national debt isn't the same thing as when you and I go into debt it isn't even really debt at all let me explain the federal government of the U.
(04:28) S has currency sovereignty it has a fiat currency meaning its currency isn't tied to anything like gold and IT issues debt mainly in said currency when the government spends more than at taxes this is called a deficit this deficit is a gap the government fills at the moment through debt and the US gets this debt by selling bonds this is easily the most confusing part of the video so bear with me for a second what are bonds well the private sector lends the US money and in return the US issues them an IOU a bond that the government
(05:03) promises to pay back with interest at a later date maybe 5 10 15 years later the government doesn't really need this money remember it can print more at any time because it has a fiat currency so this is less of an actual loan and more of a savings account for the private sector a risk-free asset that the government lets people mostly the wealthy store some of their money in but anyway these bonds are held by a lot of people including some foreign governments but the vast majority are held by Americans the government itself
(05:32) and the Federal Reserve which will often buy back bonds as a way to introduce more currency into the economy we call this debt but it's more like an accounting system for the government and a way for it to give some value to its currency by making sure people want to store their wealth in dollars instead of something else unlike you and me the government will always be able to pay this debt back to return the money on the ious it created because because it's issued everything in dollars which the government can
(05:59) produce in Unlimited Supply the government can never go bankrupt it's not waiting for more gold to come in or something the government debt is just the way the government monitors and holds on to a part of the money supply if that was a little Technical and complicated here's a more practical way to think about it governments spend first and tax later they create money and then they destroy some of it with taxes you already knew that we all know that governments create money without the government there would
(06:28) be no dollars because somebody needs to print them out or credit bank accounts with digital dollars and you and me we're just not allowed to do that but we often forget this fact when it comes to government spending we know that governments are responsible for money creation and yet most of our Lives we're told that the government gets a big pile of money through taxes and then spend some of it and that's how Federal budgeting works but that's not true they spend first by creating money and spending it somewhere
(06:56) and then they tax later according to how much they need to why are taxes part of this process well the government has a rule we all need to pay our taxes in dollars no one's allowed to do it in Bitcoin or elegantly crafted poems no matter how moving they may be so people need dollars for their taxes which the government gives them sometimes by buying bonds or more directly by funding new projects that money goes from one business to another and eventually ends up in your pocket as your paycheck and that way you can pay
(07:25) your taxes this process of creation and Taxation allows the government to fund projects generate demand and value for its currency and ultimately control the money supply in its economy now that you understand that things get a bit more complicated in practice the government doesn't create all the money itself it lets private Banks do most of it and it's mostly happy just kind of monitoring what's going on when a private business gets loans from a bank that bank isn't taking money from your savings and
(07:59) giving it to the business owner it's creating new money out of thin air and the government is cool with some private Banks doing this so long as they follow a couple rules and the economy works the way the government wants it to money is created out of thin air all the time instead of letting private Banks create new money more government spending is just the Federal Government funding things itself instead of private businesses taking out loans it's why when we say that the government could fund Universal Health Care
(08:26) infrastructure the green New Deal whatever it's true the same way private Banks could fund basically anything so long as the government doesn't call them a counterfeiter there are no Financial constraints when you can create and Destroy money at will so what's the limit well the only real constraint you have to consider is what economists call the real economy there's money and then there's the real economy the actual resources that this new money can be spent on in the case of Universal
(08:54) Health Care for example the government would be paying doctors and nurses salaries the salaries of the workers who make medical equipment pills and other Pharmaceuticals the hospital's electricity bills and all the other things that keep medical centers running the real constraints on what a government can do aren't coming from the budget remember the budget is infinite the constraints are the real world resources at its disposal when the government isn't spending on Health Care like this either the private sector will
(09:22) and profiteer or those resources will go unused this is the reason government spending doesn't break everything because when new money is created it's to do new stuff the money supply grows but so does the real economy which government spending mobilizes when the government funds a new Endeavor it's getting more use out of the resources available and therefore having more money floating around isn't a problem but I know you're thinking about inflation because we're often told that inflation happens when the government
(09:54) spends too much but that's not true either countries like Japan for example have some of the highest debt to GDP ratios in the world and still the country can't get out of deflation more government spending does not automatically lead to inflation or hyperinflation all it really takes for inflation to happen is for enough businesses to start raising their prices your grocery store might raise their prices if they're a market leader for example and you will feel the pain of inflation without the government having changed the money
(10:25) supply at all businesses that can't change their prices like this either because they're in a more competitive market or can't move their prices as fast we'll simply lose profits and might even go under we tend to think of inflation as everything getting more expensive and having more money in the economy seems like it would cause that but if everything did get more expensive at once inflation wouldn't be a problem if everything suddenly got more expensive your salary would automatically go up
(10:51) too it's because things move asymmetrically in the real world that inflation is so devastating and all it takes is a few businesses leveraging their Market position for it to happen if anything government spending on something like Universal Health Care might even be deflationary in all likelihood it would lower the prices of health insurance and your prescriptions by cutting out the profits for the middlemen of the private insurance world I'll say it again government spending has nothing to do with inflation and in
(11:20) the real world almost all cases of hyperinflation didn't happen because of more money printing but as the result of productive capacity collapsing or an over Reliance on foreign currency not government spending taken altogether this is why the government has this kind of Liberty to spend this framework of understanding money creation and destruction generally referred to as modern monetary Theory or mmt is why more spending and even more debt is fine so long as the government finds something to spend money on it can
(11:52) do it it already does this anytime the Pentagon comes running for more money or during the pandemic when the FED injected five trillion dollars into the economy the problem with government spending is profit in a capitalist economy the prime directive that private business owners are operating under is profit making the more the government finances directly which it can do without worrying about profit and only focusing on the real world outcomes the less private businesses can extract profit from that thing if the government
(12:21) spends on Health Care a private business can't and therefore won't get the opportunity to skim a little off the top business owners also don't like getting taxed this approach to government spending partly relies on the ability of governments to delete money business owners who accumulate money by paying their workers less than what they bring in for the company would very much like to keep that stolen wealth and don't care at all about public projects that benefit everybody so they Lobby governments and pay accountants to find
(12:48) ways to not pay taxes and store their wealth somewhere else even when they are taxed because these capitalists these business owners are in charge of setting prices and wages any taxation on businesses can often just be passed on to workers and consumers through price hikes wage Cuts extended hours lower benefits and on and on and these here are the limits of mmt and the point where a little Marxism comes in mmt accurately describes the power of the government to spend but it doesn't take into account the power of the capitalist
(13:19) class to be upset about it and in a class Society like ours that's a problem the government can't go bankrupt it can spend money on all sorts of cool stuff but when it does it has to get its permission slip signed by the ruling class first if anything it does gets in the way of profit the big chunk of money that only a few people get to keep it will only do it if there's fire in the streets and it doesn't have a choice the government can feed the Homeless Free People of debt fund renewable energy reduce working hours by law
(13:51) without cutting pay but these kinds of things suck for profit Seekers they're great for Humanity but they're terrible for capitalists the small percentage of humanity that benefits when people are forced to work and buy at an inflated price Universal Health Care is great it might even save businesses money but it makes workers less desperate and that small percentage of business owners has the power and the wealth to stop the kind of spending that would make people less desperate I'll summarize this video
(14:20) another way take away the need for profit take away the power of the ruling class in short take away capitalism and the only limit to doing cool stuff becomes the resources available we have the doctors for Universal Health Care the housing for free homes the Farms to feed everyone the machines for infrastructure the technology to switch away from fossil fuels we can spend on these resources and bring them into action let workers control the economy democratically and the new money we create can be spent well without the
(14:52) need to enrich the middleman we don't need to worry about how we're going to pay for that there are plenty of resources in our economy waiting to be used for the betterment of people's lives the only obstacle left is how much improving people's lives costs the capitalist ruling class okay I understand that this is a horribly complicated topic that probably doesn't make much sense at first in about 15 minutes I've tried to explain something that is in complete contradiction with how most of us are
(15:20) told government spending Works our entire lives so I'm sure this short video will have left you with more questions than answers to help I've left a few videos and books in the description to help you learn more about this topic specifically I want to highlight one dimes two fantastic videos on Taxation and government deficits they were my introduction to this topic and one dime was kind enough to enter an unreasonable amount of my questions to make the video you just watched accurate so please show them some love
(15:46) this is a really interesting and complex topic and funnily enough government spending is one thing that both wings of the American two-party corporate duopoly agree on so I just want to take a second and show you what that looks like with today's sponsor ground news here we have three examples of news coverage of the rise in American poverty one from the right one from the corporate center and one from what most Americans would consider the left notice how each article picks a convenient scapegoat for the right it's Joe Biden's fault for the
(16:15) left it's Joe manchin's fault and for the center it's thanks to kovid regardless of where these Outlets place the blame in each case their conclusion is that this is just how the system works and that government spending can't solve the problem of poverty or would even make it worse as we've seen in this video that's simply not the case the government can spend money on whatever it wants and the endless Pearl clutching about the deficit is just a convenient excuse not to improve things for the
(16:41) average person as with anything the key here is to recognize who benefits from this kind of of coverage and ground news goes a long way towards helping the reader understand what interests are funding each of these Outlets this is something I get asked about a lot how do I help parents or friends break out of their little propaganda bubble it's great to analyze rhetoric like this examining wording to look for bias and determining who's behind each outlet but that's a lot of work and none of us have
(17:05) time for that that's why I always recommend people check out ground news because it has a ton of really useful tools to make building media literacy skills a lot easier ground news is a web and mobile app that Aggregates over 50 000 news sources and offers intuitive easy to understand comparison tools so you can do things like what we did here see how a particular story is being spun by various interests you can also see the political leaning factuality rating and ownership of every single news source right in the app no tedious
(17:33) research required now full disclosure as a socialist I obviously disagree with the placement of some of these outlets for example I don't think CNN should be placed as far left as it is but honestly this might be a good thing when trying to educate your friends and family if you come at them with well actually CNN is a right wing Network they're not going to take you seriously ground news is the perfect first baby step towards media literacy if you're looking for a way to give your friends and family a
(17:59) great set of tools to understand media bias who it serves and how to spot it I highly recommend you check out ground news at the link below and if you really like it they're currently offering a 30 discount for their Vantage subscription to all second thought viewers you can only redeem the discount at ground.
