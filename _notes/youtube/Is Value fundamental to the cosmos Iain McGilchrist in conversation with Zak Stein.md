Is Value fundamental to the cosmos? Iain McGilchrist in conversation with Zak Stein
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vceeE4YYrI)

## Transcript:
welcome everyone to the second event
it's good to see you all
um I'm Jonathan rice and I'm chief
executive and co-founder of prospectiva
prospectiva is a publisher and we're
very proud to publish Ian's book this is
the second volume of the matter of
things matter with things here and
participating there's other things too
though we're a charity based in London
and our general emphasis is on sort of
trying to reimagine the world from first
principles giving people permission to
do that social and intellectual
permission and encouragement to rethink
the world and we see this as a sort of
necessary kind of work that we have to
do today
and that brings with it certain events
and we have an annual Festival we have a
European Network called emerge and we
have a methodology we call the
anti-debate and
um we're in the business of creating
some course material that we hope to
start sharing with you all soon
um so watch this space for further
developments on perspectiva and in the
chat maybe Michael can just share our
website if anyone's interested to know
um a little bit more about us
um
I wanted to say a few things before Zach
and Ian speak and then I'm going to
disappear in the
you know the the digital sense of no
longer being on your screen
um the first is to thank the tonight's
event is free and that's partly because
we were given a a grant to help bring
Ian's work to more public attention and
to inquire more deeply into the material
in the matter with things so I'm very
grateful to the inspiration incubator
particularly Nikki and Matt Nikki and
Max
um which has made it possible for these
events to be free and there are going to
be um there's already been one this is
the second
um there's going to be double figures
events we don't yet know if it's 10 or
12 or 15 but we're we're going to be in
that sort of magnitude of of events
because there's a lot to discuss in
Ian's book and because we want to do
something a little bit different
um in essence Ian's work sort of came to
public attention around 2011.
um some 13 or 12 or so years ago and
um
since then as Ian someone who's followed
his work closely
the wonderful thing is that it's coming
to public attention the big idea the
main idea the hemispheric hypothesis
and but that's been a good decade now a
good decade of questions clarifying what
exactly Ian means what's the difference
between the right and left hemisphere
how does it play out in the world and
there's still a place for that there's a
lot of a lot of people catching up with
the significance of that and how why
it's a world-changing Insight when you
when you understand properly what you're
seeing
but it's also true that Ian has moved
along and um deepened the inquiry and
and in a more specific way apply it is
understanding to particular areas
and they need greater attention on their
own terms so in this seminar series
there's a kind of presumption although
we will reiterate and you know restate
the argument as we go we're trying to
move Beyond let's say magilchrist 101
we're trying not to be simply this is
the main thesis can I can I ask you
again about that please we're trying to
assume a level of understanding and
engagement with the work that allows us
to move it on and when I say move it on
I mean move it on philosophically to
really understand more deeply what's
being said
um but I also mean moving on kind of
um in a more in a more quasi-applied or
proto-applied sense because there's a
lot of risk and rushing too quickly to
understand what might follow for means
work but there's also a need to begin to
figure out what it means for each of us
in our personal and professional and
even political lives
um and with that in mind the first event
was
um trying to frame the purpose of the
series as a whole and that was called
attention as a moral Act
um and I also introduced what I called
in the Gilchrist maneuver and there's a
little blog post about what the middle
Quest maneuver is I think and you can
that can be shared in the chat too
um
and that's a way of trying to get people
to orient towards how we begin to think
about the places where where Ian's work
makes sense in the public realm what
what value it might have for civil
society rethinking things and we're
continuing that tonight
and just so you know as a sort of a
little bit of a preamble we have future
events relating to sanity and
Imagination so we're trying to zoom in
on particular issues that are
um dealt with in great depth in Ian's
books
um but which are also of a sort of have
a degree of salience and relevance and
tangibility in the real world we don't
want to be in the simple business of
because Ian says X we should do y
because Ian would be the first to say
that's not how it is but we are
interested in the shift of perception
that arises from Ian's work and how that
begins to look in different contexts and
in different thematic areas and tonight
we're on a really big one
um values
value and this is one of the things I
want Ian and Zach to help clarify for us
because when I was I re-read by the way
if any of you are wondering about the
reading material for tonight or what to
read after tonight to sort of cover the
ground again chapter 26 and the second
volume of the matter with things is
particularly relevant to what you're
about to hear
and it's uh Ian will Ian and Zach will
go into it in more depth but it's a
philosophical take on where what value
is where it comes from why it matters
and the extent to which it can be
perceived directly
and the reason I think I wanted to
inquire into this question is because
values are you know mentioned everywhere
if you're working in a sort of Civil
Society space as I am
um everyone's speaking about trying to
work on values for campaigning there's a
values and Frames company that think
about messaging to try and get
particular values encoded in the
language you use
political strategy is full of tapping
into implicit values
in the commercial world the world of
commercial ethics if you order food from
for example waitrose in the UK you hear
that they have their chicken eggs and
milk come from farmers who share our
values right and then of course if
you're working in the business world or
the finance world you hear a lot about
the value proposition of something and
the bottom line being about shareholder
value
so this word value kind of permeates
society in lots of different ways but
it's used maybe without adequate
reflection to really understand what's
going on
um I'd like one of the things for Eden's
act to clarify is this sort of
distinction between values singular and
values plural I hope that will come up
at some point in the discussion and also
kind of what I sense as a kind of big
Transcendent sense of value almost value
is equivalent with Dao or God or
something like that and then a kind of
value that's something to do with truth
beauty and goodness and maybe love and
maybe meaning and purpose the kind of
fundamental values and then the sort of
derivative values like pleasure and
maybe integrity and things like that I'm
curious to understand the kind of
reverberations of those things and the
connections between them
with that said it's a great pleasure to
introduce both of our speakers now Ian I
think goes pretty much without saying
for the audience here
um he has inter-alia the author of The
Master and his Emissary and the matter
with things he's a well-known polymathic
scholar and um public speaker
um zakistan may be a little less known
but for those who do know him
um it's hugely exciting to give him a
chance to speak with Ian
um I have known Zach now for about four
to five years and we we went to the same
graduate school although my sense of
talking with Zach is always that I've
heard of the books that he's actually
read that's usually my feeling of
encountering Zach he's a very studious
very erudite fellow really engages very
deeply with all the material that he
touches so when he speaks he speaks with
a great deal of authority because it
comes from a lot of study and
consideration
um he is
um among many many other things
um one of the co-founders of the
civilization Research Institute he is
working on a lot of different books but
I happen to know as publisher that he
has a manuscript in preparation that
relates to metaphysics which is one of
the reasons I thought he was
particularly well placed to talk with
Ian tonight he's also a philosopher of
education and he's written several
essays for perspectiva
um which you can again we'll share with
you in the chat and due course
so I think that's all from me if I
haven't forgotten anything
um I think I hope I hope I've made sense
of a thank you to her being sponsors
um why we're having this series at all
why tonight's event matters most and why
are speakers are great and with that I
can disappear for 45 to 50 minutes and
let you enjoy Ian and Zach's company
I'll see you later on bye
thank you Jonathan thank you Jonathan
yeah
well
so it's a pleasure to to talk never
spoken before so it's kind of
interesting to have it first so publicly
um it it's great
you know Jonathan mentioned I'm working
on a book on metaphysics
um I have a training in cognitive
developmental psychology as a
neopiagetian and so what I encountered
it was actually like
that had that experience of someone
saying something that I almost
completely agreed with where there was
just this complete absorption of the
book and uh both all of it both volumes
and the and the prior work and
what was interesting to me was that in
my own experience and in the branches of
psychology that I explored and
philosophy that I explored value was a
given and so the skepticism and cynicism
about value that I encountered in
post-modernism and even some forms of
modernism
was actually kind of like I didn't
understand it
but I also encounter people who didn't
understand value as a given right
so when I got to the places in your work
where it was clear that there were
hemispheric dominance patterns that were
expressing themselves across these
different philosophical positions and
even in the personalities of the people
who are holding them
lights went off
um and uh so I'm just kind of thanking
you for for your work before I get into
it
um
thank you very very much I hope the
lights went on as well
um
yes anyway
no thank you very much and yes I look
forward to talking about these things
perhaps I should just begin unless
you've got a question lined up have you
got a question lined up
I had a I had a prompt
page
122. and this is the second volume this
is the chapter in value
uh you you say something and it's just a
simple sentence but it's very very
profound which is that you're placing
value as equally primordial with time
space matter and motion and
Consciousness yes so yes yes this is
when you think about what is the
universe what is reality
time space matter of ocean sure everyone
kind of buys that Consciousness you can
get people to do that placing value is
equally primordial to those elements of
Cosmos
is court of the work that I'm doing in
metaphysics at the center for into a
wisdom
Gaffney and Wilbur and it's core of the
work that I was doing as a psychologist
as a PSJA as a physician where he was in
part with moral judgment and kohlberg
what they were looking at was value
section was the ability of the organism
itself
to perceive the field of value kohlberg
was a moral realist he believed that yes
you equilibrated your moral judgment to
a moral reality the way you equilibrate
your socio excuse me your sensory motor
intelligence to gravity like gravity
exists so you operate on gravity as a
kid and you learn to you know work and
navigate space and time with your body
cold more space was saying and you do a
similar thing with moral reality with
the field of value you learn from it
it's not a it's a construction
um
and so I'm wondering if you could speak
to the philosophical lineage that has
always held that as true
um because my sense is that most humans
in most cultures with most philosophies
and worldviews and religions held this
as true it's only mostly recently in
modernity
that you follow position has been a
value cynicism or value skepticism and
so
I wonder if you could kind of underline
that point that yes value is

really primordial constitutive of
universe
yes well I believe it to be so I I felt
um that people would and I'm glad you
you have that reaction and think
goodness you've talked about all these
things that everyone agrees are
constitutive of the cosmos but now
you're talking about things like value
purpose and the sense of the Sacred
which are my last three chapters and I
left them to that point because I
thought that if people understood enough
about what I said earlier about the more
commonly accepted foundations of reality
they would probably see why I would
consider these things also as
foundational
I I talk I I talk the chapter is called
value not values as uh Jonathan pointed
out because
I'm not really talking in this chapter
about which particular everyday values
we might consider to be the more
important ones I think there is a
discussion to be had about values but
often values boils down to objectives
and that objective is often economic as
Jonathan pointed out
um and I don't think values are
objectives exactly
um an objective is something that in the
left hemisphere where you target you
find a line to go to it and achieve it
whereas what I'm talking about is
something that is I believe
impossible to do without I mean it's not
an invention it is something that is
there in the ground of uh being we don't
I think a very important starting point
is I don't
believe that we invent values and paint
them on to reality in order to cheer
ourselves up but that we actually
discover values they are there for the
discovery we either respond to them or
we don't and
um perhaps that would take us too far
from this discussion which hasn't even
got going on value yet but but I I do
argue that the purpose of life the
reason the cosmos brings into being
something quite so counter-intuitive as
life
with all its problems is that it is the
ability to bring forth in that Cosmos
something that can respond to these
primordial values so I I think I start
by by saying something like so
Consciousness is not what life brings
because I've suggested in a previous
chapter that Consciousness is everywhere
in the universe and that's becoming not
not an unusual point of view it's of
course Very widely been accepted for
thousands of years particularly in the
East but it's now being
um accepted much more in the mainstream
of analytic uh anglo-american philosophy
but the idea of value is
I think there are a number of aspects to
it really and perhaps if I just say
something about what I take it that we
generally believe and something about
what I am going to argue or what I do
argue there that would help there are
about half a dozen of them and one I've
mentioned which is this idea that we we
don't invent but Discover it
um and related to that is that it is not
um a cognitive derivation it is not
something that we look at life and then
we attach certain sorts of things and we
call those values but we have this
ability to be in touch with something
which is an ontological primitive and we
do it through what you've already
mentioned this concept of valueception
which I believe is a translation from
the German of Max shailer who invented a
a word in German which didn't until he
made it up exists which is
perception but vert name on which is
value and Sovereign
which is a perfectly straightforward
German word for perception but the link
with perception is interesting because
when we perceive things we don't
we don't take in a piece of data
passively we're not like receptive
plates that absorb data and then do a
calculation on it and have a response we
immediately
as it were
get a get an idea of what it is that
we're we're
um
we're dealing with here and in fact we
go to meet it which is another
interesting idea so it's disclosed in
a precognitive take on the Gestalt of
what we are seeing it's not calculated
and this is particularly important when
it comes to
um my understanding of morality itself
of goodness
it's now been for a long time normal
within the mainstream of Western academe
to consider that
um anyone who espouses another view of
morality the utilitarianism must be
making a fundamental mistake but
utilitarianism is exactly the kind of
morality that is made simply out of
making a calculation of what results
from it and that perhaps brings sharply
into Focus what I'm talking about it's
not about a result it's not about a
calculation towards a a known goal it is
a something that evokes in us a
reverberative relationship so it calls
to us and it calls to us from in front
so it is in that sense rather like
um a final cause rather than efficient
cause most of our thinking is to do with
an efficient cause which is what pushes
us from behind the thing that makes us
do something in the way that one would
make a machine do something I know you
know all this act but I'm just saying it
for everyone's benefit whereas a final
cause is a is a a cause that that brings
you to do something because you have a
relationship with it it's not a
self-generated concept but it is another
and that's very important part of what
I'm saying and there were just a couple
of things more to say and then I'll hand
back to you and one is that this makes
it something that is not determined but
is free we can choose
to respond or not and we can choose what
we believe actually fulfills each of
these values so I mentioned that there
are goals or objectives or targets or or
things we like to do and which ones we
decide are beautiful good or true is
another conversation an important one
but I'm talking here about the very fact
of the being Beauty goodness and Truth
at all
and and the last point I'd like to make
is that the utilitarian
um thinking which is in fact the value
of the left hemisphere that of utility
um means that values are designed to
make us do something that is
evolutionarily beneficial so beauty is
just a way of making us choose the right
mate or whatever
um truth is uh the idea of Truth is just
something that's made up by a powerful
hierarchy to Dragoon people into
following it
um you know and perhaps goodness is in
the same league now what I'm saying is
that truly understood properly
understood these values are fulfilled
in being responded to in themselves not
for any further purpose beyond that so
if I leave it at that as a sort of
laying out my stool you can now
um pick it apart
no I think it's like I said I agree with
so much of what you're saying and
it's one of the things that I think
clarifies the nature of value as you're
trying to express it as a as a basic
property of the cosmos
uh something I write about
in this in this work that Jonathan was
speaking to it is that it pre-exists the
human right because if you're if you're
a post-modernist you take value as a
social construction then there's
basically nothing
in terms of human emerges and then we
create value systems and we use them to
oppress people or whatever you do with
that but the take here is that actually
no
life emerged to respond to Value which
pre-existed it so I think of Whitehead
Whitehead spoke of the a petition of the
cosmos that the cosmos had an appetite
that it wanted something that had moved
towards
something and so that the evolutionary
process responds to Value makes it
teleological
um it also means that there's a
dimension in biological evolution
uh that is responding to the same field
of real value that we are responding to
um and that's I think again a position
that humans have believed before like I
think of natural law theory it's not a
great instance of it but natural law is
a case of that and I think of religious
systems where
The Ordering of the cosmos you
participated in it as a micro as a
microcosm so that there was this
continuity of value across life and
human and divine
um so it's interesting that the power of
the left hemisphere to reify a worldview
that is
so much a minority position respective
to most of human thought
it is one of the things that strikes me
because again there's something about
socialization or early childhood
education or the nature of the things
that get the left hemispheric dominance
put in place there's a type of person
that hasn't been domesticated to that by
the educational system it's not clear
why that occurs and for them arguments
about value that's what I'm making here
seem actually they they like them it
makes you feel good you feel like you're
at home in the universe like that the
things you care about actually matter to
the universe and then there's another
personality type let me say which is
deeply skeptical cynical of that view in
fact anything that would make you feel
at home in the universe is probably
proof that it's not science right
anything that would make you feel
comfortable thinking about uh
the emergence of human value from
biological evolution would be odd so so
I guess I'm and that's a yeah please no
I'm just kind of prompted no no that
that's a that's of course um a case of
petite open keep you isn't it I mean it
it seems like it must be wrong because
science starts from the standpoint that
of course all this has to be viewed as
objectively alien to us right and so it
discovers that it is curiously enough
alien you know after after much looking
for things that it has ruled out from
the start like purpose and real values
it it finds that they these things can't
exist or if you hold that they do exist
you can't be being scientific well I
mean I've tried to argue from science
and philosophy for these very Concepts
themselves
yeah yeah and and it's there you can see
it in the science if you read it from a
different angle essential uh can I
mention Darwin because people will you
know we're talking about Evolution you
you raise biology and one of the things
that I love about Darwin apart from
anything else is that he was motivated
in his study by Beauty and that in his
earlier writings beauty is already
um a Beauty or beautiful occurs on one
in six of of his pages but in his final
writings it occurs in on average every
other page he uses the term beauty or
beautiful he's constantly referring to
it and twice he puzzles over it because
he says it's all very well to say that
birds choose a mate because they find
them beautiful and and that of course in
itself suggests that it doesn't just
arise with us
with us humans but
um
the existence of beauty itself remains a
mystery I mean what that that
observation addresses is given the
existence of beauty how can it be made
useful to Evolution but it doesn't
answer the question how does Beauty come
about and what does it lie in right yeah
it's interesting Darwin also writes a
lot about love and I bet they co-occur
with beauty it does this Dynamic of
allurement and attraction in the animal
kingdom not as much but yes yes yeah and
the the plenitude of nature in the
creation of beautiful things because
it's not just that the bird could fall
to the other bird it also appears
beautiful to us which sins yes it seems
extravagant like why would it be that
the human nervous system responds so
immediately to completely
these things
yeah this is a point I made I mean that
why is it that the the things that birds
and animals find beautiful we also find
beautiful even though they have no and
no irrelevant I mean the fact that a
bird has certain colors doesn't or a
plant it in fact a um a plant that is
poisonous may be very beautiful so it's
not a matter of you know being
evolutionally beneficial it just is
beautiful and another thing is trees the
shape of trees the shapes of trees are
intrinsically beautiful to humans that
have been commented on since time
immemorial but there's nothing about the
shape of a tree that can in any sense be
attractive from them
um propagation of the species point of
view okay they need insects but don't
tell me insects are going around going
that Elm is just Exquisite
why would my nervous system evolve to be
appreciative of the beauty of the trade
and indeed indeed and it certainly is
and so that notion of
kind of like moving the utilitarian
calculus down into evolutionary
explanation and therefore believing that
that's here like my whole body and mind
evolved for this very narrative function
is in fact incorrect that if value
exists and life responds to Value then
his reason to be that we optimized
actually biologically neurologically for
love beauty right a whole host
of values that we actually have the
ability to respond to and so value
section this gets to a question
value section is like a skill
like values can be trained and when you
think of exactly an aesthetic perception
I had training exactly it was a music it
was a music actually where I
I so desperately wanted to have certain
albums in my possession and so like they
expose myself to such a beautiful thing
specifically Jazz and Indian classical
music
whereas why when I take a working job at
a coffee shop specifically to get money
just to buy these things
so the intrinsic value of the and the
appreciation so this question of yeah
how do you build value section why is it
that our students at our schools for
example seem to inhibit it that the
culture seems to actually create the
opposite where things that happen yes
where things that haven't even perceived
as having value is one way of even
describing the commodity form itself
um that you you yes you perform a trick
uh yes yes yes the exchange value
overriding the actual use value as it
were so yeah how do we get a better
value session
yes it's a very interesting question
because
like so many things it's not black and
white in that
value sections can only exist once it's
been trained
but it's also true that it can be
trained but it is intrinsic so I think
children without any in instruction find
certain things beautiful and and certain
animals for example are beautiful
um and they also find some ugly and this
is an important point to make because
something that might be said is well you
know you find all these beautiful things
in nature just because we're trained at
whatever is natural is beautiful
absolutely not
um although most of nature managers
remain extremely beautiful there are
certainly lots of things in nature that
are just plain ugly and in the book I'm
afraid I I I I draw attention to the
rather
um unattractive features the shoe build
stalk I seem to remember
I mean there it is it's an Italian
natural bird creation but it's um it's
not a very attractive one I think to
most people so I think they're intrinsic
and also goodness I mean goodness is
over honestly culturally determined to a
point but this can be exaggerated I mean
there are very few cultures in the world
where
um it's considered good to murder and
rape and in fact Beauty too is firm or
um culturally Universal than is made out
by people who want to impress on us that
it's simply made up
um most eastern peoples Chinese and
Japanese for example find no problem
whatever in enjoying the works of art in
the western works of art in our museums
coming to the place of Shakespeare we
find no problem at all in going to in
the beauty of their art and their
culture so and interestingly
um it's also true that things can be
found that
quite specifically mean things that are
intrinsic so for example certain
intervals and shapes and melodies in an
Indian rug
can be understood by um Norwegians who
know nothing about Indian music if
they're asked to say what is it that
this is expressing they are remarkably
similar to what an Indian listener
trained would say that was being
expressed so I mean that's a
scientifically verified
um uh result so I think it's it's it's
like so many things that you can have a
basic
um understanding of something but what
we can do is help it to flourish and
grow in beneficial directions and this
is a little bit like anything that grows
a plant a plant can grow and will grow
anyway but a gardener can actually make
make plants Thrive more and can make
them grow to another shape or to another
size or to another color so there is a
way in which whatever it is there can be
trained by us but that doesn't mean mean
that it's made up by us I believe that
Greta is right when he says that
everything properly considered and
appreciated by us calls out in US The
Faculty with which we can appreciate it
and so for example you talked about
music and and I imagine your experience
is the same as mine that when one starts
learning to love music one loves certain
things that when perhaps still loves but
one can't necessarily immediately
respond to other things as one learns
more and more The Faculty enough to
appreciate them great and the deepening
of value one way to think about human
development
the human development is just then
maturation if you will is this deepening
of appreciation of more and more value
and and it's not it's not the making up
more things to care about it's the
getting deeper in touch with reality
it's actually deepening to this field of
value which and again from a human
development perspective it it does seem
that it's a it's a disposition that is
deeply rooted values
um and that a lot of what occurs is just
the absence of support
for that yes skill and things that
counteract it which is to say anti-value
so like preference like preference
falsification is the root of advertising
and advertising exists
of uses our environment so there's a
intentional thing in our culture to
actually disrupt the ability to truly
perceive
um value so it's it's a thing that we
need to solution think about like how do
we protect ourselves from being confused
and then sit and appreciate uh how does
that actually work
um even just the ability to hold
attention for a long period of time
is necessary for certain levels of
appreciation of value and Beauty right
so which is another another reason why
my attention is a moral act as we have
called this series which is a phrase
that I think I use in both um the master
and his Emissary and the management
things yeah yeah so I'm so I'm right
there so but it the implication also
another implication accountable question
is
so therefore
if we really downgrade value section
like let's say about the value collapses
at the center of culture which is which
is you could say is occurring that
we're we've kind of burnt off the fumes
of pre-modernity and we're running out
of a center of value
and even the ability to then perceive
value
um
that's very dangerous like if part of
what evolution has been is adapting us
to perceive and relate to value
if we cut up that ability then we become
evolutionarily non-adaptive which means
we go extinct so another place though
this work that I'm doing is the
relationship between value and
existential risk right and
civilizational qualities which is that
the patterns you're pointing to
are actually deep generator functions of
existential risk if you will let me drop
into that vocabulary I'm saying like the
inability
the simplification of problem to narrow
metric right the best characterization
of a complex thing as a complicated
thing that could be fixed but actually
you can't even exactly all those
characteristics are things that are
leading us to a point in Civilization
that is treacherous yes yes so there's
an urgency I see it as an educational
urgency to figure out how to to
rebalance the hemisphere and that's why
I'm focusing on value exceptions what
can we actually do
ourselves to perceive what's actually
valuable again because we're clearly
very confused about with value if we've
been brought to a place where our
civilization is about to self-destruct
and AI is a great example the core of
the AI is the alignment problem which is
a values alignment problem
so that's me kind of saying Help Us save
civilization Ian
how do we learn to perceive value again
so that we know
um
yes I can't remember who it is but you
can probably tell me in Silicon Valley
who said that yes the the way AI is
going will probably render us extinct
but would be very good for the economy
in the meantime and uh that perhaps sums
up the left hemisphere's approach to
these things
um it only understands power control
utility and as a sort of subset of that
pleasure which is assumed to be what
these things give although by the way
they don't
um people who who have as much power as
you can conceivably imagine are
um lead unhappy anxious lives but there
we are
I can tell you for free as a
psychiatrist but
um yes what what how do we how do we get
back on course well partly of course you
won't be surprised to hear me say that
even below the fixing of values is this
business of the hemisphere balance
because you mentioned that the idea of a
complicated machine that can be fixed
versus a complex system which is the
difference being that a complex system
is intrinsically indeterminate it is
intrinsically free it is intrinsically
not controllable it is intrinsically
um able to move in a way that we can't
actually program so that is
that is a kind of slap in the face to
the those who hold this left hemisphere
view that we can make ourselves
all-powerful and for me the most heinous
thing that has happened in the last 200
years or perhaps even since the
enlightenment is this belief that we can
control everything that we have power
and if only we could have humility
enough to understand how little we know
how little we really understand what
we're dealing with
and how helpless we will be in the face
of things that we are now is setting
loose and then if it might not be too
late to do something about it so
re-gaining some sense of humility and
awe before what it is we're seeing
respect for these things not the the the
the the whole idea that we make them all
up of course is is a version of this
idea that
we are the creators of everything we see
we are the creators of all that we
experience excuse me we are not we are
the the
receivers we are the the the the the the
the Grateful or should be great for
recipients of some enormous gift that we
only partly understand and we have a
responsibility
to respond to that that's of course at
the root of responsibility is this idea
you have to respond to something and
that that something is calling to us to
behave in a different way
so
obviously
one of the things I would say is that we
need to open up the minds of those who
are both now in control and will control
our futures to the idea of we don't
understand this we don't know what it is
but let us find the good in it the
beautiful in it and what is true about
it because at the moment I don't think
there's ever been a a period since
recorded time that I know of when truth
has been so profoundly travestied and
with the development of AI it's going to
be almost impossible for education for
the law for politics to function if we
don't know whether something is a video
clip that is made up by a computer
showing a politician saying things he
never said you know if when we get to
that and how do we know that the
children or the young people we're we're
teaching have really understood anything
if they can generate an s say that will
satisfy an examiner and it's it's going
to negate all the things on which a
civilization is built and what a
civilization is for is to guarantee that
we are better at seeing the Beautiful
the good and the true which to me are
with the sacred which goes above it is
is the most important
important um value of all yeah I mean
this is the one of the central risks
that people don't see in terms of
catastrophic risk is that the true
collapse of culture and Truth at this in
value because what occurs there is uh is
basically an I can still Bonita Rose
Thunder but basically it's a
schizophrenic break at the level of
culture where the entire culture gets
out of touch with
value
um and uh AI is the thing that could
perpetrate that right
um I wondered though about the
relationship between depression and the
hemispheres and traumatic experience in
the hemisphere so part of me is like
okay you think you can control the world
and you kind of can pretend you can for
a while until it it slaps you in the
face and something occurs that forces
your identity to reorient because I'm
thinking like what is the actual human
development process when someone
actually
reorients their basic hemispheric
dominance pattern and maybe that's too
simple a way to think but I wonder if
you know at various points in history
where we seem to step in
uh and speak from you know the master
uh more times sometimes after very hard
lessons were learned
um and so I'm wondering if one of the
things that will reawaken the perception
of value is actually the occurrence of
catastrophe and tragedy
um yes I think that's right and I
wouldn't concentrate myself in terms of
depression trauma in the hemispheres
um because that's just too complicated I
mean I think there's something in it
um and you know that I devote a whole
chapter in the matter with things to
showing what
the correspondences are between a left
hemisphere dominated picture of the
world and the right hemisphere deficient
picture of the world and that of the
subject was schizophrenia so that is
very much like left hemisphere overdrive
and it's been commented before I drew
these parallels by people like Louise
fast that something seems to be
happening to our culture which is rather
like what happens in schizophrenia and
of course schizophrenia is a very
distressing condition which often does
lead individually to Suicide I believe
that we are actually pursuing our own
suicide very rapidly at the moment we're
disemboweling our culture and destroying
all the good in it we are disemboweling
and destroying the Beauty and the the
Vibrance of Nature and we've turned our
backs on the sacred and the Divine and
said that these are just childish
fantasies whereas they're probably the
most important realities that they're
not easy to find for us now so I don't
disrespect somebody who can't find them
and can't see what is meant by them and
indeed I think that the talk about them
is quite problematic and no doubt I'll
talk to someone else in another session
about that but nevertheless I think
these values are hugely important and we
are losing them it might be worth just
mentioning because I think it's
something
um helpful to me I found
um which is shayla's Pyramid of values
I'm talking here not about
um Schiller but Shayla Max Shayla
s-c-h-e-l-e-r who was an early
um 20th century German phenomenological
philosopher
um said by Heidegger to be the brightest
philosopher in Europe of his generation
and he he wrote about values in a way
that Heidegger himself didn't Nord
actually did 15 to the same extent
although in culture and value I find he
he writes beautifully about these things
but in any case Max Shayla had a pyramid
of values a hierarchy and at the bottom
were those of use
um I.E utility and pleasure and then
somewhat above that were
um what he called the labens theater the
values of
of life and he meant by these things
like um generosity and courage and
magnanimity and loyalty and then above
that came effectively what he called the
geisigaberta meaning either the
intellectual or the spiritual
values which are I believe Beauty
goodness and truth principally and other
values that you might mention are
effectively derivative from either
Beauty goodness or truth that we we
value them because we think they are
either good or we think they're
beautiful
um or we think they're true and then on
the top of this pyramid was the sacred
and what I suggest is that in our own
time we have inverted this pyramid so
that the left hemispheres value is at
the top the that of utility and the
other ones are said to be simply in
service utility that is the vision of
the materialist reductionists who until
recently have held the floor in the
universities that thank goodness is
changing there is a a wonderful move of
foot I see in philosophy I see in
biology and the people see that these
this very simplistic mechanistic vision
is is is gone it's it's over it it just
doesn't go work
thank you for all that that was
intriguing I'd been saying for some time
that we were dealing with basically a
suicidal culture that was running an
overdrive down into those patterns so
reflect us from getting too much into
that but your enumeration there of the
hierarchy of values gets into Jonathan's
point about
uh
uh you know values versus value and is
there some structure to the organization
of first principles and first values
like the core of the work that I'm doing
at the French wisdom is that enumerating
first principles and first values from a
perspective of continuity with Evolution
itself so that there are some values
which are periphery
which occur locally and then there are
other values which are so core that we
can actually say that we share them with
like animals and then we share them
perhaps
cells right
um that you know the value pre-exists us
then there's a continuity of value that
we participate in and so things like uh
Harmony right like is expressed very
early in physics where you either get
someone or do not work
um and if you think about multicellular
organisms or complex organisms a lot of
what's occurring there is complex
systems of Interest harmonious things
humans start to use speech they start to
try to name values and you get something
like justice or fairness that's a
continuation of this dimension of yes
so that's some of the thing we're doing
there yeah what emerges is that there's
a a paucity of language of evaluation in
our culture
so this is Charles Taylor makes he talks
about languages of strong evaluation
being the core of the culture together
um and that means a language of shared
value we talk about a
a universal grammar of value is absent
yes we kind of have a grammar to talk
about mathematics and science and all
these other things but when we get
together and we try to have a
conversation about value our tongues are
tied
uh and especially if we move down our
own culture so there's this needless
to create some new languages of value I
think how much do you think that um
depends on the level at which one is
talking about value and I've sort of set
up a kind of
an idea of certain values such as Beauty
goodness and truth and it would almost
make no sense to say
um up up to a point
about these things
um we just do think beauty is good we do
think goodness is good we do think the
truth is good it's almost a tautology
but if you start talking about the
values that we hold as a society and one
may go back to the call of the French
Revolution
and these sound like a very good start
but immediately one friends oneself and
this is where one might get tongue-tied
and there might be conflicts is but what
exactly do we mean by these things and
in what context and how much and for
whom so Liberty is on the face of it
highly desirable and I certainly
wouldn't
um admire a culture in which there was
no Liberty but obviously utterly
unchamel of Liberty and restraints and
constraints
within reason are very important and we
as a mature Society is able to balance
those things and and you know it's it's
true of egality and fraternity you know
what exactly does one mean by them are
they always necessarily good in all
contexts or do we have to finesse them
and I think that's
um that's that's what I would think is
the difficulty about the values
themselves
perhaps the only way in which one can
resurrect a good sense of values is in
fact by looking at societies that have
been stable for a long time and produced
that Harmony that you thank you for
mentioning that because I think it's
terribly important and it's not only a
very important idea in physics but also
as you point out in biology and also of
course it was foundational in Greek
um right thinking you know from from
um Pythagoras onwards that's one of
those things you can see like it's a
it's a yes and you can hear it it's one
of the problems yeah so it's just it's a
remarkable and suffuses I remember this
quote by Whitehead again everybody says
you know the circle haunts the universe
like a ghost and what he was talking
about was just the presence of
universals amongst the fluffs right and
so harmless Harmony Harmony kind of
haunts Evolution at all stages and we
yearn for it like in our in our
societies we want Harmony and uh
and so addressing that and what how many
points out is it's all in relations it's
not Unison it's relations between things
but beautiful and generous relations
that work together to produce only good
and beautiful sound so you know and you
we talk about other
um species and humans and one and you
talked about how Harmony seems to be
very much a kind of human conception I
think you you hinted that at any rate I
hope I'm not
um miscroaching you but but it is I want
to say true that you know birds sing but
in essence they sing competitively but
only humans can sing in harmony and
attune their voices to one another so
this is I mean
there's so much that one can regret
about Humanity but the trouble with this
is that it leads to a kind of
disparagement of everything that
Humanity can be and we need to preserve
the ideal of what a human being and a
human life in a human society
um can be what its meaning is at the
same time as being highly critical of
many of the things that it's now
interpreted as involving and this comes
down to my basic point and the reason I
wrote the matter with things is that we
no longer understand what a human being
is what the world is and what we're
hearing it for and that's very
unfortunate that's very unfortunate I
believe in the in the Master's Emissary
you cited that
research that the vocal cords were more
developed before the language centers so
the very first humans communicated
mostly through song basically that there
was this kind of hidden state where
there was this harmonic vocalization uh
of somewhat Sapient you know bipedal
creatures who were basically singing
together before they were speaking and
that the function of language the
function of language to be denotative
and descriptive is
piggybacked on the use of the vocal
cords for basically Harmony yes yes
well you know I mean this is this is um
I I have to rely here quite a lot on
anthropologists and but there is a
prominent School of anthropologists who
certainly believe this Stephen Maiden
being one of the most best known
exponents of it but um what I think is
nice is that there is very good
um
um if you like paleo and anatomical
reason for believing that this is the
case and from the examination of animals
their ability to vocalize and so on the
nature of their skulls and their rib
cages too much to explain now but it's
in
um in the master in his chemistry but
what I love about it is that it inverts
this assumption that um all of course
all the business is done with language
and music is just some frivolous
exception of language but actually it
turns out that the science is on the
side that music comes first and that
language is a useful acceptation of
Music exactly that's the idea and uh
where we've been staffers at about uh to
intervene Jonathan no no it's just that
I'm part of my um hopelessly a tech
world as a grandfather clock
so yeah I'm ready I'm ready
it's a very deep point about what
Society ought to be like in things that
in fact now that's
summons us to heaven or to Hell sorry
it's a very pivotal moment in the
conversation now huh
so the point is both that uh
we misunderstand theoretically the
function of language thinking that its
primary function is denotative and
descriptive when in fact there's a
deeper function which is the resonance
it allows for between us
um it's interesting like as a someone
who's done some clinical work when you
listen to someone speak You're often not
listening to what they say you're
listening to the tone and tenor and
anxiety or absence of anxiety and the
porosity and the pace of their speech
and all the musical tones basically not
the content and in fact the mismatch
between content and that underlying
musicality is a sign to pay attention to
so it's just interesting to think that
in fact we something as basic as
language we're not we're miss the
hemispheres are allowing us to
misunderstand suddenly and that yeah
harmonies suffuses uh this organism and
it is resonates with it
any other chanting and the music
and then the notion that in the human
the value of Harmony becomes aware of
itself and so we actually arrange and
this is the kind of an interesting note
that runs through a couple of places in
the matter with things that there's a
something that occurs with the human as
an evolutionary emergent where a value
and Consciousness become aware of
himself for the ways that they were not
previously and this is a big thing I
think that's a really important point
and it goes back to my idea which I
think is absolutely constant with my
understanding of Whitehead which is that
whatever we mean by God the creative
Force logos
whatever it may be and that is bringing
the cosmos into being and the cosmos is
bringing it further into being so that
each is unfolding and discovering more
of its potential in this Dynamic
relationship it's not a story of a
static something that just is or of two
static some things but of
um a two-fold relationship in which
something is ever more coming into being
that seems to be at the center of
creation and if there's one one thing
one can say about the cosmos is that it
is creative in this way that is one of
the primary values if you like of the
cosmos is simply to make things happen
to differentiate out of an enormously
um potential unit Unity
all that that potential means when it's
unfolded and then to refold it again
into a now enriched Unity which then
carries on this process it's an
alternation and of course this is very
much in keeping with David bones
um idea of um the implicit order of the
explicit order and then being reinfolded
into the implicit yeah we speak of
evolving evolving value or evolving
Eternal value yes yes
is that yes to think about it and uh
in the kabbalistic tradition there's a
saying that there's more God to come
which is basically I I didn't know that
if you if you can give me the reference
to that because I'm very keen on the
Kabbalah and I've never heard that but I
argue of course that the Cabana actually
sees that um you know that whatever is
the ground of being ends off is actually
coming into being yeah no that's the
root of this work because it's the
collaboration with the rabbi Gaffney and
Ken Wilbur are both esotericists
command of the capitalistic literature
you know and and it's part of the
through line of the matter with things
is the line back through shelling
uh you know yes through Boheme to the
Renaissance basically Christian yeah
um and another physics is implicit there
which is of this is the where God
invests in the cosmos the ability to
basically further the Divine to create
new God and so as something like Harmony
Falls or beauty involves
um you know the intensification of the
value evolves forever and we
participated in self-aware
so it's a it's a kind of we either
participate in it or fail to do so and
that is the tragedy that at the moment
we're failing to do so right exactly
yeah
yeah thank you Zach and Ian if you I
mean I I'm aware that you guys can talk
for hours further and uh I hope you will
at some point and I'm very glad you've
met and I I feel very validated by the
decision to bring you together and I
hope it's the first of many
conversations because I'm aware that
you're
um you share depths
um and common interests that are uh
are are sometimes esoteric and are
sometimes extremely difficult but of
fundamental importance and um you know
you're both first principles thinkers in
a way that the world currently needs so
I'm very grateful to to have you here
and bring you together but I'm also
conscious we have 330 odd people
um some of whom are Keen to ask you
things
um I will before I'll ask you something
myself first but just to allow the
audience to sort of warm up
I am Keen as a point of principle in
these sessions that we try and ask a
question about what's just been spoken
of
um not to revert back to the go Chris
101 as I say
um of course uh you may have been you
may have more fundamental queries but it
would be good because we've just shared
something together that we that we focus
on what we've heard
um with that in mind I am feeling
significantly clearer about my sort of
quam inquiry earlier vis-a-vis the
mapping of
the relationship between value values
and and so on
um but I'm also curious about something
that is sort of Point related to that
and it came up last in the last session
too
for all the bashing of the left
hemisphere and I know you you're quite
famous for saying that the left
hemisphere is your second favorite
hemisphere
um and that it's you know it's one to be
loved and cherished and it shouldn't be
you know knocked down I I I feel this
work that I feel responsible for and the
perspective is engaged in
of working with first principles
thinkers like yourselves
trying to make sense of what they're
really saying philosophically about the
nature of reality and our capacity to
know it maybe love it and relate to it
there is a certain
um dignified beautiful role for the left
hemisphere in taking a few moments as
Emissary just to get clear about what
exactly the master is saying right
absolutely right and that's why when I
occasionally feel almost guilty like
when I part of me has a kind of weird
socio-epistemic guilt about trying to
map these things mentally in a kind of
cartography because I feel shouldn't I
just be presencing shouldn't I just be
with this shouldn't I be playing some
music or doing some art here instead I'm
trying to sort of craft out with these
words in a bubble chart how they link
together and I think no surely it's not
that nonetheless what I was trying to
get at Ian is that you you mentioned
sheller's hierarchy or or rather
structure thereof of the Sacred giving
rise to sort of fundamental truth beauty
and goodness
and then you mentioned of this more
derivative values
um
and that's useful but what I what I was
left wondering is if value is primordial
and pre-human
and in some sense something that life is
for for us to be in relationship with as
you argue in the book
you go on to have a chapter on the
sacred but help me out here with the
distinction not between values plural
and the sacred but values singular and
the sacred how can we make a distinction
between them that's useful to make sense
of what's being said here
first of all I should just comment that
Shayla doesn't imply that
um the sacred gives rise to the next
lower line of the pyramid and so on down
to utility and he simply says that there
is a hierarchy of values and that
um some are simply more
um important than others they are more
Central if you like to the business of
leading a fulfilled human life
um
what I would say in my altitude also
touches on what you've just said about
the importance of the left hemisphere
that it's good that it should
um as it were questioned and and try and
make clearer to itself what it is that
the master is talking about but it has
to do so knowing that at the end of the
day whatever it can come up with falls
short of whatever it is the master is
saying so the process is useful in that
things come out of it but at the end of
the day it's not going to have an
equivalent map and say ah I've got the
Master's message now and it's all this
because that would automatically be
wrong so having said that and what I
think we can see is that
the sacred is something that is dark
um it's
the mystics talk about it as a kind of
visible Darkness a a light that's so
bright that in fact it for us it is
invisible or impenetrable or unknowable
now if that is the case what happens is
that when it passes through a prism
we can then perhaps begin to see it it
it it the light is somehow softened
filtered and the prism through which
that light of the sacred
comes is the one that generates
in my view Beauty goodness and truth
that these are manifestations of it that
the creation can respond to and that are
its principle lures that are calling to
us to to to to go to it
does that help
I mean it's beautiful before I can
decide whether it has utility in the
sense of helping
um so already I'm feeling the feeling
the right sort of
relative importance of things
um it does help and I don't it doesn't
need to be pristine there was a moment I
I shared this with Zach prior to the
call
um many of you will know uh George
lackov and his work on sort of the
representation of
um Concepts being embodied and sort of
often often grounded in metaphors of the
body so you know an idea is big an idea
is big for example or
um you can
um you know you can play with Notions of
of something being a long shot you know
and there's these sort of Expressions
which get at the idea that the way the
Mind organizes itself conceptually is
through these spatial metaphors and I
find myself having a moment reading your
chapter 26 where I was going okay so
you've got this value that's sort of
primordial and pre-human and fundamental
and then you have love which comes up
when you speak about the relationship
between love and then you have meaning
and you have purpose and not just any
old purpose but cosmological
teleological purpose

um and I'm trying my mind to actually
see this in space
so I had this moment of sort of you know
um whatever that's called edectic
imagery or whatever that word is for the
sort of thing in your mind and I was
trying to sort of right trying to
picture that in my mind and I suddenly
realized how absurd the whole thing was
in the sense that
couldn't possibly capture it because it
somehow was as you see
always going to be an inadequate
representation of what was actually
being described
and it was very useful it was all it was
it was a sort of micro spiritual
experience of sorts because there was a
definitely a sense of
these fundamental features of the
universe love truth beauty goodness
value the sacred meaning purpose there's
a lot of them right it's a family
um and and you've said before and the
reviews maneuver just as the one as many
the many as one so it's not true that
they're all the same there and there's
one sense the same in another sense
they're not and when you try and hold
that in your mind
and actually see how they map together
as if it was some kind of flow chart the
only answer is a kind of laughter
because it doesn't really work and it's
a Liberation in some ways that it
doesn't work and yet there's still a
part of me that's a little bit uneasy
um and I'm curious if anyone else feels
that way
well and if that Zachary Ian has
anything to comment before other people
come in I'll start looking at people's
questions now while you're answering
that okay but I I'd just like to respond
since
well it's your point is is aimed at what
I've been saying I suppose
um
I I I agree with that that idea that
there seem to be a family of these
things but another way of looking at it
is
um that I didn't put
love in as a value
because I think love is the grounding
the nature of being whatever
and the sacred is our sense of
that ground of being
and you could say that that ground of
being and call it God whatever one wants
to call it but the ultimate
essence of of the creation of the of the
cosmos
is itself purposeful that it in general
it generates automatically not as an
extra thing not as a sort of
subsequently now I'm going to have a
purpose but it is purposive love is
purposive it is ultimately
aimed towards
something that it's it's directed it is
relational automatically but I wouldn't
again make relation another
um separate thing the trouble is that
we're so
um in hot to things and I almost called
this book there are no things because it
isn't a thing truth and beauty and
goodness but what we're really trying to
add and braid is the nature of this
loving core that is in itself true that
is in itself beautiful what it does is
automatically good although that is
something that theologians could dispute
is it good because God automatically
goes there or or does God go there
because it's good you know and so forth
but what I'm really saying in brief is
that these are different unfoldings of a
single element the multiplicity is the
many strands that do nothing to
um in any way imperil the Integrity of
the whole but in fact enhance it okay
the closest the closest thing would be
like a field
right so we speak of a field that
there's a unified field of value but
it's not featureless yes basic
properties I feel to be arrows we talk
about arrows so we talk about erotic
humanism in which arrows is the
foundation
field root of value but then all of
these values differentiate out but some
have existed since the Big Bang
uh and others are more or more recent
um but yeah they're not things and
therefore when you flow chart them and
even when you try to sequence them in a
strict way you can't
um uh the left hemisphere will do that
at lower moral stages of development but
maturity as deepening into value
perceptions sees inevitable value
conflict and again it's not a harmonious
picture in its totality Whitehead speaks
about the intensification of polarities
not about everything getting better but
about the intensification of the
polarities and dynamics of values all
co-evolving in tension right
uh erotic kind of like basically
self-disclosure
um so erotic self-disclosure okay
um I I I'm very grateful yeah yeah the
questions the questions are very good um
and we'll come to them very quickly
moving swiftly along so
um I'm conscious that we may not get
through all of them but we're going to
try and get to the best ones at least
I'm also conscious that for many who are
of a philosophical mindset
um some of this discussion will have
been delicious and um exactly the kind
of their staple diet I feel like but for
others from a more practical mindset
perhaps less philosophically
um you know Adept it can seem a little
abstract so I have a really good
question here which is principally for
Zach actually although I'm sure email
have thoughts on it and because I happen
to know that Zach has written a great
deal about propaganda and thought about
it at length and written about it on the
consilience project website
and we're in a time of intense
propaganda Zach the question here is
from Kevin kotwas if I've said that
correctly and he just says can you talk
about the weaponization of value in
propaganda
and uh I'm sure Ian has thoughts too but
if you could begin
yeah I mean
a few things to say there one and I
mentioned already that preference
falsification being the foundation of
advertising just Claire for what you
mean by that because I didn't quite get
it it's falsification has been you think
you value something but you actually
don't truly value it you've kind of been
tricked into valuing it
sometimes through coercion sometimes
through uh tricks of psychology so so
it's like preference falsification is
the goal of psychology excuse me of
advertising advertising was one of the
main places where Psychology was
operationalized after World War II
coming out of large-scale propaganda
programs that were built during the Cold
War
um and so you're looking at a science of
persuasive communication and if
everything we're saying is true about
the intrinsic nature of value and the
way the human nervous system responds to
Value then if I'm trying to get you to
do something and I'm a psychologist and
I know that then the first thing I do is
manipulate your value systems and your
value preferences
um so without even speaking about
propaganda just staying on Advertising
um we can see that
the saturation of that kind of
persuasive to the point of being
coercive style of communication
is one of the things that has undermined
our ability to perceive actual value
right so that's the idea is that if
you're if you're succeeding as an
Advertiser you're not just getting them
to Value what you want them to Value
like Coca-Cola
right like why did we drink Coca-Cola
right it's actually bad for you
but people really want to drink
Coca-Cola the main reason you want to
drink Coca-Cola is because of
advertising and they're incredibly
they've been doing it for decades now
they're very good at it it's very subtle
so they're making you want something
making you perceived valuable that's not
actually valuable just to play devil's
advocate for Coca-Cola here I feel like
I'm on the BBC or something trying to be
impartial I mean all over that goes but
I was going to say it's not just
caffeine and sugar don't I just want the
caffeine and sugar and some some some
sweeteners
yes but that's Again part of the
falsification of a value what you want
is to feel good right uh what you
actually want is to feel good uh and the
falsification of value goes right down
into your actual body and limbic system
and so like when so when we send our
boys over there with World War II
um they were not in a position to really
know geopolitically what was going on
they were in a position to have been
told what was going on right and they
fought for their country with love with
full flux of value
um as a result of propaganda and again
propaganda
is very complex to discuss because
there's a thin line between propaganda
and education and it becomes the evil
twin of education is propaganda both of
them piggyback on value section both of
them the employee strategies of getting
you to Value something that's what I was
going to ask you Zach that's why your
question to Ian earlier about how one
begins to cultivate refine develop the
capacity for Value section is culturally
critical almost a matter of
civilizational survival and it doesn't
just apply sort of in the classroom but
you it also applies more in the front
line of culture
influencing our everyday activity and
then because values
our values
um they are also explicitly thematized
reflectively by propagandists so like
the culture wars
are a result of both sides trying to
create conflict around value and values
so to get that one of the things that
makes it hard to talk about values is
that they've been subject to
in the United States to a kind of
internal informational Civil War where
just like in the 30 Years War the
different visions of Heaven and Hell and
other things were used by propagandists
to get the Protestants and the Catholics
to really fear and hate one another
similarly now digital propaganda is
working us into a frenzy mostly along
these value fault lines which are
identified and then cleaved and like
salt is thrown on the wound and they're
they're trying to make this value kind
of like as polarized
and difficult as possible
um there's tons to say but because I
know you have yeah you have no lack of
things to say on propaganda and for
those who are interested if you go to
the concilians project there is I
believe three very considered early
essays on propaganda that Zach's written
there
um maybe Michael if you can put that in
the chat if you can find it but it is
there
um Ian any thoughts on propaganda before
we come on to other things yeah I think
I think um Zach covered it perfectly and
I I agree with him horizontally and I I
thought the point about education and
propaganda being evil twins and
sometimes being confused with one
another particularly important at the
moment right I agree um this is quite a
more refined sort of philosophical
question but a pretty important one
because I've fallen into this trap
myself
it's by Andrew M Davies or Davis sorry
um much of this conversation has bounced
between aesthetic and moral value
a lot of bouncing Whitehead makes the
claim that moral order is merely certain
aspects of aesthetic order
here a static order is wider and deeper
than moral value how do you understand
or here's the question how do you
understand the relationship between
aesthetic and moral order is one more
ontologically primitive than the other
so it's an A plus for the question there
Andrew what's the answer is acne and you
want to go first
yes okay
um it's a good question and it's one
that I do
um tackle a bit in in at least in in
this chapter I think
um
beauty is is a difficult one because you
know I I'm I'm a great admirer of Keats
but he did die when he was 26 and he was
a poet
um he wasn't on oath as a philosopher as
it were when he said that beauty is true
truth beauty this is all you know and
all you need to know
um
if it were as simple as that we wouldn't
have two quite distinct terms and the
question I wouldn't have used them
um nor would Whitehead have thought that
these words were worth preserving
because I can think of things that are
beautiful and definitely not good and I
can think of things that are good that
are definitely not beautiful unless you
I mean it's always open to somebody to
sew twist the meaning of a word that it
will now Encompass but in the way we
normally use them they're different
um so it causes caused me more trouble
than anything to be able to deal with
these and it's interesting that whereas
moral values seem much more distinctly
carved up between the right and left
hemispheres as David Hester UCL says
um
the um the right hemisphere basically
deals in in good and and the left in in
what is morally bad I mean
that that that's that's his words
um or a paraphrase of them and and um so
it's it's much easier whereas with the
with the master of beauty both
hemispheres do get involved with it and
do contribute to it although if you go
into the niceties of it I it would take
us too too long and too far I don't
agree in short
um with Whitehead on this particular
Point
um uh Andrew uh announced that I'm a
great white headian
um but on this one I just can't really
agree with it because it seems to me
that in a way we Value Beauty because
ultimately it is good but we don't value
God ultimately because it's beautiful I
I that's the way I see it maybe that's a
product of my
um modern Western European education and
a degree of protestantism in the
background that I've overlaid heavily
with other strands but I I don't know
that's my take on him what do you say is
that
I mean I'm not sure either but I think
about just the big three the good the
true and the Beautiful having been
differentiated for quite a long time
uh so there's something to the value of
that differentiation that in modernity
they became disassociated
and you know you had science rudging
running hegemonic over the over the good
and the true
um but I also think of Kant and the
structure of the three critiques right
and then at the end the Kant basically
is saying that you know it reduces down
to this very complex form of aesthetic
judgment
um which is which is more than just the
Judgment of beauty it's also the ability
to perceive the teleological to
basically the perceived value per se
would be my reading of the third
critique in which case
there is something that is neither of
those three that's more deep so if I
think about the sacred I think sometimes
that's just an intensification of all
three at once and that there's something
like a deeper field of adornment or Eros
that is primary to the emergence of even
the differentiation of those three and
there's a story that
um Weber tells and habermas tells about
the differentiation of those value
spheres after their pre-modern synthesis
that there was a time when they were
merged in the idea of the Sacred
that slowly they were differentiated out
um talks about the linguistification of
the Sacred and the differentiation out
of those three and then eventually the
asymmetry that emerged with
the unbounded rationality of modernity
so that's me not really answering the
question but talking about what I know
about the question
um
but I could just quickly um come back
for a couple of things
um the first is that your um invocation
of shows perfectly what I mean by
what one can achieve by redefining what
one means by Beauty and because if you
call this aesthetic then you are
enlarging the meaning beyond what most
people normally use it to mean in order
you know like Humpty Dumpty you're
allowed to do that but then have you
really achieved anything by applying
this particular term to it
um and the the other is just to say that
I think your illumination that the
sacred is all the realities combined
it's just perfect because this is what I
was saying about the light being
differentiated through colored glass
um but when the the colors are separated
one doesn't call red blue you know but
nonetheless in the light they are
together right
um I'm it's it um it occurs to me Zach
um and I know Ian you know Daniel
schmackenberger as well a little bit but
Daniel has said in a couple of his talks
I've heard him say I don't know whether
he still holds to this philosophically
but it's a very elegant line he says I
wouldn't really care about goodness and
truth if it wasn't through beauty that
was his way of putting it it was
something about the charm and sort of
um intuitive elegance and attraction of
beauty was sort of primary that it sort
of Drew you and you know this is how I
understand his claim there was something
about beauty that that was the prior
motivation to to look at goodness and
truth I'm not saying it's right I'm not
saying it's exactly how he means it but
for what it's worth He said it and I
find it quite quite an elegant
a proposition or provocation to to think
about but Ian you've already answered
adequately why that might not be the
whole story and likewise that yes
um I want to get to some other questions
and I can see we still have let's see
quite a few more Michael do you want to
take a shot
um and ask it yourself
Jonathan thanks for that um
yeah so I guess my question stems from
the fact that I feel
this view that is being put forth here
that value is ontologically fundamental
if that was to take hold more broadly in
society and culture I feel it could be
very very powerful like a very very
powerful view to transform our way of
relating to life
um and I guess and you know before I ask
this question I'm aware that it might be
my left hemisphere grasping after
certainty but I'm wondering and this is
really for both of you Zach and Ian
How likely is it do you think that in
time the the evidence for this will
become more and more compelling like do
you see the the new scientific findings
um will start to make a compelling case
for the fact that that we can actually
quite convincingly say no value is
ontologically fundamental
um Zach you mentioned about how we see
maybe
um in biology
values that seem to be
um existence existent out with any need
for human beings to exist
um so I'm kind of thinking in those
terms
um
yeah I'll leave it at that
and I have something to say first and
then then you've said yeah sure go ahead
um
well as I always say prediction is is a
Fool's game but I don't think that
science will ever answer this question
or shed a great deal of light on it it's
a philosophical question of a kind that
science is not really a crypto answer I
would say
and you know that's no disrespect to
science but there are certain places
science won't take as profitably
I think though that it may become more
Vivid to us when the over sophisticated
over technical over
scientistic way of conceiving ourselves
has been blown away
by a collapse
um some kind of
cataclysm that will lead to suffering
and here I
go back to something that I think Zach
um was I I think getting at when he
talks about or hinted at the idea that
suffering might actually
enable us to see certain things that
that otherwise we wouldn't and I do
think that in a paradoxical way but then
you know that I profoundly Believe In
The Coincidence of opposites that the um
the way in which
things will get better is actually by
getting worse that in doing that uh our
vision will become clearer our responses
will become more natural and we will see
what matters and that that which matters
to us and which will enable us to
survive will to be to be able to trust
people and to achieve something which
really exemplifies goodness truth and
beauty and you might say but in
circumstances of dereliction would
Beauty matter and in the book I
emphasize that the earliest human
artifacts that we know about are are
beautiful and seem as
um what was he called the chap who did a
hundred the history of the world in 100
objects suddenly forgotten his name Neil
um the the director of the British
museum For Heaven's Sake what was he
called
well anyway uh you surely know about the
history of the world in 100 objects
anyway no yeah yeah yeah but not the
author
no no okay I mean he's very well known
but his name's suddenly gone but um
anyway he he said that one of the things
that he noticed was that when we first
started making things the simplest you
know hand axes we required them to be
beautiful as much as we require them to
be of utility
right yeah and I quote a
consultation on a school in Mexico where
the parents in a very poor area were
going to be gifted with the school and
they were asked what above all they
would value in that school and the first
thing they said was that they wanted it
to be beautiful
yeah I mean the return to value at the
core of culture
is inevitable if culture is to survive
that's one almost
uh like a a symptom of the state of our
civilization is the degree to which we
are removing value from the center of
culture and
what's interesting is that uh the native
disposition of the human is to respond
to Value still
so we haven't been completely
dehumanized yet and there's evidence to
show that like during natural disasters
and when other things occur people
spontaneous
spontaneously do heroic things that
spontaneously collaborate that the
number of people who go completely
sociopathic is actually much smaller
than you'd think that our spontaneous
action under complete adrenal overload
is basically respond to immediate value
and save that baby and get this person
water and just do what needs to be done
it's a fallback position of the human
nervous system that's evolved to respond
to Basic Value so
um green and Paxton have also
demonstrated much to that surprise that
the default position for us is to be
honest and that lying is actually
stressful and difficult not that we are
naturally deceitful and so I think these
things are really important that you you
just said sorry
few minutes left and I I'm I've been
brought to task and quite rightly for
the gendering balance and the questions
and it was entirely because I hadn't
seen askable questions
um but I believe there's one from Claire
I can't see you clear very easily on the
screen but if you're there please uh let
it be known to us with a hand up and
that will make it easier to find us have
find you I know what your question was
roughly but it would be better if you
can ask it in your own voice and it's
early morning here and it's in
Wellington New Zealand
um
thank you no it just sparked my
attention was that
um when you were saying I I'm I'm a PhD
student and I'm I'm I'm dealing
um with these topics and
um I've very much focused on the idea
that con you know of the paradigm shift
to make Consciousness fundamental to
matter
um and you know matter of secondary and
Consciousness is primary I'm looking at
that issue
um and then you said that value is
fundamental and I thought well how many
things can be fundamental and if value
and Consciousness are both fundamental
um what's the relationship between the
two of them and are the other
um qualities that uh can be defined as
fundamental
good question and perhaps I could just
have a quick stab at that
um
I myself hold that Consciousness is an
ontological primitive and that matter is
an aspect of Consciousness
um
but it seems to me that
Consciousness is intrinsically
relational
that
um Consciousness is always Consciousness
towards or consciousness of something
else and therefore immediately comes
into the question the nature of this
relationship and if it if there is a
relationship
um and maybe everyone would say that it
is intrinsic and and here I'm not
multiplying entities but just saying
these are other facets that one can talk
about about love love is intrinsically
relational it is intrinsically beautiful
it is intrinsically good this is
intrinsically true when it is a true
love so the the these things are I mean
we get tied up in in linguistic knots
but it's not that there are a whole
cupboard full of entities and we come
back to my point that there's a problem
when we rarify things whereas all we're
really alluding to is different
qualities of this Primal whatever it is
that would be my answer
Zach thank you Zach it's a very deep
question
um as I alluded to before you know I
would take Consciousness matter time
space motion value
as
differentiations from an underlying
field which I would characterize
probably as being a field of value if I
had to pick one of them
uh which is interesting that again the
basic root of the cosmos is like a
desire like an appetition like a wanting
to be hmm
and uh
so and then once you get after those the
question of is there some more
fundamental set is one of the things
that we've been working on a limited set
of first principles and first values
that would characterize Cosmic Evolution
basically from the beginning which we
can either choose to self-consciously
align with these first principles and
values of the cosmos or not and this is
the view of cosmographic humanism as
we're articulating it recently
so I'm not clear how to I don't know
it's kind of above my philosophical pay
grade to make the final decision about
about those fundamental categories but I
but I do think like if I that the list
that Ian gave where you add
Consciousness and value to matter time
space and motion that's a very important
basic list and the addition of value is
just one of the most important
philosophical moves that's that can be
made in in our culture today because
people kind of buy consciousness
uh they're kind of even physicists are
willing to buy Consciousness but the
idea that the Universe matters and has a
purpose and that the Universe responds
to value is intrinsically valuable is a
little bit like that so the addition is
just so critical I believe
um it puts the press on it puts the
Press on the the hardcore left view
reductionist view it puts them into a
corner okay thank you Zach um is that a
good enough response to the question yes
I will ponder that but the the only
thing is I was thinking is that meta
time space of all three-dimensional
activities or qualities and I'm just you
know I I always thought things like
Consciousness value uh Beyond maybe
three dimensions
so that's again a deep question Ian I've
had the same similar experience while
shifting between these things and the
second volume yes that there's a there
are different kinds of things going on
that are all fundamental
yes you were asking a very deep question
and I made attempt to answer it very
briefly will probably not be
satisfactory but
um what I would what I would say at the
moment is this that
um
I believe that matter is a phase of
Consciousness that it could be
considered secondary to Consciousness or
could just be a way in which
Consciousness can manifest under certain
circumstances it's reason for doing so
is to provide two things that
Consciousness can't which is a degree of
permanence and a degree of resistance
and the degree of resistance and
permanence of related to one another and
why resistance is important to Creation
would take me a long time but it's a
teammate deal with in the book and once
you've got Mata and it it cannot
um we we cannot talk about anything
material at all or imagine it without
the need for time and space so when
people tell me that by some mathematical
um jiggery pokery they find equations in
which time disappears I would say well
you've just cut the Rogue from under
science and indeed philosophical
discourse because without the existence
of time we can't say anything know
anything and we can't rely on anything
that we empirically experiment with and
and so we we get into knots because of
the limitations of uh language but
alsoever our Consciousness we're limited
beings let's enjoy it and let's
celebrate it and but what we have is
glorious and it's up to us to you know
respond well to what we've been given
thank you Ian it's a great thought to
end on being limited beings time is one
of our limitations
um and we we were trying presbyter
trying to be disciplined about our
100-minute events 100 100 minute moments
we're thinking of calling them we're
still working on it internally
um but um really glad that you've all
shared this one with us and
um there will be further events coming
up
um we will have one in two weeks like I
say we're not quite certain who the
mystery guest is but it's one of two
people we're currently clarifying that
in the next couple of days that will
become clear
um and this will carry on for several
weeks
um we the event is free and prospectiva
is a charity but if you've enjoyed this
event and you want to support our work
please go to our website and there is a
donate button there if you feel like
giving additionally to allow us to carry
on doing this kind of event carry on
publishing this kind of work
um and all that really remains for me to
say really is a very deep heartfelt
thank you to Ian mcgilchrist and Zachary
Stein thank you very much both of you
thank you to David and thank you for
those who put questions in the chat if
it could be saved and sent to me later
I'd like to see them because I'm very
interested in new light on what I'm
trying to um illuminate myself
yes and yes thanks a lot for the
questions I will hopefully see most of
you again soon and um
I think over and out
but thanks a lot take care and see you
again soon thanks everyone very good
