(00:03) it's not the whole story because the matter doesn't satisfy the Schrodinger equation and then there's gravity which is described by Einstein's theory of general relativity and that theory doesn't know anything about Quantum properties it means that it is not only that the future is open but but the past is not fix now that doesn't mean string theory is right it just means it's the only game in town Computing suggests that we can go below this level of the particle universe and tap directly into the CPU
(00:37) of the  universe let me backtrack a little bit when I was talking about quantum mechanics one of the problems is that the theory isn't really doesn't really make sense some people call it the best theory you've ever had in science maybe it is I don't think it is myself because it's mutually and it's consistent inconsistent with itself and this is because there's a an equation called the Schrodinger equation which tells you how the quantum State evolves and it's very deterministic like the pl and all these
(01:18) other people if you know what the state is now and you know what the things you put into the that is to say the matter or whatever it is you're talking about what's called the hamiltonian you feed that in then the shro equation gives you a deterministic Evolution if you know what the system is is now then in 15 minutes from now you would be able to tell what the system is however it's not the whole story because the matter doesn't satisfy the Schrodinger equation when the system is nice and small and uncluttered then it seems to
(01:51) when it gets too big in some technical sense which I could say more about but that's not everybody agrees on what that means when it gets too big in some sense then it doesn't follow the Shing equation Shing got very upset about this quite reasonably what it does is that the wave function that's what the sh is talking about how the wave function evolves and the wave function is describing the world according to the theory there is a thing called the collapse of the wave function so it doesn't follow the Shing
(02:20) equation and usually this is considered by when something or somebody makes a measurement now in the old days it was quite often thought of that measurement or an observation the word observation was often used that suggests that some being comes along and looks at the system and that's making an observation on the system and that's the point at which you collapse the wave function probabilities come out it's not a deterministic equation anymore and these thing it's a thing called the born rule
(02:51) which you have to adopt instead of the shring equation you change your mind and say okay let's use the born rule instead and this changing of the Mind used to be considered to be the effect of a conscious Observer coming and looking at the system looking in a sort of broad sense now my view is quite different from that it's almost the opposite I'm saying that there is something out there in the physical world which at the outset doesn't have anything at least not manifestly to do with Consciousness
(03:21) it's the way that the world operates and this happens to do with what happens when you try to combine quantum mechanics with that other great theory of 20th century physics Einstein's general theory of relativity now you see there's a good big school of thought which says oh well we haven't brought them together yet we need to quantize gravity we need to bring gravity Theory Einstein's curved space theory of gravitation you need to bring it within the scope of quantum mechanics and that's the idea quantum mechanics is
(03:53) supposed to be the the ultimate which you bring but which not without mentioning the theory is inconsistent with itself now my view is the opposite that to make it into a more powerful Theory which agrees more with the wave when it doesn't follow the shering equation what does it do that's when gravity becomes important and there are arguments one can bring to indicate this is quite plausible that when gravity becomes too important in your system then the state does not follow the shring equation and
(04:25) it starts to jump in the the way that the the born rule tells you you got probabilities you don't get a a deterministic Evolution now I I do believe that that's where we should aim for and that's where if you like creativity will come in because we don't have the theory yet so it needs creativity to go beyond current theories of physics to introduce some new ideas which are indicated you can see sort of aspects of the new scheme it must have this effect and this and this so you can see some things it's got to do but we
(04:58) don't have the theory now is that creativity well it's creativity if it's not acting within the scheme that we had previously then you've got to be creative because the theory we have previously doesn't give an answer here doesn't tell you what the collapse of the wave function is it just says you do it and it doesn't say when it just is is a very incomplete picture people like Einstein and shinger and D were a bit more polite than I am they say the theory is incomplete I'm saying
(05:28) the theory is actually self inconsistent so I'm a bit Ruder than they were but it needs something to be done and that's where a bit of creativity absolutely is necessary we know of four different fundamental forces in physics that the electromagnetic force that most of you have probably heard of then we have the strong and weak nuclear force and we have gravity and the problem is that three of those forces the electromagnetic and the two nuclear forces have Quantum properties so we have some particles like electrons and
(06:02) quarx and chons stuff like this and we know that they do funny things like they obey the uncertainty principle they can be in two places at the same time that kind of weird stuff and then there's gravity which is described by Einstein's theory of general relativity and that theory doesn't know anything about Quantum properties and this brings up the question if I have a particle like an electron that can be two places at the same time and it has a mass and that mass generates the gravitational Pole
(06:36) where does the gravitational pole go you'd expect that to also go to two places at the same time but Einstein's theory can't make that work because it doesn't know anything about Quantum properties so this leaves us in this weird position where we just don't know what the gravitational pole of an electron is so it's a it's a really simple question like what's going on with the gravitational field of the this electron and we don't know and um if you ask like more technically uh what's the
(07:08) matter it's just that those two theories the quantum field theories that we used to describe particles uh like the electron and a couple of other particles um Einstein's theory of general relativity they're just mathematically incompatible if we just put them together it doesn't work but nature knows how it works so there's got to be a solution to this uh and we don't know what it is there have been many people have tried to solve this problem what we need is a theory of quantum gravity so a theory that gives
(07:46) properties to gravity at least that's the way that it's normally put but more generally we need some way to resolve this discrepancy between the two theories and the probably best known approach to this is string theory that most of you will have heard of there are other ideas like uh loop quantum gravity and then there are less well known ones like maybe as ASM totically safe uh gravity and stuff like this but so far we don't know if any of those is correct uh or how we can even test them and yes
(08:21) I think it's a really big problem now when it comes to my personal opinion on what to do as I just said like people have worked on this problem for a long time it's been known since the 1930s or something so it's definitely not a new thing and there are lots of smart people have spent their whole life trying to fix something that they think is wrong with gravity and I have a lot of respect for all those people and if they couldn't make it work I'm pretty sure I can't make it work either so this is why
(08:51) I think it's a better strategy to try and figure out if not there's something wrong with the quantum side of things of the problems may be caused by us not understanding what quantization means in the first place I generally think it's not good to um put our bets on one thing so um I I'm really supportive of spending some time on modify gravity and that different approaches to that kind of thing uh spending some time on the idea of trying to replace gravity or explain it at something emergent or
(09:25) induced gravity this is similar but related idea or maybe just saying maybe the for is with uh the quantum side of things which is what what I uh personally work on okay so there we have three different approaches to this that you're outlining is the modified gravity as one way to go there's this emergent picture of trying to reframe the idea of gravity to begin with and then you have quantum gravity so to the three de uh Debaters here if you had to place your bets Priya on either of these you say agnostic but if
(10:00) you had to put some if I gave you some chips now you had to put them down on the so what are the what's the third option so I think modifying gravity just with a view to adding um additional degrees of freedom but stay within the same framework where other cracks are opening up is clearly not that's not where I would put my bet but not little tweaks to the theory but push it so that the cracks to try to make sense of all these crises so the modifying gravity so far has been really focused on the Dark
(10:34) Matter problem so new and I think been pointed out new zoos of particles right alternative particles I think that is an that's an approach that has been tried a lot of energy has been spent and I think it's it's it's been useful it's taught us more but that's not where I would put my bet on the kind of uh pushing the theory that I'm talking about is actually trying to see these crises you know going Beyond just having a different kind of dark matter particle I think that's where things are pushing us
(11:06) fundamentally look at the nature of dark energy and what we think dark energy is for example and then fundamentally looking at whether these conceptual ideas of dark matter and dark energy can somehow be I mean could they be two manifestations of the same thing I mean you know I think those kinds of ideas are totally worth exploring and I think they should be and not as much attention is being being paid to them we've been uh spending too much uh so I would not bet on the modifying gravity and I said with the quantum um with the quantum
(11:38) theory of gravity I think that there's just like vast bits of things that we don't understand so as a pragmatist I would stick to sort of my view of uh really pushing the theory of general relativity with the view of finding a replacement theory for it and I firmly believe that we will see new directions but Saina this approach to modify gravity which has been uh which has come to the for a lot in the last 5 to 10 years it's really um gained a lot of uh interest and a lot of research uh in the field I know you have also
(12:15) engaged a lot with that field do you see it as priia is suggesting here more that it's limited kind of tinkering with the existing model or do you think that there's a real promise and a kind of a breakthrough with understanding modified gravity well as you say I've actually worked on modified gravity for a couple of years and uh I used to think it's really promising it's going to solve all the all these problems and I don't work on it anymore because it turned out it doesn't work quite as well as I thought
(12:44) it would it's like from a theoretical side it's really really difficult to make those theories work and you know I'm of two minds about this on the one hand they do have some really appealing properties where you can explain certain types of correlations that we observe like as a matter of fact we can explain them very easily but on the theoretical side they don't seem to work properly so and this I I think I I'm afraid I actually agree with you it just makes me feel like we're missing something really
(13:19) big like there's something fundamentally wrong with this type of theory because they don't work with the mathematics doesn't work the way that we expect it to work especially light deflection I think one of the big you know I was open-minded like um sa I dabbled a little less uh because you know I'm invested in light detection uh gravitational lensing those theories are unable to provide a description and we see these lenses we see these arcs Hubble Space Telescope has shown us these arcs right so well there are there
(13:52) are models which can explain that kind of thing but then they have other problems so it's like you're pushing around the bump under the carpet you know it always comes up somewhere so Eric where would you place your chips well someone said I mean don't modify gravity but try to understand it and I think that's my Approach is I want to understand gravity and then find answers and maybe I should mention it here more more clearly there has been a lot of progress made in our field in understanding gravity that comes from
(14:23) String Theory we have a theory that explains Gravity microscopically the only drawback is that it's not yet in a universe that looks like our own it's namely one where there's no dark energy that makes things a lot simpler so the step that we need to make as theories eventually is to develop this theory that we understand very well but in a context where there is dark energy and there I feel that we can indeed understand gravity to the level where we can do computations and make descriptions that clarify these these
(14:57) observation not by modifying it but really understanding what gravity is to make clear so I think it's it's starting from quantum mechanics and then deriving gravity again and maybe I should mention that I mean Newton had a theory of gravity Einstein didn't modify exactly the equation of Newton he had a much better much deeper understanding so the the because he he combined it with space and time and everything curvature of space and time a totally New Perspective and I think our next theory of gravity will again not be
(15:34) a modification of the the laws of nton or or the Einstein equations no it will be a totally New Perspective that will be given on what gravity  is the debate is not only between scientists and historians or philosophers the debate is within theoretical physics yes special relativity even general relativity has been proven in all kinds of experiments but the collision between quantum mechanics and special and general relativity is just is being as sharper and sharper every day and physics today theoretical
(16:17) physics today is still within a great controversy between these two great clash between these two theories so here you have experiments in quantum mechanics which tell you that if two particles are being measured at the same time at different places something although not information is going between them faster than the speed of flight at infinite velocity it's not information but there is something this is something which goes against special relativity even general relativity there is a problem here but there it's much
(16:50) worse so many in uh um experiments in quantum mechanics tells you that when you make a measurement you don't affect the particle in the sense that its future moments are being affected you affect it also backwards which means something really crazy it means that it is not only that the future is open but but the past is not fixed at least at the quantum level we have papers on that we have experiments which have been proved recently I I believe I showed such a paper I presented such a paper in a conference which you were present so
(17:25) we are at the verge of a huge Revolution which is at the magnitude of Relativity and quantum mechanics at the beginning of the 20th century there is something very important about scientist being humans as Kima says but the Schism is within theoretical physics itself so many paradoxes which tell you that this picture nice picture of four dimensions and all events being there is far from being the TRU let me just give one example and then then I'll finish a single Photon hits a a half silvered mirror you have two detectors here I
(17:59) made some money with this one of them is going to give you a click and the other is not going to give you a click nothing nothing nothing in physics can tell you my grand my scientific grandfather David bom who was the father of who was the adviser of Yakir aronov believed in some hidden variables there are no hidden variables so here are two events two possible events in the future which nothing in the present can tell you which of them will occur that tells you that the future in some very profound way does not exist not only for you and
(18:33) Kima and me in some profound way it does not exist and it is being built our world is being built our universe is adding an event after event in a way which is still a mystery to physics but there is a lot of physics in it you were interviewed on a podcast which the name of this podcast escapes me but someone showed you a video of Eric Weinstein who is criticizing not String Theory but string culture and you said hey we welcome criticism it's great it's just that you should put something forward constructively rather than just
(19:07) criticize and I believe the quote was put up or shut up and I want to know are you aware that Eric Weinstein has his own Theory so he has put up well so far all the theories that have been put up that are Rivals the string theory have failed uh they failed for basically three reasons first of all the theory has to incorporate all of Einstein's theory which they can which they can do second of all they have to accommodate the standard model and that's where a lot of these theories fail that means 36 quarks and antiquarks three generations
(19:45) of identical subatomic particles 20 free parameters that's the standard model only string theory has the richness to describe the standard model and third which is the real killer is that once you combine quantum mechanics with classical physics you get anomalies divergences things blow up in your face the only way we know to control these divergences is through super symmetry which is the symmetry of strings in other words string theory has no rival I repeat string theory has no rival other competing versions do not
(20:24) have the standard model or they diverge take a look for example at l quantum gravity which is a very interesting Theory I've looked at it Loop quantum gravity has a problem it has no electrons which means it has no matter which means it's a theory of pure space which means it's kind of useless it's a theory of pure space with no electrons no standard model none of that and that's why string theory is different String Theory can accommodate the standard model Carlo RI said that that you can't have Fons in Loop quantum
(21:01) gravity has only been true up until a few years ago and that if anyone has kept up with the research with in recent years they'd see that they were able to produce it and then also when it comes to string theory solving all of these problems but other theories having issues it's It's tricky to state that because there's also tens of thousands of people and plenty that go into String Theory whereas some other issues are just their in their Bud string theory in its Bud also had issues that plagued it
(21:27) and they were solved because of attention and Minds went into it so you have to somehow normalize or reweight these theories by how much mental energy went into them and if you do so it's not clear to me is string theory the winner I don't know my attitude is let a thousand flowers bloom let all of them bloom mature so that we can pit them against each other okay we're not going to hurt anyone's feelings these theories have no feelings so let them Clash and let's find out the limitations of these
(22:01) things Loop quantum gravity has a problem with firion the firmon loops are Divergent they blow up in your face the only way known to cancel these divergences is through super symmetry which is a symmetry of strings so in other words we're still back to Ground Zero that Loop point of gravity does not have a theory with firion that have finite results and so what I'm saying is something very simple you can read need alternative versions that claim to have the theory of everything fine but the acid test is to look for whether or not
(22:37) they can incorporate the standard model and whether or not they can control the divergences and anomalies and so far string theory is the only one which can do this now that doesn't mean string theory is right it just means it's the only game in town I wouldn't say that uh Quantum Computing is a hoax but it is an extremely bold proposal right it's it's uh the proposal that we can achieve something that nature hasn't done that we're able to build something that is Computing polom faster than any kind of
(23:10) classical process if you look at the computers that we are building today that we're using if you look at our brains at all the interactions that we can observe in nature they're all made of dynamics that we can describe as the interaction of particles or something equivalent and um Quantum computing suggest that we can go below this level of the particle universe and tap directly into the CPU of the universe and that the CPU of the universe is running much much faster than uh the particle dynamics that we are seeing and
(23:42) that we are made of right so it's an extremely bold proposal that is being made and it's so complex that relatively few people actually understand its implications and um in the past some of the people who saw the implications that there might be a possibility to basically bypass the particle Universe with some Arcane technology and build computers that are dramatically faster for some applications at least and this is an extremely bold statement and it consists of two parts one is we can build a non-local machine which has been
(24:12) built right you were involved in d-wave and uh the other one is hyper computation it's really makes is about building something that is able to compute faster than a classical computer and this might not be possible but or if it is uh possible it might still not imply that the church touring thesis uh the computer science statement that all computers have basically the same power just differ in memory that they have and processing speed this will probably not be broken right and there's the question
(24:42) does Quantum Computing make the claim that it breaks this it's Quantum Computing in part based on some faulty part of physics because the physicists have checked out the co C based from the mathematicians uh before gdle happened and before mathematics was forced to become constructive so maybe maybe there are some specifications in the mathematics that we use to describe quantum mechanics that lead give rise to hopes that we can build computers that cannot be built and to me it's very very exciting to observe these developments
(25:10) because there are open metaphysical questions to be answered and whether this is being built with respect to the Practical implications of funding a large amount of funding that was be made available as part of the stimulus packages during Co and so on and uh I found that when I talked to some of these companies that people in these companies did not actually understand how to build a quantum computer which was very frightening to me they did not understand the underlying physics they were hoping that we have this physicist
(25:37) our company who's going to figure this out for us but we are all building this amazing machine that's all going to make us rich if it ever works right so it's a lot like crypto and uh maybe this is enough as a start by 3 minutes over well I mean for some of the deep the theoretical Sciences such as physics for example this is has been the driving driving uh mechanism for a long time is this ideal of beauty that you refer to uh and this this idea that there should be an ultimate equation there should be
(26:10) something that could somehow unify all the different phenomena that we know uh and this is a very peculiar thing to to physics which is the only branch of science that I know that sort of submits the world to its own rational ideal in physics there's a long tradition for uh what can be called mathematical universalism this idea that mathematical language can uncover the truth the truth is out there to be discovered uh and that scientists have the ability to do so I think if you look at how uh the science has progressed this is clearly
(26:42) not how it's actually working but this ideal has somehow stuck with us that we can somehow uncover it so that would be my first sort of objection to this um to this way that we can find a single single true account uh rather than thinking of it as uh true or not true the different methods or the different theories and models can be useful in so far as they're convincing so the whole there's a battle going on all the time between scientists and people outside of Sciences to convince each other that their idea is the right
(27:17) one that is the that is the battle that's what a model can do you can try to outmaneuver somebody else by trying to convince them that a model is true or like has more hold or more sway but this ultimate idea of the one model that explains it all well in physics it's almost a century now looking for the single unifying Theory it's driving a lot of the discipline a lot of uh the research and the funding and uh everything within the science is attempting to find the single uh the single uh correct view uh
(27:52) but very clearly we're at a point now where very few people believe in that anymore that it is possible that is just uh uh the subject matter is too complex and overstretched to be able to find one true  account often the starting point for thinking about matter and what it's made of is um an equation you don't need to understand any of these equation suffice to say that it has in it every Elon interacting with every other electron every electron interacting with every ion in the material so you can tell if
(28:37) you have trillion trillions of electrons you have everyone interacting with every other one one can write down an equation but it's almost as complicated as literally writing down every single electron in the universe it's not something one can readily solve and even if one said maybe one has a super computer and maybe at some point it will be able to Crunch this equation and give you an answer even if one were to say that there's something else that happens that makes that very unlikely to give you the correct answer and that's
(29:12) something known as emergence so what is emergence it's also something you might have heard in other areas not just uh physics it essentially relates to Collective ensembles of objects collectively self assembling to form something very very different from the individual constituents um and you can think about um people in crowds so the collective behaves very differently from each individual member you can think about something like Consciousness it would be very far-fetched to think of Consciousness in terms of individual neurons in cutting
(29:51) up the brain and saying okay what are the individual elements that make it up and somehow I'm going to add them together and arrive at the functioning of the brain and Consciousness it's almost as absurd it is as absurd to think about materials that are all around us that are made up of trillion trillions of electrons and imagine that the collective self-organized processes that emerge from them which are as complex and as exotic as Consciousness to be in some way derivable from A reduced equation of individual electrons
(30:26) um and this is just an example of one of the very exotic forms of emergent phenomena which is superc conductivity so this is a superconducting material uh the the puck is a superconducting material and this is a string of magnets so essentially what you see happening here you can see this is levitation so superconducting materials have a couple of really interesting properties firstly they conduct electricity perfectly without any loss and this is a dramatic Quantum property and I'll show you an example in a bit
(31:03) and the second is that they levitate so if you put a magnet on top of a superconductor it levitates and this is quantum emergence in action if you took a single electron or a few electrons you would not get superconductivity it would not be predicted from the model the way superc conductivity was discovered is that first people took materials um cooled them down to very very low temperatures discovered that they lost all resistance to the flow of electricity that there was this amazing uh property of levitation so it was an experimental
(31:36) Discovery and then they worked backward and said okay how can we form a model that now explains this are you completely against the idea that we could if we understood all of the constituent Parts say we had a complete knowledge of them then we might be able to explain the emerging property in terms of its parts or do you think that they're always going to be missing something no matter how much we know about them I don't actually think that's a useful question because at this point in time right we understand how two
(32:07) electrons interact with each other with that we don't even know how three electrons we struggle in reality in a milligram of material there's 10 ^ 23 electrons that's the number of stars in the observable universe so I think it's a conceit either for scientists or people talking about science to talk about this idea of a Theory of Everything where we're at two particles so we're not going to get to 10 ^ 23 particles and the interaction between not just pairs pairs of particles three particles four 10 the^ 23 particles and
(32:45) even if we had such a theory it would be reality so there would be no point to such a theory okay good well that was my best question it's not a useful one either apparently so the go down Hillary do you want to come back on something said cuz you said that's true I heard you a moment well I I mean I'd like to hear more about what you mean by encountering but let just just let me just put that to one side it seems to me that the idea that um we have these you know all of these bits the electrons and we've got a
(33:20) puzzle about how to describe the behavior of them as a whole it is just the same sort of that I was describing initially that it's the idea that maybe if we did have all of those bits then we would explain the whole and your thought that well we're not going to get there so let's just engage in exploring um how we encounter the emergent stuff is still employing the notion that there are some bits at the level that we know about electrons um uh and there are is something more General I we you haven't
(33:58) told us much about what what the sort of overall Behavior what category you're going to use to describe that overall Behavior there is a problem of how you encounter it is that you can't get from the the the smaller bit um so I'm not sure that there's really a difference and that you're still relying on the notion that you've got the bits in the first space there is such a thing which is the electron rather than a you know an energy space or however else we might describe it and that you knew where you
(34:28) were where your Bedrock you've got bits actually I'm not right okay I'll just be a little more specific as um you ask okay so for instance superconductivity is an emergent phenomenon which you cannot describe in terms of individual electrons instead you have trillions of electrons the quantum behavior of which overlaps and then you get this uh giant wave function and that behaves completely differently to the individual electrons so you do an experiment by encounter I mean you um encounter you do
(34:59) an experiment you discover something that behaves nothing like what we know of from Individual bits and then the theory that can be employed to describe it is a phenomenology where we say we encounter this and how can we describe it and because we're only familiar with reductionist theories we reduce it into a hypothetical particle we don't start with the electron and make a theory to get to it and we don't know that they will be such a theory there might be an Infinity of such theories because yes an
(35:31) electron would be a device if we went back to an electron it's like say there was a um the eer progression where you start with birds and you go to castles if you see the castles at the end that superc conductivity you can't go back to the birds and say how did you start with the birds and get to the castles you could have started with oranges you could have started with cattle and the collective self-organization would have still given given you the end product so that's why I'm saying no I'm not starting from that
(36:01) individual so I I agree with that but are you saying that the world is not differentiated and then because I want to make the move and say the world's not differentiated that's the consequence the radical consequence of taking that through to all entities are you are you making that additional move um I don't think the idea of there being an essential or in the fundamental is a useful idea to even begin so I wouldn't say it's differentiated I would say you know that's a nice project some people
(36:28) do but does it tell us anything about the world  no
