Flashback: The Secret (and Not So Secret) Conservatism of Adam Curtis (2021)
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omg6iRugscs)

## Transcript:
it's me again Douglas Lane and in this
video I'll be responding to the new Adam
Curtis documentary series can't get you
out of my head and to the recently
published zero books title democracy
Under Siege by Frank Ferretti
the critical Cuts videos on this channel
are quite consciously styled after the
Montage documentaries of Adam Curtis
films such as a trap hypernormalization
the century of the self all watched over
by Machines of Loving Grace and it felt
like a kiss not only were influential
aesthetically but Curtis is polemics
about the power of individuals and ideas
and the history of when those ideas have
gone wrong set me off on a quest to
create my own mashups of archived film
footage with the aim of assisting The
Liberation of humanity
but what I didn't realize was that
rather than being part of the struggle
for socialism and human freedom Adam
Curtis's ideas were actually products of
a deeply conservative world view an
ideology that bleeds itself to be Beyond
politics and Power
in a 2014 interview for the journal film
comment that was later quoted in a
Wikipedia article the filmmaker
clarified what his films are really all
about
in the interview Curtis claimed both to
be a kind of neoconservative and be
lamenting the loss of communal values
and a kind of individualist or
libertarian value
ultimately Curtis explained that he was
very much a creature of his time and
that he didn't really have any politics
he like everyone else has abandoned
politics and Power in favor of a
seemingly never-ending and repeating
critique
in fact the real power of his films and
their message has never derived from any
positive prescription
but by coming at any given subject from
a multiplicity of perspectives registers
and times Curtis manages to land both
rhetorically successful and even
penetratingly accurate critiques of the
left it is the way he catalogs our
impotence
picking out all the species and
subspecies of our failures
that gives his work both significance
and meaning
and it is precisely for this reason that
today's left so desperately needs his
films
the repetition of images and songs is
justified by the pressing need to drill
the reality of failure into an otherwise
myopically optimistic left's head well
the first thing we should remember is
that
Sanders campaign was a remarkable
success Curtis's critiques of populism
and techno-progressivism psychology and
Mindless consumerism bankers and Factory
owners consumerism and poverty may be
contradictory but it is for this reason
that if the critiques tend to reach
their targets
in a world Riven with contradiction a
man with a copy of the film tiger dance
starring the burlesque dancer Sherry
North and a CD's worth of ambient music
can truly capture reality if his cuts
are properly timed

thank you

at the end of the final episode of Adam
Curtis's latest film can't get you out
of my head the filmmaker sums up his
docket series by suggesting that what is
lacking in the modern world is
confidence in human subjectivity and in
Freedom
instead of engaging with the real world
and its problems we have given in to
conspiracy theories and other Illusions
in order to avoid changing we've created
a virtual world to hide in
but this world has also become a strange
nightmare
what makes Curtis's description and
critique difficult to pin down however
is that the difference between the
fantasy world of AI hallucination and
the real world of dead malls inequality
bombing campaigns and covet
it is difficult to make out
Curtis begins this film series with a
quote from the late David Graber
quote the ultimate hidden truth of the
world is that it is something we make
and could just as easily make
differently this sounds like both a deep
and obvious truth however it is I think
too simple
I would revise Gabriel's Revelation
rewrite it this way
the ultimate hidden truth of society is
that it is the unintended result of the
way we produce and distribute the things
we need to survive
we could with a great effort arrange our
productive activities differently
I think the difference between these two
versions of the Hidden truth is
essential it's the difference between
anarchism and Marxism
and it might also be the difference
between a materialist and an idealist
conception of the world
in his recent book democracy Under Siege
Frank Ferretti gives an argument that
would be right at home in an Adam Curtis
documentary
he writes
political psychology has often served as
a medium for diseasing the demos and by
implication democracy itself
in the 19th century psychologists
developed theories of the crowd which
stressed the irrational and destructive
behavior of the urban mobs
in the current ERA citizens supporting
so-called populist parties are diagnosed
as possessing toxic authoritarian
personalities
psychology's contribution to the silent
war against democracy has been in
serving to de-politicize and medicalize
behavior of its Target
views that Inspire and motivate popular
movements are dismissed as the outcomes
of psychological pathologies narcissism
irrationalism deluded fantasy
rather than as legitimate political
responses to public problems
he goes on to quote the social critic
Christopher lash the figure who's been
featured prominently on this channel and
who has become a hero for what's
sometimes called the Dirtbag left
Freddie wrote that lash argued that by
equating mental health with left-wing
politics and by associating right-wing
politics with an invented authoritarian
pathology
the goal was to eliminate
authoritarianism by subjecting the
American people who would amounted to
Collective psychotherapy
by treating them as inmates in an insane
asylum
Adam Curtis made similar observations
and can't get you out of my head and in
his documentary series The Trap wherein
he tells the story of how millions of
people became convinced that they were
mentally ill a psychiatrists began to
use surveys and computers to discover
who had the symptoms of an array of new
disorders that were themselves only
collections of symptoms
the new approaches to psychology and
diagnosing mental illnesses that arose
in the 70s and 80s became perhaps
inadvertently a new mechanism of control
both Ferretti and Curtis are convinced
that the idea that power should rest
with citizens in a Democratic Society
has been undermined as those citizens
were deemed to be irrational and sick
but what Ferretti and Curtis don't seem
to realize is that the citizens in a
modern democracy while perhaps not
mentally ill are set into opposition
driven into anti-social Behavior by the
material interests that arise under
capitalism
for Ferretti this failure to understand
how Bourgeois democracies are inherently
fractured by class interests and how
this leads to the development of a
managerial State it's surprising given
that he was in 1978 the founder of the
Revolutionary Communist Party in the UK
even as late as 2012 Peretti was giving
lectures on Marx at the Academy of ideas
but it's worth noting what he said there
for example when Iraq in the world
about how an ancient rule it was
politics
and in the Middle Ages it was
Catholicism that Reigns Supreme
he doesn't say that in ancient Rome it
was a slave economy
right and it doesn't say that in
medieval Europe it was just serve
economy
he didn't write a critique of Roman
political economy because there was no
political economy around but he wrote a
critique of political economy because in
his lifetime it was political economy
particularly in its Scottish form that
for him represented the most interesting
and the clearing expressions of what he
took to be fundamental relationships
within Society
so there's no kind of fixed relationship
now I looked for this quote from volume
3 of capital and didn't find it I did
however find it in a footnote contained
in volume 1.
some had objected to Marx's
characterization of the base
directing or determining the
superstructure by saying that in the
Middle Ages it was Catholicism
which Reigns Supreme and in ancient
Athens it was politics
Marx responded by saying in the first
place it strikes one as an odd thing for
anyone to suppose that these well-worn
phrases about the Middle Ages and the
ancient world are unknown to anyone else
this much however is clear that the
middle agents could not live on
Catholicism nor the ancient world on
politics
on the contrary it is a mode in which
they gained a livelihood that explains
why here politics and their Catholicism
played the chief part
somewhere along the line it seems
Peretti lost his grip on Marx and
whether inadvertently or not turned him
upside down he turned him in other words
into an idealist
this may explain why it is that he has
spent decades trying to protect
Bourgeois freedoms and rights while
simultaneously abandoning the rule that
the working class must play
in changing the base of society

if we were to protect these freedoms or
realize them
we will have to change not just the law
or the market
or people's heads
but the foundation of society
and yet despite this mistake despite the
failure of both Curtis and Ferretti to
take up the need for a change in the way
we produce the world of culture
ideologies politics and the rest rather
than a change in the world of culture
ideologies and politics in themselves
they are still necessary thinkers for
this moment they have regressed back to
1789 or maybe 1849. but they have not
gone so far as to embrace the house of
Stuart
as the supposed radicals who pushed the
1619 project did
at least still long for human
subjectivity to return
even if they don't quite realize that
the only way to truly grasp human
subjectivity is through a working-class
revolution and through the
transformation
of the material world
