Transcript:
(00:00) Matt cannot hello how's it going I'm good how are you yeah very well mate very very happy to have you in the studio thanks for having me yeah it's a pleasure we're here to talk because of your book silent coup which we'll get into the detail of momentarily but first if you can tell us who you are in your own words well um right now I am chief investigator at the classified UK which is a um uh website which covers British foreign policy which we set up in 2019 to kind of try and write the uh the fact
(00:29) that the mainstream media doesn't cover British foreign policy at all well or even at all in a critical way so we've been working on that for three or four years and it's gone well um that's not related to what we're here to talk about which is the book um before the classified I was a fellow and then director at the center for investigative journalism in London and that Fellowship basically was when we we did the work for the book it was actually we started in 2014 so quite a while ago um it's taken us a while to get it
(01:00) together but we basically were given fellowships I wrote the book with a journalist called Claire Provost who left the guardian to take this Fellowship I I previously worked for the financial times and then the guy that was running the organization then the founder he's called Gabby McFadden he's he's dead now but he's a kind of anarchist um and he basically just said to us look you've got two years to do whatever you want um so used it wisely and that was kind of it we didn't need to check in with
(01:28) him or what yeah it was amazing it was amazing but also daunting because when you got that much Freedom it's quite scary but then myself and Claire we did start talking amongst ourselves about the opportunity that it was and so we started thinking what's the biggest story in the world at the moment what we can do something massive and ambitious and also we had a travel budget as well so we could go around the world at that time I didn't have kids so I had some Freedom as well um so we and we both talked about how we
(01:56) thought that the biggest issue of the day is the corporate takeover of our societies the political system the International System of governance um Claire had previously worked at a guardian looking at Aid which forms part quite a large part of the book I'd been at the financial times in Washington DC looking at different parts of the World Bank um so and so we started from there I mean the first the book is structured in four parts and that was how we reported them that it's the same timeline and often I think
(02:25) journalists like to say that there was a kind of natural progression in their books to make it sound like they were on this journey of Discovery but that is genuinely how it happened we started on the first one and then each part kind of LED on to to different subjects um the first part was something Claire had been looking at at the uh at the guardian which is called investor State dispute settlement isds which sounds boring and is a an acronym there's a lot of acronyms I'll try and keep them minimal today but
(02:57) there's a lot of acronyms in this stuff and underneath all the boring stuff what this describes is a system whereby multinational corporations can sue States for enacting policies they don't like and hardly anyone knows about it people know about it obviously in the industry itself and Specialists but this is a hugely important system that just operates above the heads of government um and uh and sees the transfer of billions of dollars every year from some of the poorest countries in the world to the richest corporations
(03:27) it also has a chilling effect on policy making all over the world and it's a massive reason why a lot of policies aren't enacted by governments because nowadays governments are talking internally about different policies and they're not talking about them in terms of what's good for our population what's good for our citizenry they're saying are we going to get hit with an investor State dispute settlement suit from a company if we enact things and when I say enact things I'm talking about
(03:49) things like raising the minimum wage there was a case where a state was sued for raising the minimum wage or not granting an environmental permit to a mining company to dig all these things that you think is Sovereign policy making are now being chilled by this system and so we started with that um we moved then on to the age industry which is part of it as well um because isds is is mainly most of the cases are heard at the World Bank there's an institution another acronym called exid The International Center for
(04:20) the settlement of investment disputes and that is the main menu where these cases are heard and decided um but the World Bank is obviously an aid organization as well as publicly funded and its stated goal is to alleviate Global poverty and promote development but again so we so if we the second part of the book is about the fact that that's the Sham and development age is not about helping the poor of the world develop their economies and become part of the developed world that is actually about greasing the entry of
(04:50) Corporations into those um States and it's also if you start looking into it those Aid organizations actually literally came out of a lot of the the institutions which projected formal Empire which kind of collapsed after the second world war so we did that and then the the third section was another thing that we kept on seeing around the world which was carve-outs from from national territory so out the the there's different elements to this the main one is what are called special economic zones scz's
(05:21) another acronym which kind of did get some prominence in the 90s with Naomi Klein and no logo and there was quite an anti-globalization movement there's quite a lot of focus on sczz and what they are essentially a corporate Utopias where corporations and investors don't have to abide by national laws so they're carve-outs on labor laws you could so there's certain sez where you can't it's illegal to strike whereas it isn't in the outside the scz uh they there's no tariffs there's no Customs there's no
(05:51) duties there's there's no minimum wage there's all these things basically how you the world would look if a corporation designed it that's what these sezs are another part of that is the private cities which is we're seeing pop up all around the world another part of that is gated communities which are run by corporations so with the third part of the book is looking at all these different elements where physical territory is basically being taken from States and then the final bit which is
(06:15) probably the most well-known part of it was another thing we were seeing was everywhere we went these sites um were being guarded not by a regular army um soldiers they were being Guided by private security and private military everywhere so and that is a huge has huge implications for democracy and and and the power of the state because a lot of sociologists political theorists often said that the power of the state effectively rests on the fact that it has the legitimate results of force and violence um that is not the case anymore and that
(06:53) was quite well known and talked about during the war on terror the early part of it I've done if you remember the private military contractors like Blackwater and stuff in Iraq in 2007 eight I think there were more private contractors in Iraq than there were Department of Defense Personnel so that that was the final part and then also so that's that's the way we kind of divided it up but what it really describes I think is how the corporate corporate coup which has been really taken off since the 50s it's now nearly complete and
(07:24) there is barely any part of our society now which is not run in the interests of Corporations and even the nominal power that is exercised by governments is often exercised in the interests of Corporations behind the scenes so that's just a quick summary that's perfect no it's great I mean I think a-level politics students and there's a fair few of them follow this page will be familiar with another acronym the IMF international monetary fund imposing Sap's structural adjustment plans which
(07:52) basically for people who aren't familiar is essentially a way for them their Loan cash donation States in return for basically imposing austerity politics right and from what you've just detailed take that like a level version of events you're sort of like a doctoral thesis almost the detail in which you've gone into it it's it's compelling could you talk a bit more about the kind of supranational apparatus that exists above these states because you're talking there about you know for
(08:15) example I don't know uh raising the minimum wage or you know wanting to prevent the opening of a diamond mine so as to I'd preserve water quality yeah it's actually possible for a company to say we disagree we're going to sue you and not only we're going to sue you like the amount of money we're going for it can be a significant portion of a country's GDP because we're talking about developing nations yeah well there's a case now in Honduras which is a small country in Central America
(08:40) where they have they're closing down a special economic zone scz and they're getting sued by the company that owns a CZ for 11 billion dollars Honduras is a large percentage of their GDP so the the figures are mind-boggling really um but this system is designed to go above the heads of national governments and that's why we the subtitle of the book is um how corporations overthrew democracy what this means is that um uh states do not no longer work in the interests of their populations uh even Democratic ones that the levers of
(09:17) power have moved over to corporations and it's by Design as well you mentioned the supranational systems that were built in fact it was so we went into the history of a lot of them um what happened after the second world war was former Empire was collapsing particularly in the 50s and 60s uh newly independent countries with leaders that were parts of Liberation movements and were nationalizing things taking taking power back and they were freaking out in Washington London other Imperial capitals and they were saying how are we
(09:44) going to maintain our control over the developing world without formal Empire we can't have a Garrison of troops in that country that can just take out a leader if he does things we don't like which is how it worked before right absolutely East India Company and others um so they designed these systems one of them was this investor State dispute settlement system and that was the exid the body of the World Bank which hears these cases that was set up in 1966 which is quite interesting because the 60s was really when decolonization in
(10:12) Africa was really taking off another part of the World Bank which deals with the eight private sector Aid financing the international Finance Corporation IFC was set up in 1956 the 50s another time so you can see that the reaction was basically we need to stop the ability of um people's acting in a what we would think of as enacting Sovereign policy making so and also just finished with this in the 50s very important three very important things happened which also scared them one was the Iranian Democratic prime minister
(10:46) Mohammed mozide nationalized the anglo-iranian oil company and made it start working in the interest of the Iranian people I.E they got a massive a much bigger take on of their their own oil than they did before he was taken out a couple of years later by the CIA and MI6 in a coup in 1953 which overthrew the Iranian democratic government uh Iran's never been a democracy ever again the following year in Guatemala um there was another Democratic president who by the way mother day was not a communist which is what the the the uh
(11:21) the British and the Americans were saying they it was part of the Cold War we're more Centrist really yeah he was but he went but he was what they call resource nationalists he believed that it's a pejorative term yeah yeah as a pejorative but what it means is that actually maybe we should the people who were sitting on top of the minerals should maybe yeah yeah benefit from them anyway the same thing that happened or in Guatemala the following year 1954 jacobo our Benz was elected a few years before he started redistributing land to
(11:49) uh peasants fallow land which wasn't being used and some land from United United Fruit Company United Fruit Company engaged the CIA who overthrew the Democratic um uh government in in Guatemala I mean what happened after that is just horrible uh there was a eventually a genocide 200 000 indigenous Guatemalan people were killed in most horrendous ways Bill Clinton actually eventually apologized for him when he was president what happened in Guatemala but anyway that happened in 1954 the 1956 was the series Crisis when NASA in Egypt
(12:24) nationalized the Suez Canal Israel France and Britain invaded to try and depose him it didn't work but basically that they were basically saying we don't want to go in hard like this anymore we don't want to have to keep taking our governments we want to create an International System where it doesn't matter if there's someone like NASA in power or or Mother Day or our Benz we want to be able to just make them not be able to move we want to put a straight jacket on them in an economic sense it's
(12:50) what Thomas Freeman called the Golden straight jacket famously so isds was a major part of this and and if you look at the internal deliberations and negotiations that were happening at the World Bank which we did we went to the archives in Washington they're quite explicit about this they're saying we need some way of ensuring that we can maintain our control and the other thing is it's totally against capitalists philosophy and ideas isn't it because capitalism is all about risk and what this does is take the risk investment
(13:19) for these companies because if you go to the Congo and open a diamond mine um you look it's dodgy definitely you might get nationalized you might get the asset taken by a paramilitary force so anything could happen but the point is that high risk is because you might get a high return this ensures you against that risk because it says if the government does anything I don't like I can just take them to these these uh courts um and one I mean it really really obscene example of this was in South Africa um post apartheid because we went to
(13:54) South Africa to report on this case actually and this was a case about the black empowerment policies which were enacted after the fall of apartheid and essentially South Africa was even under Mandela there was quite a lot of criticism of Mandela actually on the economic side from people in South Africa uh dissidents and people who are part of the anti-apartheid movement because they think that he didn't go hard enough in an economic sense I mean there's arguments about how much he could move but basically South Africa
(14:22) was integrated into this system they signed huge amounts of bilateral investment treaties which are big they're called bits um another acronym but what this did was um enshrine this uh this legal system where corporations pursue in in law in South African law and and open them up to all these cases after the fall of apata when they enacted black empowerment policies this one case we looked at one of the black empowerment policies was um mining companies had to give 30 I think it was around 30 of their um shareholding to historically
(14:58) disadvantaged people so black people most did it this one Granite Company in Italy decided no we we don't like that we're going to take you to exid so they sued South Africa and said this impinges on our investor rights we don't want to give part of our and the South Africans were quite scared because they thought if if they publicize it then they're going to get hit with all sorts of um uh suits from different companies so it was really low level not many people in South Africa knew about it when we
(15:25) arrived but what happened eventually was they settled out of court and they were Exempted from those regulations and South Africa basically did that because they didn't want they didn't want to attract more and more cases and this is this is what's happening all around the world it's it's crazy when you go around the world you talk to any government which is going against the corporatocracy and going against the corporate ruled International System and all of them are talking about this isds
(15:47) system all of them um uh so so it it was quite conscious after at the time of the fall fall of formal Empire that they wanted to create a supranational system which could go above the heads of national governments and I know this sounds like tin foil hat stuff but it but it's real and if you read the Declassified files or the archival documents from the World Bank they say it the public posture is very different obviously because it's all about all the wonderful things they can they want to give to the rest of the
(16:17) world but internally they say that they're honest about it and now I'll finish with this with the legal system which we've discussed it's one of the few systems that barely has any legitimate ideology to to justify it like you know most of them most of these systems even even here like with a neoliberalism like the Tories at least you can kind of follow an argument in a comment piece where they're talking about privatizing something like there are Arguments for it that you can that are rational I mean
(16:47) I don't agree with them but um but with the case of this legal system there's barely any there's barely anything that they can just that used to justify that they can say oh it creates this kind of benefit for the poor world the only one they use is that corporations will be much more inclined to enter new markets if they know they're insured against getting their assets appropriate or the minimum wage being raised or whatever it is um but that's just not true because Brazil is one of the unique countries
(17:15) which has never signed up to any of these agreements which enshrine the isds system and it's never signed up to exid and it doesn't have a problem with foreign direct investment does it Brazil as well so so I mean there's there's tons and tons of ideology about this and you mentioned a structured adjustment programs that was really when the system took off not just the legal system the whole corporate rule system because as you said that the debt crisis in Latin America in the 80s was leveraged to
(17:42) enact a really really extremist form of Economics which is called neoliberalism now but um uh basically says you've got to completely deregulate your economy get rid of capital controls get rid of subsidies for food fuel anything that benefits the poor get rid of tariffs uh sign up to all these treaties which which in act um uh This legal system all these different part uh elements of it and it's basically been a disaster everywhere it's been trialed there's barely anywhere that can point to successes even in like East Asia like
(18:14) South Korea and places that some people point to us they've all Protected Their Own Industries when they've been developing uh because you have to it's like in in Latin America they call it import substitution where you would not just open your country up to to be flooded by products from elsewhere you would um you you'd protect your infant Industries and they would grow and then they would provide um and that's that happened in Latin America for for quite a few decades and then it was all
(18:42) smashed up by by the IMF and World Bank essentially and I mean I I spend quite a lot of time in Argentina for family reasons and that's one example of a country which has just been destroyed by neoliberalism which has been pushed on it by the IMF and World Bank particularly the IMF the previous governments are now signed the biggest IMF Loan in history they basically mortgaged um their country for 100 years they can't do anything they can't move for 100 years so um but that's an extreme case but it
(19:12) happened all across Latin America and the world and we still live with the results of that there's no change in ideology uh after the second World War when the Bretton Woods institutions which are used to describe the IMF and the World Bank because they were both created at Bretton Woods in New Hampshire in 1944.
(19:32) they did have um it was quite successful for like 20 30 years they often like in economics departments they call it like a golden age of capitalism after the Civil War welfare states were created there wasn't this extremist idea that the system that was put down by the Americans of Brits essentially it was John Maynard Keynes on our side and a guy called Harry Dexter white on the U.
(19:53) S side it worked quite well and equitably and then it was all smashed up by this um extremely neoliberalism and these structural adjustment programs which enforced it and we're still living with that and it's very very hard to escape this system it's extremely extremely hard because the institutions create this structural pressure on all sides that means you can't move and I will finish with this guy now like six sound fishes but we went to El Salvador and this was a really interesting experience for me because we went there
(20:22) when the fmln were in power and the fmln is the political party that came out of the Marxist guerrillas in the 80s in the Civil War so they're serious people in terms of their politics they were in power they were basically doing nothing and we were saying to them why are you not enacting any policies and they were just saying there's absolutely no no we can't move we nationalized that we'll get hit with a isds suit we we uh we we take back control of XYZ will be hit with uh something else we've got an aid
(20:51) program from the US that if we do this thing they'll they'll withdraw it so there's there's just all there's this web of control which is enforced on the developing World in quite literal ways and in El Salvador's case they lost the Civil War so they were just integrated into this system and then 20 years 20 30 years later you do have a Liberation government which has been voted by the people but they they can't move and and there's I mean this is the very very literal way that they do this is
(21:19) something they call Sunset Clauses which are often embedded in these agreements these free trade agreements bilateral investment trees and sunset Clauses describes how even if you cancel that agreement you call it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't actually become canceled until 10 years later so they're hoping that in 10 years time there won't be a government that will have the same uh uh belief that this that the country doesn't need this agreement and and they can just keep it in place so it's it's
(21:45) it's just it's impossible to move hoping yeah yeah um the I think it's also important that a key distinction is you know we're talking about Bretton Woods we're talking about United fruits and we're talking about the Anglo Iranian or company we're talking about the East India Company a lot of those companies they still exist today right you know we're talking when we say United fruits it's Chiquita we talk about Anglo Iranian it's PP right and the it's not just that you know they had these ideas
(22:10) that still exist today it's the literal infrastructure of the corporation still exists today the but yeah they've rebranded but but it's the same it's the same body right yeah definitely and that's the funny thing is that the whole edifice is just a Rebrand like they call it post-colonialism I know there's critical postcolonism that argues this it's a continuation of political lending but but a lot of people just say but in a lot of people's minds the colonial period ended it never did it was
(22:37) rebranded even development itself is a PR tool idea like like I've described a lot of these institutional Aid institutions development institutions were just about enforcing capitalism and corporate rule on the developing world as formal Empire collapsed and there's another there's another part of it which is just massively taken off now which is Corporate social responsibility or CSR right and that is an extreme that's just another extreme way to uh to make money a PR tool to make money and to to to
(23:10) um make it impossible to know for your average Joe what is going on uh with corporate power because everything is there's so much effort put into putting this like patina of altruism on everything and then the media is owned by the corporations as well so they just repeat it um so it's impossible there's barely any spaces where you can get critical um uh uh coverage of Corporations and the other part of this is also the NGO sector because the NGO sector again is infested with corporations and that is such a
(23:44) powerful tool for corporations because if Oxfam uh save the children all these brands that have such uh uh household value and are seen as providing good for the world are aligning with corporations and basically whitewashing their their activities in the developing world it's very hard to fight and most journalists don't push back against it I had when we went to El Salvador for like I mentioned we had one case where we um wrote a story about a a community a poor community that were living on top of aquifer
(24:20) just outside South just outside San Salvador the capital and they were not able to afford water uh to for their kids and we went and saw it was awful uh and then down the road all these major multinationals were bottling Coke and other things one of them is called was called Sam Miller and we did the story for the guardian it went on our website under the Bill Gates Foundation logo which because Bill Gates funds their development website that you start seeing that this Panorama this web of control that corporations or at least
(24:50) corporate friendly foundations have um and then they two days later this this article was was was quite hard hitting two days later Sam Miller had a an interview in the guardian not directly referencing article but defending their their basically blaming uh water stress in Latin America on on the on the governments which is what they always do they say it's corruption these like buzzwords yeah I thought that was quite weird because it wasn't an advertorial and it wasn't that it wasn't a reply to our article so
(25:24) I looked into it and sad Miller actually was funding a part of the guardian's website so the guardian had given the last word to one of the biggest corporations in the world over the voices of some of the poorest people in the world just because that is how deep corporate control is and the piece of the puzzle that I actually missed out on this is that sad Miller sent me when um when I when I I approached him for comment about this situation with this community and they said oh no no you got it all wrong
(25:51) here's a report we've co-authored with Oxfam America about that this case which basically exculpated them from any blame so it's we live in a I know it sounds like a conspiracy stuff but we live in a matrix of control that corporations have built up but because they have all the money they have all the money the only the two power centers in our society of states and corporations really do you think it's is it I don't you know she'd done a whole premise of your book is it over simplifying it is it too binary to say
(26:21) you know on the one hand we've got corporations on the other hand we've got governments and they're in conflict with each other and that's the end of it do you think that sort of boils it down a little bit too far I don't think that's true cool I don't think that's I think that I think that's a major misconception that everyone has like um I don't think they're adversarial at all I think governments work for corporations that's what and I didn't think that in the same way before I went
(26:44) around uh the world for researching a book because I was talking to people who were the victims of Corporations whether it be I don't know ones who are hiring paramilitaries to to kill trade unionists in Colombia or um people trying to organize in in Cambodia in an scz all these people I'd say I'd always ask them what's your government doing for you because you're obviously getting um done over by these corporations the people that should be protecting your government and everyone would say
(27:14) the government they to them it was a silly question they said the government works for the corporation and that is that is what it looks like on the ground and that's what I found like these and the other amazing point of this is that you think that um projects in the developing world like corporate projects you think that they're capitalist endeavors I'm not exaggerating when I say like 80 to 90 of every project I was investigating for the and Claire as well was investigating for this book I'd find that there was some development
(27:44) financing for it like which is public money uh everywhere it was that was a real Revelation for me because I it they're in every part of nearly every part of capitalists and corporate Endeavors in the developing world have some uh AIDS part to it um and there's obviously the World Bank which is the main one but there's all there's Regional development Max as well like the Asian development Bank African Development Bank the iadb in in Latin America so it's all and what it is is to it it's not about Aid and development
(28:14) it's about locking countries into corporate friendly policies so that's a very literal example of how public money and Institute public institutions are basically working in the interests of Corporations and it is true that what you say is true that this is ever been thus like there is there is an element of that I'm not saying that this is some new thing that we've discovered like corporations have always but what what I think has happened in a lot particularly since the second world war with the age of the
(28:42) multinational which has benefited from the architect the economic architecture that we talked about that was erected after the second world war what's happened with that is that I think it's gone massively International and I think that in a lot like since the end of the Cold War when there hasn't been another poll to organize around if you're an independent country and you want to do something different it's just gone wild because now we have China which is definitely going on the rise and will be the and is
(29:08) still is already another poll that the developing world can organize around it's hyper capitalist we went to Shenzhen which I mentioned special economic zones now China's whole um rise to economic Superfast status is based on the scz model they dengia ping who opened up the economy opened up um the first scz in China in 1980 which was Shenzhen Shenzhen is now like a million people live there it's huge it's the biggest season in the world and we went there and it's just hyper capitalism workers have no rights
(29:40) there's CCTV cameras everywhere uh you're you're basically under the complete control of the corporation or the other state it's it's dystopian and that's the other poll now so it's not like the Soviet Union there is no other economic model and and the the the scarier thing about China was the scz model was perfect for them because the Communist Party could maintain control of the state while developing this wild west um private sector but just in these enclaves um and obviously sczz are all over the
(30:10) world so I think that it I I think that the books well I don't want to speak for Claire but from my perspective I I think that there are there are two major power centers in in our society which is the state and the corporation and the corporation has eaten the state which created it and you can actually delineate that because the other interesting part of that is this is not this war between the two which was actually a war before but it's been won by the corporation in my opinion but it started in of like in the modern
(30:42) Corporation they say well the historians debate when it when it when it the invention of the modern Corporation happened but a lot of them put it down to 16th century England not far from here actually in the city of London and they were chartered companies so they were basically completely under the control of then the crown you know you'd receive a chart from the queen or King um and it would be a time limited thing it would be for one job or it would be one trade route uh in East East India company's case it was like a third of
(31:12) the globe that they got their child covered for trade uh uh the the first joint stock company which is uh it was called the the in the modern version was called the Muscovy company in in in London and that was for trade route to Russia uh but what you see is like they the corporation as a as a sort of economic instrument has just been waging a war against the state it to get more and more power and obviously back then it was a privilege to to get a charter and and open a corporation right now it's a a right that happened through
(31:45) legislative changes in the 19th century and it happened it it happened most of it happened in the 19th century but it really took off on an international sense and this in a supranational international sense in after the second world war so I think that right now it's very hard to see how Corporation how governments can act in against corporate interests it's I just I I can't especially in the in in in the developing world but also here because the other part of the book that was quite interesting was that what we
(32:19) called the boomerang effect where a lot of these systems that were set up to continue dominating the developing world are now been coming back to roost and coming back to the countries where they were created so Germany was kind of the birthplace of the isds system that I talked about and they got hit with a massive um legal case from a Swedish Energy company a coal company for foreign for some environmental permit and also for their decommissioning of their nuclear power plants they were hit with a billion billions suit from the same
(32:49) Swedish company in LA in the UK freeports we've got 13 freeports were opening which is just scz's and so all these the corporations are now coming back and eating uh uh the states that created this International infrastructure and is in Design This International System where they could they could benefit from the developing world so I don't I think there's much scope for pushing back against it to be honest it's like it's so complete the control and even the media itself uh uh which you would hope would do
(33:23) um the job of at least notifying people of what's Happening doesn't because structurally it can't it's like you wouldn't trust Pravda in the Soviet Union to tell you the truth about what the Soviet Union Soviet government was doing in the Soviet regime but I I think it's a bit of a uh asked for to think that the corporate media corporate owned media owned by corporations is going to tell you the truth about the corporate run system so there's space for Independent Media to do the job and and
(33:50) you guys are doing a great job we we try like but we're kind of pushing against the massive in terms of reaching a massive people um and in a more in a more sort of UK way you saw what happened to someone like Jeremy corbyn who was one of the first leaders that really was against uh or at least wanted to push back against a corporate power in this country um uh tax Havens they had quite um Advanced and sophisticated and radical uh policies on the British tax Haven Network in their Manifesto and the corporate media system destroyed him
(34:33) um and it's very hard to see where the cracks are um I don't want to I if you ask me a question about what makes me optimistic I can also answer that giving you quite enough yeah yeah yeah and I can't imagine that those um those policies are going to be in labor parties next Manifesto but that's a conversation for another day yeah um let's talk more about non-commercial loans yeah because well a couple of examples of this they're slightly different but you know it might be um a diamond mine in
(35:00) Tanzania or in so little um these are let's say two of the companies right the beers little they have access to traditional financing options that every corporation has access to take your pick you can get loans but they have access to public money in in lidl's case you know we're literally talking about the British taxpayer right via VIA European bank right yep how on Earth have we ended up in a situation where taxpayer money is going to Wards funding the corporate expansion of you know let's say a successful supermarket chain
(35:35) and why is that happening in the name of development because you can't when you hear the phrase development you're sort of thinking I don't know you know water quality programs you're thinking education you're not thinking let's build more Littles in Poland yeah that's a very good question um I think basically it's because it's development is not how people commonly understand it it's not about or at least practiced by the World Bank and the institutions of the European bank for
(36:03) reconstruction and development which you referenced or diffid or if it doesn't exist anymore the the development part of the foreign office they don't see development like what you're talking about like water programs or whatever it is they see it as a tool for enforcing their big business interests um and it's it's never been different there was you can you can see that that was it's exactly the same from the start so to them the other part of that is there's an ideology which has developed
(36:32) which obviously justifies that to to people that ask and also to the people working within the system themselves because no one wants to think that they're doing monstrous things like using public money to help little expand in Poland for no reason um but they all tell themselves their idea of development so when they talk about why they would do if you ask them which we did why are you doing this they say well their whole development idea is that it has to be based on foreign investment so you have to there's no other way to
(37:01) develop an economy apart from just making yourself as attractive as possible to foreign investment and to open making yourself as attractive as possible to corporations because corporations are going to be the ones that are going to take their resources and their money and open a plan or a shop or whatever it is in your country and that will create jobs and then that will create economic activity around the the plant or the the shop and then that'll that would there'll be a spin-on effect that will develop the whole
(37:26) economy it it it doesn't stack up but the reason it they that they uh that they push it and the reason that it has become religion is because it benefits um uh corporations but also it benefits the system the capitalist system which a lot of these institutions were set up during the Cold War when there was real fear and people around the world actually were quite were clamoring for something a bit different and they needed to make sure that the the capitalism was spread uh and and was strong um uh and I think that's that's a big
(38:04) part of it is the the sort of geopolitical economic part of it is that they needed the this this specific system and this private sector to be as big as possible so the IFC which I mentioned was the Privacy lending arm which is the private sector lending arm of the World Bank which funds diamond mines five-star hotels in Myanmar little in Poland like all these crazy things they they the IFC was created in 1956 when at the height of the Cold War when they were just when they wanted to push back against communism everywhere and
(38:36) the European Bank of reconstruction development opened in 1981 when they were basically just like it was the Soviet Union had fallen they wanted to make sure that capitalism was going to penetrate that all the old Soviet block markets and and just make it impossible for any kind of alternative to ever rise up again so that's uh that's why uh and then they call it they put a sticker on it and call it development which is confusing if you start looking into it but most people don't know this is the
(39:03) other thing about this stuff is that it's all done so under under the radar and you can't find out like barely anyone like everyone's shocked when you describe this stuff and they don't believe you at first or they say that you're chatting rubbish but then you say look it's there in black white and then they say that doesn't make sense but then I'm like yes it doesn't make sense of you accepting the premises which you which which are given effectively by these institutions and by the papers
(39:28) um but it's it's a it's a massive massive racket Aid is Aid is a was the wildest part of this whole ride like it was it was crazy to see that it's so opposite to what they say um and then obviously there's the labor law part of it as well which is like little you mentioned that how they treat their workers um like some of the places that are of the places I went to when I was looking at companies that were receiving development financing for public money like they treat their workers so badly
(39:57) um and and and there's one report that we found from the Asian development Bank about promoting sez in Cambodia about why women were particularly good for that because they had Nimble fingers and they were more Meek so they would be less likely to strike or or put some any resistance to the corporations and that's explicit down there so that that is that that is the kind of um part of this that is really tragic is how difficult it is to work for workers to organize against the power of these institutions because essentially you go
(40:30) around and you see workers in SC designs that are getting paid below the minimum wage because they can be uh that it's impossible for them to organize because they're cut off from society by Design um and it's it's desperate I mean it's really really desperate the most profound experience I had in the whole book was going to Cambodia and talking to two different types of Union there's what they call Yellow unions there which are which are basically Affiliated to corporations and the state that's what like they work
(40:59) together um and basically they were just the people who are members of those Juniors were getting shafted and it was a way of controlling them and then there were independent unions a couple amazing people that were like trying to sneaking into SES to organize properly were some of them were being shot dead um and it was just showed you the power like they were the the repression of them was huge cambodia's been a dictatorship for for a long time um and the repression of them really showed me just like the power of independent
(41:34) Democratic unions they they're profound important institutions in our society extremely civilized institutions that that really make a difference to people's lives like the people that had uh and actually in Cambodia I just saw last week Human Rights Watch uh released a statement about how nine trade unionists in Cambodia that were organizing for better wages better conditions have been put in jail for for years so and that's that's the real results of all this it's not that it's it it's not
(42:05) uh and that's again away from um uh the mainstream uh view um there was a again a couple of decades ago quite a lot of talk about where the Knight make their trainers and sweatshops and stuff that kind of has dissipated from the mainstream discourse but that's all that is the result of all this stuff people working in sweatshots for wages getting treated like rubbish by their bosses impossible for them to organize maybe even getting put in prison if you organize so yes it's a dystopian picture um and then obviously the other side is
(42:39) it makes it one section of society extremely rich and that is the the local Elites that benefit from these systems and the people in London Washington uh Frankfurt wherever it is that where all the money is going and that is again a function of private security private cities part of this is that we're creating such an unequal Society now uh through these different systems that the elites that are benefiting from them are having to like call themselves out of society because all the problems they don't want to have
(43:15) to deal with all the rubbish of all the poor people that can't that they're desperate now like this country particularly is you see it on the streets and people will get retiring to these gated communities where they get rent private security which can like threaten people if they come anywhere near and that's kind of where we're where we're going we're going to have two parallel existences we've already got it essentially but um I think that is the The Logical conclusion of what we're talking about
(43:39) other than Cambodia are there other examples you could point to where communities have successfully resisted good questions and actually I don't want to be too pessimistic because they it was quite a hopeful experience as well and one case which I've kind of always I've been obsessed with for like 20 years now it's just stop going on about it but um which is Bolivia um and there was a very very actually quite famous case in 2000 where um they privatized water in a in a city in Bolivia it's the third city called
(44:11) culture Bamba which is a majority indigenous City um and Bechtel the U.S company got the contract and they massively jacked up prices for water um they even criminalized collecting rainwater and there was huge huge outpouring of uh protest um uh dissidents and affected and they were on the streets from for weeks and then it became known as the water wars there's a film actually by Gail Garcia Burnell about that um about the whole um that whole uh event and he uh and day day one so they they did in the end get hit with the
(44:48) isds case by Bechtel when they were when they didn't give them the when they had to cancel their contract they got hit with the case but again shows that it's impossible to escape but they won in the sense that Bechtel were kicked out and the prices weren't jacked up um and people could afford water and then one of the major leaders of that protest was Eva Morales who was then a congressman uh and the head of the Coca Union five years he was elected the first indigenous president and the Democratic Socialist president and he
(45:19) from 2000 he was elected in 2005 took power in 2006. over the next 10 years completely transformed that Society um through doing everything that the World Bank tells you not to do and then eventually was praised by the World Bank later on but they they nationalized hugely they renegotiated contracts with all the corporations which had got these um uh just obscene uh deals you know like this is what I'm talking about the comfortable governments the governments they don't care they're mostly they're
(45:53) working for Washington they're working for the corporations so they said when a corporation comes to say oh yeah well that oil contract we get 82 of that will give you 12 percent of them okay their mentality is not we need to keep this uh for for the people so in fact I interviewed Eva Morales in his house in the Amazon rainforest last year and he he was talking to me about the fact that um they were taken to to exid for for these nationalized nationalizations they were doing but he also just said like before Mass which was his government his
(46:27) party took power the corporations just designed policy explicitly they come in and and and talk to ministers and and and that was all based on the idea that we can't develop Bolivia and S corporations come and invest which means the corporations just rape your country essentially so he reversed all that um then he but then he was a victim of a coup himself in 2019 there's obviously complicated the political situation there but there was a coup which was backed by the U.
(46:56) S and Britain and then they came back so I've I've finished on a very optimistic note which is that a western-backed or U.S UK back coup which overthrows a leader which is uh who is using his resource or his or her resources for the people of the country in history that that it's worked like Allende is a famous case in Chile in 1973 when the CIA organized the military coup and they threw him the Democratic Socialist prison out he was and he died um he killed or was committed suicide but that was it you know 17 years of
(47:30) dictatorship of Augusto finisher in the case of Bolivia I think this might be the first case the first case I know about they overthrew the democratic government instilled a puppet government a far-right um uh uh interim president but the following year democracy was restored and the the mass party everyone is his party won the elections so and they're in power now and and doing good things so there is that that's a really good example of how you can fight back successfully but it it it is quite a unique case because
(48:07) when I was there interviewing Morales he's in this uh he lives in this like tiny little um that sort of uh town in the middle of the Amazon but I was talking I did do quite a few interviews with the union people and people there and activists and it's an incredibly organized population the indigenous population it was so inspiring you know like then there's meetings all the time the unions have just endless committees it's just everyone is engaged in the political process is completely different from here
(48:40) um and that that is why they could resist it I think that there was a level of organization that we just don't have here and that is quite rare anywhere really but that is how you do it effectively you need to organize resistance and specifically you need to organize unions because you in terms of like the grand forces that can take on the the the powers that I've talked about uh the institutions I've talked about organized labor is the only one with the degree of uh Power and um people power but Financial power
(49:12) whatever it is that can take on uh that kind of uh corporate power um and it they know that that's why they do that's why they divide and rule the workers like I talked about the yellow unions and that um but if you there's ways to do it it's just I think that we should be a bit more humble here and in the US and other places and say we should look at places like Colombia and see how did you do it how did you manage to get this level of Consciousness how did you get this level of organization that you can really
(49:39) fight back against these systems I'd like to tease that out a bit more because the phrase you use those it's completely different to here right and I think looking at our current economic political system and then sort of contrasting that with political debate in the country a huge amount of oxygen particularly in Britain let's just talk about Britain for the time right it's cultural yeah it's  take your pay I don't know uh trans ideology you know changing the words in Roald Dahl books you know whatever whatever
(50:16) nonsense thing it is they're talking about right and I I just would like to invite your Reflections on that whether it's whether it it's almost a tool right yeah that seeks to distract you from the big problem over here yeah I think so I've got to be careful what I say no no it's just it's extremely toxic issue and again I think that's also a function of what you're talking about in that um the culture wars I think our cult or identity politics or corporate friendly identity politics is
(50:50) a is a um is a cultural phenomenon which is rooted in the corporate takeover of our society because um it it's like you say it's an it it's it's a distraction but it's not a distraction because the issues aren't important like trans rights gay rights all these things they are important but why are we talking it's the proportion that we're talking about them at now they they dominate the whole discourse and it's extremely beneficial to corporations and they use it explicitly
(51:23) like there was a Lockheed Martin which is the largest Arms Company in the world they've they've funded some conference in the state so I can't remember what it was called last week but everyone had like pronoun badges that were going in and it was just not seen as bad that these progress people who are progressive maybe on these uh uh gender issues uh do not see any problem with being funded by a Arms Company it's like the new Statesman which talks about all these uh presents itself as this Progressive
(51:52) institution and um probably got really good Politics on on Trends or gay rights or whatever it is they're funded by the BAE Systems which is spent uh seven years destroying Yemen like making made it in the worst humanitarian crisis in the world millions of kids on the brink of starvation but it's a way of dressing up it's again goes back to the corporate thing isn't it it's a way of dressing up um these really uh ugly um uh actions and ugly uh corporations in nice Progressive rhetoric and then
(52:26) but I do think that left is not uh blameless because obviously they have to you have to yes you have to fight back against some of it but they they they they engage in it as well and they SM and they censor and de-platform people in a really in a way that I think will come back to haunt them I think that the sensoriousness of the left now so around certain issues is really really bad and uh because the left should be Defenders of free speech because we'll be hit at some point down the road and if we have no track record
(52:59) of Defending people we don't agree with then we've got no leg to stand on you know um it's interesting because because as a cultural phenomenon it doesn't really exist in places where there's actually like proper left or Democratic Socialist governments doing good stuff like in Latin America where I've spent most time I know most about probably doesn't really happen in the same way like Lula is talking really specifically he might he'll talk about abortion and stuff like this but he he has really
(53:27) strident positions on on really red line topics that you wouldn't get left this here to talk about like the war in Ukraine or um nationalizations same with uh ever uh the mass government in Bolivia um and and the Korea Government in in previous one in Ecuador I've been in all those countries and it's it's completely different and I think that's because the the discourse and the system there is not controlled in the same way by corporations there's there's not they don't have the same need to control it
(53:57) because they're much more much more need to control the discourse in places with extreme power like we have here in Washington but yeah I think that it definitely is and I definitely I definitely think it's a distraction because we don't talk about the like look at the economic structural issues in this country the country is in a complete mess um and the austerity program that the tourism enacted just decimate I think it must be one of the most horrific like hammerings of the poor that there's been
(54:28) in British history um and we're still living with the results of that and I just find I think that it benefits um the right because and I'll finish with this I think the other thing about identity politics and and the censoriousness of the left is it plays into the right hands because they can say you know like the the Tories now know that the only way they can win an election is on the cultural stuff that's why when Boris Johnson left um and this trust uh everyone will say oh well at least Rishi sunax not a like a a an extremist
(55:06) he'll get rid of people that swell of Raven but he knew that the only way he's going to win an election is by keeping her in post and keeping her as Home Secretary hammering the immigrants and whoever it is because there's no other way they can do it because they have to get people working against their own clothes voting against their own class interests and I think that when you read some of the  if I can use that word in a Daily Mail some of it has like some of it has kernels of truth about how you can't say
(55:36) this you can't say that it's true there are certain things and people see it feed it outside in the country I can't even say what I think without getting called XYZ it's really really destructive and really alienates the working class particularly from organized from the labor well from the well I don't even know if we have a left in this country whatever we call the left in this country you know it does uh it completely alienates them because also the other thing is they're looking at the political system and
(56:04) saying who's talking to to my needs who's talking to my issues and a lot of the left just aren't they're talking about stuff that like I don't want to be specific but there's there's things that most a lot of people have never even like thought about for more than a couple of seconds that they're getting inundated with is the most important part of their their lives I don't think that and I do think that's a function of um corporations controlling uh the discourse and I don't
(56:31) think they're left is immune at all and the left might even be worse um in some ways not consciously but I've adopted some of that yeah Matt Kennard thank you so much for taking the time I really appreciate it I think we'll have to have you back to talk about domestic politics and not just corporations thanks so much for coming in mate thanks for having me really appreciate it
