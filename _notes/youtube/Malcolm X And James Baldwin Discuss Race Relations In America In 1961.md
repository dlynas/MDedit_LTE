![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qJH9GrVKBY)

## Transcript:
our panel here to my right mr malcolm xt
minister of the temple of islam number
seven in new york city and generally
acknowledged to be the number two leader
in the national black muslim movement
mr c eric lincoln
professor of social philosophy at clark
college in atlanta
and author of the new volume the black
muslims in america
the first serious scholarly study of
this movement and a book which has been
called by the authoritative gordon
alpart one of the best technical case
studies in the whole literature of the
social sciences
the distinguished american writer mr
james baldwin author of the novel go
tell it on the mountain and the book of
commentary notes of a native son
and george s schuyler associate editor
of the powerful newspaper the pittsburgh
courier and a man who has long enjoyed
an international reputation as a
journalist uh mr mistrax would you like
to come in
uh yes first though i would like to
point out
that uh
we who are muslims who follow the
honorable elijah muhammad don't accept
the term negro we stand uh against that
and uh i would like to declare myself
i'm not the
number two leader
of the muslim movement because we don't
think of ourselves in that light
we have
one god whose proper name is allah
we have one leader and who in america
here
uh is the honorable elijah muhammad
we are one people and we have one aim
and that's the upliftment and the
betterment of our people here in america
who are called negroes and uh where the
objectives
and the program of the honorable elijah
muhammad differs perhaps from
uh the objectives and the programs and
methods of these
other groups that represent the
so-called negro
most of the other groups their their
method of operation has a tendency to
lead us to believe that it'll take us
another thousand years if we follow
their tactic uh whereas we who are
muslims we're not willing to wait
another 100 years we've well now in this
uplift of the black man and unwilling to
wait what specifically do you want to do
uh number one the honorable i think it
should be pointed out clearly that as
muslims we are not a political group nor
are we a civic group but rather we are a
religious group when i say that we're
not a political group uh i'm letting
it's being made clean there that uh we
are not relying on the politicians for a
political solution because uh experience
has taught us that in the past the
politicians have promised but never
delivered and if we rely on a politician
we feel we're going right around in
circles like our people have been doing
here in america a hundred years since
lincoln issued the so-called
emancipation proclamation not relying on
politicians mr x is it not correct that
the muslims seek to completely separate
the black and the white man in america
and to win and establish for the negro
their own homeland in several states of
america still that's religion with us if
it was a religion for moses uh 4 000
years ago to be missioned by god to
separate the slaves in that day from the
slave master of that day complete
separation not integration and still the
uh christians and jews both today regard
moses not as a politician but as a
religious leader and a religious man
motivated by uh motivated by religion
completely uh we feel that what the
honorable elijah muhammad is doing here
in america today in demanding a complete
separation of this slave from his slave
master and as moses asked for a land of
his own flowing with milk and honey the
honorable elijah muhammad is likewise
asking for a land for us flowing with
the sweet milk and honey of freedom
justice and equality well accepting
accepting as mr scholars just wait a
minute now

at the risk of going into politics i
would like to know how any group in the
united states is going to separate part
of the united states for them to live in
without having something to do with
politics do you plan to do this through
warfare uh sir i don't think that it's
necessary to bring about any warfare if
uh if the slave ex-slave in america has
to go to war with his former slave
master to get what is his by right then
that in itself is a condemnation of the
former slave master if lincoln issued
the emancipation proclamation a hundred
years ago which means we're supposed to
be free we're supposed to be citizens
we're supposed to be protected by the
constitution that we fight and die for
and yet at the same time today the
so-called negro is knocking at the white
house door still begging his master to
pass legislation that will give him
recognition or protection by the
constitution that he is supposed that is
uh supposed to represent him i think sir
that uh uh the man who is depriving him
of these rights cannot open up his mouth
and uh say that it would be war it would
be wrong to go to war against him to get
these things before we go further into
techniques if you will excuse me excuse
me mr scholar i would still like to get
out here the full program of the muslim
religion in america
we now have the desire for a separate
grouping
in some states of america mr baldwin
would you comment on your understanding
of other purposes of the movement
it's very difficult to talk about um
talk about it in these terms i think
i think that the power the muslim
movement
is involved with power
and
i
i know about power but it's involved
also with morality and identity
this is the argument i have with mr x
um
when malcolm x says that um
actually actually he's got a very good
thing going for him the muslim movement
does because after all what they are
asking for is what the country
is also on the record been asking for a
total separation of the races is what
mississippi wants and georgia wants and
in the basis of the record what the
country wants
now it isn't what i want pardon me
doesn't mr x and the muslim woman call
for the separation of the races by
having the negroes all in certain states
of america yes which is different from
what the mississippians want
well what the mississippians want is to
have the negro separated while still
working still in the same state in the
same state yes yeah well this is what
this is why this is why the one the one
is talking really about the nature of
power and i think one's got to make this
clear what the mississippians have or
think they have is power what the negro
what the muslim movement wants
is power
and i don't think that and we can talk
about it and let's be aware of this
distinction
because
of this reality
because again what the muslim movement
is doing is simply taking the the uh the
equipment or the history railing of
white people among with negroes and
turning it against white people now in
this country today
and and yesterday
it is it is terribly difficult to um to
believe
american americans are never proven
that they really consider negroes to be
men
now from my point of view this is done
more to destroy white men in this
country than it has done quite apart
from all the things we know about the
oppression of the ghettos and the
lynchings and so forth it has done much
more to destroy the country than it is
under destroying negroes what i'm suing
for
when i what i myself personally am suing
for
is not a separation of the races i don't
believe in the first place in races and
especially in this country again
when it's not in the situation of the
congolese fighting the belgians one is
in the situation
whether white men or black men want to
admit it are fighting one's brothers and
ones ancestors and this is a reality
which no matter how hidden will sooner
or later come to light
it one one takes the road to power it
seems to me
that the white world proves this
one ends up where the white world is
what has happened in the country since
world war ii has not been because white
people have suddenly changed their minds
or become more generous or any of those
things what has happened is the power is
beginning to shift
my concern
is what will happen
what will happen
when i
a negro
no longer
have you as my oppressor
but i'm responsible altogether
responsible
what is happening to me what i what kind
of world i want
now
i don't want to see the history of
europe history the western nations
repeated for another thousand years with
a shoe on the other foot the handicap
one has and talking in this way
is that there is no way to to use the
record
the american record or the record of the
western nations to prove this point all
the evidence really is
on the side of the muslim movement what
we can quarrel about and muskrat about
is the issue and where this will lead
and what this means in terms of human
beings who are finally the white nor
black
well now staying on that issue if i may
and establishing here in a way that we
can all agree upon how the muslim
intends to solve that issue is it not
correct that he stands not only by the
separate for the separation in the races
in separate states but is opposed to
integrations opposed to the sit-down
movement the city and movement at the
present time is that correct
with whites in georgia integration we
consider that token integration and this
is what thurgood marshall points out as
actually a failure uh in the in the on
the part of the government to back this
integration that they say will uh make
uh scala yes well there are two things
here with which i differ
violently one is that all the evidence
is on the side of the muslim movement
that has been justification for this
campaign of hate against uh
white people now uh i would like to
offer that these 18 million somehow
negroes that you're talking about in the
united states are the healthiest
the wealthiest had the most property the
best educated and the best informed of
group of negroes in the world and that
includes all those in the muslim
countries now we ought to get that thing
straight uh this is a matter of record
you don't have to get no guesswork about
it and the next thing is when is where
is anything in the constitution or in
anything that lincoln said or wrote that
says that a group has a right to part of
the united states to take it off by
itself i thought that issue was settled
a hundred years ago
i'd like to respond to one of the
remarks made by
mr schuyler
in researching the black muslim movement
and talking with hundreds of people
across the country
one of the things that i found
consistently was the fact that
since negroes in this country are among
the best educated uh non-white people in
the world
since they have the leisure time to some
extent to read and to study
and since they live in a society where
there are all of these plus values
available to the white man
i found that this is
one of the things that is most
productive of the kind of anxiety that
makes for a
muslim movement for example
we found that
the fact that the negro is so well
educated
producers are a kind of chafing at the
bit because he cannot be
a full class citizen in terms of his
education and in terms of his
preparation
we find that uh with the emergence of
black states in africa and other
non-white peoples
uh in asia and other parts of the world
that the american negro
has a sort of sinking feeling that if he
isn't careful he might be the last
person in the world to attain the kind
of status that would be equal with his
education and his preparation
it is upon this kind of anxiety that the
black muslim movement thieves
mr lincoln mr schuyler before we argue
of the point the first thing i think we
should do is to get clear what the
muslims stand for now mr lincoln you
were explaining why people turn to the
muslim movement which is important
but as i understand reading your book
you say flatly the black muslims are
emphatically opposed to passive
resistance as expressed by martin luther
king or another quote muslims have only
contempt for the negro sit-in movement
now mr x
is that correct or is it not correct uh
america itself is opposed to passive
resistance they didn't uh america has
never in when the japanese uh uh
attacked pearl harbor america didn't
resort to me i'm not talking about
america at the moment i'm talking about
you mr axe in your movies yes sir i want
to clarify that because when they refer
to us as uh non-past non-passive they
make it look like we are committing a
crime to be non-passive in this uh and
this i'm simply asking is mr lincoln are
a scholar on this subject wrong or right
when he says that you and your movement
have only contempt for the negro sit-in
movement uh we have never voiced any
contempt for the signal for the uh negro
so-called negro sit-in movement uh
because we don't voice contempt for
movements but if this is the phrase
emphatically opposed are you
emphatically opposed uh we are opposed
to
forcing our way
into a white restaurant where we are not
wanted and forcing that man to serve us
we are opposed to that while the
honorable elijah muhammad who was our
religious leader and teacher teaches us
that it would be uh wiser for the black
people of america instead of begging the
white man for what he has and forcing
themselves upon him to try and get
something for ourselves and uh if i for
instance sir if i forced my way into a
restaurant in georgia and forced a white
man to serve me i would be insane to let
him go back in his kitchen and prepare
my food and then i sit down there and
eat it after he's prepared at my site
perhaps i am being stupid but it seems
to me you are not answering my question
what is your question my question is
maybe i'm not giving
when he says that you and your movement
are emphatically opposed to the sit-in
movement i say this we are emphatically
opposed to the methods
how about the objectives if you want to
use an integration
if an objective is to sit down in
another man's restaurant and drink a cup
of coffee when you don't yet have a
restaurant of your own then we have to
be against that type of objective
because after that negro comes out of
that restaurant having drunk the coffee
where will he work where is his job now
you are opposed to the means you say and
i gather you're also opposed to the end
because you are opposed to an integrated
society is that correct the uh sit-in
movement to us represents the
intense degree of dissatisfaction that
exists among the new generation of negro
and so-called negro in america
as such it is important because it shows
that the present generation of students
have lost their fear of the white man
that was in the parent uh 20 years ago
the average so-called negro in america
if he resented jim crow or uh
segregation he would only manifest that
resentment to the degree that he thought
the white man would allow him to or to
the degree he thought that he thought he
could do it without cause without
offending the white man but i have taken
too much of the table's time mr baldwin
i think i must say that the um
this argument about integration versus
segregation is just as unreal um in
terms of the muslim movement as is in
terms of the deep south or in terms of
the country in fact
one of the things in the record is this
has been an integrated country out in
spite of the fact that it uh it's been
illegal or or subrosa
integration is not something new
again we're not arguing about the aim of
the city movement is not to get a cup of
coffee it is not it's not even the first
one seven of the white restaurants is
not wanted it seems to me that as any
any aim at all the aim is to liberate
this country
and i mean when i say this country i
mean both blacks and whites mr baldwin
now you confuse me one can have two aims
in life if one is a negro one can be to
integrate white and black society and
make it one society the other can be to
create two separate societies one all
white and one all black
i understand mr lincoln's scholarly
study of the black muslim movement it is
for the division into an all-white and
all-black society
i would like to say that another thing
that the movement stands for and
with which i'm in complete agreement is
the greater interest in the negroes
acquiring an economic stake in this
civilization also in the
fine work of rehabilitation they've done
in some of their uh young members who
have been juvenile delinquents and
criminals and they've come out and by
virtue of the teaching they received
they've uh changed their way of life now
that's been done by other movements the
muslim movement has no monopoly on it
but they have done it and you have to
give
credit uh for that and so there is this
economic problem yes and uh there's also
the problem pardon me
but to clarify the economic program
would you would you add whether you
believe that the black muslim movement
wants the economic uplift of the negro
or once two separate economies
well they i don't know they may want two
separate economies but they are
interested in economic uplift of the
negro and i think that they deserve
great
credit for that mr lincoln would you
answer that question please so we can
get it clear
my experience has been and uh talking
with the muslim leaders about the
country that perhaps
the separate economy for which the
muslims seem to be working uh is a means
to an end
where whether the ultimate end is a
reintegrated society i doubt rather much
but nevertheless the muslims seem to
feel
that in our social structure as it now
stands that it is highly unlikely if not
altogether impossible for them to
have any real economic gains
therefore as i interpret the movement
they prefer to withdraw from a society
in which they cannot move upward to
establish a society of their own in
which uh there will be black men at all
levels and then as i understand the
movement to enter into the same kind of
political negotiations with the united
states as uh exists between various
other states uh at the present time as
separate entities yes there's separate
entities yes what about this issue of
force which we've got to get out here
one of the most discussed things about
the black muslim movement is the
frequent charge that is going to resort
to force because it believes in black
supremacy
and mr malcolm mr x you are always
quoted as having said there is no white
man a muslim can trust
mr muhammad is always quoted as having
said we must take things into our own
hands we must return to the mosaic law
of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
tooth what does it matter if 10 million
of us die there will be seven million of
us left and they will enjoy justice and
freedom etc etc uh it sounds like the
language of force is it
before you uh asked me to
clarify that i wish you would allow me
to comment on mr lincoln's last
statement concerning the separate
economy go right ahead uh although as
you say he studied it by me being a
muslim myself i think i can make it more
clear than the scholar
uh
america some of us scholars doubt that
proposition is too expeditious yes well
i don't doubt that myself
uh i think you'll agree with me though
sir that a separate economy already
exists between the so-called negro and
the white man in america
because there is a certain category in
which black people can get jobs and a
certain category in which they can't get
jobs their very economies are already
separate uh there's only so high that
they can go in various business fields
some business fields are shut out to
them completely even when a black man
goes into business uh and he is in the
selling business usually if he has a
successful business he's only a uh
every sale he makes as a resale because
he in order to have a commodity or goods
to sell he has to buy it from a white
man or another white man and which means
that no matter how large his store is
still all of the goods that are being
sold are being sold actually uh for the
white man because the black man who's in
business is not a producer he doesn't
produce that which he sells now we who
follow the honorable elijah muhammad are
taught that the black man even though he
goes into business will still be a
dependent person economically because he
must produce as long as the white man is
the producer that then the white man is
setting the price for the goods that the
black man has to sell in his own
neighborhood usually when a black man
goes into business he doesn't go into
business in a white neighborhood he goes
into business in a black neighborhood
and since he can only buy his goods from
a wholesaler who is white who gets it
from the producer who is also white the
he has to come back into his
neighborhood and jack the prices up to
get back the money from the uh that the
white man has already taken away from
this is your explanation i'm explaining
it clear so that it won't be uh
misunderstood so uh mr muhammad teaches
us that in order for us to be
economically independent we have to have
some land where we can set up our own
factories and be producers just like the
white man is a producer uh for his kind
mr schuyler you seem unhappy
well of course i'm unhappy because i
want to get back to the field of reality
uh
there's something like 200 000 negro
individual farmers in the united states
they raise cotton
corn they sell milk
and all of that but they're selling it
to uh white people and
the white people they are very hard put
if they didn't have this cotton and corn
and the meat and other things that negro
farmers raised
to buy from them and so it seems to me
that it's inherent in trade that you buy
and sell
nobody's stopping and they grow from
either buying or selling in the united
states many of them are doing
doing it all the time and i think it's a
perversion of the fact uh to uh say that
negro had no part in the economy that's
ridiculous uh the muslims they must be
have some part in it with fifteen
hundred thousand of them in labor unions
uh throughout the country and some of
them in the highest categories that i
know would be too long to list here now
if negroes have been able to devise ways
and means of getting more of these jobs
that is partially their own fault but
sir even though they're in these labor
unions they're yet the last ones hired
and the first ones fired
not necessarily and the greater
percentage of the unemployed right now
here in america according to secretary
goldberg's uh statement are the
so-called negroes despite the fact that
they belong to these unions and whatnot
that isn't entirely due to the fact that
they're negroes
i think there's something extremely
misleading and trying to talk about the
economy this way in fact as far as i can
tell the black the black economy and the
white economy are interdependent and
it's quite true that that negroes are
the first to be fired and the last to be
hired this is however there's nothing
this these details are obscuring the
point at the moment my question here is
how
i think it is uh i think we can take it
for granted the united states is not
about to give
uh away six or ten states therefore in
one way or another
the only way this will be achieved is
they will not be able to hold on to them
now the question is what happens then to
the this economy which negroes have i
think you say 20 million or 20 billion
dollars at their disposal this will no
longer be so if the system
under which this and which is obtained
no longer exists which is the only way
these states can be achieved then what
will the economy be
what will be what will be the future of
these hypothetical states
what uh will be their relationship not
only to the united states because by
this time as far as we can tell there
won't be anything with them in the
united states as we know it now it will
be at least another country it will be a
very different country and obviously a
much less powerful country it'll be a
black american american well it is
already on this continent already but
there will be the blacks all in some
states now whites now if i can if i can
say one more thing it seems to me this
is this this is
somehow the hub for me then the the root
of the irreality here the illusion of
white people in this country is that
they are living in a white country i
think that is a very dangerous illusion
you cannot have a white country with as
many negro as we as we have had in it
all these years to say nothing of the
effect on white people and the
interaction between white and black
people
of of of this terrible history
uh
i think the reality here is involved
with the same reality on the white side
of the fence i think that before we can
begin to talk about this or the any
liberation can be hoped for one has got
to really face the facts of what really
happened i know about the oppression the
lynchings and so forth that is only when
i know that situation now i'm not trying
to minimize this but this is not all
that happened this is not all that
happened a great many other things
happened too a great many other things
were achieved and whether or not this
i'm not talking about white good will
but the point is that history is also
immoral just as immoral as power is but
what history has produced in terms of
one's own personality and in terms of
the present facts
has has to be dealt with i don't see
that one is for example one hasn't got
to accuse the muslim movement of being a
hate movement you know but i do realize
from my own vantage point i'm a boy from
harlem too how desperately and how
deeply negroes hate white people now
white people don't want to know this and
protect and spend have spent all of my
lifetime anyway protecting themselves
against this knowledge negroes do not
tell them this either now this is the
ball and what i'm trying to find out is
whether the muslim movement does hate me
or not and whether it proposes to use
force to satisfy his hatred it is not i
don't seem to be able to get any place
in finding it out no it is not important
to know whether the muslim movement
clear that up it's not important to know
whether the muslim movement hates you or
not that is not that is not at all the
question they may or they may not that's
irrelevant but but the point is that
most negroes
most black people
most black people do not trust white
people and most negroes hate white
people and as long as this country as
the white people in this country use all
the fantastic invasions they do use to
protect themselves against this
knowledge there's one thing every white
man in this country knows he knows you
would like to be black here no matter
what else he doesn't know no and all the
liberal movements that i've ever been
associated with and all the liberals
almost all the liberals and the
exceptions only prove the rule
all the liberals that i've ever known
are
working day and night and not only um
not only uh in terms of not letting
anyone next door to them but in terms of
their own minds their own consciences
their own
way of life but to protect themselves
against the crime which for which they
know they are responsible now i cannot
this is this is what is important about
this i think when the future of the
country depends on it
if i
as a black man must be responsible every
day of my life for something i did not
do either if i must pay for
the history written in the color of my
skin someone's white people the great
the great pain about being in a girl
here is that you can never get across to
a white person the fact that you are
you are as human as he is and that he is
losing his humanity and so far as he
denies you yours this is a great
advantage of the muslim movement it
doesn't matter whether they hate you or
not
one's got to deal with the record um
well i marvel sometimes that
if as is said by the muslim speakers
that the white man has hated the negro
since he has been on earth
why is white man done so much
to help the negro for example i noticed
they abolished the slave trade in
africa and from here to africa and i
don't know whether any of the muslim
states have done that they've set up
schools and clinics and hospitals and
asylums and all the colleges throughout
all black africa i don't know that
anybody can point out one muslim college
or university south of egypt and morocco
in africa for the education of
black people now these things have been
done and it doesn't seem to me that this
is the action of people that hate a
whole people
of course there are white people who
hate negro but i don't see any reason or
justification for exaggerating the
situation
may i mr baldwin party may i come back
just from the purposes of clarification
to try to get mr x's comment
on the statements first that his
movement stands for black supremacy
secondly that it intends to bring it
about by the use of force
uh if by supremacy you mean rule
uh the fact that the white man has been
ruling for so long uh is which is white
supremacy and most of your white
historians and your even your current
politicians and diplomats admit that the
trouble that the white world is in today
is losing out all over the world britain
used to rule an empire so large she
bragged about the sun would never set on
it but today when the sun rises you
can't hardly find
and your leader is quoted in mr
lincoln's book as saying that he wants
to use an eye for an eye a tooth for a
tooth and he wants to end white rule in
the u.s he wants to overthrow it to use
the quotation if mr lincoln said that mr
lincoln is one thousand percent wrong
what does he mean by the quotation then
we must take things into our own hands
what does it matter if 10 million of us
die there will be seven million of us
left if you have men uh if you have uh
crimes such as those that were committed
against emmett till
and the government itself could go into
mississippi and find the exact culprits
who committed the crime or the type of
crime that was committed against matt
parker and again the government agents
go in there and find the culprits who
were guilty of murdering mack parker and
then turn around and in the government
admit that it is not able to bring those
murderers to justice i think that it
would be insane on the part of any man
to uh deny the family of mack parker or
the family of emmett till the right to
come together and defend themselves
since the government admits that it
can't it is helpless to defend him i
take that to be your justice
america is justified in retaliating and
retaliating against japan when japan
strikes her or retaliating against
germany when germany strikes her or
retaliating against any other country to
defend herself from attack i think that
america has reached the point of
insanity to think that the world would
look upon the black people here in
america as being wrong if they took a
stand to defend themselves against the
crime that the white man is committing
against us here day and night i don't
see why you don't answer the man's
question are you full force or are you
against a force if you're four force and
use of force then that's sedition why
don't you level on the thing instead of
curving off is it right no uh
since it is islam and the muslims who
are being discussed here
and it is islam and the muslims who are
uh under fire i think that it is only
right uh to expect me to get to expect
me to give you my answer not someone
else's answer because this is what
primarily has been done here in america
uh everyone else speaks for the muslims
and they're not allowed to speak for
themselves now you don't put a yes and
no answer today in the mouth of any
black man other perhaps than mr scott
nobody uh um speaking this is it that's
correct
mr mr lincoln would you like to comment
on this or any related point as to what
the real program is is it a program of
force or not
from what i have been able to determine
the muslims are very careful
not to
talk about the use of force
now in the early days of the of my
research on the movement
it was stated among muslims that they
looked forward to a sort of day of
armageddon that was to take place around
1970 yeah when the white man in america
would be overthrown and when the black
man would come into what was considered
to be i challenge that and i think
you're a thousand percent pardon me mr x
let him finish that you can comment on
you
but
at the same time mr x uh
it is true that muslims have awarded as
i said uh any um
direct reference to the use of force and
in more recent times the muslims have
tended to say that allah himself am i
correct no you're wrong in the front in
the first part and you're right in the
last part we have the honorable elijah
muhammad has never taught us that we
ourselves are going to fight the white
man
uh but he has taught us that there will
come a day when god will destroy evil
from the face of this earth god will do
it he has never proof of the matter is
we never carry arms we're probably the
only black group in america as large as
we are who can absolutely say at a
meeting that we have that not one man in
that audience has arms in his pocket or
alcohol in his head and i think that
it's absurd to stand around and accuse
the black muslims of advocating violence
when we've never been in the during the
entire 30 years that the honorable
elijah muhammad has been teaching here
in america we have never been involved
in any aggressive acts against any white
people and any time their violence has
occurred and even the newspapers have to
admit this and the police whenever we've
been involved in any violence it has
always been at a time when we ourselves
were attacked because we one thousand
percent don't believe that a man should
turn the other cheek when there's knots
on his cheek already and the man is
going to put some more knots on his
cheek we can't see that
before
yes go ahead may i respond to mr x's
statement
uh you talk about putting words in
people's mouths now i have pointed out
very clearly uh in my book
that the muslims do not
initiate aggression i have pointed out
very clearly that they do not carry arms
i have pointed out clearly that they
are taught
not to initiate aggression and that they
must not even have so much of the
fingernail file in their pockets correct
and always obey the law
always obey the law
you're confusing me it's you who wrote
the description of the fruit of islam
the secret army and said they received
training in judo military and their
military drill and the use of knives and
blackjacks the fruit of islam looks
forward to playing a heroic role in the
impending battle of armageddon reference
lincoln page 201 let me finish
i said that they do not
commit aggression so far what they're
going to do in the future nobody knows
to talk to muslims themselves uh where
does the black jacks and the knives come
in with muslims
well
they reform
they search for them everyone who comes
into the mosque
uh
that are set up here in america under
the spiritual guidance of the honorable
elijah muhammad is checked thoroughly
because we're absolutely against any
kind of aggression or weapons that one
can use in aggression well if there's
such peace lovers then why do you have
to search them uh that's the question
that comes to my mind mr schuyler uh the
thing that i can't understand on this uh
violence and hate business
uh they rockwell this so-called nazi who
wanted to give a speech down in uh in
the village was uh was stoned by the
jews and the jews were never accused of
violence or hate he was stoned in boston
by the jews and the jews never were
accused of violence and hate yet the man
hadn't done anything but he wanted to
make a speech yet anytime a muslim or a
black man he doesn't have to be a muslim
stands up here in america and mentions
that it's time for him to try and defend
himself not from someone's doctrine but
from the actual violence that is
committed against him then that black
man is accused of being violent and uh
just because we remind uh the public of
the crimes that were committed against
our people here in america during
slavery we're accused of advocating a
hate campaign but right now you turn on
your television your radio and all of
your press and you'll see nothing on
there about eichmann and what the
germans did to the jews a thousand years
ago and yet the jews aren't accused of
of carrying on a uh uh hate campaign to
actually talk at great length and
monopolize a considerable amount of time
however i would
like to say that one of the things that
was in mr lincoln's book that intrigued
me was the fact that
this muslim movement is run as a kind of
a dictatorship itself there haven't been
any elections
people have tried without
having anything to say about it and
cast into the outer limbo the women are
dissubordinated and have no voice uh
within the movement now uh that didn't
sound seem to me like something new in
the world it seemed to me to be pretty
reactionary you wrote in the pittsburgh
courier mr scholar about the muslim
movement yourself on may 30th 1959 at
which time you said from what i have
seen and heard about the program of the
black muslims in this country in the
past few years i conclude that there is
much to commend it uh to other sex and
religious groups many of whom seem to be
distressingly unwitting in their way i
just said that you also pointed out that
not only do the muslims believe in it
meaning this economic progress but they
are doing it they are not only preparing
and serving their food but they are
growing it this is what you wrote you
says that you also said uh we are alone
in not doing this in regards to setting
up economic enterprises for ourselves so
we are always writing the t rattling the
tin cup and begging for sucker
you see that's what you get for trying
to be nice now uh i just told mr x here
a little while ago that this was a part
of the muslim movement which i commended
very highly i don't you don't have to go
back to what i wrote a year or so ago i
said that this afternoon i say it again
but uh you haven't dealt with the issue
that i raised about the movement
being dictatorial itself uh sir if
because we have unity
no sir if because we have complete unity
and again the worst critics of the
honorable elijah muhammad give him
credit for establishing better
discipline and unity among his followers
than has ever been established among any
so-called negroes in america and uh
uh anytime there is unity in any country
that is uh a po that is that has a
philosophy or a doctrine or an aim
that's uh in opposition to these to the
power of uh existing blind mr schuyler
wants to come in and we have to move on
to another point mr scholar you want to
adopt this point now i don't think you
men are going to agree well of course
we'll never agree and we i won't drop it
but uh i will not want to monopolize the
time
mr schuyler has made an issue
about about the our religion and about
the muslims being the one who created
all this uh uh he made the point i think
i want to clear it up he has made an
issue about our religion pardon anything
that muslims call you to order here mr
schuyler has dropped the point so that
we can move to something else i want to
bring mr baldwin in here if i may
because i've been very much interested
in your articles in harper's and the
times and so forth in which you explain
the whole negro mood part of which is
expressed through the black muslims as
in part of reaction to world events
particularly africa
uh and this is a new negro you say now
in these terms uh it's it's quite
interesting to me to read of the alleged
connections uh between the back muslims
and the muslims in africa
and between the black muslims and the
castro movement in cuba do you know
anything about this
no i don't know anything about that in
detail
but i um
another thing about the muslim movement
in africa at all so i can't talk about
that but of course it is making great
progress in it as you know i know that
do you see this is a worldwide movement
at all which would appeal to the negro
uh
well
can i put it you know it seems to me to
be arguing in a way almost after the
fact what if you're talking about power
it is very very clear that the western
nations the white nations that
that power is broken uh the connection
between cuba and american israel as i
can see very well because uh the way
that the united states role in cuba and
especially the events of the last few
weeks the last few months
are exactly analogous to the mind of any
negro living in this country to the
situation he finds himself in here now
that
again i have to come back to this to
this um this point
we are really talking about power and we
cannot argue with the muslim movement in
those terms because i repeat this
they're only imitating they're really
they're simply doing the same thing that
the white world has done for all these
years now that has been my objection to
the muslim movement
it seems to me that what what we in this
country do not know and have not faced
is that we can very well isolate
ourselves on this continent because the
world is no longer white
at all we do not know what to do
this
in the first place when we're talking
about i i think the malcolm
x mr x and um and i don't agree entirely
with mr scala either
or all the white or white americans i
don't know what white men have in the
first place which is so desirable i
don't know why it's so important to be
white anymore it seems to me the
civilization which we are now
witnessing in a way if not the end of
the great transformation on can only be
saved by us in this country if we're
willing to do something which we have
not done what would we do mr baldwin in
your opinion do you do you favor the
black muslim program or do you favor the
program of let us say the naacp
well i think you're trying to get this i
think the naacp program is probably
outmoded because
if when you have a situation where the
legality of a country is not is in
question when one does not know what is
legal anymore when it's got to revise
the entire system well the naacp says
what is legal is the integration of
american life what is legal then in what
is illegal in mississippi
how does one achieve it then in
mississippi the naacp says you keep
trying until you achieve mr extra mr x
responds it'd be not really he says he's
impatient mr x responds and says he will
not wait a hundred years ah he says
something else he says he doesn't want
it either i say wait a moment no don't
say what i say i say that the black
masses themselves in america are
impatient and that the white man does
not know how the black masses think any
more than he knew how the the peasants
in cuba thought when he went in there
and thought that they would rise up
inside with him now you said the white
man does not know and i'm i'm sure i
don't know he doesn't know sir he
doesn't know because he's not being told
by his uh so-called negro advisers or
the ones that he has set up as spokesman
for the for the so-called negro well
pardon me these so-called advisors i
thought were men of some knowledge about
the negro community they never live in
the negro community ralph bunch has
denounced you as a totally escapist
movement roy wilkins executive secretary
of the naacp says you are preaching pure
hatred thurgood marshall called you so
many such violent names i won't repeat
that i hear each other martin luther
king says you are simply one of the hate
groups arising in our midst
wait a moment sir i think that in
fairness since these things that you
read to your audience television
audience as well as right here uh in
order for you to be fair i have to make
my comments go ahead uh uh number one
these so-called negro leaders that made
these statements uh is contrary to our
policy ever to attack anyone personally
only in defense and i think that the uh
each one that you read off you couldn't
find them in harlem the only time you
ever see any one of those that are uh
made spokesmen by you parents by the
white men uh you never find them in
harlem you find them at the waldorf
astoria and as so far as them knowing
how the black man out there in the
street thinks all you have to do is do
like john griffin this white man who
posed as a negro did for six weeks he
was a pseudo-negro and yet he comes back
today and he's an expert on how a negro
is supposed to feel and we've been black
all of our lives and when we step up and
try and tell you how a black man who is
born black fields you think that we're
haters or racists or something of that
sort and i think that if women just want
to come in yes i'm from harlem too i was
born on those streets and raising them
and i think i know something about it
too
uh
what all the all of the condemnations
from mr bunch et cetera et cetera et
cetera are all far too simple
the challenge of this movement
represents and i think it's very much
even you think about it simply as a
movement the challenge movement
represents is nothing to do with what
they call themselves or even what what
their aims are whether mr x is willing
to say what the aims are or whether or
not we will have we know
the challenges this this movement
represents is finally whether or not
this country means to be what it says it
is does it are we free or are we not
and we can only decide this one way if
the country if the country wants to be
free then it has got to do something to
prove it and as long as as long as we're
not willing to do it then the muslim
movement will gain more and more and
more ground and not only here but all
over the world if we if it means we say
i think we should put the governor
mississippi in jail as opposed to
putting people who harmless people who
challenge house and american activities
committee in jail
i think it's
i think that what is going on inside
when i still don't have clear whether
you favor the black muslim program or
the naacp program
two different approaches but i cannot i
will not answer it that way i certainly
don't play with the black muslim
movement
no but i can see great let me see why it
came about you see very well why it came
about i think mr lincoln has explained
in his book very well why i don't think
so i don't think that he has i don't
think that's any mystery very well why
it came about
or how it uh exists uh for instance in
there where it was said in the book that
i spent two hours in a secret
conversation with castro that wasn't
done on any research other than through
a local new york paper uh whom we are
suing right now for three million
dollars for libel for uh we have a three
million dollar libel suit
against the new york paper for saying
that i spent two hours in a secret
conference with castro now if that's an
authentic statement and that's
representative of the other statements
in the book then i can say that the book
is representative of muslims i must
respond to that mr exit was from you
yourself i think you're wrong
i am not wrong on this case uh it was
from you yourself a lot from reading in
any new york paper that i found that you
had had an appointment which you kept
with mr castro these words are from your
mouth no wait a minute now clarify that
two of us and i think allah that there
were two uh in a conversation with you
explained about this uh highly
publicized incident with castro and we
told you exactly how it came about that
i was representing the city of the the
mayor's office and the police department
and half of the civic groups in harlem
that uh made it possible to go to the
library
that when we have only seven minutes
left
about five minutes
this particular sect or movement is just
one of the succession of such movements
that have been in american life for the
last three centuries among negroes they
began
in the
around about 1815
when the american colonization movement
began to grow and the negroes went to
sierra leone they went to liberia and
since then these movements have been
recurrent on the eve of the civil war
major martin r delaney had gone to the
west coast of africa and signed treaties
with african chiefs
showing that he had
a considerable following and this
thought has been in people's minds for a
long time it isn't anything new but mr
scholar i take it to be mr baldwin's
point and in mr lincoln's point in his
book that there is a new situation in
the moment yes i don't think i must i
think that it is it is misleading to to
talk about even garvey
any of the movements which
the movement of the twenties
movements there's one great difference
between them if only one there's the
difference is africa you know this is
this way
this makes a great deal of difference
but i wanted i really want to repeat
this point i think the only way to to to
to challenge this movement or to cut it
undercut it is to so this country to do
something he doesn't seem to be prepared
to do which is to become really
overnight a radical country when i say
radical i mean to really re-examine and
overhaul the entire social fabric to ask
everyone in this country should ask
himself why it's so important to be
white and what they will lose if they
admit to themselves
because admit to themselves that i'm not
i've i personally speaking only now for
myself you know
i can't imagine anything this country
can offer me that i no longer want
and this and what has happened to me it
seems to me has happened to everyone in
every negro in this country and the only
way this can be redeemed and we can
prevent
as i as i say a reversal a repetition of
this history with the roles reversed
is to decide and to decide right now
that this country either everyone in
this country is free either i'm either
i'm a man
or i am not and is that the country it's
up to the country to decide it it is not
really it is not really any longer up to
me
it is lincoln i don't think you agree
with that from reading your book well i
certainly agree with it in part
um whether it is the black muslim
movement or whether it's naacp whether
it's the sit ends or whether it's the
southerly southern christian leadership
conference under mr king
one of the objectives is certainly
identical to all of these uh various
expressions and that is the essential
freedom and the identification
of the negro
now
whether he goes about it in the way of
the muslims or whether he goes about it
in some other way
i believe that this has to come about in
this country and it has to come rather
soon this i do say
in my book this country cannot continue
to exist
uh black and white either we're going to
have to be americans are we going to
continue to be played with all kinds of
organizations if the black muslims did
not exist then some other group would
exist in that place to fill this room mr
skyler i think you disagree even more
sharply with mr baldwin
well i just simply think that
there's a lot of wishful thinking in
many of these uh statements i see no
statistical evidence of all this i've
been all over the country i don't know
the mass and negroes are pending to join
the black muslims just like they weren't
planning to join garvey there are
certain elements that will because you
have all kinds of people in any group
negro group is like any other group you
have everything in it and there's never
going to be any unity of all the negroes
and i think it would be a catastrophe if
it works
perhaps
perhaps they will never be a
unimate among legal also would be uh
most anomalous if if they're this should
come about but there is i think with mr
baldwin a sharpening of the negro mood a
kind of insistence that he must pardon
me i want mr x to have a word here
before we have to close just a word yes
uh i don't think that all of the muslims
who follow mr muhammad read the book
that is the those the leaders and we
actually don't think that it rightly
represents us and uh mr muhammad's aim
is this his he was uh raised by god to
separate the black man in america from
the white man because the white man will
not give us freedom justice and equality
on his own and he also teaches us that
if uh white america can't give the black
man in america complete recognition as a
human being immediately right here then
we have to separate and god will give it
to us and the he also teaches us that
all of the trouble that america is
having just like pharaoh had trouble in
the bible because he mistreated the
slaves every trouble political and
otherwise i have the cut off no i'm
sorry for this discussion thank you
mr eric lincoln mr james baldwin and mr
george styler good afternoon ladies and
