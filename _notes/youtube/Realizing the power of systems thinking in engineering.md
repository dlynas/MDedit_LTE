Realizing the power of systems thinking in engineering
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_qdRrj7nyo)

## Transcript:
there are
months
so the systems
complexes
Espana
let me switch to English language for
the benefit of our prestigious speaker
my name is Bernardo Del Ricardo and the
facilitator of this conference program
on behalf of inkosi
welcome everyone thank you Gary Smith
our guest speaker today
also thank you all the participants from
Spain and Spanish-speaking countries and
worldwide
once again let me say that we would not
be here without a Spanish Navy and
incosity to make happen this conference
program let's all show our appreciation
for them
instant thinking uh sorry assistant
engineering could no could not assist
without system thinking
the sense of system thinking is in sin
the world in a particular way
seeing the wholeness instead of Parts
because how you see things affects the
way you approach situations or undertake
a specific engineering test
the practice of system engineering is a
balance between
systemic and systematic aspects systemic
aspect taking advantage of system
thinking means
thinking about the whole system its
contents and stakeholders on the other
hand systematic
aspect means following an instructor
approach to the realization of the
system
some people seem to have a natural
talent for system thinking
yes a sun have natural talent to play
piano
but most people find it rather
occur
and difficult at first
this is why our conference today is
about system thinking
our presentation today is realizing the
power of system thinking in engineering
it is time for a grand leap in our
system engineering capability our
programs and projects are by necessity
becoming increasingly complex Duty due
to the interconnectedness
of everything and the potential that
this interconnect interconnectedness
and uh
and this is sorry complexity requires
and demands greater appreciation from
complexity brings
we did the potential for powerful
Solutions
and yet
at the same time powerful problems
in our system engineering our body of
knowledge has evolves
holistically to help our profession make
sense of and deal with such problems
because it in collaboration with
International Society for the assistant
science
has been working to create
holistic framework for system science
is proposed is to provide the means to
organize
the pursuit and practice of system
knowledge as a learning system
engineering and system printing
experience has played a beetle role a
vital role in shaping the architecture
of this framework and when these
heuristics are
place in the context of the whole new
insights and connections emerge
since
when you place holistic heuristics in
the context of the whole the system
science for anger
it gives a deeper meaning every stitch
do not stand alone and become part of a
greater system
a greater system that will Empower our
engineering
based on scientific principles
as I said earlier Darius meet is our
guest speaker today
Gary Smith is an inkosi except a senior
expert assistant engineer at Airbus
defense and space
where he is engaged in the system of
system engineering and organizational
transformation program
there he is the bipresident of system
practice
for the international Society for system
science and is The Impossible
liaison
and relationship manager he is the
senior editor for
the assistant Foundation session of the
system engineering body of knowledge
Gary
has applied system thinking to
understand the nature of disease in
living systems
and this functions
in organizations
with Bridget Daniel Allegro proposed the
system tree as a framework for
systemic contents
this incorporate the attitudes of the
system thinker
and the concepts they think about
when they
when
sorry they think about when seeking to
understand and engage in systems
speaking I met Gary working in a in
Airbus long time ago I spiraled the
corporate Community working on system
engineering involved in incocie I can
only say that Gary is a privileged mind
in system thinking consistent science
and finally please use the chat in teens
for your questions we will use the last
10 minutes for your question and answers
we will try to address some of them
just now time for our guest speaker I
live in the capable hands of Gary during
the
The Nest 40 minutes I give the floor to
Gary please Gary
that's very kind of you thank you
Bernardo and um thank you for the
invitation and to be able to present
um
so can you see my screen is it coming
through yeah okay great yeah
so yeah so the title is realizing the
power of systems thinking
um in engineering
um
as as Bernard said uh you know uh in
terms of the systematic and and although
it's also the the systemic aspects in
systems engineering
um
this is the the contents of the overall
talk and and what I wanted to do was to
to split it into three parts really the
first part is is looking at the
challenges that we face in our projects
our programs and also our everyday lives
um I'll then go on to explain
um some Essentials about system science
um its foundations and and how systems
thinking
um is integrated into that into that
overall framework and then I will then
go on to uh really the the the the main
part the juicy part really which is uh
where we explain how that the science
and systems thinking can be used to
empower our practice
um but in in order to be able to do that
I I need to to go through these these
parts first in in order to give you the
the context and and the concepts so that
this part really makes sense
so that's that's the overall structure
I'll also be referring to the the kind
of fin framework which some of you may
have come across this this has been
um very useful
um in uh bringing together the overall
system science
um and also for providing
um a great way of making sense of the
chaotic the complex the complicated and
the clear
so I'll make reference to that a few
times
so just just very quickly with with my
background so originally I was a chemist
um and my background in chemistry has
has been influential
um in my thinking about systems and in
my thinking about system science
um as it was mentioned in the
introduction I've applied systems
thinking
um and systems Design Concepts looking
at biosystem complexity in my spare time
and I've published a number of papers on
things like cancer and inflammation and
sepsis and I've also
contributed to a recent paper on covid
as well so this is one of the things
that I do to help me really with my
systems thinking because this forces you
to systems think when you're working in
a domain which is which is not familiar
to you
um in in my background at Airbus I was
um I have been an architect for uh
border security systems
um and again there's been some some very
interesting parallels between border
security
um in in the in in the engineering
context
um and and looking at uh essentially
biosystem security
um in biological systems there's a lot
of parallels
um and I'll talk a little bit about
parallels and uh the power of analogy as
we go through the talk
um you know it's been mentioned that you
know I have I have some associations
with uh within cozy and also the
international Society for system
sciences and and Bridget and I did some
work together on on something which we
called the systems tree
um so these are the concepts that the
systems thinker thinks about and and
these are the if you like the attitudes
of the systems thinker and this is one
of my bookshelves at home
um and I think this tells you a little
bit about my background as well there's
a mix of uh of science the op University
which has been very influential
um books on philosophy and psychology
um I I also do a lot of role playing
well I have done role playing in my in
the past things like Dungeons and
Dragons I read a lot of Science Fiction
um you know and also things like Harry
Potter and Terry Pratchett and stuff
like that so yeah I'm a bit of a strange
person I guess
um
so this is a slide that Bridget and I
used before so systems thinking is what
you have to do when you're faced with
the inexplicable uh the unaccountable
unexplainable you know when things just
don't make sense this is when you have
to apply systems thinking
um and Captain jarrow is is Captain Jack
Sparrow from the Pirates of the
Caribbean he's one of our heroes because
he says the problem is not the problem
the problem is your attitude about the
problem do you understand and really
when you do systems thinking what you're
doing is you're changing the way that
you think that's what systems thinking
does
and when you do that you can get new
understanding
um so I'm now going to go into the uh
the the challenges
um and you know just a reminder there
are some really big Global challenges
um that are facing us at the moment you
know climate change pandemics
um you know all sorts of things that
that that are arising because our world
is becoming more and more complicated
and and we've moved into a geological a
new geological age called the
anthropocene where humankind are at is
actually changing the very geology of
our planet
um
and um this little diagram here from
from Bernard and Ray is nice because
they say I spy complexity confusion but
I can organize exploration of it as a
learning system
um and you know there is far too much to
know but one of the things that we're
trying to do with system science is to
create essentially create a framework
for all of our system knowledge
foreign
a few years ago is we had a we had we
had a workshop with a very diverse group
of people and we asked them
um in that session to consider what were
the key things that they considered to
be
um non-systemic what were the what were
the features of being non-systemic and
we've now labeled these as essentially
systemic pathologies and these were the
Clusters
so we've got around this cluster
isolation pain sadness no sense of
nature lack of information knowledge and
appreciation no vision of the future
situation here we've got confusion in
complexity not seeing the connection
flow of causality having a perspective
Gap
limited choices resource and energy gap
going in the wrong direction
unintended consequences and not seeing
the big picture so these are the things
that tend to happen when you're not
systems thinking or when you're not
being systemic and these are the things
that we see not just in our everyday
lives but also in in our programs on our
projects
and when we look at the impact of
complexity and confusion in projects
there's some great work from the
Standish group with their chaos reports
and they show that
um there is a strong correlation with
um with success challenged and failed in
in in terms of complexity so very
complex projects
only 15 of them
um are successful truly successful you
know time cost and quality 50 57 of them
um have major issues with with you know
not not achieving the the full scope of
the project and 28 of them are actually
canceled because they realize that the
projects you know they just cannot
achieve any any meaningful success so
they do the right thing and they cancel
them
and when we look at the the reason why
projects and programs fail
um these are the these are some of the
main issues that came out of that and
these were reported by by project
managers attending um training so 36
related to poor organizational project
management practices 20 to poorly
defined or missing project objectives
and 15 related to ineffective project
planning so this is really the impact of
complexity and confusion in these
projects
um another factor is the the
relationship between the systems
Engineers
um and the project management discipline
um there was um there was some great
work done by in cozy in combination with
PMI and MIT and they did a survey of
program managers and and chief engineers
and and one of the the biggest
factors for uh what they called
um
uh tension between the two disciplines
was a lack of integrated planning that
this was the number one uh root cause of
of issues
um and it's a major Factor Why by
complex project programs fail because
the the relationship between systems
engineering and project management is so
important so if these two disciplines
aren't working together effectively this
leads to you know major challenges
another great uh report from that um
alliance between the three three
organizations is the guide to lean
enablers for managing engineering
programs and this really is a must-read
uh publication for any program managers
and systems Engineers who are working in
complexity
so this multiple cause and effects
diagram shows ultimately the pathways to
reactive program execution and
firefighting
um
but um
is it is it not just really insufficient
appreciation of the required complexity
and the organization necessary to deal
with it and and one of the things that
is important is is what takes place
right at the very beginning in terms of
the acquisition and the Contracting
processes if these things aren't
supporting sufficient program planning
then firefighting will result
and there's there's this statement from
Alexander bogdanov in 1917 who has been
very very influential in um in system
science and and the development of
system science and he said a disordered
whole is practically less than the sum
of its parts and I think that's that's a
really great statement
now if we look at the the impact of
technical debt and the insufficient
appreciation of complexity
um prior to project startup which which
some associate with with contract award
um if you don't do enough investigation
of the problem and the solution and
enough preparation up front you will end
up with an effort curve which looks like
this
and and this is essentially not doing
the right things at the right time this
is work that's come from the in cozy
pmse integration working group
um and this is a great piece of work
uh you know the ideal profile is
something that looks more like this
which is where you you have a really
good appreciation of the problem and the
solution you formulate for instance your
product breakdown structure your work
breakdown structure
um you know what it is that you have to
do
um before you start doing the work
um if you don't do that you end up with
a curve that looks like this which is
which is a very painful experience on on
complex projects
and one again one reason for this is is
what I call a terrible divide in
understanding
where you have a proposal phase and you
have a team who are responsible for
making the proposal
um their mission is accomplished when
the proposal is is completed and then a
brand new team comes into play after the
contract and the responsibility is now
under the project management
and because you've not sufficiently
prepared
with your understanding you have a cost
type quality triangle which looks like
this
but then when you start the program it
actually turns out to be much more
complex and much more difficult than you
thought and the scope is a lot bigger
and because the budgets have already
been established
um it's very very difficult to get back
on track
so I I think again this is this is one
of the this is one of the problems that
we face
um and systems engineering really
matters because it addresses complexity
when it is done at the right time in the
right way
um I had a conversation with Kevin
felsberg a few years ago who was really
one of the uh the leaders in the
establishment of in cozy and he said to
me that systems engineering is really
about clearing away the fog and making
things clear and I think that's really
important
when we look at the amount of effort
which is spent on systems engineering
um in NASA there is a close correlation
between the the level of effort which is
spent and the level of program overrun
so when we're talking about 3.0 here
we're talking about 300 cost overrun and
in this particular case there was no
effort applied on systems engineering
The Sweet Spot seems to be somewhere
around 12 to 16 percent of the of effort
on a on a program being spent on systems
engineering
um some more work which has come out of
the in cozy scpm integration working
group has been using cosismo as a way of
uh looking at the the cost of the
assumptions that are made prior to
contract
um and the ones in red are the
assumptions that were made prior to
contract and the ones in blue
are are the reality of the situation
once the program has started so so here
the requirements understanding a
contract was considered to be
0.77 which was high but actually it
turned out to be low
um architectural understanding was
considered to be high but it turned out
to be low and when you multiply up all
of these factors what it essentially
means is that in instead of you needing
let's say 100 hours for systems
engineering you needed 533 hours and and
that escalates across the whole of the
program though in this particular
program which is a real program the cost
increase was 500 percent of the overall
budget
um as a result of these um assumptions
that were made which turned out to be
false
so that's one of the reasons why um
systems engineering and systems thinking
is so important right at the very
beginning
so now I'm going to go on to uh system
science and the dawn of of what I'm
calling Applied systemics so I'm going
to go through what is system science
what are the foundations and how systems
thinking heuristics are integrated into
that
and I'll make reference to to many
different works I think it's important
for me to also explain that the what I'm
explaining here is is is not just my
work it's been the work of collaboration
across many people
so what's this system science all about
so
Richard Beasley I had his permission to
say this so he he wears a badge and on
his badge so he Bridges it in cozy ESF
as well and on his battery so systems
are everywhere and everything
and and really this is what the system
science is about it's about all of these
systems
it's about it's about these cosmological
systems the biological systems the human
civilization systems the social systems
the ecosystems so systems are everywhere
and everything
and the idea of system science is it
would be a systematic and systemic uh
Enterprise that discovers develops and
organizes system knowledge in the form
of testable explanations and predictions
about the universe
and the reason why we have the potential
for a system size is because there are
general concepts patterns principles and
assets that are truly transdisciplinary
and go across all of the different types
of subjects it goes across physics
chemistry biology sociology and even
politics and economics there are certain
principles and Concepts which span all
of these different types of systems
um and when you look at
um
the emergence of these systems in these
different system levels we can see that
there is a process a natural process of
integration emergence and
diversification
which results in these in these levels
and and ever greater complexity
so system Sciences is about all of this
stuff
and and there there is a grand pattern
which we experience and across all of
these systems
and and I I can I can explain it in the
context of of kind of thing
which was the work of David Snowden and
others
but I can also relate this to our
engineering experience as well
so in in the center of of the model we
have nature and Society is a greater
whole and and this is this is both the
beginning and the end in in terms of
data
and from data we derive information we
make observations we have ideas and this
is where we work out why
and and in the kind of thing model this
is referred to as as the domain of the
perceived chaotic
um when we when we encounter this area
we we identify Illuminating information
theories and Concepts and we build
Frameworks
and these Frameworks are our knowledge
our architectures and this is where we
appreciate complexity this is where we
work out what
and then with our architectures our
structures and our patterns these then
provide the enabling constraints for our
designs
and this is where we apply our
principles
and and this is where we
um we deal with and master the
complicated through our designs and we
bring together power and forces
to manipulate energy and mass create our
assets through realization and when
these when these assets are then applied
in nature and Society
um sometimes we get surprises
nice surprises but also
um surprises that we weren't expecting
and and that brings with it new
opportunities and and the potential for
for new ideas a new Frameworks and new
principles
and when we when we consider that
in the context of the scientific method
we can see again the same pattern
applicable to science
um and
the uh the engagement
in in terms of principles
and the creation of of our Technologies
and our systems
and and over here we have the the ideas
the theories the hypotheses which we use
to build our Frameworks our
architectures and then within those
architectures we then apply our
principles to create our our systems and
our Solutions
so what I'm now going to introduce you
to is is the idea of transformational
powers
so there are nine powers
and and the the use of these Powers will
become more clear as we go through the
presentation but there are nine powers
and and these these Powers over here are
let's say more um
more feeling
and over here we have powers which are
more tangible so these are the tangible
powers
so these are we have with the power of
spirit philosophy and Theory over here
and these are powers that we engage with
when we're conceptualizing and
architecting
um we then go into the technical
the action potential which is where
we're um we're using that power when we
do design
when we're implementing our designs we
make decisions
um and we there is a power of design
Aesthetics and design Aesthetics then
has an impact on social
and um we also have political as a power
which is used essentially to to turn all
of these these wheels around
so
conceptualizing again architecting
designing and realizing
another thing I'm going to introduce you
to is is the idea of fit Form and
Function which many of you will have
heard of before
um and again there are there are reasons
why I'm showing you these things so so
four
in in form we're dealing with topics
like the system identity the
characteristics and Its Behavior and and
these are the limits of the system
self-control
and and these are the powers that are
applicable in this particular area that
the powers to to to transform form
essentially
um here we have a function and and this
is the this is where we we consider the
system Place its purpose and its life
cycle so again you know classically
relating to you know the Criterion that
is met when the part system performs its
stated purpose effectively in
reliability these are the powers that
are at play here
um and then there's the The Wider space
the context within that which that
system is playing its part
and and this is the the possibility
space the situational context the
stakeholder perspective so this is this
is where the the the fitness of the
system is judged by the external context
and and here we're dealing with the the
power of spirit social and dystolic
design Aesthetics
foreign I think yeah so yeah I'll I'll
leave you to that I don't want to talk
too much about that because I'm just
trying to slowly build up a picture now
when we take the the concepts of form
function of fit
um
we we have two knowledge areas related
to this identity and behavior so the
togetherness of things and the
relationship of things this this is the
domain of form and these are the system
Concepts that we use when we observe and
we talk about uh identity and behavior
things like structure components
boundaries boundedness and here we're
talking about activity Dynamics
influences interactions
these are the concepts related to cycles
and capability
these are the concepts related to value
and Consciousness so here we're talking
about the experience of things and the
value of things so and and the concepts
we're using here are things like
perspective judgment circumstances when
we're talking about Consciousness we're
talking about awareness understanding
empathy comprehension and what you can
see is on this on this Matrix which
shows the uh the the five let's say
phases across the top
um
what what we do on on this Matrix is we
show the intersection of these stages
with these knowledge categories
and now what we do is we place the
powers
and the problems the pathologies onto
this framework
so what you can see is for instance
um you know the power of the technical
can be used to help resolve confusion
and complexity the power of technical
can can help to resolve the issue of not
seeing the connection flow of causality
and the power of technical can also help
to resolve issues of limited choices
and over here we have the the assets
which are created when we apply
these kinds of principles and these
principles would be derived from these
theories
um so the idea of this framework is is
we were able to essentially plug in all
of our knowledge about systems within
this framework as an organized whole
and using the framework you would be
able to access this knowledge in the
pursuit of for instance systems
engineering processes and and that's
what I'll be talking about in in the
final section there's a little bit more
Theory necessary for us to get there
first
so
um what I've done is I've taken this
framework and and what we've done is
we've mapped in
um many many Frameworks heuristic
Frameworks
um of systems thinking
so for instance uh systems thinking Made
Simple the ways of the systems thinker
the habits of the systems thinker is a
particularly good one I'll be I'll be
using that as we go through but what
we've done is we've taken all of these
heuristics and we've placed them on the
intersections between the problems and
the powers
and um here's one example of a heuristic
from the waters Foundation the habits of
the systems thinker so you know they
have these nice diagrams these pictures
and this one is recognizes that a system
structure generates Its Behavior and
this is one of the heuristics which sits
up here on this particular pathway from
um from here to the engagement of this
power
um because the the I'm guessing the the
presentation is going to be shared with
everybody and I've included this just to
to give you access to all of these
different works on
um systems thinking and where you can
get them from
now when we look at the the pathways
from the problems to the powers we've
we've now labeled the pathways
um to give them meaning so confusion in
complexity going to the power of theory
you generate hypotheses
when you go into the power of the
technical you're exploring potential
when you're not seeing the connection
flow of causality you make the Dynamics
explicit or you plan ahead to engage the
political power if you have limited
choices you develop Technologies or you
extend what is possible with action
potential
so you get the idea these are Pathways
two powers to essentially uh get you
away from the problems that you're
experiencing
okay now the other thing to bear in mind
is as well as the the positive Pathways
and positive systems thinking there are
also some Shadow uh traps in thinking
and attitude uh Bridget and I did some
work exploring these in in our in a
booklet we did exploring the branches of
the systems landscape so we considered
these to be unfounded Concepts
um because really we we have the opinion
that nothing was truly useless and also
there's no such thing as nothing because
even nothing is a concept
and and these are some of the traps in
thinking that that you experience
um when you get lost in complexity
um the other thing I'm going to make
reference to is um is
um
personality traits
because these personality traits
um have a big influence on systems
thinking capability and and where that
systems thinking capability is applied
um I'm not sure if if you're all
familiar with Myers-Briggs but there's
this extroversion introversion sensing
intuition thinking and feeling judging
and perceiving and and these These are
um traits in terms of personality in
terms of tendencies in terms of your
personal preferences so some people are
more introverted some people are more
extroverted and this this has an
influence
um on the traits that you you uh exhibit
when you're working in a team
and um
uh what what becomes apparent is that
um this this variety that we see in our
personality traits is actually all part
of um the way that we've developed as a
society and as a culture and as
individuals to better work as teams to
deal with complexity
and and again that will become apparent
as we go through
so I'm now going to get into the into
the main meat I'm going to go into
um the technical management aspects the
conceptualization the architecture of
design and the realization and
sustainment
so um technical management just just as
a reminder in in the in the in cozy
handbook there's a there's a section
five on on technical management
processes and and these These are really
important
um we tend to overlook them perhaps a
little
um and focus more on the technical
processes you know the processes of for
instance architecture design integration
verification Etc but technical
management is a key capability that we
need in order to deal with complexity
um and it really provides I would say
let's say the bridge between traditional
project management and systems
engineering it really does
it it's the vehicle for integrating
those two different uh disciplines
um
but Lawson
um who was uh you know really
influential on on the
um he was one of the key authors of the
ISO standards
um and you know a very active in in
systems engineering and he explained
this Paradigm for thinking and acting
acting which integrates
UDA observe oriented decide an Act and
the plan do check app Loops so when you
bring these two together and you
integrate them
um this gives you and when you apply it
this really gives you the capability for
continuous situational management
um and this is something that has to be
done by technical management throughout
the the development of of uh of programs
this really does when you apply it it
makes you strategic agile lean and
responsive and this is really the
essence of technical management
foreign
I'm also going to I think I'll I won't
talk about this very much because this
this you know you can look at this at
your leisure but here we have the
categories the knowledge Concepts
um the potential leverage points from
danella Meadows and and some questions
that can help you
um which are based on these Concepts and
they can help you to identify leverage
points
um for making changes in systems or for
actually establishing new systems and
and down here we have the ones which
danella said worthy the greatest
leverage potential and here we have the
one which has the lowest source of
Leverage for potential and one of the
reasons for this is from John Gaul he
said that all established systems resist
change
and when you're changing when you try
and change these things the system
essentially uh hits back and and and
things happen that you weren't expecting
the system is resistant
so I'm now going to conceptualizing
um so conceptualizing is is what you do
when you're attempting to make sense of
a situation
um by seeing the situation from A
diversity of viewpoints we will you will
enrich your comprehension
and and when you're conceptualizing
these are the powers
that are coming into play
these are the roles the traits that are
useful
um when you're conceptualizing
and here's some of the
um
heuristics from the waters Foundation
are related to these uh these traits so
the Thinker makes meaningful connections
within and between systems and the
champion considers how mental models
affect current reality in the future
and when you're conceptualizing you you
draw on the power of uh or the
utilization of analogy metaphor
um and anomaly
um when you're doing this
conceptualization so you gather it data
you try to make sense of it you
formulate the big picture and you
validate Impressions with experts and
stakeholders
um and when conceptualizing
these are the the pathways that I showed
you earlier
the ones in green so these are the
positive Pathways from these problems
these are theoristics that are being
engaged
uh these are the pathologies in Gray
in in the red
we we have negative pathways
so the these negative Pathways represent
either the the abuse of power or the
utilization of power
um
um you know with without
I guess thinking
which served to sustain these
pathologies
so let's just let's just look at this
one of the top end for instance so no
Fusion of the future situation uh this
is addressed through the pathway give
voice to Future possibilities and this
is why it considers how mental models
affects current reality in the future is
is supportive of this
the the systems engineering processes
which are at play in this area are life
cycle Model Management and acquisition
so these these processes are supporting
potentially both the forward pathway and
the backward pathway and the backward
pathway is reluctance to change to
retain the establishment
um here we've got stakeholder needs and
requirements definition which is coming
from a lack of information knowledge and
appreciation so stakeholder needs and
requirements definition is supporting
the pathway of engaging stakeholders
but there's a negative pathway which is
manipulation of relationships to blame
the other a subgroup or all alien so
this is where we we see how the systems
engineering processes can be supported
um in this overall big picture of
conceptualizing
and and these are the four main traits
which are useful in doing
conceptualization
so when we talk about realizing the
power of systems thinking
in engineering this is what we're really
talking about it's the processes it's
the thinking it's the understanding of
the pathways both forward and backwards
and the roles
and and the types of people
which are
helpful to unlock
that power
when conceptualizing
I hope that makes I hope that makes
sense this is uh architecting
so architecting is what you do when you
are attempting to appreciate the
complexity of systems in their
situational context and and here's some
if you like heuristics related to
architecting
yeah taking into account multiple
perspectives relating the features of
the system to the stakeholder needs
organizing the concepts and the
components and establishing the
principles for design
and again these are the these are the
these are some of some of the heuristics
which are useful
these are the uh the primary powers
and the players
that are at play when architecting
um
so a similar kind of diagram
but but what what's really interesting
for me when when I was putting this
together is
what you start to see in terms of the
emerging connections which you weren't
able to see before
um
and and also potentially gaps in our
processes
so I in in our processes
you know we we don't have processes for
essentially changing your mind or
opening your mind
and and maybe there's a place here for
imagining and dreaming and even
meditating
um because these are these are things
that are helpful
um when you're in this particular space
um and when you need to consider an
issue fully and resist the urge to come
to Quick conclusions
and when you need to change your
perspectives to increase your
understanding
um here we've got observes how elements
within systems change over time
generating patterns and Trends so this
is really useful for planning ahead and
in your measurement management
um and your life cycle management you
know and and here we've got again
recognizes that a system structure
generates Its Behavior so this is useful
in systems analysis and in requirements
definition
um
so I'll move on designing designing what
you what you do is what you do when
you're working out some how something
needs to be done in the context of the
systems you're engaging with
um again these are the roles and the
powers that are coming into play
is some of the heuristics again uses
understanding of system structure to
identify possible leverage points and
that information I I provided earlier in
terms of the you know Donald Meadows and
The Leverage points she identified and
the categories and the concepts which
are useful for identifying leverage
recognizes the impact of time delays
when exploring cause and effect
relationships this is important for the
inspector the Craftsman surfaces and
tests assumptions
the doer pays attention to accumulations
and their rates of change
so again all of these roles and powers
are at play
and some some if you like wisdom related
to this particular domain of Designing
the greater the complexity of the system
the greater the number of trade-offs
that will need to be made
and the value of the system is
proportional to its benefit benefits
divided by its complicatedness
um so the key message really is you know
we need to appreciate complexity
complexity is not necessarily bad
um if it wasn't for complexity we
wouldn't exist
you know systems are by their nature
complex but what we should be doing as
Engineers is we should be appreciating
that complexity and trying to make the
systems that we that we create
less complicated
try to make them only as complicated as
is necessary
and the viability of the system and the
it and the diversity of the components
are directly related
that's also really important to
understand
um so this is the the diagram related to
uh designing
um again we'll just look at a couple of
these so not seeing the connection flow
of causality we can make the Dynamics
explicit through the power of the
technical
um and we can avoid getting lost in the
data
when we do our systems analysis
um
infrastructure management
is really important when we're seeking
efficiency
and making sure that we're doing our
part for the whole
um
we extend what is possible to address
limited choices
through our implementations
and we need to avoid firefighting
and in our decision management
we need to steer the way the right time
the right way
and we need to avoid the issue of
leaders escaping accountability
for for uh for the wrong decisions and
making sure that we we learn from any
mistakes that we made
this is the the the situation on
sustaining and realizing so sustaining
is maintaining in the context of
business as usual and things work they
obviously work this way and you probably
want to keep it working and there's the
adage if it isn't broken then don't fix
it but we need to take time to assess
performance
um don't ignore feedback that things are
not working we need to remember that
established systems will resist change
even when the time for changes come you
know this is one of the things that we
as systems Engineers need to need to
address
and these are the the primary powers and
uh the players at play
uh we need to remember that we're we're
all part of one big system called nature
um we're actually already well beyond
the limits of the sustainable
capabilities of our planet
um we can work together to create Health
well-being security and happiness
but only if we all take the system's
perspective
and and this is the the overall
situation for sustaining
um and realizing and we've got things
like seeks to understand the big picture
which is important in our knowledge
management and the development of
knowledge and being wise to system-ness
um one of the uh the pathologies that
are that is at play down here is the
tribal
um and solilo behavior that we sometimes
see
um and a systems Engineers this is
something that that we we have to
um address to ensure that everybody is
actually working together at the right
time in the right way
um we have identifies the circular
nature of complex cause and effect
relationships
um this is at play here in this
particular space
uh considers the long-term and
short-term and unintended consequences
of actions
so again this is this has a place for
verification and quality assurance
and down here we have
um checked results and changes actions
if needed
um so this is related to things like
maintenance and quality management
um
integration as a process as a big role
to play here
um seeking the wholeness of the system
um and um when we have unintended
consequences we need to learn from our
mistakes and we need to adapt and
improve
so what I'm overall trying to do here is
I'm trying to show you how the the
various Pathways both negative and
positive the pathologies the roles and
the processes can all come together as
essentially a system for realizing and
sustaining
yeah incorporating not just the the
technical processes but the the
processes that support the the overall
Enterprise the project management
orientated technical management
orientated processes so all of these
things need to come together as an
overall system and the the the the chief
sorry the the systems engineers and the
technical managers have a big role to
play in in ensuring that that these
systems and these parts all come
together as a whole
because when we're all systems thinking
together this really does greatly
Empower
um engineering
you know so bringing together all of
these roles
um in all of these different contexts of
working out why working out what
working out how
and establishing our common wisdom you
know we we all have a role to play
um in that and it's only by working as a
team that we really realize the power of
systems engineering and systems thinking
so
um I hope that I've managed to keep
reasonably in time and um I I appreciate
that there was a huge amount of slides
there
um it I I felt it was necessary to give
you that overall story of the problems
we Face uh the science that is emerging
and how that science has a relevance
directly in our engineering processes
um
if you'd like to know more or contribute
to the development of system science
then I'm very happy to correspond this
is my my email
um and really is there is far too much
to know but we might be able to create a
framework for it all
um and this is one of the things that
I'm hoping to do with this systems
engineering body of knowledge to capture
all of the essentials and to make
explicit the tools the methods and the
practices that can support our
engineering
thank you Gary for your great
presentation very interesting
you know we have a little time remaining
but we will have the opportunity to
pause some questions
um please use
the chat
here we have a question Gary related to
when talking about system engineering
and trade management integration
uh which are from your point of view the
necessary actions to smoothly integrate
both disciplines
in an organization
well
I think that what we're finding from
um our engagement with project
management is is first of all a
difference in the language
and the processes yeah project
management as a as a as a different set
of processes to systems engineering
um
and um you know getting a common
understanding of of the language
um is important
um we so what we've done at Airbus is
we've essentially established a
technical management discipline and that
discipline really is the bridge between
the two
um they're able to speak both the
language of systems engineers and
they're also able to speak the language
of the project managers so that that's
that's really important the other thing
which is really important is is finding
a way of getting the project managers
engaged as early as possible
um in in the examination of the the
problem space
because if they come on board
um at the project start which is when
the scope has been defined and that's
already too late you know when the scope
is defined you know you've got you
should have the product breakdown
structure the work breakdown structure
the cost breakdown structure all of
those things and if the project manager
hasn't been part and parcel of creating
those structures and those plans then
um you know there's going to be there's
going to be a let's say a culture shock
um and all of the things that that
should have been done won't have been
done so that that again is is a big part
of what we need to address
any additional question from people
just one question on my side that is uh
how in the day-to-day
how you see the application of system
thinking in our organization what is
your recommendations you know
um
that's really hard yeah I know
um
so do you remember you've got children
haven't you Bernardo yeah yeah so you
know when they're when they're three
four or five they're constantly ask you
the question why
yeah why why
yeah so I think we need to ask way more
yeah yeah we're doing stuff what is the
reason for doing this what why yeah
um and um you know if you ask why a few
times it's very very powerful you could
really find out
um you know things that you you hadn't
expected yeah and and what you often
find is that people are doing things
without thinking you know they're just
following the process and just following
the process is not enough
you need to be thinking while you apply
the process and and asking why is is
really important yeah and then of course
you get the what
you're right it's curious we have clever
people in our organization but um
and never ask why you know always jump
to the solution directly yeah
thing so I think this is a important I
think you are right assistant thinking
help us to address the wise you know
yeah yeah
that's um that's that's one of the
pathologies which is
um
jumping in jumping into
um technological solutions
um
I've got I've got it I've got it here
yeah so if if it's okay if I just share
it for a moment
yeah
I'll share so
these these
when when you bring together all of the
the anti-systemic pathways
um you know jumping to technological
conclusions is one of the things that
that can actually help to promote chaos
yeah and confusion
um another another big one that we we
fall into is not seeing the connection
flow of causality
um you know
you know as as Engineers you know we I
would say we probably do more thinking
oh you know no disrespect to to the
other disciplines but we we probably do
more let's say technical thinking than
than many of the other disciplines so
our natural tendencies tend to be
towards this top end you know the theory
the technical and the action you know
we're very action orientated in
engineering
um so these pathologies tend to be the
the ones that we we suffer from the most
you know the fire fighting
um the resource in energy gap
um you know wasting time and and energy
you know asking why
here
in this area is really important you
know so that we don't waste our time and
energy so that we have enough
understanding that we don't you know we
don't fall into an intended consequences
um and when you ask why we make sure
that we're not going in in the wrong
direction yeah yeah so yeah so asking
why is probably the biggest thing we
could do
okay and thank you
Gary for being here with us for sharing
your thoughts
and he's trying to win up to our
conference let me
um
I would like to leave you with the
invitation to be here with us in the
next conference
and thank you for all the participants
today and and you Gary you are part of
our community you know and thank you for
promoting assistant thinking and system
Engineering in in Spain I greatly
appreciate that you know thank you yeah
thank you again I really appreciate the
invitation and my my invitation to to
correspond was uh was very honest so if
people want to contact me and find out
more and have more conversations I'm
very happy to do that and I know that
the subject was was very rich and there
was a lot of material there so again you
know if people want to find out more
then I'm more than happy to talk about
it
thank you Gary
