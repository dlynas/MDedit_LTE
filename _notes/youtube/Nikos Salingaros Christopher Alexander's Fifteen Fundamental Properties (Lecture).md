Nikos Salingaros: "Christopher Alexander's Fifteen Fundamental Properties" (Lecture)
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGTjJZhnl4A)

## Transcript:
hello everyone welcome back to the
series
of lectures algorithmic sustainable
design the future architectural theory
today is the sixth in a series of
lectures and i'm very happy today
to uh introduce uh christopher
alexander's 15 fundamental properties
one of the most significant
in my opinion development in
architectural theory and
philosophy in general
here is our logo
today i will uh devote most of the
lecture to
the 15 fundamental properties and then i
will discuss
my own three laws of architecture at the
end
there is a connection between these two
uh works
alexander's fifteen properties uh
outline
the the wholeness of structure
found in nature and in the greatest of
human creation so i have to
discuss each one of those fundamental
properties
nevertheless 15 properties are is a
large number to remember
so for my own use i
have tried to to group them into three
groups
and so my three laws of architecture are
not
either substitution of christopher
alexander's 15
fundamental properties uh nor an
additional
set of rules they are a way of
remembering the 15 fundamental
15 fundamental properties better and
hopefully a way of grouping them
together
and getting more insight into the into
the properties so
my three rules presented at the end are
meant to be a complementary tool
i will begin the lecture by reviewing
what i have done before
not the material but what have the
previous lectures done they have derived
uh some structural rules
going into the details so that students
and readers of these lectures can
understand them
i began with universal scaling and
showed how that
works then i introduced the principle
wide boundaries which is in fact
one of christopher alexander's 15
fundamental properties
then i looked into scaling coherence
and the universal distribution of sizes
which have to do
with the coexistence of
components of different sizes in complex
systems and the scaling coherence
relates the morphological features
at different scales or magnification
whereas the universal distribution of
sizes looks at the number
or the proliferation of different
size components existing on each scale
and there is a universal rule which
we have covered in one of the previous
lectures that
shows in a in a stable complex system
there is a relationship
now after having derived all these rules
time has come to ask
how many such rules are there altogether
and is there completeness
all the all the structure rules that i
will look into
help us to design better buildings and
cities and i would like
to find a complete set of rules as
complete as possible
so now it's time to to delve into the
the 15 fundamental properties and from
that we will have a
very good basis for a uh for deriving a
complete set of structural rules
if we keep doing these investigations
how many rules can we come up with so
the question of completeness is
important to mathematicians
are there four rules that i have derived
or are there
50 rules well the answer is given by
christopher alexander there are 15 rules
actually there are fewer than 15 rules
but alexander
has found through his uh through his uh
teaching and
and design experience that it's good to
formulate the rules as 15 properties
rather than 10 properties or 12
properties
even though that would be more compact
so 15 is the number he has chosen and i
hope you will you will see the reason
why after i go through these
these properties
now because of the background that i
have given i did not begin with the 15
properties i
began with with the other rules
and derive them some of the properties
you will see today
will be understood as mathematically
conclusive as practical
and logical and that was my intent
uh because then that makes the uh the
other rules easier to accept
and uh together the 15 properties can
form a complete set and why do we need
the complete set
well from the previous lecture
uh which is the topic of these lectures
algorithmic design we're computing
configurations in order to get a better
building or a better city that is
adapted to human use
and in the computation we have decisions
because we have a darwinian process of
selection
so at each point in the computation we
have to decide based upon criteria
these 15 properties are going to be the
criteria that we select
and and push the process of computation
ahead so this is a crucial topic
the 15 fundamental properties are
morphological features that resonate
with the human senses
they are found in man-made forms and
structures
they're independent of culture period or
region it's something
innate because these 15 properties
appear
in almost every
building city and artifact that humans
have um
have created over history that we find
pleasing and emotionally nourishing
and uh it is a it is um
it is impossible to explain other that
this is something innate
in humanity itself nevertheless
i want to be extremely careful to say
that
the 15 properties are not based upon
humanity because they are present in
natural forms and objects
this is a absolutely important
so i will present the the the properties
christopher alexander derived the 15
properties by observing structure that
is alive in buildings cities and
artifacts
and they are presented in detail in the
first volume of his
book the nature of order the phenomenon
of life
the explanatory hierarchy goes as
follows
these properties are present in nature
therefore it has nothing to do with
human beings they are present in
biological forms in the simplest
biological forms in the biological
structure in the structure of
life itself therefore there's nothing
with human beings they're present in
animals
therefore it has not they have nothing
to do with human beings they are present
in human beings and
what human beings create and they're
also
obviously and predominantly present in
human culture which is a superstructure
that that human beings have created on
top of their biological
existence so i want to emphasize is that
this is not this is not a personal
preference of alexander
or myself this is not um
something that is unique to a particular
culture
this goes beyond or rather to the fundam
to the foundations of matter itself and
and i'm not going to discuss that here
but
you can get an appreciation for that by
reading christopher alexander's
monumental book here's a list of the
properties
and for those for those who are taking
notes uh
let me remind you that uh the these
slides are put
on the world wide web independently of
the videos
so um you don't have to be rushing to to
take down notes because you can also
download the slides and print whatever
slides you want
from from the videos well
separately from the videos the slides
are made available for free
so the list of properties levels of
scale
strong centers thick boundaries
alternating repetition positive space
good shape local symmetries
deep interlock and ambiguity those are
properties one two eight
the other properties are contrast
gradients
roughness echoes
the void simplicity and inner calm
and not separateness i mentioned earlier
that we could
we can squeeze these because there is
some overlap between the properties
so we could reduce them to a smaller
number
however for practical terms it's best to
keep them at 15
because they emphasize important things
that would otherwise be lost if we
combine
these properties
in case you missed the previous one
properties one two eight
and then properties uh nine to fifteen
and i will discuss each one of these
in turn now in my discussion i'm helped
by a set of diagrams drawn by helmut
leitner a software engineer in graz
austria
who made some very simple schematic
sketches and these illustrate the 15
properties of the glance each each of
the properties they were presented
in a conference that i attended in
vienna just a few months
ago and um helmut has graciously
allowed me to use these in my lectures
in return let me advertise his book in
german
mustardeoria which is a pattern theory
but unfortunately his book does not
contain these diagrams these are
presented here to the public for the
first time
here is a helmut knight likeness book a
nice
very small book in german and i believe
he's preparing an english edition
and he had he addresses the uh the
appearance of patterns
alexander type patterns in both
buildings and in software
after all he's a software engineer and i
should say
that that by now listen let me take a
little break here
people who are following these lectures
will see me refer
to computer scientists who are giving
fundamental results about patterns and
the work of christopher alexander
christopher alexander is regarded as one
of the
present-day gurus in computer science so
i'm using results developed by computer
scientists to feed back into
architecture and urbanism so this is
a phenomenally useful feedback
this is the first of uh of the lightner
diagrams levels of scale
and just with a simple schematic sketch
he shows that
complex structure has different levels
of scale
i have spent uh the first several
lectures on the scaling hierarchy
so just to review that material levels
of scale
are defined by objects and subdivisions
in a building or a city
that define a particular scale and the
actual
dimension the measurement that defines
the scale
should not be spaced so closely uh
should be spaced closely enough for
coherence namely for the different
size components to uh to connect
visually through the scaling hierarchy
however not too close so as to blur the
distinction between nearby's nearby
scales if you have a collection of
objects that is
almost the same size but
not close enough then uh things become
very vague
and i discussed this all earlier i gave
mathematical rules
for generating the correct scales via
the logarithmic constant e
which is approximately 2.7 or going back
to the
ancient uh architects rule of three
use a factor of three to to create
subdivisions
and uh i i also dealt delve
more deeply into the mathematics of the
fibonacci sequence and how
alternative alternate terms of the
fibonacci sequence
give us the correct subdivisions of the
scales
now i am proposing
an adaptive method for design and the
accessible scaling hierarchy is
essential for adaptation
the whole point of adaptive design is to
satisfy needs on the human scales and
what are the human scales
well starting from the size of the human
body
a very tall individual can be from two
meters
high down to the smallest perceivable
structure on the human body which is say
a width of a hair which is less than one
millimeter all of the scales
are defined by the human body and for
for our
buildings to be adaptive to us
human beings then our buildings must
have
perceivable scales in the human range of
scales
unfortunately certain styles
have eschewed the human scales
but i'm not discussing that now
i'm just discussing one of the one of
the properties and to remind you
to apply this property on on on scales
it tells you that you accommodate all
the scales
according to certain formulas
that i that i have given but these
formulas do not
determine the shape of
the spaces or the components of the
building the shape depends on the
centers
and here we are the next uh the next
slide is strong centers
so a very schematic thing with something
in the middle that defines a strong
center
out our eye is drawn to the center
i have devoted a lecture five to the
theory of centers
each center ties the substantial
regional space together coherently
as the whole point of the centers
it combines the surrounding centers and
boundaries to focus on something
and ultimately focuses on itself
uh the centers overlap the centers
support each other
centers exist on on different scales
to complement the the previous uh the
previous property
there's a hierarchy of centers and
they're created recursively so you have
a recursive hierarchical property
that builds more and more centers
but amazingly enough at the end
if you are successful
you don't see the center as a separate
if you're successful then the centers
all uh blend into a coherent whole
so you have something and you're aware
of it it's highly complex it has all
these
substructures but you cannot separate
these centers because they are
supporting each other so everything
becomes a coherent whole and that is the
aim
of our design
some more review there are two types of
centers there's a defined center and an
implied center and these interact
coherently
a defined sender is like a lightness
diagram
something in the middle right in the
middle to focus our attention
so the focus is actually on the center
but there's another type of center
that's an implied center
and the implied center which is dual to
the defined center has a boundary
and the boundary focuses attention on
the empty interior
and the visual focus
uh enhances function uh what does that
mean let me explain it
a little bit uh unless my listeners get
the wrong idea that i'm talking about
simply visual or aesthetic concepts that
is not true
because the center property
actually helps the function in a
building or
urban space or in a city the
movement of people in the use of certain
regions depends absolutely upon the
geometry
so what i'm saying is not just visual
what i'm saying
is a precondition for the use of
spaces that we're going to define
using the the recursive property of
centers
here's property number three thick
boundaries and
to show the interdependence of the
fifteen properties this
beautifully illustrates the center
an implied center where a thick boundary
focuses attention in its towards this
middle so this could also be an
illustration for an applied center
but thick boundary is a is a separate
structural property
now let me review a discussion that i
have already given on this
on boundaries according to universal
scaling
the thick boundary arises as the next
scale so you have something that is
three meters in size the boundary
should be on the order of 1 meter the
rule of 1 3 or 2.7
it doesn't have to be exactly that of
course but it should be thick
now if you have something that's three
meters in size and you bounded with one
centimeter boundary that is ineffective
why
because it does not connect through the
scaling hierarchy
a one centimeter
scale exists in that scaling hierarchy
but it is uh
five or six terms away from the three
meter object that you're trying to
bounce
so if you skip too many
terms in the scaling hierarchy there is
no possible connection
therefore your boundary is unconnected
from what it bounds
and what does that mean it means that
there is no center
you're breaking the you're breaking the
coherence of the
of the forms by skipping over
terms in the hierarchy and our goal
here is to enhance that coherence is to
build up the coherence or it becomes
totally and perfectly coherent
the concept of a thick boundary is
important enough to use a separate
structural property even though you see
it follows directly from
from the universal hierarchy
now in lecture two i introduced the
concept of perforated bend and folded
for urban interfaces
the most successful urban interfaces are
semi-permeable
therefore they have a complexity they
allow something's true while blocking
other things
and therefore if you have a an interface
that is complex and has this structure
that permits it to be semi-permeable it
must be thick to contain the structure
and that's another example of a thick
boundary you cannot have a thin
boundary that is perfectly bent and
folded therefore
an implied center is defined only
through a thick boundary
and thick boundaries play a focusing
role as well as a bounding role
and we could add that it all they also
play a role as a
as an interface which bounds something
from the inside and bound something from
the outside
the fourth property alternating
repetition here something is repeated
with alternation and and contrast is is
tied in to alternation
there is an informational definition for
translational symmetry
if you're repeating something
simplistically then
the information is collapsible what do i
mean by that
if you have something very simple that's
repeated uh a hundred times
you code it according to software as
x that's the simple object and then you
say
the additional command repeat 100 times
that's a trivial addition
however if you have something that's
non-trivial if you have a repetition
like we have here in in
helmut's diagram this is still simple
but
but it is not uh it does not it does not
suffer informational collapse because
you you're repeating something
with a little bit of complexity and you
are using contrast and repetition to
reinforce each other
through alternation um
that's the whole point of this um again
getting back
in case we have forgotten
where is all this stuff coming from this
stuff is coming from christopher
alexander observing
these in the the greatest of human
creations uh
in artifacts buildings and cities that
make us feel whole in ourselves that are
emotionally nourishing so
i know i'm getting into the mathematical
explanations of all these all these
properties but
please bear in mind at every point in
today's lecture at every second of
today's lecture
these are empirically derived by
christopher alexander
by looking at buildings and cities so
i'm not making these up what i'm giving
is
is explanation to uh to further
reinforce
the uh these properties that alexander
has discovered
next property is positive space and we
see a figure ground
figure here by helmet lightner well
which is the figure which is the ground
the point is that it doesn't matter
there is positive space on both
or both sides and that's and that's a
crucial positive space uh refers to
gestalt psychology how we perceive
things the basis of human perception
whether we're looking in an area or a
volume three dimensionals or two
dimensions
the convexity plays a major role in
defining
an object or a space and these are
mathematical plus psychological reasons
and you can see how they apply to the
spaces we inhabit
if we have an object sticking out
towards
us we perceive that as a threat this is
uh
this is certainly pre-human this goes
down to to the
first animals with uh
with locomotion and an eye brain
mechanism that perceives something
sticking out as a threat
so it's there's nothing we can do to
overcome that and the architects who
build things sticking out towards us
are triggering these threats uh what
does it have to do with
with um with positive space
well positive space means that the space
has a convexity
which would eliminate things sticking
out towards us
we want to apply the positive space
concept to both figure and background
the urban space must be positive just as
much as the building's interior space
must be positive now not everything can
be positive at the same time however
uh look at the great urban spaces
pre-20th century and you see that they
have
this concept applied beautifully but
there are all positive spaces the
partially surrounded so you get a
feeling of positive space
i think that my audience would be hard
to find
just as i am i find it extremely
difficult to locate a
an urban space built in the 20th century
that
gives emotional nourishment and that's
because
this property was intentionally ignored
in building urban spaces in the 20th
century
uh one of my acquaintances um tried to
get around this
by saying that the modernist urbanists
defined a new kind of urban space
but i totally disagree with that
characterization
uh there is one kind of urban space that
is that is emotionally nourishing and
that obeys the rules that i'm i'm
outlining
in this series of lectures and anything
else uh is just not a good urban space
it's just poor urban space
so it does not help to to stick a
different label on it
it does not undo the damage
the sixth property good shape and what
does good shape mean
well a helmet lightner here has drawn
some sort of drop
or teardrop and
just in this simple diagram we see the
characteristics there are symmetries in
here there are symmetries that make it
good easy to perceive that's the whole
point
symmetry is reduced information overload
and why do we care about information
overload
well we care for the following reason
the
human brain and the brain of any animal
produces a representation
from two-dimensional views our retina
gives a two-dimensional view
of an object but the brain constructs a
three-dimensional
representation that we can
computationally manipulate
and if you if you've seen the very
advanced uh imaging
software you you move your mouse and the
object that is image
moves around in three dimensions well
that takes an enormous amount of
computation
not only the moving of the
three-dimensional object
but the representation the construction
of the three-dimensional image to begin
with
so good shape means that it's easily
graspable
the brain has an innate need to
compactify information
and to to do this representation
now if you have a shape that's not
easily represented it strains the
computational ability of the brain
and what happens when you strain the
brain you produce anxiety
there's no other way around this
anxiety hormones pump into the system
the signal is alarm something is
difficult something um
watch out be prepared for fight or
flight that is classic anxiety
and that is measured in laboratory
experiments
next property local symmetries
in this uh leitner diagram we see
something that's not
overall symmetric but a piece of it
has symmetries and that's the meaning of
local
on a smaller scale
this is a combination of symmetries with
within a hierarchy
with the universal scaling symmetries
must act on every scale
and the scales go from the larger scale
down
to the smaller smaller smaller scale and
symmetry does not mean that
an overall symmetry as is usually
envisioned
we have this uh flawed conception of an
over overall symmetry a building
built in the shape of a giant direct
angle yes it is overall symmetric but
that's that's not very interesting
what is interesting and what what um
is essential for our adaptive design is
it does it have sub-symmetries on all
the smaller hierarchies
uh and the answer in the 20th century is
usually not
so we want to have multiple
sub-symmetries acting within larger
symmetries
and these symmetries need to need to be
hierarchically nested
um let me go back to the symmetries
before i
before i go on with it deep interlock
so what does this mean we are combining
hierarchy we're combining we're
combining the existence of a hierarchy
of scales which i have
argued previously with symmetries on
each of those scales
and the the previous lectures also show
that we need to create centers that
support each other
so everything now is tying itself
together the symmetries that we
introduce on the small and smaller
scales have to cooperate
namely there have to be sub symmetries
of large asymmetries
so i could repeat my lecture on centers
and instead of using the word center i
will use the word
symmetry symmetry is acting
on a certain scale and they contain
smaller symmetries and these cooperate
by symmetry to create larger symmetries
so all these things are happening in
order to create a
a coherence and overall coherence for
what we're designing
here is a lightness diagram for a deep
interlock and ambiguity
things are interlocking they're
connecting it's a strong way of
of connecting the strongest way of
physically connecting forms
interpenetrate to link together
the analogy comes from fractals where
the lines tend to be crinkly
as to fill out portions of space lines
are not smooth
or straight and surfaces of accretion
fractals grow with accretion
so they fill in volume even for the
other type of fractal the perforated
fractal you have holes punched into
areas so that the background
interpenetrates and interlocks with the
figure itself
uh the count the the opposite is
an abrupt transition an abrupt smooth
transition does not bind
one one side to the other and that's
what we want to avoid
an excellent example of this type of
binding
is the perforated bend and folded urban
interface that i introduced earlier
where two regions interpenetrate at a
semi-permeable interface
and this also uh explains very nicely
the the word ambiguity
that alexander uses for this fundamental
property
if you're in a transition region in the
interface
in transition between one region and
another region
to which side of the interface do you
belong well you don't know because
you're in the transition therefore there
is an ambiguity
and the ambiguity is what makes it work
what makes the transition work
there is no ambiguity when you have a
sharp transition you know
you're here in region a and one step
you're
over your region b and that's the
reasons are not connected
because of the abruptness
here is contrast obviously
contrast differentiates regions
contrast is necessary for many different
reasons
first to establish distinct subunits and
i keep talking about
subunits and how they cooperate well in
order to establish them you need
contrast
and you need to distinguish between
adjoining units
that's the alternating repetition
fundamental property
if you cannot distinguish between
adjoining units and there's nothing
to alternate to provide figure ground
symmetry of opposites you need contrast
now what um what reduces contrast
a certain attempt at the transparency
and in architecture and urbanism
i would like to to classify this
as a false transparency because it is
stylistically driven it is not uh
driven by by function or
adaptation and reduced contrast weakens
the design
because the reducing contrast not only
eliminates this particular fundamental
property contrast but
because many of the other properties
depend upon contrast it weakens or
eliminates the other
properties as well so here's a good uses
of contrast the space under an arcade
versus an open street space
you you in you're in the arcade and then
it's an
entirely different type of feeling than
out in the open street space
note however that this is an example i
use for
interpenetration the perforated bent and
folded so we have contrast on the one
hand and at the same time we have
connectivity but it is it is a
semi-permeable
connectivity it is contrasted very
strongly yet it is connected very
strongly
these are not opposites these are acting
here
at the same time to create a very
positive urban space as everyone knows
who has visited their cities throughout
europe where you have arcades and you
can walk under the arcades
an example of the opposite a weak space
inside versus outside
makes no difference glass curtain wall
in buildings whether you're on one side
inside the building it doesn't feel like
inside whether you're outside it doesn't
feel like you're outside
there's no contrast and therefore
the spaces both outside and this are the
weakened
gradients a very important property
yet one that comes to play in the larger
urban scales
and i'm going to be devoting
time to that in the last elections in
this series
a gradient is a transition we want to
get away from uniformity because
adaptive architecture
is the opposite of uniformity now i have
talked so much about subdividing things
and to get the other scales however
sometimes we should not quantize form
into discrete pieces
but we need to change it gradually
and here are two examples
on the urban scale the urban transect
going from city to countryside it's a
it's a transition
from highly built area
dense certain um
height of buildings density of
occupation
and you need to go gradually through
different stages in the transect
and i will discuss the the new urbanist
transaction in a later lecture
all the way to countryside where you
have um
at the extreme you have nature preserves
just inside nature preserves
toward the urban transect you have a
countryside inhabited by just a few
isolated uh
farms and homes for the farmers etc so
here is a a um
a transition that that uh takes place uh
over
over a very large uh area and uh
unfortunately our
contemporary cities have have broken
this transition they have made a mess
of the countryside as well as well as
the transition from city to countryside
another example is interior space in in
the best houses
there is a transition from public to
private spaces
uh modern houses don't have that
you have to go to traditional houses
where the the the public and private
transition
is is carefully orchestrated and uh
respected
most cultures around the world not the
american culture most councils around
the world
uh are forced to do that because
the way of life the religion itself
requires a transition between
the the public uh region and the private
region so
we have this transact of privacy in
inside a house and it could be very
simple but it's absolutely necessary
so that's it's an example of gradients
used in the design
of a building
let's move on to property 11 roughness
here a lightner has three seagulls
compared to three leaves well they are
similar it's a they're both group of
threes
but what is different the individual
shape is different so there's a
similarity it's a group of three
and uh but on the details it is rough
it is not the same
let me go through the many different
manifestations of roughness and all
these are
are offered as positive design
tools
first of all fractal structure goes all
the way down in scales nothing is smooth
in a fractal
you go to the regions where it has more
and more
structure on the small and smaller
scales it is not smooth
when we design something to be adaptive
you have to relax
a strict geometry to allow imperfections
if you tolerate
the adaptation the computation of
adaptive use in your design then you
have to allow imperfection and this
imperfections that are absolutely
necessary can be viewed as roughness
they're included in in this
world of roughness now all ornamentation
which is necessary as i have explained
in in other lectures can be all ornament
can be interpreted as a roughness in a
smooth geometry
if we want to clean up
a building or a city we just eliminate
the ornament
and we eliminate all the all the
hierarchy hierarchy and we eliminate
the life in the city but we can
interpret therefore ornament as a
roughness in a smooth geometry
a topic for a a lecture that's
forthcoming
is symmetry breaking
imperfections differentiate repeated
units to make them similar but not
identical
for example hand-painted tiles you have
a wall with a hundred hand-painted tiles
if you have a very poorly made
mechanical tiles they suffer from
informational collapse
because it's it's they're identical and
you remember the computer algorithm you
have x and you repeated 100 times
so the the code is is very brief but if
they're hand painted
the individual variations prevent
informational collapse
that's roughness and the roughness uh
increases the the area
that uh that is informationally rich
therefore symmetry breaking in an
approximate symmetry breaking prevents
informational collapse
when you use the deliberate reference in
repetition and you can see that
all over the world in different
architectures
now sustainability replies at the
implies adaptation
you cannot impose uh any egoistic ideas
because they ruin the sustainability of
of a region of the world
but in order to adapt you have to follow
techniques much as
what i described in this series of
lectures and the local conditions
which are the initial conditions for
the computations create roughness they
break regularity and
and prevent perfect symmetry in in many
in many instances so the whole will
change as you're computing the design
the whole will change according to its
context thus it becomes unique
so on this transparency here i'm linking
some very important concepts together
and i will try to put a hierarchy of
explanation
in order to have sustainability you need
adaptivity you need adaptive design
which is what these
these series of lectures are about and
in order to have the adaptivity you also
must allow for uniqueness and uniqueness
is possible only if you permit roughness
this topic could entertain an entirely
different lecture but
that's it we need to move on to echoes
here are some vaguely mountain ranges uh
helmut knight is from austria and have
gorgeous mountains in austria
so these are echoes
there are two types of echoes in
structure and design
first there is translational symmetry
similar forms found on the same scale
but at the distance
we have been talking about translational
symmetry
there is also scaling symmetry the
second type of echo
similar forms exist at different scales
one is a magnification of the other
why don't we say that is the isn't this
the echoes contained in symmetry
yes it is but uh christopher alexander
in in defining a separate property
wants to make the following point uh
things found in in
the built environment and in artifacts
are not exactly
the same or magnified or or at the same
scale
they're similar but not exactly the same
so even natural fractals they'll be
fractal
similarity so when you magnify a piece
of a natural fractal such as a
tree leaf or a cauliflower
it looks almost the same but not quite
there are variations
and that can be interpreted as the
roughness we had just uh
discussed so the concept of echoes
which is a looser looser type of
similarity
either in translational symmetry or in
scaling symmetry
drives this point across for use of an
architect
the void something empty
well isn't 20th century architecture
composed
mostly of voids
yes it is but the other stuff is missing
the void arises as the largest scale of
a fractal
you remember all the fractals we have
dealt with in this course
there is always a largest open component
and that survives as the void
the fractal fills in regions of focus
but does not go in and fill in
everything
it always leaves a void in an implied
center a complex boundary focuses on the
open middle and that's the void
the open middle of an implied center
the penultimate property simplicity in a
calm
this simple schematic is simple and
is has a calming effect to look at it
what does this mean
we want to introduce this in our design
it's a subtle it's a subtle quality
it implies a lack of clutter and it's so
important is to introduce a separate
property
when you achieve uh overall coherence
you achieve a balance
and vice versa balance is achieved by an
overall coherence
the symmetries are all cooperating to
support each other and there's nothing
extraneous or distracting if something
is distracting then it's not cooperating
to an overall coherence and when you
achieve that
it appears effortless or the experience
is effortless and you don't notice
how much work went into doing that uh
such a coherence
and we're talking now as designers and
builders and and urban planners
is extremely difficult to achieve you
have to work at it
extremely um extremely hard but when you
achieve it
the result appears effortless and that
is
that could be misleading to someone who
doesn't understand what's going on
let's look at nature to learn the lesson
of nature there's nothing simple in
nature
in the sense of the word simple being
used in a minimalist
sense simple in nature means extremely
complex
and at the same time extremely coherent
a system appears simple to us because it
is so perfect and the form is seamless
so the greatest achievements of nature
through physical
structure biological evolution appear
simple to us they feel wonderfully
beautiful to us
when we examine them from a mechanistic
point of view they're extremely
complicated we can hardly understand how
they work
do we do we understand how mosquito
works well hardly
so the simplicity we're talking about
here is that
coherence that we see in in natural and
biological objects
it is underpinned by an enormous
structural complexity that is so
coherent
that it appears simple to us so please
note how i'm using the word simple and
it's not
the the way it is used
by by most designers today
the final property is not separateness
symbolized here
by lightner in the yin yang diagram
of two inseparable
halves that make a perfect call our goal
is design is to achieve coherence
coherence is an emerging property it is
not present in the individual components
in the logical here and whole that has
achieved coherence there's no peace can
be taken away
no peace can be added a decomposition is
neither obvious
nor possible we can decompose
a coherent whole artificially for the
purpose of studying it but that's the
same
as um as doing um
as doing a surgery or an autopsy or an
animal as soon as you
separate something living into its
pieces it ceases to be alive
so while it is for didactic purposes
it's it helps us to see the components
of a coherent form
then we need to accept that the effect
is one of of coherence that's when all
the forms together and it's an emerging
property
and it cannot be understood from the
individual components
when we achieve coherence nothing looks
separate and nothing draws attention to
itself
there is a seamless blending of an
enormous number of complex components
and this is the opposite of willful
separateness
this last property goes outside
of the object itself it goes beyond
internal coherence
because you want to connect what you
have
to the to its environment so
not separateness extends to connect
the object to everything beyond itself
just like those centers the center is a
field concept that extends beyond itself
as far as you can possibly go
so if you're a designer an honest
designer following the precepts of these
lectures then you will try as much as
possible to generate large-scale
coherence
it means it does not stop within your
building it goes as far as possible
to the outside that is within your
the possibilities of your influence and
control
the 15 properties when applied to a
design
will give us a coherent form which is so
natural that it is hardly noticed
it is like nature we walk past a tree
a waterfall a stream and we don't notice
them
because they're so natural yet a single
bush
the the biological structure of a bush
as far surpasses anything that
humankind has created
now architects and students most often
wish to draw attention to their designs
which is a natural response however how
is that achieved
in order to draw attention to your
design
you can do so by violating the 15
properties
but when you do that it causes
physiological anxiety for the user
because it is perceived as unnatural
and we are
the most perfectly tuned instrument
for detecting what is natural and what
is unnatural and when we detect
something that's unnatural it causes
alarm and anxiety in us
therefore students and architects who
create something deliberately unnatural
to draw our attention
influence us negatively because they
they uh
deliberately make um produce anxiety
in the user that brings us to a moral
quandary
that i wish to present to my audience
do we follow the 15 properties to design
an adaptive nourishing environment
or do we deliberately break them and
design an eye-catching project
as many people do
we have to ask the following question is
playing with emotions and especially
anxiety
likely to promote my work
well that depends upon what is valued by
the society we live in and the times we
live in at the moment
critics and architectural prize winners
and professors of architecture
who wore degrees particularly value
work that generates anxiety so
even if you agree with everything i have
said you will be forced to
create works that generate anxiety the
other
question is climb client demand does the
client want a
eye-catching form that generates anxiety
or does the client want a um
an emotionally nourishing environment
architects have to do exactly what the
client demands they can
argue a little bit but not too much
because there are many architects
who can take the job so
whether consciously or unconsciously the
architectural design of the 20th century
has cultivated the absence of the 15
properties
that means that when i
talk about them and when alexander
discusses the 15 properties
students and architects respond
emotionally and very negatively to them
because they they have been conditioned
to certain images and
all those images that have been
presented
as paradigmatic good architecture
for people to build in a contemporary
style
that clashes obviously with a 15
property so
either you have to accept the 15
properties
as i have given them
and admit that this
architecture so highly praised generates
anxiety or you ignore the 15 properties
and continue with what you're doing to
praise
architects who intentionally generate
anxiety
i'm sorry to bring this up but this has
to be
addressed in the 21st century because we
are no longer
able to bury this under the rug
architects finally have a choice
to question the validity of the
contemporary built environment and the
ideology that gave rise to it
when you look at the arguments that
support those forms that violate the 15
properties they're terribly weak
and i speak as a scientist
very very weak arguments but there is a
momentum of course
in the whole profession and that that
carries them through even if the
arguments are terribly weak
how do we get our good examples if we
want to
build emotionally nourishing
architecture well we have to go to
traditional architecture
in all traditional architectures all
over the world
of all cultures of all periods
because those evolve using darwinian
processes to give us the maximum
degree of emotional nourishment
so that um that is the first part of the
talk and then just a little bit
to conclude on the three laws of
architecture that are introduced in my
book the theory of architecture
and i wanted to answer the i want to to
i wanted to answer the following
question
um christopher gives 15 properties and
he himself
says that they could be reduced but that
for
pedagogical reasons and and for actual
practice day-to-day practice in
architecture office
it's good to have 15 of them so my
question was how many
can we have and as the smallest number
the reduced basis and these are my own
thoughts which are complementary and and
help to understand the 15 properties
without
trying to substitute them so
i'm going to present three laws for
architecture the low one is ordered on
the smaller scale
by physical analogy this is established
by paired
contrasting elements the
pairs create a balanced visual tension
when i look at physics the elementary
particles with opposite characteristics
couple
we have positive and negative charges
coupling to form
atoms electrons and nuclei opposite spin
states
couple isospin states
couple etc
interested people interested listeners
can can
look at some physics textbooks and you
see that this is a fundamental rule
for the structure of matter there's
pairwise binding on subatomic atomic and
molecular levels
all of these are the short scale
some illustrations of my diagrams
pairwise coupling
uh say two ions a positive and a
negative ion the
the outside electron shell one has an
extra electron and the
and the the other one has a a gap
so that they pair and you create the
salt for example sodium chloride
is created by such coupling
crystallization
where we have um alternating
once you create a single atom of
sodium chloride salt you put a lot of
them together and you make a crystal
and then the crystal uh the crystal um
orders uh the sodium and chlorine atoms
in in a lattice that's very ordered and
the opposites are bound in a
two-dimensional
lattice to make a crystal
law two order on a large scale
here elements relate to each other at
the distance
the configuration which is composed of
different elements tries to induce the
reduce the entropy the entropy is
the degree of disorder
in order to reduce the disorder we shed
randomness
what do we mean by that well
crystallization that i just um
mentioned reduces entropy by aligning
atoms up in a regular lattice
very beautiful mathematical lattice
magnets
align along field lines
any field a physics field electric field
magnetic field
aligns things that are affected by it
and in order to reduce the energy so our
compass needle
aligns because it reduces its energy by
alignment
therefore long-range forces imply
ordering
and here are some uh some schematic
diagrams
we align the objects in order to reduce
the the state of energy
and here is just a simple reorientation
of alignment
and here's another reorientation
alignment along the field on the right
these could be iron filings that align
along magnetic fields
so this brings in ordering on the large
scale
and the third and final law is how to
link this mode to the large scale
since i have given low one says what
happens on the small scale and law two
says what happens on the large scale so
we need a
linking law how to link the two and the
linking occurs to a regular scaling
hierarchy which is the topic of lesson
one
so just to repeat uh and review that
there's a universal scaling factor
of the e the
the base for natural logarithms
approximately equal to 2.7
and the scales from the largest to the
smaller scale are related by the same
scaling ratio very approximate
and that links the small to the large
scale the hierarchy
so those who have been following uh my
lectures here
will will notice that all this
what i have just talked about the three
laws are not new they're contained
in the 15 properties but hopefully it's
another way of
looking at them that will help
in the conception here are some diagrams
to show how the
uh scaling hierarchy helps coherence in
the plan of urban space
so we have a plan here and we have a
large urban space and we have structures
all around
what i want to emphasize are these
little things that are occurring
those little things look like
traditional urban spaces
a a urban uh square in italy with uh
uh stores coffee tables uh
umbrellas on the outside uh statues of
the
commendatore on the corner etc cetera
a modernist urban space even if it had a
good shape like this
would get rid of all this clutter and
therefore it will not have a good
scaling hierarchy
here's our scaling hierarchy in the
building facade which could be a modest
skyscraper
again little things and remember the
universal distribution
uh the the smaller a component is the
more the
more of them they have to be so all
these little things what does this look
like
this looks like one of the most well
beloved skyscrapers
now i don't particularly like
skyscrapers but i love those turn of the
century
until about 1920. those wonderful
skyscrapers by louis sullivan
the flat iron building in new york they
have this structure they obey the
the hierarchy
so let me summarize everything
and and also as a reference
which of the 15 properties relate to the
first law
because my uh aim was
to contain as many of the laws as
possible in the smallest number of laws
alternating repetition is contained in
the first law
which was uh the contrast the coupling
of opposites
repetition of contrasting pairs not of a
single unit
deep interlock and ambiguity is again
local coupling occurs through
geometrical interlock
and contrast which is the basis for
coupling of units having opposite
qualities
which of the 15 properties relate to the
second law the second law
was uh that order is created by some
sort of field effect
alignment in order to shed randomness
so local symmetries
occur when disorder is reduced by having
actual symmetries
local meaning on a smaller and smaller
scale sub-symmetries
echoes gives you a similarity at the
distance or similarity in scaling and
that it reduces the entropy
because you have copies either
translated in a different position or
scaled up or down not separateness
reduces entropy
because it's a field effect and it ties
components together on different scales
which of the 15 properties relate to the
third law which is hierarchy
what levels of scales is the hierarchy
and uh
is that if there is any question about
it i'm not the one who
who gave the uh the hierarchy was it was
christopher in levels of scale who gave
the hierarchy and i just did some
mathematical background to to to help
define it and to support it the thick
boundaries
of course are part of of the hierarchy
the boundary is the next smaller scale
in the hierarchy
and the void that was one of the
things we just talked about is the
larger scale in the hierarchy which
balances all the smaller scales
and that's why in a fractal it is left
it exists
open always so that fractal builds
around the
the void so uh what what have i been
able to do well
i have been able to to reduce uh
the 15 properties into into a
three groups of of three and uh
sort of stick them together into three
laws but but not
for to replace them but hopefully to
shed more light
on on the 15 properties and and what i
want to
to do as a conclusion here
is to state that alexander's 15
properties
are an incredibly essential set of
practical design tools
please read christopher's own
justification
2000 pages of it but what i have done
is to give my own arguments based on
mathematics physics chemistry biology
to argue hopefully some of my arguments
are are novel and to support the the
importance of these properties
as a design tool now
the time has come i think in the history
of architecture when archivists have to
accept the 15 properties as universal
and i have to make a conscious decision
whether to follow them or not
and that decision must be made on
stylistic reason
stylistic reasons and whoever makes that
decision has to live with the
consequences
now many of my friends are traditional
architects
urbanists traditional practitioners
intuitively
recognize some of these 15 properties as
part of their own design method
not all some are unknown to them and
when i uh
when i lecture to traditional
practitioners they they love
that the fact that they're finally
getting a complete set
uh which uh which is extremely useful
in in everyday design so um we're
presenting
or christopher is presenting a coherent
set
of rules that can be used by everyone to
design
a a room or a or a chair
or an urban space or an entire city
so to to uh end this lecture i want to
say one thing and this is um
where i disagree with christopher my
good friend
i find that by giving six
lectures and then introducing the fifth
environmental properties
then listeners are ready to accept the
properties because
half of them have improved already so
they're eager for the completeness so
the
giving the 15 properties in today's
lecture satisfies the need for
completeness the complete set here they
are
and you can start using them uh
if however you introduce them
to people who are not particularly
receptive to them
in the beginning and say here they are
we have proven them using very
sophisticated arguments but
you accept them and you start using them
but there's a resistance because of the
shock
uh architecture students have been
given the good examples that totally
violate the 15 property so how do you
expect the architecture students
to accept these you can you can tell
them all you want that these have been
proven by mathematicians by physicists
by biologists uh 3 000 pages of
explanation well
it's easier for them to ignore of that
and just to block it out
and continue doing what i have been
doing because i have been taught
to uh to worship these anxiety-producing
forms that violate the properties
therefore as a is a didactic strategy
i think it is essential uh to do what i
have done which is to
to build up to the 15 properties and
these are these are given today this is
the sixth
lecture and this is right in the middle
of the series of twelve lectures
uh and as my my friend and colleague
kenneth mansdan
has remarked each of these lectures can
be taken and made
into a studio course for an entire
semester so
i apologize there's a lot of material
being given in each lecture that needs
more amplification and uh students to
actually
do these things make a project to
illustrate all these concepts and make
design
go out and measure things so i'm giving
just
the briefest of summaries and even so
it's filling out 12 lectures so
there is so much material here that
needs to be given
it may not have escaped my listeners
attention
that none of this material is presently
being taught in architecture schools
and you can draw your own conclusions
and with that
thank you very much and i hope to see
you next time
you
