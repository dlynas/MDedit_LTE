BHA Annual Conference 2013: Susan Blackmore on Free Will
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHP6fWwVqrk)

## Transcript:
my name's blai zegan i'm a trustee of
the bha and i'm a trustee of the center
for inquiry uk the uk end of the
american organization uh central inquiry
which publishes a skeptical inquirer and
the uk end is now uh under the wing of
the
bha um
uh people in the skeptic movement will
know the name of sue blackmore um from
way back and in 1991 she won the cycop
award
and um
the subject of her talk today is free
will something which has exercised the
minds of philosophers for uh quite some
time
and now scientists neuroscientists in
particular are getting involved and uh
and adding to uh
to it with quite a bit of empirical
content i think i'm sure we'll all be uh
very interested to see uh see uh what
that consists of so without further ado
i give you sue blackmore
you came here and pretty well
so living without free will
what i don't want to do today is enter
into all these difficult philosophical
arguments i am not going to mention
other than once compatibilism
incompatibilism harding all of these
philosophical things i'm actually
interested in
what to do if you realize that there's
no such thing as free will or perhaps
that free will isn't what you thought it
was how should we live our lives
it seems to me that humanists ought to
be interested in this question of how to
live without free will
humanists uh i'd simply looked up the
bha website on the train yesterday isn't
it wonderful you can just sit on the
train and have wi-fi and look things up
when you want to know and i took these
um from there
humanists trust to the scientific method
when it comes to understanding how the
universe works and reject the idea of
the supernatural
to some extent the ordinary idea of free
will would be supernatural it would be
the idea that somehow there's a me in
here who by some unknown weird way
intervenes in what's going on in the
brain and causes things to happen it
would be taking me back to my previous
life as mentioned by our chairman of
a skeptic as i used to call myself
a commitment to the perspective
interests and centrality of human
persons
so what is a human person humanists
calling themselves that should i think
be interested in this as i am and that's
what i want to talk about today
as i said i won't be talking um a lot
about
the
complex and subtle philosophical
arguments that have gone on for probably
three 000 years
i'm just taking a very ordinary view of
free will
when i asked you did you come here of
your own free will and different people
gave different answers you didn't go
well what do you mean maybe you know we
have an ordinary everyday concept that's
something like this
that i
this me
not the arms and legs or this bit of my
brain but me
has a thought i'm going to hit the
lectern and because i have that thought
it happens
something like that is the ordinary
sense of free will and that i am free to
choose
what i want to do
so let's have a go i suggest that both
the self who would do this
and free will itself are illusory
i want to be quite clear what i mean by
illusory
it's not quite as simple as saying
there's no such thing now this morning
lee cronin said i think he was talking
about me he said oh cyril kill me
and that's probably because when i talk
about consciousness i say no i'm not
saying it doesn't exist i'm saying it's
not what we think it is
now i'm very close to saying it doesn't
exist but the reason i put it this way
is that
there's there's a problem
i mean in terms of consciousness there's
how it is
and we need to explain that so there is
a problem to be explained but not
because there's something called
consciousness that we need to explain
same with life there isn't something
called life that we need to explain
there's all these processes and and so
on so when it comes to self and free
will when i'm saying they're illusory
i want to think about what we mean by
the word illusion
here's a very nice illusion for you it
might make you feel a bit squiffy-eyed i
hope you enjoy it it's a particularly
nice illusion because it seems to
respond to what you do
if you look at one corner it stays still
and all the others move and then you
look at another one ah it's horrible
isn't it i'm not even going to look are
you enjoying that
now this is a very straightforward kind
of illusion in the sense that it is a
um
appearance reality confusion the thing
appears to be moving in reality it's
staying still unless i'm doing something
clever here but i'm not you know it's
staying still and it seems to move so
that's just an appearance reality
confusion
um the sort of illusions that i'm
talking about are rather more tricky
than that
because
we can't say
we can't measure what's real about self
or free will but it's the same idea
not that there's nothing there but that
the way we think about these things is
wrong
getting in a muddle with this i decided
to do something really really um
fundamental and i got down my penguin
dictionary and i looked up illusion
this is when i was getting in trouble
with people for saying nothing you say
it doesn't exist
so i looked it up in the dictionary and
the most common definition i looked at
lots of dictionaries is a false
impression or notion something that
deceives or misleads intellectually and
that's what i'm going to say about free
will
if we think we have this magical thing
called free will in the ordinary
everyday sense not the clever
philosophical
myriad ways of of changing it in that
ordinary sense then i would say we are
deceived or misled
in other words
an illusion like self or free will is
something that's not what it seems to be
so
let's think about
what you seem to be
i would like you please now just to sit
quietly for a minute like we did this
morning already
and just feel
how does it seem being you now
does it feel something like this
well i know you know that there isn't a
sofa in your brain or any levers for you
to pull
but i suggest that for at least some of
you it probably does feel as though you
inhabit
your head
in some sense you are
inside there
does it feel like that
no okay hands up and what i'm talking
about here is is the sort of feeling
that well now out i'm here
here are my eyes and i'm i'm somewhere
behind here looking out through the eyes
i can hear the clinking of china
somewhere it's over there i'm here where
am i well i'm not the whole body because
this is my foot
this is my hand
this is my brain clearly i'm not
my my hand i'm over here i'm looking at
my hand
so it all gives this kind of feeling of
i'm i'm in here
looking out experiencing the world
around me so hands up who feels somehow
that way
yup quite a lot of you hands up who
doesn't feel that way
is that through years of meditation is
it through intellectual inquiry or
drugs
excellent excellent
there are definitely plenty of drugs
that will uh move your sense of self
yes i won't be distributing lsd or
mescaline later on but um that would
certainly change the idea itself but as
some of you will know this is
what dan dennett calls the american
philosopher dan dennett calls the
cartesian theater
now this comes from his 1991 book
consciousness explained which many
people going it's just consciousness
explained away he doesn't think it
exists
and that's one of these problems about
um trying to clarify consciousness
but really that whole book is a kind of
extended riff on the non-existence of
the cartesian theater
and what he argues is something like
this
everybody with any sense at all
99 of neuroscientists philosophers
psychologists reject straightforward
cartesian dualism in other words the
idea that there really is a mental world
and a physical world or thinking stuff
and extended stuff mind brain
it just gives rise to the mind body
problem which appears to be insoluble
somehow or another
it all has to be one and we don't know
how so most neuroscientists are
materialists they say it's all material
somehow and then they have the problem
of trying to explain consciousness um
other people do it from as we heard from
someone this morning are idealists they
take it the other way then you've got to
explain the existence of the physical
world all of these problems um are very
difficult but most people reject
cartesian dualism but says danette
when they do that
they still hang on to a whole lot of
baggage which ought to be thrown out
along with that dualism
he says when you discard cartesian
dualism you really must discard the show
that would have gone on in the cartesian
theater and the audience as well because
neither the show nor the audience exists
inside the brain and the brain is the
only real place there is to look for
them
now i'm not going to be talking about
the show here
i often do talk about perception and how
it doesn't make a picture in the brain
and so on and the show really doesn't
exist anywhere at all and we just kind
of think there's a show like looking at
all this i'm going to talk more about
the audience who seems to have free will
who sits there somehow inside like a
ghost in the machine pulling the levers
pulling the arms and legs making the
muscles work and ought to be discarded
along with dualism
i was very
pleased are you here the lady who taught
met me last night and said about new
scientists was it you yeah um she came
up to me last night and said have you
seen this week's new scientist there's
an article from a neuroscientist about
freewheel he's discovered how freewill
works and rushed out well actually my
husband adam rushed out and um kindly
bought me the new scientist and i read
it with increasing horror
what how can i
um this this man peter ulrich t
has
some interesting comments about how
neural spikes firing affect the
probability of firing in the next few
moments of other neurons in other words
the flexibility is happening much faster
than previously people thought
and this it seems to him
makes free will possible somewhere in
between chance and determinacy he says
it's possible
but note in the midst of all this it's
to me i'm just like ah
but very interesting to have free will
requires that our self
that which we feel directs our attention
around our conscious experience
has some say in the matter of what we do
or think so he's taking
the ordinary everyday
apparent certainty that there's this
thing called a self
that directs our attention around
a contents of consciousness which is
itself phenomenally controversial that
there's any such thing
um and that this has some say in other
words some control over um what we do or
think
so he's really restating the ordinary
sense of free will
and somehow slithering from that into
he's found how it works how the self
this
hypothetical entity um directs attention
and um has some say in what we think or
do
so i'm going to think about that self or
rather i'd like to encourage you to
think about yourself
again just feel who am i what kind of
thing am i when i say me
here are some of the qualities that
people typically attribute to themselves
in some sense i am unified
in other words
i'm sitting here standing here and i
look over there i look over there and i
look over there
there's just one me in this complex
world with all this other stuff going on
and the things i'm aware of
are all unified into what i'm aware of
now it's persisting
that means the self that woke up this
morning in bed in rome whatever it was
on the 12th floor um is the same me
who's here now and is the same me who
will in
half an hour walk off
out of this room
i persist through my life if you like
going to sleep waking up all that but
persisting
i'm the subject of experiences i am now
experiencing the sound of these words
coming out of this mouth and the sound
of the projector and the sound of
somebody doing something strange with a
shoe over there and
and people beginning to warm up i think
there's less shivering going on and
somebody's taken her hood off
so it must be getting warmer
the subject of experiences and finally
the one who decides
the one who is who decided to come here
and is responsible for
this body being here
that i would suggest is a pretty good
collection of the things that people
seem to be
but
how can that be
i'm not going to give a great talk on
on which bits of the brain do what not
the point of this picture is just that
take it down to any
very very small levels and we can say an
awful lot about what is going on where
but one of the most interesting things
to say about the brain structure the
general way it's structured is it is a
multiple parallel machine
we may feel as though there's a world
out there and the information comes in
to me where i am in the middle and then
i decide what to do but the brain isn't
organized like that
if we just take the visual system for
example back here in um well the whole
visual system starts with the eyes
information comes in goes into the
thalamus um all sorts of things happen
there and goes off in different ways but
in here you've got something like 40
parallel pathways in the visual system
and what happens that information well
it doesn't all go off into 40 parallel
pathways and then come back together
to make the show in the cartesian
theater where the audience is looking it
all just keeps going
it just keeps going
it controls different things in
different ways some of it like like for
example color information is is
processed in v4 lines and edges in v1
all sorts of different things are going
on in different places and some of the
information goes to the verbal areas to
construct what you're saying and some
goes to the art to them
motor cortex to do control your arms and
legs and other bits go off into
temporal lobe and store things in memory
and all this stuff is all going it
doesn't all come together
to create
the picture you see in front of you
because there really isn't a picture you
see in front of you or are you to see it
at least that's how it looks in this
multiple parallel system where would the
self be
and what would it be doing
because the more we understand about the
way the brain works
the less room there seems to be
for anything else to come in there and
do something
in fact i think it's rather wonderful
that the more we learn about brain
function and it's going so fast now
fantastic scanning methods and you know
brilliant stuff going on in neuroscience
the worse these basic questions become
where is the room for something called
consciousness
or self
or free will
when you ask where any of the jobs that
these things would do
are going on you'll find there's a bit
of the brain doing that job well it
doesn't need me as well so am i
redundant
yes i
the arrogance that i thought there was
somebody in here is redundant it's a
fantasy it's just an invented idea that
that is not true and doesn't correspond
to what's going on in the brain that at
least is my conclusion from having a
look at some of this stuff
so there are fundamentally two ways of
thinking about self and you can see
which side i'm on but i would like i
mean can be wrong so let's have a look
at the two fundamental ways of thinking
about self this of course is a bit crude
but it's a nice scheme um invented by
the philosopher derek parfitt
and in his book reasons and persons but
elsewhere as well
and he divides theories of self into ego
theories and bundle theories
so an ego theory is all those qualities
that i gave before it's a theory nothing
to do with floyd's ego and that stuff
just just plain kind of there is really
a self
it might be a it might be a
a
distributed process in the brain it
might be a soul it might be a spirit it
might be i mean anything it doesn't
matter
but in ego theory it's a persisting
mental and entity
that is the subject of your experiences
and makes your decisions
that if you think there's such a thing
then you're an ego theorist
bundle theory named after david hume's
um
idea that um when he looked deeply into
himself had greatly these people who
really in descartes included really look
into their own experience said you know
i can find all these different
perceptions and feelings and so on
but i never find the self who's having
them i never find anything but the self
and the the the feelings and the
perceptions
there's they're just tied together like
a bundle perhaps tied together by the
string of memory or something like that
but there isn't someone who is having
them so after him it was named bundle
theory
so those are the two options
interestingly they divide
religions
right into two
so you've got the great monotheistic
religions christianity islam judaism so
on
in which you
are a precious god-given soul
who here believes in a soul
i i i wouldn't be surprised if there
were one or two people who just wouldn't
dare put their hands up in a humorous
place um i don't think i've ever i i
wasn't intending to ask that question i
thought
this should be none in a place like this
i've never spoken to an audience before
where there weren't people who put their
hands up when i used to teach
consciousness course in bristol um
typically in a student environment there
would be maybe a quarter of the people
would say they believe in seoul not
necessarily religious people
um and in america of course it's nearly
everybody
um
um
because it's so such a powerful feeling
we have of being somebody in here and so
difficult to understand what that might
be that it's very very tempting so
christianity islam take that
take it big time you persist you were
born um you carry on you go on through
to the death of the physical body but
you are not the physical body and you
are responsible for what you did and you
go to heaven or hell
so you are a soul in those ones
buddhism interestingly is very different
and it's quite um i mean it's different
also in being an atheist religion um
but different in the sense of
what a self is supposed to be and one of
the buddha's
primary insights is what is called anata
or no self and derek parfit says that
the buddha was
the buddha was the first
and now i'm afraid that was an accident
we still have to use those we still have
to discriminate in those ways but not
for the reason that that's really real i
think
um so profits himself in in his writings
about ego and bundle theory said that
the buddha was the first bundle theorist
well the first bundle things we know
about quite possibly people realized
this long before but we we don't know
here's a nice statement from the buddha
i mean all this was written down a lot
later so we don't really know what he
said but this bundle of elements this
thing here bundle of elements their
elements were different from our modern
elements but the principles the same
this bundle of elements is void of self
in it there is no sentient being
conscious being
just as a set of wooden parts receives
the name of carriage so do we give to
elements the name of fancied being
i always think of my car i've got a
lovely ford focus called zaza
that's because her um number plate is
zedze
and um
if i think about she's a replacement for
my last one which had bits falling off
and had you know tires replaced and
exhausts replaced and other bits in the
engine replaced and new spark plugs and
you know we're quite happy with a car to
say well we could replace this we could
place everything actually we could have
a new body and then a new engine he's
still my car
somehow we're not quite so happy to
think about ourselves this way
hence all the arguments we have when new
medical technologies come along people
go oh but it's you know it's life it's
human
but the buddha would say
and and that's remarkable really two and
a half thousand years ago to be
basically saying we're just a set of
elements
and we give it a name that's fine this
is sue blackmore no problem giving this
thing here a name but it's just fancied
being it's a temporary conglomeration of
elements and there isn't a sentient
being inside it
a conscious self separate so he was in
in that very clear sense a bundle
theorist
so would you like to think for a moment
which you are an ego theorist or a
bundle theorist
hands up ego theorists
hands up bundle theorists
hands up people who didn't put their
hand up
cowards
okay let pardon are they mutually
exclusive
the way prophet's trying to put them is
to try to make the mutual divorce um
that's how i like to use it too to force
people to one side or the other there
they're crude you know there's all kinds
of subtleties you can bring into it but
they're supposed to be mutually
exclusive yes just to try and force you
to what you're thinking about now those
of you who say that you are bundle
theorists do you have a certain
discomfort about it
yeah yeah some of you don't some of you
do fine what i discovered when i taught
for many many years um undergraduate
consciousness course
was that people often said to me and i i
love this all that sort of painful in a
way they would say to me you know over
these weeks or months that we've been
studying consciousness
i've gone from being an ego theorist to
being intellectually a bundle theorist
but i know i can feel deep down i still
feel that that there is a me
and i great
that's that's what to live with work
with think about feel you're not alone
it's really really hard
that's something that i've tackled a lot
it's what buddhist practitioners tackle
a lot um is um
is this concept of well what if you're
not a persisting self then
what is this feeling and can it go
away now
somebody asked me a question last night
about reincarnation so i just want to
make a quick comment on that because i
will be mentioning buddhist buddhism
again and i've been training in zen for
more than 30 years and i'm not a
buddhist i haven't signed up to any
dogmas and beliefs until but i find the
training
in meditation and mindfulness and so on
extremely helpful and that's how i've
come to learn quite a bit about buddhism
now certain kinds of buddhism tibetan in
particular have what i would say a very
kind of crude basic idea of
reincarnation which is you know there's
something that's reincarnated and lives
on different lives it doesn't it's
completely incompatible with anata with
the basic insight about you know
carriage and fancy being and all that i
think the memes of we exist and we go on
into future lives are just far more uh
they thrive far better in the human
human culture than the difficult memes
of actually you may feel there's someone
in there but there isn't
um in zen there's much less of that sort
of idea and some rather subtle concepts
of of what reincarnation might mean
which do not entail anybody going on
into another life and so on
um so i mean it is a big problem for
modern people
encountering buddhism so just that's
kind of a side if you like
so
there we are some ego theorists and some
bundle theorists that's all i want to
say about self really although it
threads through everything else i'm
going to say because i want to move on
to this great sticky problem of free
will
people have struggled with it for a long
time samuel johnson said one of the most
famous quotes on free will all theory is
against the freedom of the will all
experience for it
and it's the same kind of conflict that
you've just experienced over ego and
bundle theory
kind of think well logically it can't be
but
surely i came here of my own free will
and um boswell said sire we know our
will is free and there's an end on it
which is common enough response from
people today
and again we have this uh clash um and
this difference between the religions so
that christianity and islam say that god
gave you that soul it gave you free will
so that you could choose between good
and evil and then you either go to
heaven or hell because of the choice you
made and you really do have free will
you're either a good person or a bad
person and we know the kinds of
consequences that that attitude can lead
to rather depressingly
um and again in um in buddha in buddhism
it's very different indeed and this is
my absolute all-time favorite quote uh
from buddhist um
teachings
actions exist and also their
consequences
but the person that acts does not
so this
action
has consequences the action exists this
body really did go wow
and the consequences are i might have
broken that i didn't but i've heard
slightly hurt my hand because i hit it
too hard to make a nice noise for you
the consequences exist and will go on
having effects um down into the future
which is the more subtle idea of what
karma means um but the person that acts
does not
in other words there's a body that acts
but there isn't a person in there a
sentient being who did the action
now i understand from from various
scholars of sanskrit and pali that there
was no concept of free will in in the
languages
in pali in which the early scriptures
were written
but i think this would be if there had
been it would say that there isn't any
free will but that's kind of contentious
so
do you believe in free will
i've already asked you that question so
let us go on to some thoughts about um
what that might mean
well where do you act from
thinking about that brain again
where would you be doing the actions
from
well i got this lovely piglet thing
and they're very sweet aren't they who
else has bought one of these from the
yeah one person has two
it's a i've never even heard of clangers
apparently i was alive when they were on
telly but i've never heard of them
anyway it's very very sweet and this um
this this clanger here is going to help
me now with something very important
hey
well done excellent
go on then i can always buy another
right um okay mike langer has gone into
a new has been reborn in a new life with
a new owner i hope you're very kind to
him and look after him well
now what happened there what is your
name please sir stephen stephen okay
stephen caught the clanger
now you might think or stephen might
think oh
i saw her rave her arm i saw the clanger
coming towards me and i decided i better
catch it so i reached up my arms and i
caught it
that would be the kind of natural way we
think about it but it isn't true it
can't be true
we know that um i mentioned all these
parallel pathways but there are two very
important fundamental pathways from the
visual system to other parts of the
brain
the dorsal stream goes up here to the
motor cortex which is along here here
and it's a very fast stream of
information
if an object is coming towards you the
whole system is set up so that you will
very quickly go
or
or
a little bit of processing goes on to
determine whether you're going to catch
it and which will go through another
automatic system for bringing hands
together or whether you're going to bat
it away whether you're going to protect
yourself or whether you're just going to
duck out of the way if it was a brick
you would probably duck so it's not it's
not in incredibly fast like the very
early system that goes up here through
the superior helicopter straight to the
eye muscles to make your eyes go like
this that's really fast this one's a
little bit slower
but it is not fast enough to know that
it was a clanger there's no way that by
the time you had already started
reaching your arms up you would know
what that object was what color it was
what shape it was or anything like that
because all that analysis goes on in a
separate pathway down here which goes
into the temporal lobe
and is called the ventral stream and
that is where object recognition uh
where the color information comes
together with shape information and so
on to decide what that object is compare
it with things you've seen in the past
and if you'd heard of a clanger you
might go here comes a clanger if you're
me you'd think that's a little pink
piglet
um but that's all afterwards so it is
after the fact that we retrospectively
go back and say i saw it coming and so i
caught it and we do this all the time
post-hoc confabulation we tell stories
about what we're doing it's actually a
massive parallel processing system just
getting on with its stuff with a little
talky job going on in broker's area or
somewhere around there uh telling
stories about what we've done to try to
make sense of it for ourselves
now i would like you all please to do
something for me
uh i don't want you to tickle the person
in front or hurt anybody or anything
else but i would like you please to hold
out one arm like this
and then whenever you feel like it
voluntarily and of your own free will
just go like this
flip your hand
and i want you to do that for quite a
long time please
um unless your arm gets too tired and
just get the feel of what it's like to
do this
okay
now i told you what to do but i didn't
tell you when to do it
the reason that i'm asking you this is
because that action was the basis of
what is undoubtedly the most famous
experiment ever done on consciousness
studies ever and that is libit's
experiment on deliberate action how many
of you know about libits experiment
not that many fine uh forgive me boring
you but actually a lot of you who know
about it will have not had it explained
in this way it's quite hard to
understand and i'm trying to make it
easy by doing it in this way and i think
you'll see why it's the most uh famous
experiment so i want to ask you a
question about your own action there
when you were doing this
what do you think came first these are
libits
he was a a neuropsychologist in
california he's died now these
experiments were done in the mid 80s
w will that is the feeling you have that
i'm i'm going to do it now
a the action that's when you actually do
it
and the readiness potential the
resonance potential is found in you can
detect it by electroencephalogram in the
motor strip across here
and it's a kind of ramp function that
starts something like and somewhere
between half a second and a second
depending on the kind of action it is
and it kind of goes like up up
just before the action goes down again
so you can measure if you do it many
times the beginning of the readiness
potential that's the start of the brain
preparing for an action
so i want you to think about this when
you did this and you decided when to
move
which came first
w
or the readiness potential the moment
you decided to act
or the
readiness potential in the brain
hands up who thinks will came first
hands up who thinks readiness potential
came first
hands up who thinks they come at the
same time
uh no but it's the feeling of wanting to
do it that we're talking about this kind
of the feeling that you have yeah yeah i
agree with you you can't um
uh but this is i'm trying to get at his
experiment so you can understand that
what he did
now libert was a dualist
if you believe that your will your
conscious thought wanting to do
something comes first you're basically a
dualist you're basically saying there's
this separate thing called thought that
causes the physical brain to start up
okay fine
that that's what he wanted to prove
and if you say the readiness potential
came first then you're saying that the
will is um
not what starts the action obviously so
how did libert measure this
what he did was to put electrodes on the
wrist which can very easily measure when
you move
put electroencephalogram electrodes on
the motor cortex which can easily
measure the readiness potential
but now he needs to measure their moment
of will
how do you time exactly when the person
feels they're going to move any
suggestions
yes
um you can have like something spinning
and when you reach the top you
i think you're getting that from the
picture but it when it reaches the top
it's giving you the time so that
wouldn't be when you're spontaneously
coming up with it somebody here said
voice
yes if you if you use the voice then
you've got all the problems you yeah i
mean
it takes just as long to almost as long
to say something as it does to flick
your wrist so that's that big delay
which is unmeasurable it won't help
we're trying to measure something mental
not something physical a clicker
uh that would be a physical action as
well and he's trying to measure the the
mental the thought the actual when i
consciously decide to move of my own
free will he's trying to measure that um
that would be that would be an
interesting one because that's very fast
uh but it's still a delay and not
measurable delay because you really
don't you know you don't know whether
time when you felt it and you can't you
know you've got to measure that to know
how long the delay is
brainwaves you're back in the physical
again
and when he's trying to measure
something mental not something physical
well i'll tell you how i did it because
this is really why his experiment was so
famous
what he did was to use a revolving spot
on a screen
and um
imagine it's like a clock uh clockwise
is that way isn't it for you
so the spot is revolving like this so
it's one o'clock two three four six
nine whatever
and he got people to shout out where the
spot was at the moment they decided to
move
now this is very clever because
it doesn't matter when you shout it out
you shout it out 10 minutes later you
can remember it for 10 minutes and and
say it afterwards it doesn't matter the
point you're actually making a
simultaneity judgment you're actually
judging where was this when i thought
about it and he did lots of subsidiary
experiments with flashing lights and
poking things and whatever people are
very good at saying where the spot was
when something happened so that's how he
did it so we're going to have a go at
what his subjects did all right so i
want you please to put out your arm in
front of you as you did before do
exactly the same thing as you did before
but when you decide to move shout out
where the spot is okay off you go
come on i want to 300 people shouting
excellent well done there are
thousands of papers written about this
experiment i'm not kidding thousands um
there are several whole books about it
and lots and lots of arguments one of
which is that you can't do the task you
can do the task you've just done it
what on earth it actually means is
another matter
philosophically it's extremely weird to
see what you're measuring but you're
measuring something you are able to
shout out where the number is
something meaningful to you about when
you did it
when you thought you wanted to move
so he was able in this way to say what
comes first
and i'm afraid to say that libit was
pretty upset with the results
because they were absolutely clear and
they've gone on with modern technology
with fmri scans pet scans and other
methods it's been confirmed again and
again that this is what happens if the
action happens at time zero
the
decision to move or the moment of w as
he called it happens on average 200
milliseconds that's a fifth of a second
before the action whereas the readiness
potential starts up half a second before
what this means i am not going into
because thousands of books i could give
many hours of lectures and i wouldn't
come to it but it's still
a very interesting hint about how we
feel about our own actions
there have been more experiments of a
rather different kind more recently
only a few years ago in which subjects
were asked to move either left or the
right hand and the experimenters with
brain scans measured different areas for
example the prefrontal cortex where um
deliberation goes on which one should i
do oh i wonder i feel like left this
time blah blah blah uh here where the
readiness potential is in the motor
strip uh this is a hand specific
um activity
and they were able to measure all these
in different parts of the brain
and just cut a long story short having
measured all this going on they were
able
by looking at what was happening in the
brain to predict which hand the person
would move
a long time before
the outcome of the decision they said
can be encoded in brain activity of
prefrontal and parietal cortex up to 10
seconds before it enters awareness
now again i'm going
what does enter's awareness mean you
idiot there's no such thing that you
know they should have said something
like before people are able to say that
that's what they're going to do or
something of that kind but never mind
the the point is clear they've they've
discovered how long before things are
building up which are going to determine
that action in the end
the final experiments i'll just mention
briefly with dan wagner what he's done
is some wonderful experiments with ouija
boards
in which um he engineered it so that um
there was a confederate and the subject
thought that the other the confederate
was another subject and they were
together to move the pointer around and
stop on a particular position and he
engineered it so that on some occasions
the subject
would think that they were in charge
when actually the confederate had
decided where it would stop and vice
versa he was able to do a two by two
separation of the feeling that you did
it
and whether you really did do it
and he was able to conclude from that
that
the feeling that we have done something
is built up in the brain from timing
from when the thought occurs and so on
and when the action happens the
connection between them
and it's one of these wonderful um
uh
correlation and cause things
now i'm sure you know any of you who are
scientists will and probably uh plenty
others as well there's always a problem
if you find a correlation it doesn't
necessarily imply a cause well because
somewhere but if if you have a
correlation between a and b it doesn't
mean a causes b it could be b causes a
could be c causes both of them it could
be all sorts of things going on
and that's what he says about thoughts
and our actions
so what we perceive
again and again and again like i'm going
to hit this
is there's a thought
in the right timing a little bit later
the action happens so we think that the
thought caused the action
in fact he says uh all sorts of things
are going on in the brain and they all
give rise to both of these things and we
just this little bit after the fact this
post-hoc confabulator um
decides that i
my thoughts caused the action his
conclusion is our sense of being a
conscious agent who does things
comes at the cost of being technically
wrong all the time
now there are maybe many of you here who
think well she's wrong i can see all
that but i still think that's pretty
well fair enough but there are probably
some of you who also like me feel no
free will is an illusion i'm deluded
about it or i was deluded about it if
you're not any more deluded um but how
do i live my life without free will
it's very interesting i've interviewed a
lot i've been lucky enough to be able to
interview a lot of people i don't think
they've got my book com
sorry uh conversations on consciousness
here but this is when i interviewed a
lot of neuroscientists and philosophers
about consciousness and i asked them all
do you have free will
and the answers were absolutely
fascinating most of them said yes
um and of those who didn't um well there
are various ways of kind of getting
around it
um so what do you do when you
do you just ignore the feeling hope
it'll go away
just like we did with ego and bundle
theory i don't like it it's
uncomfortable
lots of people do that
or do you just act as if you have free
will because after all if you don't act
as if you've got free will the whole
world will fall apart and you'll do that
you'll go rampaging around killing old
ladies and you know just for fun and
doing awful things and murdering people
and i don't know taking drugs and just
doing terrible things
um
and the whole society would break down
on the rule of law and oh it's a
terrorist i've got to behave as if there
is
or
just get on with it stop believing it
and live your life without now i think
all of you here
and if there are any exceptions you
won't let on
live without believing in god
that may have been very difficult for
some of you depending on your background
and how you were brought up
you may be tempted at times of real life
to go oh my god or even dear god please
let this not happen you know it's so you
know but you manage don't you
you you you know it's easier now you got
used to it
you don't rely on being someone who's
going to get you out of trouble or
whatever it is or somebody who loves you
up in the sky you've got over it and you
can get over free will too
so among the people i interviewed i got
some very interesting reactions kevin
o'regan you really would have thought
that he would say
that he had got over it
he says everybody's a robot he's known
he's a robot since he was a little boy
of about four when he started reading
about neuroscience
um and he said but when i asked him
about it he said yes everybody does even
robots believe they have free will even
if they don't
okay
i started to despair then because he was
my kind of hero of we're all robots well
john cell's famous i mean he absolutely
believes in it very famous american
philosopher well i don't have a choice
about that
um
thank you um we all think we have free
will and there's no way we can think
away our own free will in other words
what i'm advocating or what i do myself
i'm not advocating it necessarily but
i'm trying to explain that it's possible
is to give it up to give up a sense of
free will well i say he's wrong
when i go in the restaurant this is
really famous statement of his about
restaurants and spaghetti i might decide
well i'll have the spaghetti but i'm not
forced to have the spaghetti i could
have done something else
but the point is of course you could
have done something else if this little
bit of your brain been slightly
different or the waitress had not such a
nice smile or the person opposite you
hadn't ordered something else or
whatever had been slightly different of
course
and i'm not talking about being forced
or coerced or put in prison i'm just
talking about ordinary people in
restaurants
why you decide to have the spaghetti is
because of all those things in the
universe that have come together at that
moment with a brain and an arms and legs
and a table in a menu and that's what
happened
so i disagree with him but then we get
susan greenfield whom some of you will
know
i believe very much in my own free will
and then she said
well i suppose i can see that you might
be in your sue blackmorey way sitting
there and saying oh i wonder what she's
going to order but i don't think that
every minute of your life you think i
wonder what she's going to do
well you might if you have schizophrenia
well actually i do i mean i quite often
find myself when i get to those moments
of a decision has to be made
and that's a bit nerve-wracking and that
there's still still a little bit for me
there's a temptation of of thinking i've
got to decide and then i just replace
that with
i wonder what she'll do
and that wondering what she will do
might include her actually getting a
piece of paper and writing pros and cons
that's the extreme but it will very
often include her thinking well if i do
that that'll happen if i do that that'll
happen i wonder what she'll do and then
she does one or the other
but according to um springy well i must
there must be something a bit loopy
about me if i go around doing that
perhaps you think there is that's fine
so don't follow my example if you don't
want to be schizophrenic
now dan wagner is a very interesting
example he's the one who said you're
technically wrong all the time
he said i do the as if
and i think almost everybody who's happy
and healthy tends to do that
in other words again the implication
that you wouldn't be happy or healthy
if you didn't do the as if
but then it was very interesting when i
really pushed him i enjoyed these
interviews so much because it was a
chance to really push people who know
what they're talking about
um he said
oh no i haven't got it there i'm really
sorry he said something like
or maybe i've got it later i'll come to
it later i think i probably have
um another people i interviewed that's
pat and paul churchill there we had
breakfast i had breakfast with pat and
paul churchill and lunch with
francis crick and then zoomed back to
tucson for their consciousness
conference it was a most thrilling day
and got on the stage and sang a song
with dan dennett
you don't get many days like that in a
lifetime
so over breakfast what pat churchill
said was the standard model that you
consciously identify the options you
consciously do an expected utility
calculation you consciously choose and
then the actions executed is a useful
user illusion
so she's saying it's it is an illusion
but it's useful
and again she wouldn't give it up
people are very very loath to give it up
so am i alone
in trying to give it up because that's
what i've been doing i would say since
i've been a teenager i can remember as a
teenager really struggling with this
i went back recently and looked in my
diaries and i found in my 20s
arguments with my then boyfriend about
free will and me saying it couldn't
exist and how could you live without it
and so on i've been doing it a long time
the meditation has helped a great deal
um because the that's explicit in in
there but no i'm not alone in these
interviews that i did here's that here's
the one of dan wagner he said well
yes i do the asif but
i do think that i don't have to worry
about every little thing things happen
well and have happened well throughout
my life as a result of simply allowing
this machinery to do its operation
and i think to me in the end that's
getting close to what the skill i'm
talking about is it's letting go
it's letting this clever machinery that
evolved with this clever brain and these
amazing arms and legs and everything
else just get on with it without
interference of a mythical me
who's supposed to control it
giving up control giving up being in
there and the one who's in charge
allowing the machinery to do its
operation
and rama you some of you may know his
wonderful work on phantom limbs and all
sorts of other things
he said i think it's a bit like i really
had to push him to this
but once he got going on the shiva thing
he was really good and he's brought up
as a hindu um i think it's a bit like
the whole dance of shiva thing that you
think you're an aloof spectator by
yourself watching the universe
but actually you're just part of the
cosmic ebb and flow of the world
that's enobling rather than
diminishing and this is a thought that
somehow we feel there's the world the
universe doing and me
it's kind of arrogant isn't it the whole
universe and me
no it's just the universe this is the
universe
i'm not separate from it
and then takes one very much in this
direction
two
there's names are given to it
non-volitional functioning the way of
non-action or not doing
when i was first told when i started
practicing zen that it that meditation
led to non-meditation in the end i was
like what you mean i'm going to meditate
for years and years and years and years
and finally learn how to not meditate do
well yeah actually because the giving up
of the self who would be doing the
meditation eventually culminates in well
there's a body sitting but there's
nobody doing it actions exist and all
the so they're consequences but the
person that acts does not
so
well
will you
thank you
yes susan at what age does
an infant first show signs of having a
sense of self
what age does an infant show signs of
having a sense of self i am not a
developmental psychologist so i don't
really know but it it's around 18 months
that they're able to recognize self in a
mirror and self-recognition in a mirror
is one of those tests but then there's
masses and masses of research going on
on theory of mind which is the idea that
we have a theory that other people have
minds and that reflects back on what we
think about ourselves having minds and
that develops slowly and gradually
there's no one time at which you get a
sense of self it's gradually you get
different aspects of the sense of self
and one of the big questions is um
if that's happening is it useful and if
so for what purpose and are you better
as a fully functioning human being like
our jesus chap this morning was telling
us you know we go on through life trying
to get better is it better to develop
that good self um before throwing it
over um these are big open questions we
don't know but it's a it's a gradual and
complex process
uh people should take the microphone
well you can choose just give the
microphone to whoever you like
and i'll uh
i wonder what your thoughts were i have
a quite i have a profoundly autistic son
who has no sense of of mind or other
people's existence there's only samuel
in samuel's world and how does this fit
in with your your thoughts
i think the only thing i can say is i
think trouble is i'm not a you know i i
know absolutely nothing about that kind
of psychology at all i'm really sorry
autism is very difficult and i and it
must be difficult to cope with but i
haven't a clue i'm sorry it's a totally
different kind of end of psychology
dealing with
problems that people have i'm just kind
of dealing with brain stuff
sorry
let's come over and
i mean i'm
basically i feel because it's i kind of
come from an anthropological background
um i was quite curious what your
thoughts would be on
in terms of you sort of briefly touched
it already in the q a um
how much
social
sociability and everyone else impacts on
our own free will is there something in
do is it kind of
i don't know again i'm not really not
being very articulate because these are
these ideas already occurred to me
because of your talk but um you know
because surely we need to kind of see
free will in other people to then you
know know who to blame
yes
i think there's implicit in there in
your inarticulate question you were
struggling towards two big questions and
i may be wrong but let's have a go i
think one is
does the sense of free will differ
across different cultures and yes it
does very much so
for many reasons one is the structure of
languages so languages that have a very
powerful eye in every sentence are going
to get much more sense of self that is
the one with the free will and so on
some languages are not like that um some
don't even have a specific word for i
not very many but there are some and
that must influence people a lot but
then there's the religious background
because if you're brought up in a in a
you know hard-line christian atmosphere
then you're going to be told from the
start that that's what's the most
important thing about you that you
decide to be good or bad and you know
that drives you so yes it has a huge
impact and it's quite interesting you
know anthropologists do try and find out
about the way people's sense of self
theory of mind
and sense of free will develop
the other question you're hinting at
there of course is something to do with
blame and responsibility and this is
very very tricky
but i think at least a very small
beginning part of the answer is think
about the difference between blaming
this functioning organism with its
history the way it was brought up as a
child all the things that happened to it
then it did things blaming that for a
bad action let's say or blaming
something inside that is really really
bad or really really good like a soul
that you know you know it's sort of the
difference when you're told with you
know bringing up children don't say
you're a bad bad boy say
that's a bad thing to do
um because there will be reasons why
people go out you know doing awful
things they've had awful childhoods and
so on and so on and that's how i think
you making that shift is really what i'm
talking about
i'm a probation officer and i spend a
lot of my time
talking to people about the decisions
that they've made
that have led to them acting in a way
that causes other people quite serious
harm
and a lot of them do have um have had
trouble childhood choices some of them
haven't they're always there's always
some kind of reason that's led to it
others see it just seemed to
go completely against what you just said
by saying this in these words but have
made the decision to do it regardless of
the consequences for others i'm thinking
if you're saying that actually people
don't have that much control over the
decisions they make
may do you think the approach that we
take to people who commit offences
in our society
is is valid do you think we should be
punishing them
uh yes and no um i think we should be
understanding them which clearly you're
doing as a as a did you say a social
worker or probation right you're trying
to understand the reasons why they did
it and it's it's easier when you can see
awful things that led in their childhood
or whatever harder when they're just
being really awful but there'll be some
reason won't that
um so understanding is probably quite
helpful
but if you say oh well they've got no
free will so oh they didn't do it that's
not going to help either but i noted
that you said something like they have
no control over what they're doing who
is the they who's controlling what
that's what i'm trying to dismantle is
this natural feeling we have there's
somebody in here who controls what this
does and so we're separating out um this
little little me from big me if you like
something like that
um and i think that doesn't help but
then you come to your last point about
punishment well think of the
consequences of punishment our current
legal system seems to be a kind of model
of retribution and effective treatment
and the retribution stuff is like you
know you are bad so you deserve to be
punished if you don't believe in free
will then you get rid of that but what
you don't get rid of is the fact that if
people um that people are very clever
learning organisms and they will respond
to praise punishment reward and so on so
i would replace the current system with
something where you you don't ask you
know were they really to blame what you
ask is would punishing them do any good
either to them or to the rest of society
so clearly you'd still lock people up if
they're going to be a harm to society
you'd still lock them up on some
occasions i mean
because it might actually make deter
them from doing it again or it might
deter other people from doing it you
would still um you know give fines and
so on if you thought it would help and
if you've got someone who's mentally
incapable of understanding it's not
going to help so you wouldn't do it but
the basis of the arguments would be
different but our whole legal system
would not fall apart and you'd still
have a job as a probation officer trying
to understand what they did and trying
to do the best for them
where is the microphone gone now
um you just gave some really interesting
advice to preparations
here i'm
you gave some interesting advice to
probation officers as if she had some
choice over what she did
but you know what's the what's the point
of any of this discussion things if none
of us have any choice over what we do
anyway we all have huge amounts of
choice i hope i hope that um i'm really
sorry if i haven't been clear about this
um
i should say we are choice machines as
we have evolved become more and more
brainy compared to every other species
on this planet we have more and more
choices our whole day long is choice
after choice after choice after choice
but what is making that choice
it's a whole organism as i've described
with a complex brain with multiple
parallel pathways choices are going on
all over the place prefrontal cortex is
doing long slow decision making things
this part of the cortex is doing quick
ones there are all these different
responses when i threw the piglet thing
you know i was getting at different
kinds of choices so we are doing
choosing all the time but not i would
say the gist of what i'm trying to say
is
it's a great machine doing it there
isn't also
a me
inside interfering with the machinery
and having a kind of central point from
which i act and a little thing that can
be held responsible do away with that
you've still got plenty of choices you
just don't have the self who has free
will and the has what you have will but
it isn't free it's it's it's a
consequence of all the things going on
in this amazing machinery
can i just i would like to ask that
question because it you know if i wasn't
clear about that i'm really glad we've
had the opportunity to to sort of pull
that tease that out of it yep
you talked about compatibilists and a
lot of what you're talking about is
coming from a philosophical perspective
do you think philosophers are going to
listen to the neuroscience and actually
change their position
oh some are and some aren't i've heard
some philosophers saying these
neuroscientists don't know what they're
talking about they think it has
implications of free will well it
doesn't but then a lot of the
philosophers have completely
uh i can't say incompatible incompatible
views with each other i don't mean you
know free will and determinism
incompatibility i think gradually what
will happen is what's happened in
consciousness studies which is that the
philosophers will find that they simply
can't get away with talking in a vacuum
and they're going to have to deal with
this and they will they will begin to
educate the neuroscientists like the one
that i mentioned what he said here begin
to educate them to think more clearly to
ask clearer questions about what kind of
neuroscience will impact on it and
probably in the end it won't seem such a
problem and it will go away but we're a
long way off that i would say just like
the problem of life well the lecture
this morning was still asking what is
life but not in the way that people used
to when they said what is life hey
what's the life force the el avital
where is it how do we find it we don't
do that anymore with consciousness we
thought what is it where is it well i
don't think we'll do that anymore same
with free will
it will dissolve into understanding how
human actions are caused and human
decisions are made and then the problem
will disappear but that's quite a long
way off i think
you
