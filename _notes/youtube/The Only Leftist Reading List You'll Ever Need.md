Transcript:
(00:01) hi there this is something I get damned about daily so I thought i' make a dedicated video here's a list of books meant as a general introduction to socialism for those interested now this isn't meant to be an exhaustive list of everything you'll ever need to read ever it's more of a handful of recommendations that you could knock out in a week or two of reading all these Works can be found for free on the Marxist internet archive so check that out if you didn't already know about it
(00:24) otherwise you can check out libgen which has pretty much every scanned work ever at least I think so starting off with the Mario and Luigi Marxism marks and Engles themselves the first work I'd recommend you start with is the principles of Communism by angles it's set up as a summary more than anything else with 25 questions and answers provided it's the most quick and concise explanation of the absolute Basics that I like personally if it were up to me this would be the introductory work of Marxism that everybody reads
(00:53) first instead of the Communist Manifesto the next work is actually two that should be read together and that is wag labor and capital and value price and profit both of these works are precursors of the much larger capital in three volumes which although is long isn't as difficult to read as some people make it out to be these two essays though present the basics of the Marxist analysis of capitalism with concise explanations of Labor and labor power the falling rate of profit Surplus value its extraction wages and so much
(01:20) more basically the functions of capitalism generally brilliant works all around the next work is from Engles and it is socialism utopian and scientific originally just a separately published section of the larger work anti- during this is an excellent overview of the general question as well as discussion on the marking view of dialectics and historical materialism it shows exactly how Scientific Socialism differs from the utopian socialism of the past and in doing so also deals with the regurgitated argument we hear almost
(01:46) daily the one that goes socialism sounds good on paper but is too utopian to actually be done who knew that the people who set such things never actually engage with the literature now there's much more that somebody can read from marks and Engles but for a brief introduction I think these works are enough otherwise anti- during Capital the German ideology the Civil War in France critique of the gother program Marxist griza and others are all very important works but all those are outside the scope of a basic reading
(02:14) list moving into Lennon's works there are really two that are absolutely necessary reading although if I had my way I'd make practically everything Lennon wrote necessary reading because he's just that good the first is of course the state and the revolution an absolute Banger of a book that goes into the necessity of Revolution and its necessary glass background the concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat critiques of anarchism and social democracy what happens to the state after the evolution and so much more one
(02:41) of the most important Works in Marxism and absolutely indispensable the second work is imperialism the highest stage of capitalism which equally is a giant of a work that if one doesn't read it not only could they not hope to understand capitalism in its modern form but also just how the world generally works it goes into imperialism as it develops the role of Finance Capital the centralized ization of capital concepts of Labor aristocracy and more it's absolutely brilliant really it's also somewhat more
(03:06) academic than the previous work but it isn't unreadable by any stretch of the imagination really give it a go as I said from marks and Engles lenon has many many other works that are important to read in particular his continuous dunking on kotsky who seeing somewhat of a Revival if not in thought then at least in spirit in some sections of the western left but adding all those in wouldn't make it a basic reading list out would it a minor side point here's where some people stick in a few of Stalin works specifically his
(03:31) foundations of leninism and his essay dialectical and historical materialism among other works I personally am of the thought that if you've read the previous Works mentioned by Marx and ankles and Lennon you don't really need to touch on Stalin's Works in a basic reading list if you want to though I won't stop you moving on to Mao who in my opinion is the single best writer of the popular Marxist cannon with maybe only fenan being more enjoyable in my opinion there are several Works to recommend what's
(03:56) nice about Mao is that a lot of what he wrote was intended for regular soldiers of mostly peasant background to read and hence he wrote simply effectively and concisely really just a fantastic time all around the first work which is really two Works merge into one after the fact is on practice and on contradiction on practice is a philosophical Exposition on the relation between human knowledge and practice I've seen some people call it common sense at a point but honestly with the mistakes we see repeated over and over
(04:22) again on the left globally it seems that Ma's Common Sense really isn't as common as we'd Hope on contradiction on the other hand is the discussion of well contradic what is a contradiction their forms antagonism of contradictions and how they interact and the relevance of contradictions not only to the material world but also to the class struggle ma Builds on this Essay with another titled on the correct handling of contradictions among the people which I also highly recommend you read other than that there are two very quick
(04:47) essays to read which include oppose book worship and combat liberalism both of which are self-explanatory and provide excellent bits of advice for work in political organizations in particular to reiterate though this is a very general outline to give you a solid foundation in Marxist theory there's a lot more and you can take a look at my book recommendations playlist for that or simply ask whenever you like through Twitter my DMs are always open
