Transcript:
(00:03) um good afternoon I'm Damon Silvers I'm a visiting professor of practice here at the institute for Innovation at public and public purpose at University College London um today's lecture is uh as the slide says about understanding neoliberalism as a system of power and in particular understanding it as uh as a global system I've got a couple of methodological things to say before we get into the the essence of this this talk is not surprisingly for a professor of practice this talk is heavily based on on
(00:39) Research that has been done with increasing intensity by some of the world's leading economists and political scientists I will I will cite a few of them in the talk it's also heavily based on my own experience as as a trade unionist as someone involved in public policy in the United States over the last four decades and in certain respects as you'll see it even draws upon my childhood and so if you're looking for a definitive proof of what I'm about to say with differential equations and so
(01:11) forth you're going to be disappointed this is a work of history of narrative of political economy and and I would suggest to you that that is in fact the only way to approach this subject that those who seek to deal with something as large as what I'm about to talk about uh through an attempt at a mathematical proof or making a fundamental mistake and so with that caveat we're going to begin uh I'm going to speak for about an hour then we'll do q a uh we've got uh I think a meaningful online audience we'll
(01:45) try to alter between the room and the uh and the audience online uh is that that's the plan right excellent all right so let's begin um we are here as I said a moment or two ago we are here uh so let me just let me just restate the theme again because anybody missed it this is neoliberalism as a global order an order characterized by private power and public weakness now we are here at the institute for Innovation and public purpose here at this institute many of you are guests particularly those online we
(02:28) think about how to build a we think about how in the words of the institute's director Professor Mariana mazicato how we radically reform and rearm the entrepreneurial state so that it's capable of taking on the world's wickedest problems but the reality is that as our students and they're this is a formerly a lecture for uh our master's students in public in public affairs when our students go out into into the world they will encounter a world in which neoliberalism has taken hold is in fact hegemonic and shapes the
(03:09) way that governments themselves and the professionals who staff governments around the world understand what they're capable of what they can do right the neoliberal order I'm about to describe has engendered a fundamental passivity and lack of self-confidence right in the very institutions of government in which we are sending our students and so this this hollowing out that has occurred as a result of neoliberalism which I'm going to describe is not just a hollowing out of capacity it's not just a hollowing out of staff
(03:44) and resources in the public sector it's a hollowing out of will of confidence of the belief that public institutions can make a positive difference in human civilization and so the key thesis of this lecture is to understand that that is a consequence of neoliberalism as a global system it's not simply about the politics of a few English-speaking countries and if and if you try to understand it that way you will fundamentally Miss be misled as to what neoliberalism is and in fact you will tend to believe
(04:23) more in what neoliberalism's Advocates say it is than what it actually is it's also because because the truth is that is that neoliberalism like its predecessor and namesake Classical liberalism is a janus-based system it turns different faces in different directions depending on who you are and where you are neoliberalism shows a face of freedom for some and a face of coercion for others a face of unrivaled opportunity and wealth and faces of desperation poverty and constraint for others and so in this lecture today we will
(05:08) look at the origin and nature of neoliberalism as a global system a week from today same time in the same place in part two we will look at the crisis of neoliberalism in the 21st century it's unraveling its relationship with authoritarianism with the rise of authoritarianism in the 21st century populist authoritarianism racist authoritarianism and we will talk about what are the possibilities for a post-neoliberal future now the first thing to do after having said the term neoliberalism about 10 times is to understand what exactly are we
(05:47) talking about neoliberalism is a confusing term for many people particularly North Americans because in North America the term liberalism has come to be associated with the promotion of mixed economies right but the term neoliberalism is something completely different it's derived from the earlier meaning the 19th century meaning of the term liberal 19th century economic liberalism was in some cases closer to what we would today call libertarianism or as I'm going to call it in this lecture Market fundamentalism
(06:27) the key concepts of 19th century economic liberalism which had its origin significantly in the Scottish Enlightenment in the United Kingdom and is associated with people famous people like Adam Smith here on the screen James Mill Ricardo 19th century liberalism stood for open trade among nations a belief in the prefectability of markets and a more or less total opposition to government regulation of Labor product and capital markets classical or 19th century liberalism became the dominant political economy in
(07:03) the world in the course of the 19th century it was heavily associated with the rise of the British Empire but it collapsed intellectually and politically during the Great Depression and the Second World War the era of classical liberal policy hegemony though and this is important because it mirrors neoliberalism the era of classical liberal policy hegemony and its offer of human freedom which it clearly did in the 19th century was also at the same time the era of European Imperial expansion together liberal economics in the Imperial
(07:44) Heartland in the Imperial homelands particularly in Great Britain was linked inextricably with the conquest of Asia Africa the suborning of Latin America the stock exchange and the gunboat were linked together in one political economy that covered the 19th century globe as you can see and I'll come to this in the more in a second neoliberalism is a direct intellectual link from our friend Adam Smith there on the left to Margaret Thatcher on the right going over John Maynard Keynes the key intellect of the of the economic and
(08:25) political era in between that that dominated the 20th century now now neoliberalism itself as a global system is often described and I think accurately as the Resurgence of the core ideas of Classical liberalism in the decades after 1980. following what most historians would describe as the crisis of Keynesian and Social Democratic politics and economics in the 1970s and it became the best known term describing the globalized political economy of the 1990s although in these talks I want to distinguish between two terms
(09:16) you can use neoliberalism as an intellectual term but I prefer not to all right I prefer to describe the the ideas the ideology and I use the term ideology advisedly I don't believe that Neil that that market fundamentalism really holds together as as a philosophy it's it's a set of it's a set of politicized ideas it's ideology I would describe Market fundamentalism as the ideology neoliberalism is the political economy the the actual system of political and economic practice and Power now I want to acknowledge here that I am
(09:58) heavily drawing upon some other people who've done enormous work in this space and so first I want to acknowledge the really impressive work of Gary gerstel at Cambridge whose book the rise and fall of the neoliberal order is of tremendous account of the politics of neoliberalism in the United States there you know as we sit here Rana faruhar at the financial times has written a whole series of articles I believe she's working on a book on the same subject her reporting is focused on the financialization associated with
(10:30) neoliberalism and and global trade also very importantly Joe stiglitz who has encouraged me in this work uh Joseph Professor Joe stiglitz at Columbia he has he is writing today and you can find in the last few months a series of pieces critiquing the Notions of economic modeling that underlie Market fundamentalism I really highly recommend looking at Joe stiglitz's pieces to understand what's wrong intellectually with many of the ideas that underline neoliberalism but with that said too much attention in my view has been
(11:09) paid to what neo-liberal act to what neo-liberalism's Advocates have said the ideology of neoliberalism too much attention has been paid to that and two little little attention has been paid to what actually has happened right in the neoliberal era from 1980 to the present although the last 15 years or more the crisis of neoliberalism what has happened is not the same thing as what they say and it's particularly not the same thing if you think about the the history of neoliberalism as a global phenomenon
(11:47) neoliberalism looks very different and operates very differently in the places in which it has concentrated power and wealth New York London Hong Kong Dubai Shanghai than the places in which the kind of the hammer Falls right the north of England Lille in France West Virginia in the United States the Niger Delta in Nigeria a whole bunch of different places in China too numerous to list and so we need to understand neoliberalism as a global system of open and closed societies working together to create a single Global political economy
(12:41) I'm going to say this over and over again so it's not missed right the nature of the Chinese state the nature of the Nigerian state the nature of the Saudi Arabian state is as fundamental to what neoliberalism is as the English State the Australian State the United States Canada France Germany and and the outcome the end game of this system looked at globally is the weakening of Public Power and the suborning of Public Power to private power the two Theses of these lectures are one neoliberalism cannot be understood other
(13:29) than as a global system two the output the end game it's not freedom it's not wealth it's power it's private power I hope people recognize what the image behind this slide is right that's Elon musk's star rocket that blew up last week all right the world's richest man undertaking using essentially privatized public assets a function that was at the heart of the legitimacy and Majesty of the American state in the pre-neoliberal era now where does this begin neoliberalism as a political economy and
(14:28) as a global order begins not in the city of London not in New York not at the University of Chicago although that's close it begins in Santiago Chile in 1970 Keynesian economics and Social Democratic politics were near hegemonic outside of the Communist world where arguably and even more left-wing economic order was hegemonic in in the in what was called The Free World at the time as I said what would now be considered rather left-wing power political economy was dominant the one way of understanding this dominance is that even right-wing
(15:17) governments and U.S backed military dictatorships like those in Brazil and Argentina at the time pursued authoritarian versions of these same policies Trade union for example in Brazil under military dictatorship trade unionism was mandatory mandatory that's a controversy that's controversial among trade unionists but that was the reality of the Brazilian dictatorship a right-wing dictatorship for decades prior to this time a rather small group of of economic right-wingers of people who who stuck with Classical
(15:57) liberalism through the depression and through the Second World War people like Friedrich Hayek perhaps the most important of this group intellectually William Buckley in the United States Milton Friedman at the University of Chicago and iron Rand who was a very peculiar character with a huge uh intellectual and social influence these folks were trying during this period to revive classical economics to return to Market fundamentalism and they were backed by wealthy families and a few corporations most of business had made
(16:36) their peace at this time was with the Keynesian order they were backed by a few right-wing families wealthy families in the United States and the United Kingdom in their effort to create a political movement to fundamentally undo the Social Democratic consensus but they Nev but they did not have the opportunity to apply their ideas their ideas of fundamentally as the American right-wing political activist Grover norquist said later to shrink the state to the point where it could be drowned in a bathtub they didn't have the opportunity to do
(17:14) that until a CIA backed military coup in Chile in 1973 in the context of the growing crisis of Keynesian economics the fair the the collapse of the Bretton Woods monetary regime the slowing global economic growth in that context the Chilean back that the CIA backed military coup in Chile gave the economic right-wingers an opening a military government wielding absolute power that was willing to try to to undo Social Democratic structures not to not to contain them not to sort of manage them in a more conservative way
(17:59) as governments like the MacMillan government in this country or the Eisenhower government in the United States had done not to kind of compromise with them but to smash them a government willing to smash them with absolute power came into being in Chile and in case this photo doesn't mean anything to you this is a picture of the meeting of Milton Friedman right the leading right-wing U.
(18:27) S Economist of the time with General Pinochet in Santiago where this agenda was discussed now you might ask you might ask how can this be how can Market fundamentalism or libertarianism how can it be associated with military dictatorship this would seem to be a this is one of the neoliberalism is filled with paradoxes this is perhaps one of the most fascinating paradoxes of neoliberalism is the assertion of absolute human Freedom which yet requires military dictatorship to it to enable it to make it happen and it's important to understand because
(19:15) this these type this type of logic flows through the neoliberal era that the parent that there is this fundamental connection between economic libertarianism and authoritarianism and the heavy Hammer of the state the reason why this is true is because Market fundamentalism the idea that that that quote free markets that markets um left on their own never mind co-creation by the state and all that markets left on their own produce Optimum social outcomes that idea has historically associated with the idea that the right to private property is a
(19:57) fundamental natural right and cannot be interfered with by the state now those are not the same ideas but they historically have gone together not surprisingly people with property tend to view that property as a natural right and they also tend to think that being left alone to buy and sell their property is the best of all possible worlds but when you combine those two beliefs as the center of a conception of public policy or political economy then historically what tends to happen is that the result is rising economic
(20:35) inequality broad economic insecurity and governments that are unable to effectively manage economic Cycles this was the outcome of the classical liberal order and it has been the outcome of neoliberalism at various times in various places um in a democracy or in any kind of political economy in which public opinion is allowed to influence public policy public opinion will in response to these economic shortcomings of Market fundamentalism demand policies that impinge on property rights right that is the entire history by the
(21:14) way of this Society of the United Kingdom since the adoption of universal suffrage in the 19th century Market fundamentalists will in response to democracy's demand for limitations on private property rights Market fundamentalists who believe in private property as a fundamental right will feel entitled to have the State Resort to violence and authoritarianism to preserve their property just as Europe just as you or I might feel that way if our political or religious freedoms were interfered with we might feel that violence was
(21:55) appropriate in response to an authoritarian threat to our freedom people deeply believe in property rights tend to believe that violence is okay if their property rights are threatened this is the logic that produces Milton Friedman and general Pinochet sitting in the same room together it's worth remembering that this logic has much more Force in societies with deep historic class race or caste divisions where those with property have deeper reasons to view those without property as fundamentally inferior to themselves
(22:30) and thus okay targets of violence this Dynamic this Paradox of the of the association of Market fundamentalist or libertarian economic ideas with a propensity to political violence and an authoritarian States is at the core of the neoliberal project and the neoliberal era and you will see it repeatedly in the in these presentations now the Chilean what happened in Chile from Economic Policy perspective after the coup was that fundamental Social Democratic structures were dismantled retirement security systems were
(23:22) privatized trade unions were made illegal this turned out not to be sustainable in the long run in Chile but during the period the period of high military dictatorship trade unions were made illegal now this was a precursor to what then happened in the United States and the United Kingdom the two countries in the world that in the late 70s and early 80s moved decisively in the neoliberal direction so the reason why this happened is that throughout the world the rise of democracy based on universal suffrage was associated with the rise of trade
(24:00) unions and trade unions were the political power behind the rise of mixed economies in the post-war era the Keynesian Social Democratic hegemony I talked about earlier so you know in in order in order to fundamentally alter that order and replace it with the neoliberal order the first thing that people that strategist saw they needed to do was to break the power of the Trade union movement and if you go and look at what was said by various key actors in both Britain and the United States during this period they were very explicit about it
(24:38) Margaret Thatcher Paul volcker in certain respects even Jimmy Carter in relation to things like um the regulation of Transportation in the United States all expressed a desire to weaken the Trade union movement and they used a variety of tools during this period very effectively labor laws were labor laws that had been put in place in the depression in the second world war were fundamentally weakened in both societies monetary policy was used to break the collective bar the break the bargaining power of workers by bringing in an hour
(25:10) of high unemployment after Decades of relatively full employment in both societies this little visual here is interest rates in the United States during the late 70s and early 80s when those things didn't work force was used that's the minor strike the key the key events here that that reshape the balance of power between labor and management and weakened labor as a political force where in the United States the air traffic controllers strike where Ronald Reagan fired all the Striking air traffic controllers the
(25:46) News Corp strike in London which is now kind of Forgotten in the wake of a minor strike but actually came first where Rupert Murdoch moved the printing presses out of the center of London and employed non-union workers and ultimately successfully and of course the 1984 minor strike in the United Kingdom foreign the core ideas of neoliberalism articulated at this time was an attack on the state as a shaper of markets this comes back again to what we do here at iipp in the 1980s in the United States and the United Kingdom
(26:28) Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher set the policy tone that would define neoliberalism for decades to come policies that were designed to weaken the state as a market-shaping institution and a counterbalance to private power is Ronald Reagan famously said the nine most terrifying words in English language are I'm from the government and I'm here to help if as a master's student in this program you graduate and you go into government and you walk into an office and you find somebody my age and they say we can't do
(27:06) that that's not government's role that's not possible they are echoing this right Margaret Thatcher there is no such thing as Society there are individual men and women and they're our families this is the underlying denial of the notion of social solidarity that underpins any democratic government it's very important to understand this kind of stuff as profoundly linked to the pictures I showed you before right of an effort to use Force to break social solidarity this is the theory the police on Horseback the tanks in the
(27:54) streets of Santiago they are the practice but it did not stop there now again back to the sort of ironies of neoliberalism the I the people that I was just laying out in front of you Milton Friedman Frederick Hayek Margaret Thatcher Ronald Reagan they were making two kinds of claims about economics and politics claims that have echoed through the neoliberal era they're making a normative claim and they were making an empirical claim the normative claim is that neoliberalism is a political economy of freedom
(28:46) that derate that weakening the state and weakening institutions of social solidarity creates freedom a world in which power does not exist the second claim is that market fundamentalism deregulated markets privatized capital is the best we can do from an efficiency perspective we will all it anything else will make us worse off as a world now I think by the time this lecture and the following one are finished you may doubt the truth of these statements but they are the claims of neoliberalism and as and as I've said before they
(29:34) fundamentally undercut the key ID of the entrepreneurial state that the state itself can be and in fact must be a source of creativity and innovation and that markets are not handed down by God that markets are actually created and shaped by States these ideas are fundamentally in conflict now the hegemony of Market fundamentalism the hegemony of the of the idea that aren't the quote unregulated markets produce optimal social outcomes not just its adoption by particular governments by particular politicians
(30:19) but it's adoption by entire state apparatuses and this is I think Gary gerstle's book really is very good on this point in terms of the United States it's adoption by entire State apparatuses destroys the self-confidence and sense of mission of states and their bureaucracies this um our colleague Reiner has just written the book on the importance of effective bureaucracies the term bureaucracy itself has become kind of an insult right but the reality is is that if we want our societies to function we
(30:55) need effective bureaucracies neoliberalism argued for the destruction of bureaucracy of government institutions as a positive good this is the intellectual structure of neoliberalism but it is not it is not the reality of neoliberalism reality of neoliberalism is something quite different because it's not about a world without without power it's about shifting power from the public to the private sector from the public realm to the private Realm from Democratic states to corporations Capital markets and and to some degree International
(31:51) institutions that are at a remove from democratic accountability now the neoliberal policy agenda was marketed as freedom from the state but its consequence was the growth of private power private power over markets private power over workers over citizens and ultimately private power over the state itself now I talked for a minute about the attack on the labor movement as the first move in the neoliberal and the actual agenda of creating a neoliberal political economy by the late 70s in in Britain to some degree in the United States and
(32:37) certainly by the early 80s in the United States and then increasingly around the world you saw a set of neoliberal policies pursued in common across National boundaries but within nation states tax cutting particularly on corporations and the wealthy dismantling Anti-Trust enforcement allowing the accumulation of private Market power dismantling of financial regulations dating from the new from the the era of the Great Depression and supporting Finance Capital exerting more power vis-a-vis operating companies the the dismantling of the regulation of
(33:17) the media and the privatization of public media Enterprises this particularly dramatic in the United States this is where Fox News comes from is this is this change but it occurred throughout the world and has been a constant Battleground in the United Kingdom over the fate of the BBC and the dismantling of environmental regulation something which has turned out to have truly horrifying consequences which was symbolized in the early days of the neoliberal era by President Reagan's removing the solar panels from the White House roof
(33:48) what was the consequence of these policies I could show you a hundred graphs but they all basically tell the same story this is the genie coefficient of the United Kingdom excuse me this is the genie coefficient of the United Kingdom that giant spiked there that spike is stature this is the graph of a regime change down here you see a genie coefficient of around 3.
(34:22) 0 this is basically true since the Second World War up here is 4.6 and it's true as you can see to the present day a radical increase in the inequality of wealth and power and income that changed very fast with the adoption of neoliberal policies by the Thatcher government and has not been undone since despite the fact that there have been way that there was a labor government for some time now by the end of the 1980s as I was just saying economic data showed clearly across all of the world's developed countries
(35:13) that we were entering a new regime a new political economy regime different countries entered this regime from different starting points so if you looked at the data for say Union density in the United Kingdom and in Sweden they start at very different points Union density in this country in 1980 was around 30 percent and Sweden was like 80 percent but the trend is downward everywhere same thing is true for the size of the state the characteristics of the regime that came into being during this time was a and this is the most important the
(35:54) public sector shrinking as a percentage of GDP true across oecd countries except you have to be careful around defense spending so that you can see there's some odd things particularly with the United States that are created by defense spending but if you take that out you'll see the same thing everywhere two lower corporate marginal lower corporate tax rates and lower marginal individual tax rates and lower Revenue collection declining Union density wage stagnation a shifts from labor income to Capital Income in terms of the composition of
(36:34) national income the privatization of public assets a greater concentration of both financial institutions and operating companies business in general rising Rising inequality of incomes as I showed on the last slide and even more so of wealth to really follow the neoliberal order you need to follow wealth data more than income data from the perspective of the agenda of this institution the iipp this slide is one to not forget this graph is a graph from Thomas picketty's work most recent work the team that pickety leads
(37:19) that shows what has happened to the balance of private assets and public Assets in major developed economies during the neoliberal era and as you can see the top line is the private assets which go up as a percentage of GDP to from 300 to 600 and 700 percent while public assets fall in some cases below zero below zero meaning that public liabilities now exceed public assets this is the this is a measure of the impoverished this is a way of getting at the impoverishment of the public sector under the neoliberal order and the
(38:04) draining away of State capacity now what I've done so far is the layout for you neoliberalism as a set of economic ideas and National Economic practice the rest of the talk is going to be about neoliberalism as a global order and again there are some ironies here the rise of governments in the English-speaking world in the 1980s that put neoliberal ideas into practice and the beginning of the creation of a neoliberal political economy in that period was actually not initially clearly connected to a new kind of global global
(38:50) political economy the Reagan and Thatcher government's trade and foreign policies looked backward toward the Cold War and traditional business-oriented protectionism much more than they did than they did forward to the globalism of the 90s something many Americans are not aware of it's the Reagan Administration was actually protectionist fundamentally not free trade oriented they the Reagan Administration responded to demands from American Industrial Enterprises in the early 80s to do something about Japan about South Korea about
(39:28) countries that were viewed as threats to American business before American Business figured out that Outsourcing was an opportunity not a threat the same thing I think can be understood about the plaza courts by the way of the currency deal that Reagan cut with Japan the Falklands War right is not a globalist Enterprise right the Falklands War was again about a a backward looking sort of late Imperial venture the hostility to the U.
(40:07) N that was evidenced by Reagan and Thatcher very different than the pro International institution tilt of governments in both countries later what changed and what's at the stage for the neoliberalism as a global order was the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989. now that is what most people who've written about neoliberalism will tell you is the key event and I'm not arguing that it's not it's very important but I would suggest that if you want that if you think about neoliberalism as a global system that the real key event
(40:50) is not the fall of the Soviet Union the Soviet Union the countries that made up the former Soviet Union are not at the center of the world's economy today and we're not at the center of the world's economy in the 1990s the key event in my view is the one that is behind these words it's the failure of the Tiananmen uprising it's the it's the failure of democratic forces in China to succeed in putting China on a path away from its leninist heritage this sets the stage for China playing the role that it does
(41:34) in the 1990s as a provider of cheap labor to the global into the global neoliberal system and and ensures that working people in China are unable to assert uh their voices during the long period of neoliberal hegemony this is the key event that makes the neoliberal global system possible on the scale and with the completeness that it triumphed in the 1990s so what is the key element what are the key elements of neoliberalism as a global system by the way I should say I have no idea what would have happened had Tiananmen succeeded
(42:16) I just know that it's failure set the stage for a certain type of relationship between the world's largest economies now what is this and what is the what are the key elements of neoliberalism as a global system first and this is not original by me development of truly Global Systems of natural resource extraction production and finance which integrate developed World democracies and Emerging Market states with varying degrees of authoritarian governments this is again the Paradox of neoliberalism the assertion that what
(42:58) the what the neoliberal order is is an order characterized by open markets rule of law democracy and the actuality the reality of what happened during the Heyday of the neoliberal order in China in Mexico in Russia in Nigeria in Saudi Arabia Ken sarawiwa executed by the Nigerian government in order to ensure that the people of the Niger Delta did not get their fair share of oil being produced for British Petroleum and shell is as much an emblematic figure of the neoliberal order as Bill Clinton or Tony Blair second
(43:48) the rise of tax Havens that create a hidden globally integrated tax system I'm going to talk about this more later this term and lectures about recent British economic history but this means that no matter what the perp what the intentions of Any Given government are in relation to their tax rates in the wealthy individuals and corporations can always move into the alternative tax system Ireland Delaware and the United States obviously some other places like Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands but when you start
(44:27) listing the places most of them seem to be under the British crown third economic integration through trade agreements without regulatory integration which essentially again defeats National efforts to regulate economies and to impose labor standards environmental standards and the like the WTO becomes that kind of system famously NAFTA the North American Free Trade Agreement interestingly the EU the EU tried very hard to have social integration as well as economic integration as well as trade integration but left out certain key things
(45:15) like a truly enforceable minimum wage across across the nation-states of the EU with disastrous consequences which I'll talk about in my lecture on brexits third uh or fourth the restructuring of international institutions to be in forces of private property rights and investor interests against government the Gat the WTO the IMF the World Bank and the oecd moved into this role during the 1990s whereas in the past at least nominally most of them were supposed to be about maintaining Global demand and finally the unleashing of currency
(45:56) markets and Central Bank coordination to suppress wages and discourage public investment the collapse of Bretton Woods in the 1970s sets the stage for this sort of thing being dominant in the global economy in the 1990s now the Paradox of the of this order I talked about the Paradox again of freedom and sort of not freedom but the creation of the neoliberal order Global Order in the 1990s produced a whole set of new paradoxes many of which are with us today and and help one understand what is going on around us first and this was I think
(46:43) this had its echoes in the 19th century but first in the 1990s in both domestic and international politics Market fundamentalist ideas that were initially associated with right-wing governments Reagan Thatcher Pinochet gained ascendancy in nominally left-wing governments and became associated with liberal social thought as was true in the early 19th century free market market fundamentalism became attached to Humana essentially humanistic ideas coming out of the Enlightenment Racial equality gender equality equal to equal and dignified treatment
(47:26) for lgbtq people right these two ideas these two things kind of connected to each other this is Manifest in the politics the Clinton Administration the Blair government the Schroder government in Germany and transnational institutions like the EU the oecd and the world economic Forum that push forward a mix of these two ideas two sets of ideas and again at the heart of it our conceptions of freedom that may not necessarily be what is really going on long and then secondly long-standing ideas and international relations dating back to the early 19th
(48:10) century took on New Life as advocates of neoliberalism claimed that the combination of unregulated trade the rule of law and open borders were inseparable plenty of evidence for the contrary but they argued they were inseparable and that together they would produce peace and harmony the reality though this was the ideology the reality was something completely different key National actors in the in the Neo Globe liberal global economy did not play by those rules at all the picture in the backdrop is Chinese workers Chinese industrial
(48:56) workers at Honda in southern China on strike in 2010. right the representatives of the Chinese state are confronting them this is not Davos values but Davos values aren't really Davos values and what this meant was that in the neoliberal system some states capacities grew while the rhetoric was that states were shrinking China's capacity China's capacity capacity grew even as the Chinese States percentage of the national economy shrank the capacity of the state grew and in some ways very successfully from
(49:46) the perspective of Chinese society and the Chinese economy Saudi Arabia the Saudi Arabian state became a regional hegemon during this period it did not weaken it strengthened in many respects countries in the periphery of the neoliberal order they didn't want to be terribly exploited by countries at the center had to strengthen their states those that didn't those that took neoliberal rhetoric seriously ended up very disadvantaged particularly as the crisis of the neoliberal era intensified in the early
(50:22) 2000s and speaking of neoliberalism as a global system it was no accident that when the Chinese government in response to things like this strike in the 2010s before president XI contemplated creating real labor laws where did the opposition come from it didn't come from maoist ideologues it came from the U.
(50:53) S Chamber of Commerce in China now that tells you all you need to know about the nature of the neoliberal global order now where did the neoliberal order lead us after a decade of neoliberal hegemony in the 1990s globally it created a feedback loop a feedback loop where in the countries where neoliberal policies were fully implemented growing inequality and weakened States and weakened institutions of countervailing power trade unions Civil Society led to nominally democratic political systems taking on the characteristics of plutocracies
(51:47) elections continued newspapers kept being published the the appearances of democracy continued but the actual power dynamics shifted more and more and more in favor of the wealthy and large corporations and then their control of the state intensified it that's the feedback loop the feedback loop plutocratic feedback loop resulted in neoliberal governments neoliberal States transferring key Capital allocation mechanisms around the provision of public goods and household Economic Security from the state to private firms and capital markets
(52:28) education retirement security housing Health Care all moved toward the private sector and away from the public sector and further vast fortunes were made in the process now by the way it's hard to hard not to reflect on the on the fact that some of that some of those kinds of processes were pioneered in the in the former Soviet Union and its uh satellite states in the aftermath of 1989 with as we all know ruinous consequences in many of the world's leading economies the state's political autonomy the state's self-confidence
(53:16) and its capacity for Effective Market shaping by 2000 has been weakened past the point of effectiveness by the combination of privatization Outsourcing if you're interested in the Outsourcing part of this our colleagues Mariana mazzuccato and Rosie Collington have written a wonderful book about that about the Outsourcing of State function to consulting firms loss of Revenue and Mission constraints formal and informal Mission constraints now before I finish talking about the global or neoliberal order it's very important to address
(54:04) what Advocates of that order say about its outcomes so I've been talking about its outcome in terms of State capacity and the Integrity of democracy and their response not unlike some stalinists talking about the Soviet Union say in 1950 their response is well those things may be true it may be true that you know General Pinochet tortured musicians in order to achieve neoliberalism but we produced economic growth what do you say to that it's important to actually have the data and this is the data this is Glo this is these are this is
(54:49) global rates of economic growth from the World Bank right during the pre and post neoliberal order right and it shows you something very very telling this chart begins in 1960. global economic growth during the 1960s was between four and six percent pretty steadily and by the way I couldn't get the right the the chart that had this data had a lot of stuff on it so I didn't use it but that was true back from back to 1950.
(55:27) all right the error of Keynesian air of Keynesian hegemony was an era of four to six percent global economic growth now part of that has to do with the post-war recovery of the world's largest economies but not all of it this is a period of extraordinary hope and optimism uh in Latin America to some degree in Africa in parts of Asia but particularly in Latin America the crisis the crisis of global keynesianism in the 1970s you see produces this volatility that then follows the neoliberal order takes over in the
(56:05) 1980s and 1990s and produces a more or less stable two to four percent growth rate two to four not four to six two to four but it's kind of stable until it isn't see at 2000 you have the Asian financial crisis and then the.com bust and its Global consequences in the United States and then and then you see the real then you see the real storm hit with the 2008 financial crash which is a direct consequence of neoliberal Doctrine no lesser critic of neoliberalism than Alan Greenspan said so and then we have the very interesting
(56:52) covet problem which again is deeply intertwined with State capacity this is not a record of economic superiority it's a complicated record there's things embedded in it the extraordinary success of China economically is embedded in these numbers but these are the global numbers and they are not a story of economic superiority and as well and as we'll talk about next time right they do not have an answer to the neoliberals orders inability to organize solutions to the pressing problems of our time and so next week When We Gather again
(57:39) we'll talk about the crisis of the neoliberal order we've just talked about the construction of it next week we'll talk about when it really runs into sort of its limits in the first decade of the 20th of the 21st Century which I find shockingly is now a long time ago in the first decade of the 21st Century the consequences of the neoliberal global system were coming into Focus through a series of escalating and interrelated crises the 2000 first the 2001 financial crisis largely in the equities markets but then
(58:16) really the 2008 crisis the climate crisis Rising inequality in the crisis of global demand which is related by the way to the financial crisis the the the resulting crisis of democracy and the rise of authoritarianism racism populism some would say the return of fascism is a political force covid these crises required and required today effective entrepreneurial States exactly the political and political economy structures that neoliberalism worked so hard to destroy and they've effectively and again I again I give full credit here to Gary
(59:02) gerstal who laid who lays this out in terms of American politics they've effectively brought an end to neoliberal hegemony and they've left in its place a world of rising conflict over what sort of political economy will replace neoliberalism the fate of the planet not the physical Planet which is indifferent to these things but the fate of human civilization on the planet depends on what kind of outcome we get and so next week I'm going to talk about these crises in detail and about the the Alternatives facing us
(59:40) as a global civilization in the wake of the crisis of neoliberalism and I will give it away to a certain extent that what I'm going to say is basically that we face as we faced in the 1930s and 1940s a choice between a democratic and authoritarian future and with the with the looming threat of climate change above that choice with that I thank you for your patience and we'll take some questions I think we have I think we have a microphone do we not thank you that was a really good lecture thank you very well um my question is
(1:00:31) about you mentioned and I completely agree that neoliberalism seeks to destroy democracy in order to enforce its principles on the world and you mentioned some of the institutions WTO IMF the even the EU to what extent do you think these institutions need to be dismantled in order to roll back neoliberalism it's a great question I I feared a little bit that people might take away from my presentation on hostility the international institutions um I I'm not hostile in international institutions at all I think they are
(1:01:07) critical and must work but they can't be the instruments of the suppression of democracy or the suppression of the voices of working people in the global economy and I think if you look at different International institutions they have they have different arcs around these questions right I I'm I I I think that for example during the During the period of austerity in the EU increasingly the IMF and the oecd became Skeptics of austerity while the European Central Bank pushed it and pushed it and pushed it
(1:01:51) I think International institutions can change I think they need to be democratized I think they're incredibly important right and um and I think that the example of the EU is very telling because the EU made a huge effort not to do what NAFTA did not to be uh uh not to have free trade without democracy and without social regulation and you know politics being politics that effort was imperfect the imperfections turned out to be critical in what and what ended up resulting in brexit so the struggles over what international
(1:02:33) institutions are is a huge part of what we have to deal with in the future and climate change is the ultimate sort of illustration of this that there is no way to effectively combat climate change without strong International institutions and yet at every turn we see some of the states that I referred to in my presentation seeking to weaken those institutions so they can essentially continue to pour carbon into our hemisphere I hope that I hope that begins to answer your it's a huge question you asked um can do we have people online or we
(1:03:13) kind of promised to go back and forth yeah we're gonna we're gonna take one online then we're gonna go then we'll come back to the room I agree we have uh thank you um we have a PhD student here very helpfully volunteered to do this very glad um so we have a few questions online uh one of the questions this one comes from Simon Combs uh it reads the state already the state already has a lot of power to kill brothers and sisters from racially minoritized groups I'm mentioning black people in America and
(1:03:50) Muslim people in France that are regularly subjected to excessive State violence thus what does your call to re-arm the state mean in light of these practices shouldn't we defund the police see it's very easy to be misunderstood in these circumstances re-arm is a metaphor it's not actually arms it's not guns the the the the quote from Mariana mazicato is about giving the is about the idea of the state having the tools to address the profound challenges of our time and in particular challenges
(1:04:23) like climate change and economic inequality um I think one of the things to take away from my presentation is that one of the sort of hidden things about neoliberalism is that while there is a rhetoric and an ideology of freedom neoliberal states end up more and more of what the state does is actual physical repression right that the the portion of the state the portion of the neoliberal state devoted to military expenditures the ways in which the neoliberal state manages law enforcement are are actually completely contrary to the ideology of
(1:05:01) neoliberalism right the the the the idea that this and and it relates to these issues around property rights and the political kind of the political con impossibility of sustained Democratic majorities for economic policies that impoverish the majority of people that creates a a a a a that creates a a kind of feedback loop as I said earlier around the militarization uh of the state and not just in terms of the military itself but the police uh and I I think those are not good things um I'm let me add though in case anybody
(1:05:45) missed is and I will talk about this at Great length next time um the Democratic state has to defend itself right the the that the idea that the Democratic State should be without actual physical defenses is a really bad idea and um you know we're not very far from where George we're all well lived uh a lot of what he had to say about this is very is very uh apropos today so we're taking a question in the room sir so thank you thank you for uh this opportunity and thank you for the presentation actually I have two
(1:06:22) questions one of them is from the slide of uh opening act uh you mentioned uh very briefly monetary policy and new liberalism and actually what I perceived was the lower on in very low interest rate is somehow a new liberal policy uh so you showed an interest rate the divulker times and then after that and the monetary term was there so I wanted to know uh your opinion about the monetary polid relation between monetary policy and neoliberalism and also uh the other one the next question so two questions uh uh it's understanding the
(1:07:00) crisis from from the right-wing perspective this is a problem that I have constantly encountered with my students with with whatever I write the audience that uh whenever one of these crises I mean when you show them to to people they tend to understand it from right-wing perspective so when you show them that for instance they're here in London we have the surge of of uh housing prices yeah and rents and everything they normally come back with the idea that oh some people are getting benefits from the government so it's the problem of
(1:07:34) too much government still they will I mean they'll find a solution from the the linear liberal approach so how is it possible to break this hegemony of them over their minds I mean to succeed of their reality all right well those are excellent questions and thank you um uh as somebody who read this presentation before it was given said there you've packed a lot in here and so the opportunity to go into the monetary policy issue a little bit is very important um let me just first say though about the question of sort of intellectual
(1:08:07) hegemony in many respects my presentation is about the question of intellectual hegemony it's about the way in which Margaret Thatcher's idea that there is no alternative uh became uh spread throughout Global society and in particular in English-speaking countries and so you described a complete failure of one or more aspects of the neoliberal political economy and people will come back to you with neoliberal responses right they're in a it's sort of like Plato's Cave right um uh the salute the the
(1:08:47) I think we are living in a time in which that hegemony is cracking in every direction I can't give you in Specific Instructions as to how to convince somebody to think differently but I do believe that today um I I worked with both the I've worked with both the Obama and the Biden administrations in the United States there is a huge difference in the impact of neoliberal hegemony on those two administrations it was very very powerful in the Obama Administration and much much less so in the Biden Administration
(1:09:22) um the people the the and I think that reflects the fact that um people of good will actually do respond to events right and so I think the the role of intellectuals is to help sort of accelerate that process right now monetary policy um let me go back let me go back to the beginning because I want to explain what this is this is a graph of this is about this graph is a monetary policy graph it is a graph of interest rates set by the Federal Reserve in the United States in the late 70s and early 80s and what you see here is this giant
(1:10:05) Spike now what was the purpose of that giant Spike why did interest rates go up so high U.S economy had double digit inflation in in the late 70s that inflation was partly due to the Iranian Revolution and the cutoff of oil from Iran there were other there were a number of other reasons in tandem with it the Federal Reserve believed that the Federal Reserve under Paul volcker believed that as long as there were Union contracts in the industrial economy of the United States that provided cost of living adjustments that inflation would be
(1:10:48) persistent in the U.S economy so they raised interest rates to a point designed to break the union contracts in the steel industry and in the Auto industry primarily not only did they break the union contracts they broke the industries American steel industry and American Steel communities have never recovered from that and by the way those are the same communities in Pennsylvania and Michigan and Wisconsin that elected Donald Trump in the in in 2016 not in 2020 but in 2016.
(1:11:27) this was the use of monetary policy to break the labor movement and so in the end High interest rates relatively High interest rates have been a persistent feature of neoliberalism until the early 2000s High interest rates that kept under that kept unemployment relatively high and labor markets relatively soft right benefit in in the EU in the United Kingdom in the United States Japan is a very different story by the way uh but but high but relatively High interest rates are a key feature of the classic neoliberal order
(1:12:09) now monetary policy since the financial crisis since 2008 in across the developed world and and in major emerging market economies has been very low interest rates there are critics of that who believed that low interest rates have produced Rising wealth inequality and there's some some evidence for that perspective I'm far less critical of low interest rates than many uh observers of neoliberalism are because particularly given the the insane fiscal policies of the austerity era low interest rates were the only policy
(1:12:47) lever available to sane people who did not want a full-on global depression the same thing is true by the way during covid all right there are situations in which low interest low interest rates and higher interest rates have different effects in different contexts and one just has to keep that in mind uh to the to the uh to the virtual audience uh so this question comes from Ines Costa uh do you see a relation between education programs and economics in the last 50 years and the type of political leaders that we have even social
(1:13:28) governments today tend to develop policies that are identified as right-wing in reaction to economic crises like subsidies for fossil fuel companies yeah well you know this is a very another excellent question um uh I talked earlier in my talk about Joe stiglitz's recent writings about the Econo about the practice of economics I I refer the questioner to them as something really you know sophisticated and and thoughtful on this subject the the economics profession has tended to promote a way of understanding societies
(1:14:15) economics is a social science it's a way of way of trying to understand Society uh you know I had I had this thing up this graph up here this is your most basic microeconomic graph supply and demand right with the idea that supply and demand will meet and that will produce an Optimum uh level of production and of economically efficient price this is the most simple kind of piece of economic theory there is out there modern macroeconomics has produced vast theoretical structures and economic and models of economies
(1:14:53) that really in my view are completely deficient right and the the most important way in which they are deficient is is that they are static they're static they don't incorporate the uh the sorts of insights that this institute that we're sitting in uh is focused on in terms of innovation entrepreneurial change they also don't incorporate power they don't incorporate the fact that in the real world people have power and they use it right governments have power corporations have power wealthy individuals have power
(1:15:32) groups of people organized have power the the the economic professions and particularly macroeconomics bias towards towards stasis towards a view of the world as static which is expressed in the term General equilibrium Theory right as it's developed in this sort of neocanesian form this is not Kansas problem uh this is some people acting in his name in our time uh this gave rise to the sort of confidence that you could do things like deregulate finance and nothing bad would happen and so the I I just say that the
(1:16:11) question is is very much right about this and to their point about fossil fuels you could search economic literature in the 1990s very extensively without much reference to the fact that everything that was going on in the political economy of the world might be destructive if you priced in what was going to happen as a result of carbon emissions so the the the inattention to externalities which don't have powerful interests behind them is a fundamental failing of modern economics right and it's my view that the
(1:16:50) economics profession is going to have a lot to answer for when the when the final accounting is done about these matters much as in various ways the economics profession in the classical era ended up having to answer for the Great Depression if we're lucky the consequences would not be as severe as they might be uh sir actually my question follows right on from what we're talking about with the um the the economic kind of microeconomic Foundations because the whole of the talk which I enjoyed very much
(1:17:32) now that was brilliant the foundation is private economic power how does the power arise from the market clearly it does empirically we know it does but I don't see people who are opposed to Market fundamentalism taking the you know Marshall's argument with with that and the other kind of neoclassical economists from 100 years ago I don't see people taking issue with the mechanism of how power arises from markets and therefore the intellectual hegemony has been lost so could you comment on that please well
(1:18:15) that is an extremely sophisticated question I would do my best um that the I will not try to replicate the whole argument of classical economics or neoclassical economics as to why it is that in theory power should not come into being in a market economy by power I mean the power to set prices the power to control the control production set prices Monopoly power when I talk about power in this but but that argument exists and it's been shown as a historical matter to be false all right there the the existence of
(1:18:55) Google of Facebook uh of the half a dozen maybe a little more companies that control the the world oil industry none of these things would be would exist were that argument would that neoclassical or classical argument true it's just utterly false as a historical matter why is it false that's the gentleman's question well my question is about what is true yeah what's the what's the mechanism what's the mechanism by which it's false when I talk about power in this presentation I am not this is not a
(1:19:28) presentation about monopolies when I talk about power I am not talking about uh Monopoly power or Market power I'm talking about political economy power I'm talking about the fact that if you're able if you are able to gain enough market power in a business to accumulate some wealth that that wealth can then buy political power and that that political power can then set your tax rate and that political power can disarm your Anti-Trust regulators and that political power if need be can put tanks in the street
(1:20:15) on your behalf and that the consequence is the ability of whomever has that level of political power that derives from economic power to then reproduce the economic power right to to accelerate the accumulation of capital and thus not just of economic power but of political power right and this is the story and this is the story of modern history those processes on the one hand and the processes of democratic politics in every sense not just political parties but trade unions Civic organizations religious leaders
(1:21:00) in opposition to it which is what we're going to talk about next week the best government money comes that would be another way of putting it but it's not just government right it's the inter and finance plays an important role in this in these processes but if you go back to the what I was talking about about neo-liberal policies they are all about accelerating that process I'm sorry I just want to go back click through here back to my list of neoliberal policies these policies these policies are not these policies do
(1:21:35) lead to higher incomes for wealthy people but that's not what they're for they're for the accumulation of power neoliberalism is not about Freedom it's about power and it's about the intersection and the reinforcing of Economic and political power it's about the dynamic that led to this uh back to the online do we have any now do we have anybody there all right great this question comes from Sahar did the early promoters of neoliberalism Milton Friedman and early adopters Reagan and Thatcher believe that the
(1:22:25) consequences of neoliberalism would be positive meaning was it simply the best current thinking at the time I gotta say I I can try a lot of things intellectually it's hard for me to put myself inside Ronald Reagan's head those of you who may remember Ronald Reagan a very strange man um I think to be fair that that's exactly what they thought um I I think that Reagan and Thatcher were as individuals good faith actors um I think there was a thousand reasons for them to know at the time they were wrong
(1:23:08) right there is and there is a tragic and horrible sense of repetition in the story I'm telling essentially the same things have happened that happened 120 130 years ago the same mistaken sets of beliefs about markets the same tolerance of the accumulation of power without accountability the same the same sort of economic and political crises there there's a terrible repetition to this right which Reagan and Thatcher as human as human beings should have known particularly Reagan but they chose to believe what they
(1:23:55) believed I think what the what the questioner is also getting at though which I touch on and don't really dig into in this presentation is that the 1970s the era when neoliberalism began to gather steam the 1970s were an era of economic crisis they were an era in which whole whole systems of industrial production were in profound crisis uh the era when the Bretton Woods regime which was designed to limit the role of Finance in the global economy when the Bretton Woods regime fell apart I'm going to talk about this
(1:24:34) I'm doing these two lectures of neoliberalism and I'm going to do two lectures on the pre and post history of brexit which is a key kind of case study in all of this um I'm going to talk in those later lectures about this crisis in Britain in the 1970s that crisis was very real and it did lead to it did lead to people of good will people not behaving dishonestly thinking that we needed to change something dramatically and there were ideas sitting around Friedrich Hayek Milton Friedman of a way to change
(1:25:11) things and so I think there is this there is this way in which the questioner is is correct that at that time there were circumstances that led people to head in this direction who were not looking simply to make themselves more powerful and more wealthy um I I think at the same time though that Reagan and Thatcher had implicit beliefs that if we could open up their heads and share them with you all today you would find utterly repellent they were both racists well-documented races right they they believed they had no problem with
(1:25:59) Pinochet no problem at all Thatcher loved the man I I find that just repellent I can't even I can't even really get around that uh questions in the room yes sir thank you well uh Adrian we always thank you thank you very much and as well I I wonder and as a result of yes you're saying now uh where can we place the desertion of the elites here because there is a rocket and as I think now the Elites in the in the Earth are left they they left the arms in the rocket and I suppose that the the final results of all these is
(1:26:45) that the elites want to be free to be put in an in a rocket and go away and lift all us here in the in the Earth all right I must point out the the case people didn't hear online the gentleman asked what do we do about the desire of the elites to Desert human civilization to go to Mars or whatever it's very important to understand this rocket blew up it didn't work uh the the the the the project of deserting the planet uh uh is um the project of deserting the planet is not going to work it can't possibly work
(1:27:24) um what what exactly it means psychologically for the individuals who are pursuing it Elon Musk first and foremost I couldn't tell you all right but I do think it is symbolic of a different kind of desertion those Society let me speak for this those societies that were most successful at dealing with the crisis of Classical liberalism and as an American a citizen of the United States America is a bigger place as a citizen of the United States I'm particularly proud of the United the success of the United States at dealing
(1:28:01) with the Great Depression in the second world war through uh through Democratic politics small D Democratic politics but a key part of that story was that important parts of the United States is Elite particularly business Elites supported the creation that supported Franklin Roosevelt's economic policies and supported the creation of a more Democratic Society some of them did it because they believed in it some of them did it because they preferred that path to to leninism which they saw as the alternative all right but there was a
(1:28:39) cohesion of U.S Elites around actually addressing the key problems of U.S society during the Keynesian era what is striking today uh globally but particularly in those societies that most deeply drank the Kool-Aid of neoliberalism the United Kingdom United States is where are the elites that are serious about the problems we face I think particularly if my friend Hank Paulson people may be surprised that who know Hank Paulson that I count them as a friend I didn't agree with everything he did as George Bush's treasury secretary
(1:29:19) but he was a profoundly responsible man he took he took the responsibilities that he had to the core of his being how was he and he continues to do so he continues to Advocate very intense very passionately for action on climate change how was he treated by America's business Elites as a result the question answers itself I think this is something that has to be solved and I think there are a few signs here and there of some people in the global business Community moving in a better Direction and uh but there has to be more and
(1:30:04) faster I think we are running out of time at least the people who are so kind enough to manage this whole process or pointing pointing to their watches uh do we have one time for maybe one more if I'm online yes okay um so this question comes from Ilias Stratus our Technologies creation of new ways of transacting and creating wealth such as blockchains Devolution of power ai's disruption of the status quo is this morphing neoliberalism and if so what does this mean for the future like for example the next decade
(1:30:45) I'm not going to answer that question in detail because I want you to come back next week and and hear about the future I think one has to be extremely careful about the conclusions one draws about the relationship between technology and political power you first have to understand you have to really understand the Technologies I'm very I'm very struck by the fact that when I was policy director of the AFL-CIO in 2014 or 2015 I was told with great intensity and seriousness by people who had great credibility in this
(1:31:19) space by professors think tanks policy experts that we were going to have self-driving cars that were going to put the entirety of the American Transportation workforce out of work by 2025. as far as I know not a single human being has been put out of work by a self-driving car and is 2023. now that doesn't mean it might not happen in the future so you have to be careful about these things right you particularly have to be careful about cryptocurrency which and blockchain and so forth which in my view is a largely criminal Enterprise start
(1:31:56) to finish uh and uh and or an Enterprise made up of of con men and victims right not everybody who's involved in it is Criminal but if you're involved in it and you're not criminal you either are a victim or you're going to be one and I could talk for a while about why that's so so but at the same time technology is a big part of the story that I'm telling and I don't have time as as I didn't have time to tell it for real today I probably won't have time to tell it for real next time but next time when we
(1:32:31) discuss the crisis of neoliberalism and the choices it presents hopefully we'll get a little more into the technology part with that we've exhausted I think the patients of all the of all the kind and energetic people who made this happen and so if we give them a hand please uh and and hopefully uh most of you or all of you will return next week at the same time in the same place for part two
