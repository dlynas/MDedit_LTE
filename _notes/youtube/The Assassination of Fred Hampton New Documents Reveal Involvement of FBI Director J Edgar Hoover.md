Transcript:
(00:00) this is democracy now democracynow.org the quarantine report i'm amy goodman with juan gonzalez as black history month begins today we look back at the assassination of black panther leader fred hampton in chicago 51 years ago and how new documents reveal more details about the fbi's role in the murder of the 21 year old revolutionary fred hampton was killed december 4th 1969 when chicago police raided his apartment and shot and killed him in his own bed black panther leader mark clark was also killed by police in that raid
(00:35) authorities initially claimed the panthers had opened fire on the police who were there to serve a search warrant for weapons evidence later emerged that told a very different story the fbi the cook county state's attorney's office and chicago police had conspired to assassinate fred hampton now several hundred pages of fbi memos and reports obtained by historian and writer aaron leonard through a freedom of information act request document that the director of the fbi's domestic intelligence division william
(01:04) sullivan and the head of the extremist section of the domestic intelligence division george moore both played key roles in planning the raid and the cover-up that followed for more on what these documents say we're joined by flint taylor and jeff haas founding members of the people's law office in chicago who are the lead lawyers in the landmark fred hampton and mark clark civil rights case their new piece for truth out is headline new documents suggest j edgar hoover was involved in fred hampton's murder
(01:33) jeff haas let's begin with you you wrote a book about fred hampton talk about what these new documents show and what you see as the smoking gun of j edgar hoover's direct involvement thank you amy well first of all it's 51 years after the incident and 40 some years after the trial we had never gotten these documents before but what they showed was that hoover and sullivan and moore were following roy mitchell a special agent in charge very closely uh with regard to o'neill and they were complimenting him and
(02:10) rewarding him from the moment he gave the information and the floor plan uh to special agent mitchell they were congratulating mitchell on what a wonderful job he did with this informant of course mitchell got the floor plan gave it to hanrahan's police and that's what led to the raid the floor plan even showed the bed where hampton and johnson would be sleeping so we knew much of this we knew o'neal had gotten a bonus we never knew mitchell got a bonus and we never knew that hoover and sullivan and moore were starting to
(02:42) watch this in november but we um ten days before it happened they were monitoring exactly what went on and so it was approved at the highest level and during the trial we had sought to go up to sullivan and moore and hoover but the judge wouldn't allow us and we thought perhaps even john mitchell and richard nixon were involved we didn't have these documents so we couldn't uncover that uh this also shows that after the raid uh the head of the fbi in chicago met with and congratulated the informant o'neill
(03:15) thanked him for his information which led to the success of the raid what's also interesting is 51 years later these documents still have redactions there's a specific redaction because an fbi agent had been called in front of a grand jury and he was told if you get asked any questions about blank which is the fbi leave the grand jury and report to so to report to your higher-ups a year after the raid the fbi role and cointelpro had never been disclosed it was only about hanrahan and the police so it took us 13 years to uncover that
(03:53) it was cointelpro of programs whose objective was disrupt destroy and neutralize the panthers and specifically prevent the rise of a black messiah like fred hampton who could unify and electrify the masses it was this fbi program that led to the passing of the floor plan and the 90 shots and fred hampton executed in his bed at four at 2 30 in the morning on december 4th now jeff you uh the documents also seem to indicate that there was a plan to cover up the fbi's involvement in the raid could you talk about
(04:28) that aspect of what you've uncovered yes uh at the grand jury this was a special state grand jury because the black community was so outraged and there was a lot of pressure they called a special grand jury well they allowed the fbi agent who talked about who fired the guns but they didn't allow anybody to talk about the floor plan or the role of the informant william o'neill in setting up the raid and getting a bonus for it so that was kept quiet matter of fact if there hadn't been a raid at the media
(05:00) pennsylvania fbi office we might never have learned about cointelpro and in terms of why it's taken so long and there's still redactions on some of these documents i mean there's the the assassination of president kennedy there's been documents released from that and here's here we have one radical uh revolutionary in chicago and uh and it's taken so long just to get information about what actually happened well yes i think the cover-up continues and the fact that many of these pages contain redaction
(05:37) including the information from o'neill so the things the fbi has still not released we think showing the involvement of higher-ups we do have a continuous rewarding of the special agent roy mitchell referring to the success of the raid how the raid was critical to the role of the fbi so see some of these documents are new but for the next year roy mitchell got congratulated for how well he had handled o'neill and how important the information had gotten and they caught continuously internally called the rate of success
(06:12) while externally they were hiding it i want to bring flint taylor into this conversation co-founder of the people's law office in chicago you and jeff were arrested for protesting what you called in the pc outrageous rulings of the judge and the blatant misconduct of the defense can you explain what this trial was flint well this was a trial eight 18 months on trial jeff and i and others in our office are fighting to get these documents out fighting to establish the role of the fbi and we had a judge who was very similar
(06:51) to judge hoffman in the conspiracy a trial which many people may remember and he was dead set against us he was originally from alabama he was a racist and he did not believe and would not let us get at the evidence that the fbi was involved in this case but we were developing this evidence along with the senate select committee the church committee so we were exposing this evidence both in court and outside the court and the judge was getting more and more upset with us and so when we protested the unfair rulings that he was making he was
(07:29) keeping us from putting hoover in the case he was keeping us from putting uh john mitchell and the others from washington in the case and he was keeping us from getting the documents that showed the bonus to o'neill the informant uh all of this we were fighting for day and day after day and when we protested both of us at various times were held in contempt and sent to the federal uh lock-up here in chicago but we kept fighting it uh the judge threw the case out after 18 months of trial believe it or not he wouldn't let the
(08:06) jury decide the case we fought it to appeal and we won a remarkable decision in the court of appeals uh defended it in the u.s supreme court and 13 years of of litigation and fighting uh to get the evidence out we were ultimately able to to uh obtain one of the largest if not the largest police violence settlement for the families of mark clark and fred hampton and the surviving panthers uh in the history at that time of the federal courts and uh flint for the the younger members of our audience who really do not
(08:46) perhaps uh understand the role and significance of the black panther party and for instance j edgar hoover labeling them the greatest domestic threat to the u.s government hoover was aware by then although the public found out later that there had been polling done secret polling done that showed that more than 25 of all african americans at the time supported the uh black panther party could you talk about the party's significance party was very significant and its leadership was as well and fred hampton was a
(09:19) not only an up-and-coming leader but a very charismatic and dynamic leader and the panthers had a ten point program that program covered the waterfront uh with with all sorts of revolutionary and socialistic programs uh free breakfast program for example a free medical clinic for another example a newspaper that came out every week and talked about the atrocities of of the police and and and the government it was very much an anti-imperialist organization fought against the war in vietnam said people should not go to vietnam
(09:57) opposed mass incarceration before there actually was that term and uh also was very strong in setting up and fighting for coalitions between black uh hispanic or or like the young lords of course you know about that warren juan and other organizations uh revolutionary and radical organizations and this is another reason why hoover feared uh the panthers so much because they were bringing together all sorts of different radical and revolutionary groups more groups against the war in vietnam and this was very threatening to the
(10:36) government at that time and they targeted under the cointelpro program which was focused to destroy the black panther party on fred hampton and the black panthers because they were so successful here in chicago
