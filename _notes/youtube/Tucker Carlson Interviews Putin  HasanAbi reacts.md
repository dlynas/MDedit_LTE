## Transcript:
and Wars going back A Thousand Years the
ones that you mentioned but the fact is
that you didn't make this case in public
until two years ago February and in the
case the bottoman
Empire that's so
bad I've never even thought of that
before is an interview with the
president of Russia Vladimir Putin shot
February 6 2024 to about 7:00 p.m. in
the building behind us which is is of
course the Kremlin the interview as you
will see if you watch it is primarily
about the war in progress the war in
Ukraine how it started what's happening
and most presently how it might end one
note before you watch at the beginning
of the interview we asked the most
obvious question which is why did you do
this did you feel a threat an imminent
physical threat and that's your
justification and the answer we got
shocked us Putin went on for a very long
time probably half an hour about the
history of Russia going back to the 8th
century and honestly we thought this was
a filibustering technique and found it
annoying interrupted him several times
and he responded he was annoyed uh by
the interruption but we concluded in the
end for what it's worth that it was not
a filibustering technique there was no
time limit on the interview we ended it
after more than two hours instead what
you're about to see seem to us sincere
whether you agree with it or not
Vladimir Putin believes that Russia has
a historic claim to parts of Western
Ukraine so our opinion would be to view
it in that light as a sincere
expression Vladimir Putin believes
sincerely that he has a historic claim
to parts of not
eastern western Ukraine is that a
misspeak or is this on
crack
cocaine oh my
Lord of what he thinks and with that
here it is Mr President thank you on
February 22nd 2022 you addressed your
country in a nationwide address when the
conflict in Ukraine started and you said
that you were acting because you had
come to the conclusion that the United
States through NATO might initiate a
quote surprise attack on our country and
to American years that sounds paranoid
tell us why you believe the United
States might strike Russia dude I've
seen Vladimir Putin in such limited ways
that immediately when I see him in a
situation like
this I I my mind goes to that Tick Tock
Vladimir Putin that's all always like
hitting the nuclear button on the White
House like dancing with the SK dop guy
like it feels like he it's not real it
feels like he's not the guy that this is
the the Vladimir Putin impersonator
that's going to start
dancing you know what I'm talking
about you have to know the the Vladimir
Putin body double guy
like out of the blue how did you
conclude that
it's not that America the United States
was going to launch a surprise strike in
Russia I didn't say that are we having a
talk show or a serious
conversation here's the quote thank you
it's a formidable series oh my God he is
sucking on the peee dude
yo
yo oh
God
y oh Jesus
Christ because you're basic education is
in history as far as I understand
yes so if you don't mind I will take
only 30 seconds or one minute to give
you a short reference to history for
giving you a little historical
background
please let's look where our relationship
with Ukraine started from where did
Ukraine come
from Russian State started Gathering
itself as a centralized
statehood and it is considered to be the
year of the establishment of the Russian
state in
862 when the town's people of no invited
a varangian prince bro are you
are you for real dude are you for really
real that's
insane that we
are bro he literally he's like let me
tell you let me tell you the his let me
tell you
how we were just all we were a gas cloud
okay let me tell you about the big
bang you can't just dude he's doing he's
doing Russ Lord dumps rurick from
Scandinavia to
rain in 1862 Russia celebrated the
10,000th anniversary of its statehood oh
my God he's literally doing Israel oh my
God he's doing Netanyahu Israel
it's so
funny
oh God I this is why I love like
Ukrainian flag Israeli flag in the bio
guys who just like don't realize that
what Vladimir Putin is doing is
literally like it's Israel
and in no there is a Memorial
dedicated to the 1000th anniversary of
the
country in 882 rorri successor Prince
OLG who was actually playing the role of
regent at ruri's young son
because ruri had died by that time came
to
KF two brothers who he's doing that
because Ukraine is stealing Russian
history live he has to explain why it's
wrong
apparently one's being me yeah the
Russian claimed that the Kevan Rus were
Russian by that logic Ukraine can claim
Russia
too turnning into a
real why do you keep comparing Russia to
Israel what the first of all
are you familiar with both of these
countries you
mean comparing Russia to Israel is is
definitely not out of pocket at all
okay also Russia and Israel have a
pretty solid relationship despite the
fact that Vladimir Putin's always like
oh yeah I love I love Palestinians like
you
know a lot of Russians in Israel okay so
that's number one number two
he's literally doing like lore dumps and
and Russian mythology to justify his
iren actions in Ukraine why do you keep
comparing Russia to Israel what the
I'm
Palestinian
okay
so he has no real nationalist like like
look if you talk about being genuinely
afraid of NATO or wanting to uh put
forward a red line As a matter of
National Security as a foreign adversary
that's one
argument if you make irredentist claims
with like lore dumps about why you
should actually invade Ukraine and take
it over because technically you know
those are that's your land
all
right then yeah you're doing directly
IDF Playbook you're doing Israel uh
you're doing Israel propaganda to a te
members of ruri's
squad so Russia began to develop with
two centers of power Kev and
novaro the next very significant date in
the history of Russia was
988 this was the baptism of Russia when
Prince Vladimir the Great Grand son of
ruri baptized Russia and adopted
Orthodoxy or Eastern
Christianity from this time the
centralized Russian state began to
strengthen why because of the single
territory integrated economic ties one
and the same language and after the
baptism of Russia the same faith and
Rule of the prince the centralized
Russian state began to take
shape back in the Middle Ages Prince yav
the wise introduced the order of
succession to a
throne
but after he passed away it became
complicated for various reasons
okay the trone was passed not directly
from father to eldest son but from the
prince who had passed away to his
brother then to his sons in different
lines all this led to the fragmentation
and the end of rose as a single
state there was nothing special about it
the same was happening then in
Europe
but the fragmented Russian state became
an easy pre Conor this is the stuff that
American Media doesn't want you to know
I guess yeah incredibly boring
convoluted arguments that don't make any
sense unless you're like
completely one-sided on the
issue like this is what this is what my
my haters think I'm making a
claim on like Taiwan with respect to
China like this is what they think I'm
saying when I talk about like taiwan's
historical significance or its Inception
while still maintaining the position
that if they truly want autonomy then
they deserve it but I completely
understand where the Chinese position
comes from as far as like their own
security uh their own security interest
okay as as uh America utilizes Taiwan as
like a weapon against their foreign
adversary wields Taiwan and Taiwanese
Independence as a weapon against their
foreign
adversary and why most
people most people in Taiwan while they
do want independence understand that the
current way current order of business of
economic cooperation is significantly
better uh than than anything
else this is what they think I mean when
I talk about all this they think
I'm saying like well Taiwan is Chinese
and uh therefore it's it's it belongs to
Mainland
China was the US not doing that in
Ukraine not saying that the invasion was
justified no the the US is the US is
utilization of Ukraine against Russia
and claiming that they were going to
bring Ukraine into NATO when they
weren't actually ever really interested
in bringing them into
NATO okay is a way to inflame the
tensions but the goal is not to eat the
bait especially after you have already
annexed
Crimea
the Empire created earlier by King
isan his successors namely batan came to
Rose plundered and ruined nearly all the
cities the southern part including Kev
by the way and some other cities simply
lost Independence while Northern cities
preserved some of their
sovereignty they had to pay tribute to
The Horde but they managed I'm preing
him blaming Ukraine's existence on Lenin
I mean it's not he's blamed Lenin before
for it preserve some part of their
sovereignty and then a unified Russian
State begun to take shape with its
Center in
Moscow the southern part of Russian land
that's wrong the US was never reluctant
to bring Ukraine into NATO quite the
contrary yeah no that's that's why
Ukraine is currently in NATO and Article
5 was implemented and that's why there's
American troops currently fighting uh in
a in a direct hot war with Russia you're
right no totally when George W bush said
we're going to bring Georgia and Ukraine
train into NATO on his way out in like
uh in like the last month of his
presidency basically uh that was and and
Russia's red lines on that matter
that totally was was real and valid you
know dog for NATO to uh to operate you
still need cooperation from European
states to also vote in for new members
that even includes like ridiculous guys
like turkey ardan which are still easy
to control Adan has also chirped about
Sweden and Finland and then capitulated
immediately okay but the notion that
they were going to not take seriously
Russia's red lines and actually put
Ukraine into NATO Fast Track Ukraine
into NATO was always a ridiculous
argument the Russian argument would be
just that would just be that the
invasion was to prevent uh Ukraine
joining NATO except Ukraine wasn't
joining NATO regardless because they had
already successfully annexed
Crimea including
Kiev begun to gradually gravitate by the
way none of what we just talked about
everything that we just talked about is
related to obviously Russia's invasion
of Ukraine and why it's
unjustifiable and none of what Vladimir
Putin has talked about so far is even in
my opinion remotely related to them
invading Ukraine unless as liberals of
clearly stated time and time
again in their yapon omics uh sessions
that Vladimir Putin is irenes Vladimir
Putin is imperialist Vladimir Putin does
want Ukraine and he's basically saying
yeah no I do actually they weren't lying
on God I want Ukraine I'm so horny for
Ukraine towards another magnet the
center that was emerging in
Europe This was the Grand duy of
Lithuania it was even called the
Lithuanian Russian duy
because Russians were a significant part
of this population they spoke the old
Russian language and were
Orthodox but then there was a
unification the union of the grand duy
of Lithuania and the kingdom of
Poland a few years later another Union
was
signed but this time already in the
religious
sphere some of the Orthodox priests
became subordinate to the pope thus
these lands became part of the Polish
Lithuanian State Putin he is Yap maxing
during decades the PS were engaged in
polonization of this part of the
population they introduced their
language there try to inren the idea
that this population was not exactly
Russians that because they lived on The
Fringe they were
ukrainians Ukraine wasn't joining NATO
anyway because there was a war in the
East and an occupied areas which
literally stops IT becoming member State
that's until that's resolved it couldn't
join in 20 since 2014 so claiming it
will join in 2022 is just a
justification is a as a justification as
a pure lie no I'm I I know that I
recognize that which is why I'm saying
that it was ridiculous that Vladimir
Putin invaded Ukraine to begin with and
I'm also following up on that and saying
that it's also gross on the western side
that they kept selling This Tall Tale to
the Ukrainian population they were like
come on go die go die go die in defense
of Ukraine we're going to get you we're
going to put uh you know we're leading
up to uh the the last Invasion that were
like no no no trust me we're so going to
give you NATO we're you're going to be
in NATO please I promise you're going to
be in NATO it's
why do you think he invaded
Ukraine other than to keep their market
and economy and the Russian market and
prevent it becoming a subsidiary I think
he invaded Ukraine because he's a
he very openly is stating it
he's a idiot who uh personally
thought that this would be the most
effective way of dealing with uh any any
kind of Western involvement that Ukraine
would
have uh any kind of Western involvement
that Ukraine would have he would be able
to like cut short I also personally
think that he greatly uh overestimated
the the air superiority that they would
have that's what I
think I think he thought we have air
superiority we'll overtake it which was
stupid from the jump like it was always
stupid and I as much as people say I'm a
Vladimir Putin dick riter I
stated very clearly even before Russia
invaded Ukraine and certainly after that
it was virtually impossible
for uh the Russian military to
permanently Annex a
country whose national identity is quite
literally
comprised like the basic fundamentals of
being a Ukrainian is about not being
Russian okay okay is about literally
even in certain instances basically
aligning with the Nazis like
Bandera to not be
Russian 44 million people used to live
in Ukraine before The Invasion okay
their entire nationalist identity is
comprised of not being Russian there is
no shot there is no shot that
they were going to be able to
permanently Annex especially the Western
areas okay most analysts agree everyone
overemphasizes the effectiveness of
Russia's massive Air Force coupled with
the fact that Russian strikes on the
first days failed to destroy Ukraine's
air defenses
yeah it's stupid it was stupid why
because Ukraine was fully supplied and
filled with all different weapons no it
was always stupid because it was
impossible to permanently
Annex it was impossible to permanently
Annex a country like that counter insur
guys look at
Gaza look at Gaza and Israel Israel has
a infinitely stronger military force
with with so much better weapons and
they over the course of the past couple
of months have lost more military
members in Gaza than they did
against Lebanon over the course
of years okay do you understand how
devastating that is you cannot do a
counterinsurgency in an urban
environment against a population that
has nowhere else to go and is going to
fight tooth and
nail this is no longer like war is no
longer like oh you get your legionnaires
out there they get their legionnaires
and you fight in the open field
and then the rest is just peasantry that
you roll over with your Cavalry and then
now it's your territory it doesn't work
like that anymore okay you got
dudes buying drones off of alib Baba and
dropping the live stream was watching
just went down on YouTube so you'd
probably be next wait why this is not
like this is perfectly valid to watch
that's
ridiculous
what anyway let's
continue originally the word Ukrainian
meant that the person was living on the
outskirts of the state along the fringes
or was engaged in a border patrol
service it didn't mean any particular
ethnic group so the polls were trying to
in every possible way to colonize this
part of the Russian lands and actually
treated it rather harshly not to say
cruy all that led to the fact that this
part of the Russian lands began to
struggle for their rights they wrote
letters to Warsaw demanding that their
rights be observed and people be
commissioned here including to Kev can
you tell us what period I'm losing track
of where in history we are the Polish
oppression Ukraine it was in the 13th
century now I will tell you what
happened
later
and give the date so that there is no
confusion and in 1654 even a bit
earlier the people who were in control
of the authority over that part of the
Russian
lands warso iing that they send them to
rulers of Russian origin and Orthodox
faith when Warsaw did not answer them
and in fact rejected their demands they
turned to Moscow so that mosco took them
away so that you don't think that I'm
inventing things
I'll give you these documents well I I
it doesn't sound like you're inventing
it I'm not sure why it's relevant to
what happened bro he he's like he has to
fake it so hard dude he fakes it harder
than Chad's mom every night you know
what I mean it's like oh you brought a
document or maybe he thinks the document
is like laced or something but still
these are documents from the archives
copies here are the letters from
bdon the man who then controlled the
power in this part of the Russian lands
that is now called Ukraine he wrote to
Warsaw demanding that their rights be
upheld and after being refused he began
to write letters to
Moscow asking to take them under the
strong hand of the Moscow SAR there are
copies of these documents I will leave
them for your good memory there is a
translation into Russian you can
translate it into English later Russia
would not agree to admit them straight
away assuming that the war with Poland
would start nevertheless in 1654 the pun
Russian assembly of top clergy and
landowners headed by the
SAR which was the representative body of
the power of the old Russian State
decided to include a part of the old
Russian lands into Moscow Kingdom as
expected the war with Poland
began it lasted 13 years and then in
1654 I like what he's doing I think we
should when all else fails you can
always blame Poland
okay and you know that's not not the
worst
idea a truce was
concluded and 32 years later I think a
peace treaty with Poland which they
called Eternal peace was
signed in these lands the whole Left
Bank of Neer including Kiev went to
Russia and the whole right Bank of
Nipper remained in Poland under the rule
of Katherina the great Russia reclaimed
all of its historical lens including in
the South and West this all lasted until
the Revol for the record like I I not to
be super libed up here but this is one
area where Liberals are Vindicated when
they talk about like how oh he's just
like a Dugan he's like repeating
Alexander Dugan but if this is his
justification for invading Ukraine then
yes the Liberals are actually correct
that this is just simply pure iren
action that they uh that he believes is
Justified due
to uh the historical the the historical
reasons as to why Ukraine is actually a
part of Russia before world yeah this is
like this is straight up this is
straight up blood and soil for one
Austrian general staff relied on the
ideas of Ukrainian isation and started
actively promoting the ideas of Ukraine
and the ukrainization
their motive was obvious just before
World War I they wanted to weaken the
potential enemy and secured themselves
favorable conditions in the Border area
so the idea which had emerged in Poland
that people residing in that territory
were allegedly not really Russians but
rather belonged to a special ethnic
group ukrainians started being
propagated by the Austrian general
staff as far back as the 19th century
theorists calling for Ukrainian
Independence
appeared all those however claimed that
Ukraine should have a very good
relationship with
Russia they insisted on
that after the 197
Revolution Ukraine does not share
culture with ARs of course it does man
that's not what I'm saying I mean it's
like that that's not it doesn't matter
that doesn't mean that he can go and and
you know take it the biks sought to
restore the statehood and the Civil War
began including the hostilities with
Poland in 1921 peace with Poland was
proclaimed and under that treaty the
right Bank of Nipper River once again
was given back to
Poland in 1939 after Poland cooperated
with
Hitler it did collaborate with Hitler
you know Hitler offered Poland peace and
a treaty of
friendship Israelis don't share culture
with the Palestines because they're from
Europe yeah dude totally every Israeli
is from Europe what are you talking
about dude there's hella Arab
Jews so many people who are like
technically Pro Palestinian literally
don't understand a very important aspect
of this okay no there is a lot of
Israeli there are a lot of Israeli
people that are classified as Jewish and
therefore not Arab not seen as Arab in
the eyes of the Israeli government even
though they're Arab Jews which
means yes they do have a ton of
shared culture it's actually the
majority too so no it's not it's not
it's not Palestinian citizens of Israel
either I'm not talking about the
22% uh Arab Christians and Arab Muslims
I'm talking specifically about Arab Jews
that are classified as Jewish Mahi and
Safari um especially uh especially
Safari in uh
Israel or yeah Mahi and Safari not
Safari especially mahi espe
an alliance demanding in return that
Poland give back to Germany the
so-called dancing cardor which connected
the B of Germany with East Russia and
Kingsburg after World War I this
territory was transferred to Poland and
instead of Danzig a city of dansun
emerged Hitler asked them to give it
amicably but they refused of course
still they collaborated with and engaged
together in the partitioning of
Czechoslovakia may ask you you're making
the case that that Ukraine certainly
parts of Ukraine eastern Ukraine is in
effect Russia has been for hundreds of
years why wouldn't you just take it when
you became president 24 years ago you
have nuclear weapons they don't if it's
actually your land why did you wait so
long I'll tell you I'm coming to that
this briefing is coming to an end it
might be boring but it explains many
things just don't know how it's relevant
no at least
I'm so gratified
(Laughter)
that dude dude Tucker said come on man
wrap it up which is crazy you can't say
that you cannot say quit your yapping
unless you are
so like unless you are playing such a
profoundly important role as like a
western mouthpiece for Russia that
there's no shot you can get away with
saying that to Vladimir Putin I feel
like bro while Tucker Carlson is having
this conversation just so people
understand there are American
journalists that are in prison there are
Russian journalists in prison in Russia
there are obviously real spies that are
also American spies that are in prison
in Russia as well but like there are
people who should definitely not be in
prison in Russia for the crime of doing
Act ual journalism okay there are also
yeah I'm not talking about like
Paul whan all right Mr passport
afficionado I'm talking like straight up
the waler journal guy for example
there's a isn't is the waler journal guy
that the Evan Greer or whatever whatever
his name is like that there are dudes
who are Evan
gershkovich um there are dudes who
should not be in prison that are in
prison in Russia for doing journalism
for literally doing what Tucker Carlson
claims no one is doing in Russia okay
that I think is like pretty up
obviously when you look at it from the
perspective of when you look at it from
the perspective of like
um all the CNN journalists who like
turned a blind eye to to the death and
destruction that fell upon uh every Arab
journalist in the region since Israel
decided to do ethnic cleansing right um
in in uh Gaza they're being they're
being kind of phony when they go oh look
at all these journalists but like I'm
not I I do think that you can't
jail prosecute journalists like
that okay you can't do that you can't
kill journalists like Israel is doing
you can't prosecute and criminalize
journalism like Russia has done it's
( __ )
up you appreciate that thank you so
before World War II Poland collaborated
with Hitler and although it did not
yield to Hitler's yeah we do it too by
the way of course of course we do it too
Edward Snowden Chelsea Manning Julian
Assange and and you know Ukraine does a
different version of this as well like
don't get me wrong they they do it too
everybody does it but I still think it's
wrong and Dem it still
participated in the practitioning of
Czechoslovakia together with Hitler as
the polls had not given the daning
corridor to Germany had went too far
pushing Hitler to start World War II by
attacking them why was it Poland against
wh turkey's jailing so many journalists
you say nothing about that yeah I
famously never talk about Adam being
super hardcore anti- freedom of
speech yeah that's why I go back to
Turkey all the time famously that's why
um I I don't have a famous story about
writing for The Huffington Post about
the Turkish coup and how um you know I
was threatened personally through a
through an intermediary about not
writing for uh turkey at all thank you
though chatter baram DD turkey's jailing
so many journalists you say nothing
about that what's next are going to be
like you never talk about that Manan
genocide you dumb piece of
why are my haters so goddamn
stupid where they immediately where they
immediately go he's Turkish he would
never talk about turkey
suck my dick
dumbass what have you done what
sacrifices have you made in your life
you know what I mean I get death
threats on a on a goddamn basis for the
that I say how dare you I can't
even go back to Turkey safely
and you're over here talking this big
with no knowledge prior how dare
you
man address the allegations Bud yeah
okay what's Happening Here what are what
are we doing top of the hour AB breaks
it's not top of the hour it's middle of
the hour when the wor started on 1st
September
1939 band turned out to be
uncompromising and Hitler had nothing to
do but start implementing his plans with
Poland by the way the USSR I have read
some archiv documents behaved very
honestly it asked Poland's permission to
Transit its troops through the Polish
territory to help
Czechoslovakia but the then polish
foreign minister said that if the Soviet
plant flew over Poland they would be
downed over the territory of Poland but
that doesn't matter what matters is that
the War Began and Poland felt prey to
the policies it had pursued against
Czechoslovakia is under the well-known
Molotov ribbon trop PCT part of the
territory including Western
Ukraine was to be given to Russia thus
Russia which was then named as USSR
regained there ain't no way he's
using motov ribon trop as like a as a as
a good thing like no shot
right he's like no no no it was actually
really
good
like it was really chill when not
Germany gave the
USSR Ukraine historical
land after the victory in the Great
Patriotic War as we call World War
II all those territories were ultimately
enshrined as belonging to Russia to the
USSR as for Poland it received
apparently in compensation the lands
which had originally being
German the Eastern parts of Germany
these are now Western lands of
Poland of course s Charlie on an
alt-right arc when it comes to not
genociding Palestinians
what dude come on regain access to we're
being serious right now take a week off
which was once again given its polish
name so this was how this situation
developed in 1922 when the US
started building the USSR chat validates
everything dude come on ass you think TR
was going to talk about Palestinians no
but I also didn't understand how you
could be alt-right in in defense of
Israel that's what I was like trying to
hum her head what the that person
was
saying um don't validate him Chad come
on that wasn't even good you you you're
saluting mid when you salute mid you
want more mid did you buy this interview
law no it's free establish the the
interview is free for all to watch
because this is a profoundly important
work of Journalism according to Dr wants
everybody to see existed before
right Stalin insisted that those
republics be included in the USSR
as autonomous
entities for some inexplicable reason
Lenin the founder of the Soviet state
insisted that they be entitled to
withdraw from the
USSR
and again for some unknown reasons he
transferred to that newly established
bro bro he's like he's like this one
on Lenin while also hyping up
Stalin on lennin for like uh
talking about Ukrainian autonomy while
hyping up Stalin while also being a
rugged anti uh communist he hits like
like every wrong aspect of the story
he even talked about how Germany gave
Ukraine to the USSR so technically like
how Hitler gave Ukraine to the USSR so
it's technically theirs it's like what
is he trying to
do he's trying to he's trying to make a
historical argument from literally all
of the worst points that you can
make do you think he's a Nas ball no man
what are you talking about he's just
He's a hyper nationalistic
capitalist oligarch the idea that he is
like even in any way shape or form I
talked about this before the only reason
why the only reason why Vladimir Putin
even remotely mentions the USSR in a
relatively positive on relatively
positive terms is because he like a lot
of Russian Boomers does not give
a about communism well some Russian
Boomers might give a about
communism but he does not give a
about communism he is literally a
uh he's a a capitalist charlatan
from the
jump he only cares about Russia having
like this mythology of power like a
Russian Empire okay that's it he just
wants Russia to be a global
superpower and that is the only reason
why he cares about the
USSR he does not care about the USSR he
is the the reason why he is in power is
because of the illegal disillusion of
the USSR which he participated in okay
he does not give a about that
beyond the actual Legacy there's no
there is no like
ideological there's no ideological uh
goals there there's no agenda for for uh
any kind of like communist restoration
project he just cares about it as like
it was a mighty
power it was a mighty power there was a
global superpower it competed with the
United States of America and that's it
he wants to be a a he wants to be a to
have a role in a multi-polar world
that's it the Soviet Republic of Ukraine
some of the lands together with people
living there even though those lands had
never been called Ukraine and yet they
were made part of that Soviet Republic
of Ukraine those lands included the
Black Sea region which was received
under cathina the great and which had no
historical connection with Ukraine
whatsoever should even if we go as far
back as 1654 when these on
Lenin and supporting Stalin is the most
basic stance as you said it should be
the opposite by the way should be
promoting Stalin and or not promoting
Stalin it should be promoting Lenin and
like criticizing Stalin for you
know um a lot of its Mand a lot of his
mishandlings and yet he does the exact
opposite because he is not even remotely
pro-socialist he's not he's not about
it's not about socialism for him at all
there's no like ideological purpose
Beyond uh this restoration of the USSR
outside of land
ownership but yeah uh as you said Boomer
capitalist and nationalist rule the
country Source M Russian and's return to
Russian Empire that territory was the
size of three to four regions of modern
Ukraine with no Black Sea region that
was completely out of the question in
1654 exactly I'm just you obviously have
encyclopedic knowledge of this region
but why didn't you make this case for
the first 22 years as president that
Ukraine wasn't a real
country the Soviet Union was given a
great deal of territory that had never
belonged to it including the Black Sea
region at some point when Russia
received them as an outcome of the Russo
Turkish Wars they were called new Russia
or
Novia but that does not matter what
matters is that Lenin the founder of the
Soviet state established Ukraine that
way for decades the Ukrainian Soviet
Republic developed as part of the
USSR and for unknown reasons again the
Bolsheviks were engaged in Ukrainian
isation it was not merely because the
Soviet leadership was composed to a
great extent of those originating from
Ukraine rather it was explained by the
general policy of indigenization pursued
by the Soviet Union same things were
done in other Soviet republics this
involved promoting national languages
and National cultures which is not b in
principle that is how the Soviet Ukraine
was created after the World War II
Ukraine received in addition to the
lands that had belonged to Poland before
the war part of the lands that had
previously belonged to Hungary and
Romania so Romania and Hungary had some
is he saying like russification was a
good thing was a good policy because it
was not a good policy it was actually
objectively a bad
policy like it it didn't work it
failed he saying the
opposite I did I didn't understand maybe
he was saying the opposite he says that
the russification didn't
happen oh he said the Soviets did the
opposite of
russification
oh yeah no totally of their lands taken
away and given to the Soviet Ukraine and
they still remain part of Ukraine so in
this sense we have every reason to
affirm that Ukraine is an artificial
state that was shaped at Stalin's will
do you believe Hungary has a right to
take its land back from Ukraine and that
other na he's complaining that Len him
preserve Ukraine well I mean if you're
going to talk about like 2,000 years of
like kavan Rus or whatever Kean Rose or
or Ukrainian history and how it's
actually Russian from the jump then
russification should not even matter
because they are Russian
technically
right like how are you going to maintain
the position that both like there is no
autonomous Ukrainian identity
they're all Russian while simultaneously
saying well russification didn't really
work and it was actually uh all of the
all of the minority or not minority what
is it like secondary Alik in Turkish we
have this uh term uh in Turkey uh I
don't know what it's called it's like
your secondary identity I guess when you
a when you're like a former Empire you
have a lot of uh you have a lot of
ethnicities that are now Turkish or that
are now Russian but I guess technically
they would have like a a secondary uh
ethnicity as
well
like if they
were if they were already um they were
already Russian so it wouldn't matter
what uh it would not matter what Lenin
uh thought
about Nations have a right to go back to
their 1654
borders no
I'm not sure but they should go back to
the 1654
borders but given Stalin's time
so-called Stalin's regime which as many
claim saw numerous violations of human
rights and violations of the rights of
other
states wait now we should
not one may say that they could claim
back those lands of theirs while having
no right to do that it is at least
understandable have you told Victor
Orban that he can have part of
Ukraine
never I have never told him not a single
time we have not even had any
conversation on that but I actually know
for sure that hungarians who live
there wanted to get back to their
historical
land moreover I would like to share a
very interesting story with
you I take rest it's a bro this is why I
hate talking about uh Syria but also
also hate talking about Russia
Ukraine look look look Putin making
anti-semitic conspiracy about ukrainians
instead of Jews this guy he's also a
liar eastern Ukraine was anarch
primitivism part of the hetmanate before
the musite settler Colonials moved in
under Katherine the Great actually
Russia is Ukrainian since
Rose uh uh since the first rose was Kean
actually according to this Russia is
Ukrainian since the first Russ was kovan
Rus and now he's saying correct key was
the origin of Orthodox civilization in
Slavic lands Moscow was a swamp then
um everyone is
it everyone is going into everyone is
going into deep lore for no
reason
okay Russia is Russia Ukraine is
Ukraine that's it leave it as
is you don't have to get you don't have
to get to like Paradox gaming
conspiracies and and mapmaking in the
chat as you write out
paragraphs unless you're movan unless
you're movan mama Liga in which case you
are allowed because all of Russia
belongs to Moldova everybody knows
this uh except for Crimea which belongs
to Turkey everybody also knows this give
Crimea back to the tatars so it can be a
part of the Turkish conate once again
the golden horde will rise up as you
guys know I am an islamist
fundamentalist caliphate Defender who
wants to restore Sharia law globally
specifically in the United States of
America as a fifth column style
infiltrator and
um yeah and uh son of oligarchs private
jet lover uh and uh what else yeah
secretly a Neo automist as
well let's continue person one somewhere
in the early 80s I went on a road trip
in a car from then Leningrad across the
Soviet Union through Kiev May the stop
in Kiev are you pretending that you
disagree with your bloody Vladimir buddy
Vladimir I used to support you but you
politically have changed I'll be careful
following down this Rabbit Hole the
commissioner of the EU has considered
levying Financial sanctions against
Tucker Carlson to the extent he now has
to watch the abreak at the top of the
Hour come on dog that there's no top of
the hour yet that's that
doesn't count it's 346 brother
that's
insane and then went to Western Ukraine
bro we are 21 minutes in this dude is
like barely getting to World War
II is it true that you chared a private
jit to the Burbank Airport just to go to
PTO it's true I went to the town of
bavya and all the names of towns in
villages there were in Russian and in
the language I did not understand in
Hungarian in Russian and in Hungarian
not in Ukrainian in Russian and in
Hungarian I was driving through some
kind of village and there were men
sitting next to the houses and they were
wearing black three-piece suits and
black cylinder hats I asked are they
some kind of entertainers I was told no
they were not entertainers they
hungarians I said what are they doing
here what do you mean this is their land
they live here this was during the
Soviet time in the 1980s they preserve
the Hungarian language Hungarian names
and all their National costumes they are
hungarians and they feel themselves to
be hungarians and of course when now
there is an infringement well that that
is and there's a lot of that though I
think many nations are upset about trans
as well as you obviously know but many
nations feel frustrated by the redrawn
borders of the wars of the 20th centur
yeah give it back to turkey dog
yapping yapping around for no
particular reason okay it all belongs to
the Ottoman Empire I've been saying this
I've been saying it and yet for some
reason people don't want to respect it
okay it's
it belongs to the Ottoman
Empire and that's why I'm going to I'm
going to do it I'm going to be the guy
who does it okay I am the I Vladimir
yir yamir Putin country and War's going
back A Thousand Years the ones that you
mentioned but the fact is that you
didn't make this case in public until
two years ago February and in the case
the botoman
Empire that's so
bad I've never even thought of that
before the bottom an Empire more like it
how dare you how dare you I'm
mad oh my God the bottom of Empire
unironically is real it's like that
remember that tanzimat era thing
I used to have on my on my on my desktop
that I would show you guys sometimes uh
of like the dudes doing a a circle of
ass
like that uh that poster the gay
uh butt Circle that is the
bottom of Empire
true he stole that joke from a Twitter
account named Jihad Al
Hawk
damn the bottoman Empire destroys the
rentin
Empire I can't show you the actual uh
butt Circle but I used to have
that directly on my
desktop like it's uh like it's the
( __ )
horn folder of a particular content
creator next to my
taxes
oh okay let's continue which I read
today just you you explained at Great
length that you felt a physical threat
from the West in NATO including
potentially a nuclear threat and that's
what got you to move is that a fair
characterization of what you
said
understand that my long speeches prob
fall outside oh my God he is saying he's
yapping yep I'm
yapping from the West in NATO including
potentially nuclear threat and that's
what got you to move is that a fair dude
toer Carlson's literally like dog stop
talking about how you want Ukraine and
Ukraine is yours you you wanted to do it
cuz like uh NATO right like that's the
reason why you wanted to do it cuz NATO
right please dude what are you
(Laughter)
doing he's like he's like come on come
on just say you're doing it because of
NATO that's what you said before the
interview why are you saying all this
stuff about how Ukraine is Russian and
how it's been a thousand years of being
Russian and how you must take it back
characterization of what you
said
yep yeah y I'm yapping I
know I understand that my long speeches
probably fall outside of the genre of
the interview that is why I asked you at
the beginning yeah saying yep in
March are we going to have a serious
talk or a show you said a serious talk
so bear with me please we're coming to
the point where the Soviet Ukraine was
established then in 1991 the Soviet
Union
collapsed and everything that Russia had
generously bestowed on Ukraine was
dragged Away by the
ladder I'm coming to a very important
point of today's
agenda thank you it is very telling that
the first 2 minutes of him was literally
talking for like a thousand years of
history and like he hasn't even gotten
the NATO yet and Tucker had to like put
him back on the rails and be like you're
doing it cuz of NATO right like you're
doing it cuz of NATO and the only thing
he talks about is like oh the
dissolution of the USSR it's just like
and that's when Ukraine after all the
collapse of the Soviet Union was
effectively initiated by the Russian
leadership yeah I wonder I wonder who in
the Russian leadership affect itively
engaged in the collapse of the Soviet
Union obviously he would have nothing to
do with that right I mean Vladimir Putin
himself he would it'd be real weird if
he was uh what a fake
friend I do not understand what the
Russian leadership was Guided by at the
time but I suspect there were several
reasons to think everything would be
fine I think that then Russian
leadership believed that the
fundamentals of the relationship between
Russia and Ukraine were in fact a Common
Language more than 90% of the population
there spoke
Russian Family Ties every third person
there had some kind of family or
friendship ties common culture common
history finally common Faith coex aan
sounded like another tongue bathing
establishment mouthpiece to be honest
yes famously I love uh being a tongue
bathing establishment mouthpiece which
is precisely why I'm simultaneously
called uh a Hamas terrorist a dick
writer for Iran a dick riter for China
and even a dick riter for Vladimir Putin
having a nuanced perspective on uh
Global conflicts means that I am you
know that's it I'm I'm dick riding
everybody and simultaneously none at all
I'm actually dick riding Anderson Cooper
and and uh and uh Jake Tapper existence
with a single state for centuries and
deeply interconnected economies
all of these were so fundamental all
these elements together make our good
relationship
inevitable the second point is a very
important
one I want you as an American citizen
and your viewers to hear about this as
well the former Russian leadership
assumed that the Soviet Union had ceased
to exist and therefore there were no
longer any ideological dividing
lines Russia even agreed volunt and
proactively to the collapse of the
Soviet Union and believed that this
would be understood by the socalled
Civilized West as an invitation for
cooperation and
Association that is what Russia was
expecting both from the United States
and the so-called Collective West as a
whole there were smart people including
in Germany Egon bar a major politician
of the Social Democratic party who
insisted in his personal conversations
with the Soviet leadership on the brink
of the collapse of the
that a new security system should be
established in
Europe help should be given to unify
Germany but a new system should be also
established to include the United States
Canada Russia and other central European
countries is he talking about NATO now
is that what it is he like went back to
post World War II I think he talked
about the dissolution of the USSR and
then like I can't tell I can't keep
track is he is he now going back to Nato
cuz if he had started talking about NATO
if he started talking about NATO from
the
jump yeah he he started talking about
NATO if he had started talking about
NATO from the jump he would have a
better argument in my opinion yes one
because like Americans don't uh sorry
the right is like I guess ostensibly
isolationist even though they would love
nato in principle I think they just hate
it cuz like Trump said he doesn't like
it cuz I I really don't understand why
the right doesn't like
nato in general because is like it's
everything that they love just like
destroying Libya you know what I mean I
don't really know why NATO is European
which is gay yeah I I don't think they
understand what NATO is that's why they
kind of hate it or they hate on
it because the taxes yeah it's so dumb
they just don't they don't really get
it anyway but NATO needs not to expand
that's what he said
if NATO expends everything would be just
the same as during the Cold War only
closer to Russia's borders that's
all he was a wise old man but no one
listened to him in fact he got angry
ones if he's I guess this is why this is
why he had to describe like how Ukraine
is Russia technically because if your
only security concerns are NATO then you
can deal with that without invading
Ukraine but if you're if you're security
concerns come from NATO and on top of
that Ukraine is technically a Russian
then he can
justify uh why he's just taking back his
land and protecting his own people that
are being oppressed by uh you know the
scary Ukrainian Administration that's
like Western dogs or something said you
don't listen to me I'm never setting my
foot in Moscow once
again everything happened just as he had
said well of course it did come true and
I and you've mentioned this many times I
think it's a fair point and many in
America thought that relations between
Russia and the United States would be
fine with the collapse of the Soviet
Union at the end of the Cold War that
the opposite happened but you've never
explained why you think that happened
except to say that the West fears a
strong Russia but we have a strong China
the West does not seem very afraid of uh
what
wait the do you mean tuer what the
hell are you saying
dude the West does not fear a strong
China Brody where is it there's a
there's like one article about like how
uh US Army special force on long-term
bases uh being
placed uh Green Beret being stationed in
the Republic of China's uh 101st
amphibious reconnaissance Battalion on a
long-term basis on kinman and Matsu
there's literally new defense
positions opening up surround rounding
China the notion that like America isn't
trying to put a same put the
same strangle hold on China that it did
on the USSR and then subsequently Russia
is is crazy I mean he's not completely
wrong militarily there is more fear
against Russia than China since China is
relatively in inactive militarily I
guess there's
that what about Russia do you think
convinced policy makers they had to take
it
down the West is afraid of strong China
more than it fears a strong Russia
because Russia has 150 million people
and China has 1.5 billion population and
its economy is growing by Leaps and
Bounds or 5% a year it used to be even
more but that's enough for China as
bismar once put it potentials are the
most important China's potential is
enormous it is the biggest economy in
the world today in terms of purchasing
power parity and the size of the economy
it has already overtaken the United
States quite a long time ago and it is
growing at a rapid clip let let's not
talk about who is afraid of whom let's
not reason in such terms and let's get
into the fact that after 1991 when
Russia expected that it would be
welcomed into the brotherly family of
civilized Nations nothing like this
happened you tricked us I don't mean you
personally when I say you of course I'm
talking about the United States the
promise was that NATO would not expand
Eastward but it happened five times
there were five waves of expansion we
tolerated all that we were trying to
persuade them we were saying please
don't we are as Bourgeois now as you are
we are market economy and there is no
communist part I mean this part is true
he's not wrong he he ain't wrong about
that I mean worst guy to say that but
he's he's right he's like we're
capitalist we love capitalism I love
yapping just like you do I love I
hear hear hassi serving top of the hour
at break he says he's socialist yet he
serve at break at top of the hour what's
that about your socialists are also just
as bouris as we are we love capitalism

going to be coming back in a little bit
when I'm playing when I'm defending the
borders of
oan a not fictional
nation in the game I call comrade border
patrol CB
p ah it is the three minute out break
now let's negotiate moreover I have also
said this publicly
before there was a moment
when a certain Rift started growing
between us before that Hilson came to
the United States remember he spoke in
Congress and said the good words God
Bless America everything he said were
signals let us in remember the
developments in Yugoslavia before the
was lavished with praise as soon as the
developments in Yugoslavia started he
raised his voice in support of serbs and
we couldn't but raise our voices for
serbs in their defense I understand that
there were complex processes on the way
there I do but Russia could not help
raising its voice in support of serbs
because just thank you for the 2 subss
are also a special and close to us
nation with Orthodox culture and so on
it's a nation that has suffered so much
for Generations well regardless what is
important is that yon expressed his
support what did the United States do in
violation of an international law and
the UN Charter it started bombing
Belgrade it was the United States that L
the genie out of the bottom moreover
when Russia protested and expressed its
resentment what was said the UN Charter
and international law have become
obsolete now everyone invokes
international law but at that time they
started saying that everything was
outdated everything had to be changed
indeed some things need to be changed as
the balance of power has changed it's
true but not in this manner Hilton was
immediately dragged through the mud
accused of alcoholism of understanding
nothing of knowing nothing he understood
everything I assure you well I became
president in 2000 I thought okay the
Yugoslav issue is over but we should try
to restore
relations let's reopen the door that
Russia had tried to go through and
moreover I said it publicly I can't
reiterate at a meeting here in the
Kremlin with the outgoing President Bill
Clinton right here in the next room I
said to him I asked him
Bill do you think if Russia asked to
join NATO do you think it would
happen suddenly he said you know it's
interesting I think
so
interesting yeah weird weird
to uh weird to be this like uh
supposedly a pro-socialist guy Red Scare
while he's like very openly talking
about his um relationship with Bill Bill
Clinton evening when we met for dinner
he said you know I've talked to my team
no no it's not possible
now you can ask him I think he will
watch our interview he'll confirm it I
wouldn't have said anything like that if
it hadn't happened okay were you sincere
possible now would you have joined
NATO look I asked the question is it
possible or not and the answer I got was
no if I was ins sincere in my desire to
find out what the leadership position
was said yes would you have joined
NATO if he had said yes the process of
reproach me would have commenced and
eventually it might have happened if we
had seen some sincere wish on the other
side of our partners but it didn't
happen well no means no okay why do you
think that is just to get to motive I
know you're clearly bitter about it um I
understand but why do you think the West
rebuffed you then why the hostility why
did the end of the Cold War not fix the
relationship what motivates this from
your point of view
you said I was bitter about the answer
no it's not bitterness it's just a
statement of fact we're not bride and
groom bitterness resentment it's not
about those kind of matters in such
circumstances we just realized we
weren't welcome there that's all okay
fine but let's build relations in
another manner let's work for common
ground elsewhere why we receive such a
Negative response you should ask your
leaders I can only guess why too big a
country with its own opinion and so on
in the United States I've seen how
issues are being resolved in
NATO I will give you another example now
concerning
Ukraine the US leadership exerts
pressure and all NATO members obediently
vote even if they do not like
something now I'll tell you what
happened in disregard with Ukraine in
2008 although it's being discussed I'm
not going to open secret to you say
anything
new nevertheless after that we try to
build relations in different
ways for example the events in the
Middle East in Iraq we were building
relations with the United States in a
very soft prudent cautious manner I
repeatedly raised the issue that the
United States should not support
separatism or terrorism in the north
Caucasus but they continue to do it
anyway and political support information
support financial support even Military
Support came from the United States and
its satellites for terrorist groups in
the
Caucasus
I once raised this issue with my
colleague also the president of the
United States he says it's impossible do
you have proof I said yes I was prepared
for this conversation and I gave him
that proof he looked at it and you know
what he said I apologize but that's what
happened I'll quote he says well I'm
going to kick their ass we waited and
waited for some response there was no
reply I said to the FSB director write
to the CIA what is the result of the
conversation with president he wrote
once twice and then we got a reply we
have the answer in the archive the CIA
replied we have been working with the
opposition in Russia we believe that
this is the right thing to do and we
will keep on doing it just ridiculous
well okay we realized that it was out of
the question forces in opposition to you
so you're saying the CIA is trying to
overthrow your
government of course they me that
particular case the separatists the
terrorists who fought with us
dude there you go you want this you
think this is readable
okay that's who they call the
opposition this is the second
point the third moment is a very
important one is the moment when the US
missile defense system was
created the
beginning we persuaded for a long time
not to do it in the United
States
moreover after was invited by Bush
Junior's father Bush senior to visit his
place on the
ocean I had a very serious conversation
with President Bush and his team I
propos that the United States Russia and
Europe jointly create a missile defense
system that we believe if created
unilaterally threatens our security
despite the fact that the United States
officially said that it was being
created against missile threats from
Iran that was the justification for the
deployment of the missile defense system
I suggested working together Russia the
United States and Europe
they said it was very interesting they
asked me are you serious I said
absolutely what year was
this I don't remember it is easy to find
out on the internet when I was in the
USA at the invitation of bush Senor it
is even easier to learn from someone I'm
going to tell you about I was told it
was very interesting I said just imagine
if we could sackle such a global
strategic security challenge together
the world will change probably have
disputes probably economic and even
political ones but we could drastically
change the situation in the world he
says yes and asks are you serious I said
of course we need to think about it I'm
so I said go ahead please then Secretary
of Defense Gates former director I feel
like he wants to be Israel so
bad like think about it
like if I'm to take everything he's
saying at face
value okay he kind of wants to be Israel
he's like I want to I want to be
America's Ally so I can do whatever the
I want and I also want to take like
I want to take Ukraine I want to expand
into Ukraine Ukraine is mine I have laid
historic claim to
Ukraine okay I'm literally your
guy let me also participate in in like
this
Allegiance so I can just be you know I
can be your roll
dog do you think you want to be like
turkey
no ain't nobody want to be like that of
CIA and Secretary of State rice came in
here in this cabinet right here at this
table they sat on this table me the
foreign minister the Russian defense
minister on that side they said to me
yes we have thought about it we agree I
said Thank God great but with some
exceptions so twice you've described us
president's making decisions and then
being undercut by their agency heads why
you hate your own kind wait what my own
kind brother talking about Turks like
they're a different species holy
dude least racist American
guy
so it sounds like you're describing a
system that's not run by the people who
are elected in your
tent that's right that's right in the
end they just told us to get lost I'm
not going to tell you the details
because I think it's incorrect after all
it was confidential conversation but our
proposal was decline that's a fact it
was right then when I said look but then
we will be forced to take counter
measures he's literally like dog
why don't you want us to be like you're
you know Russian
Israel we also blow up Muslim
populations like all the
time okay we love blowing up Muslim
populations like come on dog let me be
your Israel homie what the
we will create such strike systems
that will certainly overcome missile
defense systems the answer was we are
not doing this against you and you do
what you want assuming that it is not
against us not against the United why
does his simping America make uh America
look kind of weirdly
russophobic I don't know States I said
okay very well that's the way it went
and we created Hypersonic systems with
InterContinental range and we continue
to develop them we are now ahead of
everyone the United by the way the
interview uh is now for me at least
becoming clear the purpose of this
interview is to be as sympathetic to
like American Republicans as
possible that's why I said the Israel
thing
like Republicans love
Israel and he's making Israel ass
arguments without the obvious like
religious Association that is also
profoundly important for uh the
Evangelical
Christianity side of
things
and I I feel like he's just trying to be
like look I'm a small
being I'm a small Bean conservative
nationalist like you're a small Bean
conservative nationalist why don't we
just like get it together cuz I was
trying to figure out like what obviously
he wants to do propaganda but his line
of
attack like
what what his line of attack like what
his his goals are here was interesting
to me and it seems like he's just trying
to come across
as like rational reasonable don't really
even talk about like the atrocities in
Ukraine don't even talk about
what the ukrainians have done right cuz
like if he was making an
argument internally
domestically if he was making a similar
argument to Tucker Carlson about the
same argument that he makes domestically
he'd be talking
about uh he'd be talking about Ukraine
and like how ukrainians are so violent
and so bad and LPR and DPR has a bunch
of Russians that they wouldn't allow to
separate but instead he's like I love
America I I love linking up and
building
um and America doesn't want me to link
up and build the states and the other
countries in terms of the development of
hypersonic strike systems and we are
improving them every day but it wasn't
us we proposed to go the other way and
we were pushed
back now about NATO's expansion to the
east well we were promised no NATO to
the east not an inch to the east as we
were told and then what they said well
it's not enshrined on paper so we'll
expand so there were five waves of
expansion the Baltic states the whole of
Eastern Europe and so on what this is
why people say I'm a Putin Dick Rider by
the way because I because there are
parts of what he's talking about that
make total sense and nothing
nothing about like Ukraine being Russian
or whatever but as far as like NATO
expansion goes and that being seen as a
genuine threat for Russia yeah of course
of course that makes total sense and no
way come to the especially post USSR
dissolution when Russia
literally is in his own words a
capitalist lap dog like run by oligarchs
that sold the country peace meal
to Western Banks so he's like why the
can't we be friends is what he's
saying why are you still propping up
NATO let me join NATO I don't know if
he's like being serious about joining
NATO or not but he's basically saying
like you're using NATO against me but
I'm your guy which he
was the main thing they have come to do
Ukraine ultimately in 2008 at The Summit
in Bucharest they declared that the
doors for Ukraine and Georgia to join
NATO were open now about how decisions
are made there Germany France seem to be
against it as well as some other
European countries
but then as it turned out later
President Bush and he's such a tough guy
a tough politician as I was told later
he exerted pressure on us and we had to
agree it's ridiculous it's like
kindergarten where are the guarantees
what kindergarten is this what kind of
people are these who are they you see
they were pressed they agreed and then
they say Ukraine won't be in the NATO
you know I say I don't know I know you
agreed in 2008 why won't you agree in
the future well they pressed us then I
say why won't they press you tomorrow
and you'll agree
again one thing that I do find very
funny is that um like he's like oh well
why don't you put it in writing this is
a thing that like Americans also say
about Russia where they're like well
Russia always reneges on like um prior
deals why could we trust them and it's
like bro you're
America like look at what Trump did with
the Iran denuclearization agreement and
that's one of many different instances
we literally have a policy in China
called strategic ambiguity which is just
a fancy word for lying is a fancy
substitute for just lying and saying no
no no you don't understand it's one
China but also we do uh uh believe that
uh you know we're going to keep arming
and utilizing Taiwan as like a military
base a forward operating base directly
into China
so American history American foreign
policy is filled with uh America writing
up treaties or having handshake
agreements that they do not follow
through on and the same of course goes
for Russia as
well but it is it is ridiculous that um
it is ridiculous that that we have this
like one-sided approach in this in the
situation where we're like oh it's only
the Russians that violate agreements
when uh NATO expansion is correct like
it did happen time and time
again and uh it happened after the
dissolution of the USSR as well my
opinion on it is that it happened
because it is a money
maker it's a money
maker and Russia's
existence uh Russia's uh actions
Russia's existence is a way to perfectly
continue justifying NATO and continue
expanding NATO that's
it
nonsensical who's there to talk to I
just don't understand we're ready to
talk but with who where are the
guarantees none so they started to
develop the territory of Ukraine
whatever is there I have told you the
background how this territory developed
what kind of relations they were with
Russia every second or third person
there has always had some ties with
Russia and during the elections in
already independent Sovereign Ukraine
which gained its independence as a
result of the Declaration of
Independence and by the way it says that
Ukraine is a neutral State and in 2008
suddenly doors or gates to Nato were
open to it oh come on this is not how we
agreed now all the presidents that have
come to power in Ukraine they relied on
electorate with a good attitude to
Russia in one way or the
other this is the southeast of Ukraine
this is a large number of
people and it was very difficult to
disuade this electorate which had a
positive attitude towards Russia Victor
yanukovich came to power and how the
first time he won up to president kuchma
they organized the third round which is
not provided for in the constitution of
Ukraine this is a cud just imagine
someone in the united all those
Sovereign countries shouldn't have the
right to join NATO Hassan real politique
oh god dude come on brother Jesus
Christ it is literally a
protection racket stop playing
with
me oh my
God
I already ran the top of the hour ey
break if you're trying to do
this yeah it's always a voluntary
association yes yes countries want
weapons okay they like having Guns
America sells them okay America gives
them to you when you join
NATO great it's still
bad
it's also additionally funny because
it's contentious with uh the supposed
socialists that claim to be socialist
and then they dick ride
NATO it makes no sense it isn't
it is an institution designed to
eviscerate socialism and communism it
was directly
created it was directly created to
reinforce American
hegemony and and uh set
up uh set up a a protection racket
sometimes for valid reasons but other
times specifically to create a uh
self-reinforcing cycle of of steady flow
of
weapons and and um assets Changing Hands
in that process from Europe back to
America and vice
versa literally hired actual Nazis and
actual fascists in every country
that it existed in and it operated in
stabilized quietly all of the European
nations that had operated in from Italy
to Germany well Germany was a little bit
more willing was Germany specifically um
and everywhere
else okay and it's like hidden under the
guys of see this is this is the
problem would you consider NATO
expansion as Colonial Conquest it's not
actual straight up colonialism because
it's a a voluntary military Alliance
that countries are joining
okay you say
that and it's it's the same as saying
like well technically why is the World
Bank and IMF actual imperialism a
continuation of imperialism how could
you say that those are just Financial
contracts like what I don't really
understand it it's still the same exact
way these they operate in the
exact same
way if you want to if you want to think
about it if you want to understand it
just imagine if it wasn't America doing
it but like China doing it and then you
can maybe uh recognize that it's know
it's not being done with the with the
most honest
intentions
oh yeah just imagine imagine it's like a
it's a a Chinese
deal States wouldn't like the outcome in
2014 before that no this was before that
after president kma Victor yanukovich
won the elections however his opponents
did not recognize that Victory the US
supported the opposition and the third
round was scheduled what is this this is
a c the US supported it and the winner
of the third round came to power imagine
if in the US something was not to
someone's liking and the third round of
election which the US Constitution does
not provide for was organized
nonetheless it was done in Ukraine okay
Victor Yenko who was considered I don't
support NATO it's just real politic
countries join NATO because it protects
them against
Putin
yeah no the real politique is not that
countries join NATO because it protects
them against Putin well now they do and
now they can the real politique of it is
the same reason why countries have uh
signed on to the Abraham
Accords they want American
weapons that's it and they also don't
want to be an enemy of the United States
of
America because if you're an enemy of
the United States of America you don't
get away with that turkey does
that's kind of what he was basically
describing when he's saying like I you
know I want to I want to deal with you
guys I want to deal positively we're
Bourgeois as well look look at us we're
a Bourgeois democracy we liberalized our
markets that's what it
is look at
Turkey you know what I
mean
the pro-western politician came to
power fine we have built relations with
him as well he came to Moscow with
visits we visited KF I visited Sue we
met in an informal setting if he's Pro
Western so be it it's fine let people do
their job the situation should have
developed inside independent Ukraine
itself as a result of kma's leadership
things got worse and Victor yanukovich
came to power after all maybe he wasn't
the best president and politician I
don't know I don't want to give
assessments you are not beating the
Russia allegations however the issue of
the association with the EU came
up we have always been lenient to this
suit yourself but when we read through
the 3y of Association it turned out to
be a problem for us since we had the
free trade zone and open Customs borders
with Ukraine which under this
Association had to open his borders for
Europe which could have led to flooding
of our
Market we said no this is not going to
work we shall close our borders with
Ukraine then the Customs borders that is
yanukovich started to calculate how much
Ukraine was going to gain how much to
lose and said to his European Partners I
need more time to think before signing
the moment he said that the opposition
began to take destructive steps which
were supported by the West it all came
down to maidan and aou in Ukraine so he
did more train with Russia than with the
EU Ukraine
did of course not even the matter of
trade volume although for the most part
it is look at Turkey what turkey's has
its whole eastern border being
destabilized by NATO nobody's taking
anything easy on turkey for being in
NATO what do you mean turkey gets to
literally overtake the northern
Syrian Corridor without a single
peep from Western media why is that the
case because inck is a nuclear
armed uh is it is it American base with
nuclear arms on it the do you mean
also partially the reason why adang is
to talk a big game about how like oh
Israel this Israel that Satan Yahoo one
minute I will you in the ass all
this while simultaneously there's
literal turkey's doing that this
year despite that despite NATO yeah
you're ridiculous if you think
that turkey's position as a NATO Nation
doesn't play a role in America not
coming down hard on Turkey isn't it odd
that only only NATO aligned nations are
able to engage in such actions
the do you
mean as long as you are an ally to the
United States of America you get away
with whatever the you
want you have childlike
politics if you personally do not
recognize
that your politics are silly if you
don't recognize it also what NATO did in
Turkey ironically ident identical to
what it did in you know also aligning
propping up Ultra nationalist fascists
like the greywolves against the
Socialists the trade unionist and the
Communists in Turkey okay so that's
another uh that's another that's another
Mark for uh my Anto uh my anti-
perspective
okay like these Ultra nationalist
fascists that have also been prominent
and propped up the Adan regime with
their Coalition is there's a direct
thorough line there's a direct through
line there between NATO involvement in
Turkey obviously nuclear bases being set
up missiles pointing directly on USSR
soil the Cuban Missile Crisis all the
way to reip Ty Ardon being able to do
whatever the he wants in the region
because he's a part of
NATO
it's not an accident after the the 700th
time that America aligns with fascists
in their endless Endeavor to eradicate
socialism it is a matter of cooperation
size which the entire Ukrainian economy
was based on the cooperation size
between the Enterprises were very close
since the times of the Soviet Union one
Enterprise there used to produce
components to be assembled both in
Russia and Ukraine and vice versa they
used to be very close
ties a was committed although I shall
not delve into details now as I find
doing it inappropriate the US told us
calm yanukovich down and we will calm
the opposition let the situation unfold
in the scenario of a political
settlement we said all right agreed
let's do it this way as the Americans
requested yanukovich did use neither the
Armed Forces nor the police yet the
armed opposition committed a coup in Kev
what is that supposed to mean who do you
think you are I wanted to ask the then
us leadership with the backing of
whom with the backing of CIA of course
the organization you wanted to join back
in the day as I understand we should
thank God they didn't let you
oh
yo he's right Tucker Carson's that is
CIA by the way Voice of
America God damn god his ass
tuger Carlson's dad is uh is is
literally CIA tuger Carlson wanted to
join the CIA that's crazy that vlader P
just dropped that in the with
the backing of CIA of course the
organization as I understand we should
thank God they didn't let you in
although it is a serious organization I
understand my so funny anovich is burken
force literally shot and killed over 100
people in my former VI a in the sense
that I served in the first main
directorate Soviet Union's intelligence
service they have always been our
opponents a job is a
job technically they did everything
right they achieved their goal of
changing the government however from
political standpoint it was a colossal
mistake surely it was political
leadership's miscalculation they should
have seen what it would evolve

into so in 2008 the doors of NATO were
opened for Ukraine in 2014 there was a
coup they started persecuting those who
did not accept the coup and it was
indeed a cool they created the threat to
Crimea which we had to take under our
prote dude Russia saying they have to
come in and involve themselves in
Ukraine because like they're being
undemocratic to the Russian like to the
ethnic Russians in the Eastern
territories is so funny because it's
literally America
okay it is identical to America
it's like America being like yeah we're
going to Afghanistan cuz they're not
treating gay people right it's what
Israel does about uh their defense of of
uh their ethnic cleansing of
Palestinians straight
up and no for those who are for those of
you who are dense as I know there's
a lot of people who are horny to like
cut anything and everything I say here
that even comes across as like even
remotely Pro Putin as like yet another
instance where I'm dick riding Putin or
some I'm not saying that that's
good okay I'm saying that that's bad I'm
using America in a way uh in a way
that is bad okay objectively
bad it's kind of funny saying it's
America when Russia has been doing
this before white people walked in na
yes but I say it's America because
obviously in the way that we understand
contemporary politics it's America that
does that okay it is a continuation of
obviously the oldest Colonial trick in
the book which is We Are civilizing The
Barbarians right the indigenous forces
that we must wipe out and enslave
deserve or are worthy of the civilizing
force of colonial uh uh you know the the
SU Supreme Colonial
cultures that's the the same thing when
I say America I'm just talking
about the same exact
continuation of that policy of that
principle like Tibet yes yes dude um yes
you're right
Tibetan uh like actual Tibetan slaves uh
joining uh joining the Revolutionary
forces is identical to uh the the
colonial violence and the enslavement of
an indigenous population thank
you no there are differences between a
feudal population and the subjects of
said feudal population joining forces
joining the Revolutionary forces to
abolish the feudal slavik conditions
that they existed under versus a
Barbarian a barbaric indigenous
population which by the way yes they had
practices that were violent of course in
in uh tribes and whatnot
getting uh brutalized in infinitely
worse Ways by an outside alien
superpower apparently Moscow was on fire
right now during the release of this
interview wait what multiple fires being
reported in Moscow # Tucker Putin I
don't believe
that n this seems like fake news
to me it's 31 it's got 31 likes that
seems
they launched a war in dunas in
2014 with the brother check your mouth
not all IND indigenous nations were
openly violent no man I that's why I
said yes certainly there were violent
practices in indigenous populations but
that does not mean that it was
justifiable to enslave all of them you
are so
silly I did not say what you think I
said just really take a breather before
you get mad aircraft and artillery
against civilians this is when it all
started there's a video of aircraft
attacking Donuts from above they
launched a large scale military
operation then another one when they
failed they started to prepare the next
one
all this against the background of
military development of this territory
and opening of NATO's
doors how could we not express concern
over what was happening from our side
this would have been a culpable
negligence that's what it would have
been why are so many folks under dick
today because I'm watching a massive
interview with uh Vladimir Putin and
Tucker Carlson and there's going to be a
lot of like uh Ukraine Watchers who are
very hawkish towards me that used to be
former fans who then got like who uh I
was probably very mean too if I'm being
real leading up to uh Russia invading
Ukraine in a very snarky way to which
I've apologized since then for getting
it wrong and even being snarky uh about
getting it wrong but they haven't given
up it's been two years and they still
have not let go um they will not let go
forever I'm pretty sure so so they they
mostly just come in here to to look for
any and every
opportunity that uh they can claim that
I'm actually very much Pro Putin to keep
that love affair alive in their own
circles
whereas if they genuinely listen to what
I had to say they would understand that
I'm
anti-nato for sure I've never uh you
know I've never missed words on that but
certainly even more anti
Putin the Moscow fires are real oh
that's
crazy of course that that big
like there
were there was
a there was a a big
split during the Sam Harris Jen uger
three-hour debate many many years prior
amongst the progressive left where there
were people who were like no I'm
actually islamophobic and it's perfectly
valid to be
islamophobic okay versus the Jen yuger
Coalition of the left at the time the
online Lefty online Progressive Movement
that was like no I think we should be
like more understanding of Muslim
populations and not engage in like such
severe acts of violence and
destabilization upon them um I think
that in my community a similar split
happened in the invasion in the Russian
invasion of uh in the Russian invasion
of Ukraine where a lot of people that
were like Oh no you're totally
wrong and you were an to me uh
they a lot of those people basically
became like complete aligned with the
United States of America no matter what
they do with some deviations every now
and then like but reluctantly
pro-american imperialism
not you just leftist media in general
I'm so tired of being called a Tangy
yeah to my shame I was in the Harris
Camp back then I know better now Yeah
ironic because a lot of people who used
to be in the Harris Camp then then
turned around from the Sam Harris
islamophobia Camp uh that were
anti-trump for a very long time looked
at what was going on in Ukraine and like
kind of took on another more reactionary
position that like America reluctantly
has to keep being violent and and engage
in Acts of
imperialism
um you know that kind of thing and now
that uh yeah now they call me a
terrorist for interviewing a yemeni kid
who they uh obviously call a
terrorist an anti-semite a slaver and
numerous other things still to this
day in spite of the fact that he is none
of those things at all they were very
mad that I uh
humanized um a person from
Yemen when America was blowing up
positions inside of
Yemen oh and a son of an oligarch as
well which is really
funny but yeah to answer your question
in the most uh long- winded convoluted
way possible I think those are the
reasons but once again I have to ask for
charitability as always be charitable
don't be motivated by what you have
watched as far as like videos that other
content creators have made of
me um as long as you are willing to
learn my position I will always tell you
I'm honest to a fault in that regard I
don't hide it I will tell you always
which is why so many people
simultaneously hold the position that
like I'm doing this to be
popular while also uh they recognize
that it is a deeply unpopular position
to
hold yeah all the drama Lefty said
you're Pro terrorist I
know it's just that the US political
leadership pushed us to the line we
could not cross because doing so could
have ruined Russia
itself besides we could not leave our
brothers in faith in fact a part of
Russian people in the face of this war
machine what was the so that was 8 years
before the current conflict started so
what was the trigger for you what was
the moment where you decided you had to
do
this we'll we'll get to Biden talking in
the White House in like 15 minutes
okay once again though to all my haters
that are in here I love you okay I do
and I hope that one day you will
understand my position why are you
triggered wait what I'm not triggered
why am I Trigg initially it was the coup
in Ukraine that provoked the conflict by
the way back then the representatives of
three European countries Germany Poland
and France Biden's tring Biden's trying
to steal py Poo's
Thunder they were the guarantors of the
signed agreement between the government
of yanukovich and the opposition they
signed it as
guarantors committed a coup and all
these countries pretended that they
didn't remember that they were
guarantors of the peaceful settlement
they just threw it in the sto right away
and nobody recalls
that Ukraine is also Neo imperialist
counterrevolutionary project propped up
specifically to prevent socialism from
spreading in Eastern Europe Russia is
literally acting in self-defense Putin
represents the last Bastion for the
dictatorship of the proletariat is so
funny because one he literally started
this interview and even his like
invasion of Ukraine by on Lenin
okay and even in this interview like 20
minutes in he was like we're bouris
we're a bis democracy we liberalized our
markets why are you guys not letting us
kill Muslims just like you we want to
kill Muslims alongside you please give
us money to kill Muslims instead of
trying to kill us with this NATO
( __ )
okay so the idea that like dude it's so
sick yeah Vladimir Putin the the eminent
upholder of proletarian
dictatorship the only thing he's
upholding is the dictatorship part of
that but certainly not at the beest of
the proletarian and uh more so for what
he is which is an oligarch and uh
definitely firmly
within uh within you
know the context of being a capitalist
uh it's a joke oh okay I don't know if
the us know anything about the agreement
between the opposition and the
authorities and its three gorss who
instead of bringing this whole situation
back in the political field supported
the coup although it was meaningless
believe me because president yanukovich
agreed to all conditions he was ready to
hold an early election which he had no
chance of winning corly speaking
everyone knew that then why the coup why
the victims why threatening Crimea why
launching an operation in D bu this I do
not understand that is exactly what the
miscalculation is Cia did its job to
complete the
coup I think one of the Deputy
secretaries of State said that it cost a
large sum of money almost 5 billion but
the political mistake was
colossal why would they have to do that
all this could have been done legally
without victims without military action
without losing crime that's pretty
funny he's like dude come on dog I can't
believe the CIA did military actions in
Ukraine yeah all of this could have been
done without any deaths is like a really
funny thing to say when you know you've
been
pummeling you've been pummeling Ukraine
just destroying eastern
Ukraine still all the is USA's
fault no USA involvement only
goes
um USA invol M only goes as far as like
the moment that Russia invaded Ukraine
it is entirely and I've said this time
and time again it is entirely Russia's
fault after that moment America can
continue its interest in in pilfering
Ukraine okay in its weakest
moment keep Whispering sweet nothings to
the ukrainians that they are going to
permanently support them when uh they
don't have that same interest especially
when you know another
Ally another Ally is is uh all of a
sudden more important uh because they're
doing um some some genocide a quick
genocide on the side
okay but
overall there are a lot of viewers in
here who 100% think Putin is right to
attack because NATO us triggered it yeah
I don't think that and I have said this
since day one and I make fun of those
people all the time um but you might not
know that because maybe you're not in
here all the time I routinely joke about
people who push Z or the magga
Communists I know there's a Biden spee
chat I know we're waiting on
it it's not live
yet what would you have Putin do other
than invade NATO after repeatedly cross
Russian redlines not saying he's right
he already annexed Crimea what are you
talking about it's jover he Annex Crimea
there is no world in which he actually
has to invade Ukraine it's
ridiculous he knows that uh the the
Western forces are never going to expand
and allow uh Ukraine into NATO he knows
that he already took parts of
Ukraine especially parts that are mostly
occupied with uh with Russian people in
general because of a prior
russification and relocation of the the
indigenous Tatar
population okay there's literally a
Russian base there
already how' you stop him so you'd have
him Annex LPR and DPR without invading
how
no no you don't Annex LPR and DPR at
all at
all like people say that Vladimir Putin
invaded eastern Ukraine because of
20,000 mostly ethnic Russians died in
LPR and DPR no that's just a
Putin justification for it that's
ridiculous how many ethnic
Russians have died since then what are
you talking
about yeah dude that was a really good
that was a really good tactical moment
for Vladimir Putin he really he really
saved a lot of ethnic Russian lives in
in eastern Ukraine when he invaded
Ukraine
come on
dude I think that I think personally
that he greatly
miscalculated maybe due to how easy it
was to
dominate uh Ukraine in you know in
2014 when its military prowess was and
its military uh equipment was
significantly I mean it was nothing in
comparison to what it is now
and they were wrong they did not they
were not able to maintain air
superiority they bombed the out of
even Western positions and they
failed they failed he thought that he
could do it he thought he could Annex it
which I literally think was impossible
regardless
okay it was a massive misstep it was a
massive
failure there's a reason why Europe
European countries are still very much
purchasing Russian gas for example
through secondary markets you could have
just kept doing you could have just kept
your head down and kept uh
dealing with your European trade
partners and just didn't have to engage
in like weird hyper nationalistic
um for the purpose of I guess like
I don't know galvanizing patriotic
support not getting outflanked by even
more nationalist forces within your
country or maybe because you personally
genuinely believe in the uh
hyper nationalist uh mentality that like
Ukraine belongs to Russia that that much
is that much seemingly is true I mean
he's basically saying
it
it shows that war against more evenly
matched countries Firepower not Manpower
ends up in a standstill we're too used
for big countries attacking smaller and
weaker ones no because big no no no no
you don't
understand if Ukraine was not armed in
any way by the UN or not un Sorry by
NATO by America by Western forces
Vladimir Putin would still not be a able
to permanently Annex the country this
has been my position since day one that
is the often times people point to that
one uh tweet about me saying like
Vladimir Putin is uh uh bad not mad he
would never invade Ukraine that would be
a major foolish uh major foolish
decision remember I never deleted that
tweet on
purpose because I never deleted that
tweet because the part that people
literally forget is why I said that
which which is because it would be
impossible for Vladimir Putin to engage
in a
counterinsurgency it would destroy it
would destroy
Russia even without even without arms
being funneled into
Ukraine by the thousands by the billions
of dollars worth okay old old equipment
or
not you
cannot go against a country with 44
million people in it that have nowhere
else to go that are not going to
sit there idly and take
it that's the reason why he was like oh
it's a special operation no it
wasn't a special operation at
all you are wrong twice actually he did
invade and it yet hasn't destroyed
Russia brother if you think that this is
a if you think that the the the invasion
of Ukraine has been a W for either side
you are huffing on maximum amounts of
copium it obviously is a stand in the
counter offensive failed in the way that
the American government and the Western
media presented it at first it never
came to be Ukraine has
hemorrhaged uh
combatants Russia also has hemorrhaged
combatants in this process by a a
significant chunk it comes down to a
major Russian intelligence failure which
believes there would be far less
Ukrainian resistance and far more
support among ethnic Russians which
wasn't the case
yes I think that they maybe thought that
it would be like Crimea which was
ridiculous I always point to harv as a
great example of an area that was more
pro-russian uh pre-invasion due to uh
Russian sympathy and ethnically Russian
people living there and look at it
now ain't nobody is Pro Russia
after their after their
entire uh existence is wiped out after
their homes are wiped out after their
apartment complex are reduce the
rubble you're not going to be Pro Russia
at that
point ethnic Russian is such a
misleading term many Russians speaking
cities are mostly pro-ukrainian look at
Kon yeah I I'm just I don't know how
else to communicate that point like more
um more sympathetic to Russia there are
there were areas in eastern Ukraine that
are more sympathetic to Russia the
further east you go in Ukraine the more
people used to be sympathetic to Russia
this doesn't mean that they wanted to be
invaded by Russia or anything like that
okay clearly they did not want to be
invaded by Russia they are now invaded
by Russia and look at them they are not
pro- Russia at
all I I'm not saying that they wanted to
be liberated by the Glorious uh Putin
Vladimir Putin that's not what I'm
saying at all
the point I was basically making is
that even those areas that he thinks
even those areas that I think Vladimir
Putin thought he would be able to easily
Annex similar
to uh easily annexed similar to Crimea
he was not going to be able to do
so I'm ethnically Russian hardly makes
any sense because if we're getting into
the history like Putin there are
ton of ethnic groups that aren't in the
the Russian ethnic group but are native
to the land
yeah I don't know what the proper way to
communicate that would
be to be fair it doesn't matter what
they
