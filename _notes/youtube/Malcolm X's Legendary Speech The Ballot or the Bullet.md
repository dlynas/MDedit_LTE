Transcript:
(00:03) Mr  moderator Reverend CLE brothers and sisters and friends and I see some  enemies in fact I think we'd be fooling ourselves if we had an audience this large and didn't realize that there were some enemies present this afternoon we want to talk about The Ballot or The Bullet The Ballot or The Bullet explains itself but before we get into it since this is the year of The Ballot or The Bullet I would like to clarify some things that refer to me personally concerning my my own personal position I'm still a Muslim that is my
(01:06) religion is still  Islam my religion is still Islam I still credit Mr Muhammad for what I know and what I am he's the one who opened my eyes at present I'm the minister of the newly founded uh Muslim Mosque Incorporated which has its offices in the Teresa hotel right in the heart of Harlem that's the black belt in New York City and when we realize that Adam Clayton Paul is a Christian minister he's the he has the abisinia Baptist Church but at the same time he's more famous for his political
(01:58) struggling and Dr King is a Christian minister in Atlant from Atlanta Georgia or in Atlanta Georgia but he's become more famous for being involved in the Civil Rights struggle there's another in New York Reverend gamis I don't know if you've heard of him out here he's a Christian minister from Brooklyn but has become famous for his fight against the segregated school system in Brooklyn Reverend CLE right here is a Christian minister here in Detroit he's the head of the freedom now party all of these
(02:29) are Christian ministers all of these are Christian ministers but they don't come to us as Christian ministers they come to us as spids in some other category I'm a Muslim Minister the same as they are Christian ministers I'm a Muslim Minister and I don't believe in fighting today in any one front but on all  fronts in fact I'm a black nationalist Freedom  Fighter Islam is my religion but I believe my religion is my personal business it governs my personal life my personal morals and my Rel religious
(03:30) philosophy is personal between me and the god in whom I believe that's right just as the religious philosophy of these others is between them and the god in whom they believe and this is best this way were we to come out here discussing religion we'd have too many differences from the outstar and we could never get together so today though Islam is my religious philosophy my political economic and social philosophy opy is black nationalism you and  I as I say if we bring up religion we'll
(04:11) have differences we'll have arguments we'll never be able to get together but if we keep our religion at home keep our religion in the closet keep our religion between ourselves and our God but when we come out here we have a fight that's common to all of us against the the enemy who is common to all of  us the political philosophy of black nationalism only means that the black man should control the politics and the politicians in his own Community the the time the time when white people can come in our community
(04:56) and get us to vote for them so that they can be our political leaders and tell us what to do and what not to do is long  gone by the same token the time when that same white man knowing that your eyes are too far open can send another negro into the community get you and me to support him so he can use him to lead us astray those days are long  gone the political philosophy of black nationalism only means that if you and I are going to live in a black community and that's where we're going to live cuz
(05:42) as soon as you move into one of their soon as you move out of the black community into their Community it's mixed for a period of time but they are gone and you're right there all by  yourself we must we must understand the politics of our community and we must know what politics is supposed to produce we must know what part politics play in our lives and until we become politically mature we will always be misled LED astray or deceived or maneuvered into uh supporting someone politically who doesn't have the good of
(06:21) our community at heart so the political philosophy of black nationalism only means that we will have to carry on a program a political program of re-education to open our people's eyes make us become more politically conscious politically mature and then we will whenever we get ready to cast our ballot that ballot will be class for will be cast for a man of the community who has the good of the community at heart and the economic philosophy of black nationalism only means that we should own and operate and control the economy
(07:00) of our community you would never find you can't open up a black store in a white Community white man won't even patronize you and he's not wrong he's in he got sense enough to look out for himself and you you who don't have sense enough to look out for  yourself the white man the white man is too intelligent to let someone else come and gain control of the economy of his community but you will let anybody come in and control the economy of your community control the housing control
(07:34) the education control the jobs control the businesses uh under the pretext that you want to integrate no you're out of your  mind the political the economic philosophy of black nationalism only means that we have to become involved in a program of re-education to educate our people in into the importance of knowing that when you spend your dollar out of the community in which you live the community uh in which you spend your money becomes richer and richer the community out of which you take your
(08:11) money becomes poor and poor and because these Negroes who have been misled misguided are breaking their necks to take their money and spend it with the man the man is becoming richer and richer and you're becoming poor and poor and then what happens the community in which you live becomes a slum it becomes a ghetto the conditions become rundown and then you have the audacity to com to complain about poor housing and a rundown Community while you run it down yourself when you take your dollar  R and you and I are in a double track
(08:51) because not only do we lose by taking our money someplace else and spending it when we try and spend it in our own Community we're trapped because we haven't had sense enough to set up stores and control the businesses of our community the man who's controlling the stores in our community is a man who doesn't look like we do he's a man who doesn't even live in the community so you and I even when we try and spend our money in the block where we live or the area where we live we're spending it
(09:17) with a man who When the Sun Goes Down takes that basket full of money in another part of the  town so we're trapped trapped double trapped triple trapped anywhere we go we find that we're trapped and every kind of solution that someone comes up with is just another trap but the political and economic philosophy of black nationalism the economic philosophy of black nationalism shows our people the importance of setting up these little stores and developing them and expanding them into larger operations ww worth
(09:57) didn't start out big like they are today they started out with a dime store and expanded and expanded and then expanded until today they're all over the country and all over the world and they getting some of everybody's money now this what you and I in general mtiv is the same way didn't start out like it is it started out just a little rat race type operation and it expanded and expanded until today is where it is right now and you and I have to make a stop and the best place to start is right in the
(10:25) community where we live so our people not only have to be uh re-educated to the importance of supporting black business but the black man himself has to be uh made aware of the importance of going into business and once you and I go into business we own an operate at least the businesses in our community what we will be doing is developing a situation wherein we will actually be able to create employment for the people in the community and once you can create some some employment in the community where you live it will eliminate the necessity
(11:02) of you and me having to act ignorantly and disgracefully boycotting and picking some cracker some place else trying to beg him for a  job anytime you have to rely upon your enemy for a job you're in bad  shape when you and he is your enemy any you wouldn't be in this country if some enemy hadn't kidnapped you and brought you here on the other hand some of you think you came here on the  mapl so as you can see uh uh brothers and sisters today this afternoon is not our intention to discuss religion
(12:00) uh we we're going to forget religion if we bring up religion we'll be in an argument and the best way to uh keep away from arguments and differences as I said earlier put your religion at home in the closet keep it between you and your God because if it hasn't done anything more for you than it has you need to forget it  anyway  whether you are whether you are a Christian or a Muslim or a nationalist we all have the same problem they don't hang you because you're a Baptist they H hang you because you're
(12:52)  black they don't attack me because I'm a Muslim they attack me because I'm black they attack all of us for the same reason all of us Catch Hell from the same enemy we're all in the same Bay in the same boat we suffer political oppression economic exploitation and social degradation all of them from the same enemy right the government has failed us you can't deny that anytime you living in the 20th century 1964 and you walking around here singing We Shall Overcome come the government has
(13:31)  failed this is part of what's wrong with you you do too much  singing today it's time to stop singing and start swinging you can't sing up on freedom but you can swing up on some  Freedom Cashes Clay can sing but singing didn't help him to become the heavyweight champion of the world swinging help him so this government has failed us the
(14:35) government itself has failed us and the white liberals who have been posing as our friends have failed us and once we see that all these other sources to which we've turned have failed we stop turning to them and turn to ourselves we need a self-help program uh do it uh do it yourself philosophy uh do it right now Phil philosophy uh it's already too late philosophy this is what you and I need to get with and the only time the only way we're going to uh solve our problem is with a self-help program before we
(15:14) can get a self-help program started we have to have a self-help philosophy that's right black nationalism is a self-help philosophy what's so good about it you can stay right in the church where you are and still take black nationalism as your philosophy you can stay in any kind of Civic organization that you belong to and still take black nationalism as your philosophy you can be an atheist and still take black nationalism as your philosophy this is a philosophy that eliminates the necessity for division
(15:43) and argument cuz if you're black you should be thinking black and if you are black and you're not thinking black at this late date well I'm sorry for you once you change your philosophy you change your thought pattern once you change your thought pattern you change your your attitude once you change your attitude it changes your behavior pattern and then you go on into some action as long as you got a sit down philosophy you'll have a sit down thought pattern and as long as you think that old sit down thought you'll be uh
(16:19) in some kind of sit down action that'll have you sitting in everywhere it's not so good to refer to what you're going to do as a city in that right there castrates you right there it brings you down what what goes with it what think of the image of a someone sitting an old woman can sit an old man can sit a chump can sit a coward can sit anything can sit well you and I have been sitting long enough and it's time today for us to start doing some standing and some fighting to back that up when we look at other parts of this
(16:59) Earth upon which we live we find that black brown red and yellow people in Africa and Asia are getting their independence they're not getting it by singing We Shall Overcome no they're getting it through nationalism that's right it is nationalism that brought about the independence of the people in Asia every nation in Asia gained its independence through the philosophy of nationalism Every Nation on the African continent that has gotten its independence brought it about through the philosophy of national ISM and it
(17:30) will take black nationalism that to bring about the freedom of 22 million Afro Americans here in this country where we have suffered colonialism for the past 400 years America is just as much a colonial power as England ever was America is just as much a colonial power as France ever was in fact America is more so a colonial power than they because she's a hypocritical colonial power behind it what is 20th what what do you call second class citizenship why that's colonization second class citizenship is
(18:17) nothing but 20th century slavery how you going to tell me you're a second class citizen they don't have second class citizenship in any other government on this Earth they just have slaves and people who free well this country is a hypocrite they try and make you think they set you free by calling you a second class citizen now you're nothing but a 20th century  slave just as it took nationalism to move to remove colonialism from Asia in Africa it'll take black nationalism today to remove colonialism from the
(18:58) backs and the minds of 22 million Afro Americans here in this country and 1964 looks like it might be the year of The Ballot or The Bullet why does it look like it might be the year of The Ballot or The Bullet because Negroes have listened to the trickery and the lies and the false promises of the white man now for too long and they're Fed Up they've become disenchanted they've become disillusioned they've become dissatisfied and all of this has built up frustrations in the black community that's makes the black community
(19:43) throughout America today more explosive than all of the atomic bombs the Russians can ever invent whenever you got a racial powder ceg sitting in your lap you're in more trouble than if you had an atomic powder cake sitting in your L when a racial powder cake goes off it doesn't care who it knocks out the way understand this it's dangerous and in 1964 this seems to be the year because what can the white men use now to fool us after he put down that March on Washington and you see all through that now he tricked you had you marching down
(20:21) to Washington yes had you marching back and forth between the feet of a dead man named Lincoln and another de man named George Washington singing We Shall  Overcome he made a chump out of it he made a fool out of you he made you think you were going somewhere and you end up going nowhere but between Lincoln in  Washington so today today our people are disillusioned they've become disenchanted they've become dissatisfied and in their frustrations they want action do you see this young
(21:10) black man this new generation asking for the book Ballot or the book that old Uncle Tom action is outdated the Young Generation don't want to hear anything about the a are against us what do we care about eyes when this country here was first being founded there were 13 colonies the the whites were colonized they were fed up with this taxation without representation so some of them stood up and said Liberty or death no I went to a white school over here in M Mason Michigan the white man made the mistake of letting me read his history
(21:56) books he made the mistake of teaching me that Patrick Henry was a patriot and George Washington wasn't nothing nonviolent about old Pat or George Washington Liberty or death was what brought about the freedom of whites in this country from the English they didn't care about the ODS why they face the Wrath of the entire British Empire and in those days they used to say that the British Empire was so vast and so powerful when the sun the sun would never set on it this is how big it was yet these 13 little scrawny
(22:36) States tired of taxation without representation tired of being exploited and oppressed and degraded told that big British Empire Liberty or death and here you have 22 million afroamerican black people today catching More Hell than Patrick Henry ever  saw and I'm I'm here to tell you in case you don't know it that you got a new you got a new generation of black people in this country who don't care anything whatsoever about ours they don't want to hear you Uncle Tom handkerchief heads
(23:17) talking about uh the eyes no this is a new generation if they're going to draft these young black men and send them over to Korea or South Vietnam to face 800 million chines if you're not afraid of those odds you shouldn't be afraid of these odds why is America why does this Loom to be such an explosive political year because this is the year of politics this is the year when all of the white politicians are going to come into the Negro Community you never see them until election time you can't blame them until
(24:18) election time they're going to come in with false promises and as they make these false promises they're going to feed our frustrations and this will only serve to make matters worse I'm no politician I'm not even a student of politics I'm not a republican nor a Democrat nor an American and got sense enough to know it I'm one of the 22 million black victims of the Democrats one of the 22 million black victims of the Republicans and one of the 22 million black victims of americanism and when I speak I don't
(25:09) speak as a democrat or a republican I speak as a victim of America's so-called democracy you and I have never seen democracy all we've seen is hypocrisy when we open our eyes today and look around America we see America not Through The Eyes of someone who have who has enjoyed the fruits of americanism we see America Through The Eyes of someone who has been the victim of americanism we don't see any American Dream we've experienced only the American  Nightmare we haven't benefited from
(25:52) America's democracy we've only suffered from America's hypocrisy and the generation that's coming up now can see it and are not afraid to say it if if you go to jail so what if you're BL you were born in jail if you black you were born in jail in the north as well as the South stop talking about the south as long as you south of the long as you're south of the Canadian border you're South don't call Governor Wallace a Dixie Governor Ramy is a Dixie Governor 22 million black victims of
(26:47) americanism are waking up and they're gaining a new political Consciousness becoming politically mature and as they become uh develop this political maturity they're able to see the recent Trends in these uh political elections they see that the whites are so evenly divided that every time they vote uh the race is so close they have to go back and count the votes all over again and which means that any block any minority that has a block of votes that stick together is in a strategic position either way you go that's who gets it
(27:22) you're you're in a position to determine who go to the White House and who stay in the dog house you're the one who has that power you can keep Johnson in Washington DC or you can send him back to his Texas cotton pants you're the one who sent Kennedy to Washington you're the one who put the present Democratic Administration in Washington DC the whites were evenly divided it was the fact that you threw 80% of your votes behind the Democrats that put the Democrat in the white house when you see this you can see that
(28:02) the Negro vote is the key factor and despite the fact that you are in a position to to be the determining Factor what do you get out of it the Democrats have been in Washington DC only because of the Negro vote they've been down there four years and there all other legislation they wanted to bring up they've brought it up and gotten it out of the way and now they bring up you and now they bring up you you put them first first and they put you last cuz you're a Chum a political Chum in Washington DC in the House of
(28:46) Representatives there are 257 who are Democrats only 177 are Republican in the Senate there are 67 uh Democrats only 33 are Republicans the party that you B controls 2/3 of the House of Representatives and the Senate and still they can't keep their promise to you cuz you're a chunk anytime you throw your weight behind a political party that controls 2third of the government and that party can't keep the promise that it made to you during election time and you are dumb enough to walk around continuing to
(29:26) identify yourself with that party you're not only a chump but you're a traitor to your race and what kind of Alibi do they come up with they try and pass the buck to the Dixie Crest now back during the days when you were blind deaf and dumb ignorant politically IM immature naturally you went along with that but today as your eyes come open and you develop political maturity you're able to see and think for yourself and you can see that a dicr is nothing but a democrat in Disguise you look at the structure of
(30:12) the uh government that controls this country it's controlled by 16 senatorial committees and 20 congressional committees of the 16 senatorial committees that run the government 10 of them are in the hands of Southern segregationists of the 20 con committees that run the government 12 of them in are in the hands of Southern segregationists and they're going to tell you and me that the South lost the  wall you today have are in the hands of a government of segregationists racists white supremacist who belong to the Democratic
(30:55) party but disguise themselves as dictocrats a dioc is nothing but a Democrat whoever runs the Democrats is also the father of the diocres and the father of all of them is sitting in the White House I say and I say it again you got a president who's nothing but a southern segregationist from the state of Texas they'll Lyn you in Texas as quick as they'll Lynch you in Mississippi only in in Texas they Lynch you with a Texas accent in Mississippi they Lynch you with a Mississippi accent and the first thing the cracker
(31:47) does when he comes in power he takes all the Negro leaders and invites them for a  coffee to show that he's all right and those Uncle Toms can't pass up the car they come away from the coffee table telling you and me that this man is all right cuz he's from the south and since he's from the south he can deal with the South look at the logic that they're using what about Eastland he's from the south make him the president he if if Johnson is a good man cuz he's from Texas and and then
(32:39) from Texas will if if Johnson is a good man cuz he's from Texas and and then from Texas will enable him to deal with the South Eastland can deal with the South better than Johnson oh I say you've been misled you've been had you been  took I was in Washington a couple of weeks ago while the senators were filibustering and I noticed in the back of the Senate a huge map and on this map it showed the distribution of negroes in America and surprisingly the same Senators that were in involved in the
(33:28) filibuster were from the states where there were the most Negroes why were they filibustering the civil rights legislation because the civil rights legislation is supposed to guarantee voting rights to Negroes in those States and those senators from those States know that if the Negroes in those states can vote those senators are down the drain the representatives of those States go down the drain and in the constitution of this country it has a stipulation wherein whenever the rights the voting rights of people in a certain
(34:02) District are violated then the representative who who's from that particular District according to the Constitution is supposed to be expelled from the Comm now if this particular aspect of the Constitution was enforced why you wouldn't have a cracker in Washington DC but what would happen when you expel the diorr you're expelling the Democrat when you destroy the power of the diorr you're destroying the power power of the democratic party so how in the well can the Democratic Party in the South
(34:43) actually sign with you in sincerity when all of this power is based in the in the South these NN Democrats are incahoots with the southern Democrats they playing a giant con game a political con game you know how it goes one of one of them comes to you and make bleed these for you and he's in cahoots with the other one that's not for you why because neither one of them is for you but they got to make you a go with one of them all the other so this is a kind game and this is what they've been doing with you and me all these
(35:19) years first thing Johnson got off the planlean when he become president he asked where's Dicky you know who Dicky is Dicky is old southern cracker rich and r Richard Russell look here yes Lyndon D Johnson's best friend is the one who is ahead who's heading the forces that are filibustering civil rights legislation you tell me how in the hell is he going to be Johnson's best friend how can Johnson be his friend and your friend too no that man is too tricky especially if his friend is still old 
(36:10) Dicky whenever the Negroes keep the Democrats in power they're keeping the dictocrats in power this is true a vote for a Democrat is nothing but a vote for a dictocrats that but I I'm not the kind of person who come here and say what you like I'm going to tell you the truth whether you like it or not up here in the north you have the same thing the Democratic party don't don't do it doesn't they don't do it that way they got a thing that they call Jerry mandering they they maneuver you out of
(36:50) power even though you can vote they fix it so you voting for nobody they got you going and coming in the South they're outright political wolves in the north they're political foxes a fox and a wolf a both can9 both belong to the dog family now you take your choice you're going to choose a northern dog or a southern dog because either dog you choose I guarantee you you'll still be in the dogghouse this is why I say it's The Ballot or The Bullet it's liberty or debt it's freedom for everybody or freedom for
(37:52) nobody America today finds herself in a unique situation historically revolutions are bloody oh yes they are they Haven never had a bloodless Revolution or a nonviolent Revolution right that don't happen even in Hollywood you don't have a revolution in which you love your enemy and you don't have a revolution in which you are begging the system of exploitation to integrate you into it revolutions overturn systems revolutions destroy system A revolution is bloody but America is in a unique position she's the only country in
(38:39) history in a position actually to become involved in a bloodless Revolution the the Russian Revolution was Bloody Chinese Revolution was Bloody French Revolution was Bloody Cuban Revolution was bloody and there was nothing more BL bloody than the American Revolution but today this country can become involved in a revolution that won't take Bloodshed all she's got to do is give the black man in this country everything that's doing everything I hope that the white man can see this because if you don't see it
(39:22) you're finished if you don't see it you're going to be coming you're going to become involved in some action in which you don't have a chance we don't care anything about your atomic bomb it's it's useless because other countries have atomic bomb when two or three different countries have atomic bombs nobody can use it so it means that the white man today is without a weapon right if you going to if you want some action you got to come on down to earth and there's more black people on Earth
(39:48) than there are white people on earth I only got a couple more minutes the white man can never win another war on the ground his days of War Victory his great his days of ground Victory are over can I prove it yes take all the action that's going on on this earth right now that he's involved in tell me where he's winning nowhere why some race Farmers some race Farmers some race eaters ran him out of Cora yes they ran him out of Cory Racers with nothing but gym shoes and a rifle and a bowl of rice took him and his tanks and his Nee
(40:45) pal and all that other acing he's supposed to have and ran him across the Yoo why because the day that he can win on the ground is pass up in uh French Ino China those little peasants rice Growers took on the might of the French army and ran all the Frenchmen you remember Den then  F the same thing happened in Algeria in Africa they didn't have anything but a ranker the French had all these highly mechanized instruments of warfare but they put some gorilla action on and a and a and a white man can't fight
(41:27) gorilla wet gorilla anent takes heart takes nerve and he doesn't have that he's Brave when he's got tanks he's Brave when he's got planes he's Brave when he's got bombs he's Brave when he got a whole lot of company along with him but you take that little man from Africa in Asia turn him loose in the woods with a blade a blade that's all he needs all he needs is a blade and when the sun comes down goes down and it's dark it's even   Steven so is thing it's the ballot a
(42:29) bullet today our people can see that we're faced with a government conspiracy this government has failed us the Senators who are filibustering concerning your and my rights that's the government don't say it's C Senators this is the government this is the government filibuster it's not a segregation of filibuster it's a government filibuster any kind of activity that takes place on the floor of the Congress or the Senate that's the government any kind of Dilly ding that's the government any kind of footing
(43:02) that's the government any kind of act that's designed to delay or deprive you and me right now of getting full rights that's the government that's responsible and anytime you find the government involved in a conspiracy to violate the citizenship or the civil rights of a people then you are wasting your time going to that government expecting regress instead you have to take that government to the world court and accuse it of genocide and all of the other crimes that it is guilty of today for those of us whose political
(43:46) and economic and social philosophy is black nationalism have become involved in the Civil Rights struggle we have injected ourselves into the Civil Rights struggle and we intend to expand it from the level of civil rights to the level of human rights as long as you as long as you fight it on the level of civil rights you're under Uncle Sam's jurisdiction you're going to his court expecting him to correct the problem he created the problem he's the criminal you don't take your case to the criminal
(44:15) you take your criminal to court when the government of South Africa begin to trample upon the human rights of the people of South Africa they were taken to the UN when the government of Portugal began to trample upon the the rights of our brothers and sisters in Angola it was taken before the UN why even the white man took the Hungarian question through the UN and just this week chief justice Goldberg was crying over uh 3 million Jews in Russia about their human rights charging Russia with violating the UN Charter
(44:57) because of its uh mistreatment of the human rights of Jews in Russia now you tell me how can the plight of everybody on this Earth reach the halls of the United Nations and you have 22 million afro Americans whose churches are being bombed whose little girls are being murdered whose whose leaders are being shut down in Broad day life now you tell me why the leaders of this struggle have never taken it before the United  Nations so our next move is to take the entire civil rights struggle problem into the United
(45:47)  Nations let the world see that Uncle Sam is guilty of violating the human rights of 22 million AF and still has the audacity or the nerve to stand up and represent himself as the leader of the Free World not only is he a crook He's a hypocrite here he is standing up in front of other people Uncle s with the blood of your and my mothers and fathers on his hands with the blood zipping down his Jaws like a bloody jwed wolf and still got the nerve to point his finger at other countries you can't
(46:41) even get civil ranks legislation and this man has got the nerve to stand up and talk about South Africa or talk about Nazi Germany or talk about pora no no more days like those so I I say in my conclusion the only way we're going to solve it we got to unit Us in unity and Harmony and black nationalism is the key how are we going to overcome the tendency to be at each other's throat that always exists in our neighborhood and the reason this tendency exists the uh strategy of the white man has always been dividing
(47:21) conquer he keeps us divided in order to conquer us he tells you I'm for separation and you for integration and keep us fighting with each other no I'm not for separation and you're not for integration what you and I are for is freedom only you think that integration will get your freedom I think separation will get me Freedom we both got the same objective we just got different ways of getting at it so uh I I I studied this man Billy green who preaches white nationalism that's what he preaches I say that's what he preaches
(48:05) the whole church structure in this country is white nationalism you go inside a white church that's what they preaching white nationalism they got Jesus white Mary White God white everybody white that's white  nationalism so what he does the way he the way he the way he circumvents the the uh jealousy and envy that he ordinarily would incur among the heads of the church whenever you go into an area where the church already is you're going to run into trouble cuz they got that thing what you call it uh
(48:43) syndicated they got a Syndicate just like the reters have I'm going to say what's on my mind cuz the church has the preachers already proved to you that they got a  Syndicate and when you're into rackets whenever you're getting in another man's territory you know they gang up on you and that's the same way with you you run into the same thing so how Billy Graham gets around that instead of going into somebody else's territory like he going to start a new new church he don't try
(49:10) he doesn't try and start a church he just goes in preaching Christ and he says everybody who believe in him you go you go wherever you find him so this helps all the churches and so since it helps all the churches they don't find well uh we're going to do the same thing only Our Gospel is black nationalism his gospel is white nationalism Our Gospel is black nationalism and the gospel of black nationalism as I told you means you should control your own the politics of your community the economy of your
(49:35) community and all of the society in which you live should be under your control and when and and once you uh uh feel that this philosophy will solve your problem go join any church where that's preached don't join a church where white nationalism is preached now you can go to a negro church and be expose to White nationalism CU when you are when you walk in a negro church and a white Mary and some white angels that negro church is preaching white nationalism but when you go to a church and you see the pastor of that church
(50:13) with a philosophy and a program that's designed to bring blank people together and Elevate blank people join that church join that church if you see where the NAACP is preaching and practicing that which is designed to uh make black nationalism materialized join inac join any kind of organization Civic religious fraternal political or otherwise that's based on lifting the black man up and making him master of his own   Community it'll be it'll be the The Ballot or it'll be the book it'll be
