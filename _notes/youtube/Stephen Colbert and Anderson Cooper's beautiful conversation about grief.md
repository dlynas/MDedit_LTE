Transcript:
You wrote me a letter after my mom died and in it you said, I hope you find peace in your grief and one of the things I've been thinking a lot about is how we don't really talk about grief and loss. People aren't comfortable talking about it and one of the things I found in the last two months since my mom died is people coming up to me on the street or reaching out to me in Instagram or wherever and sharing their grief and sharing their loss with me and I found that the most helpful thing. I found it to be the most powerful and moving thing and I kind of oddly don't want that to stop because in regular times people don't do that and you've spoken in a book about what you experience as a kid and I just I I a lot of it I didn't know I think a lot of people don't know so if you don't mind I wanted to just talk to you a little bit about it and sort of how it has shaped who you are now. Your dad was killed in Plincrash, your ten years old, along with your two brothers Peter and Paul and they were the closest brothers to you. Right. Jimmy Eddie, Mary Billy, Margot Tommy, Jay, Lulu Paul, Peter Steven. You're 11. You're 11. I'm the youngest of 11. I'm my dad died when I was 10 too and I think I mean it's such a horrible age to lose father. I can't imagine losing both my brothers at the same time as well. For me losing my dad then it changed the trajectory of my life. I'm a different person than I feel like I was meant to be and I feel like there are times I yeah. I feel like the person I remember when I was 10 I felt like I marked time and to this day I marked time between but while my dad was alive and after it's like the New Year's Year's. It's like when Paul Pot took over Cambodia without a doubt, without a doubt. Yeah, there's another guy, there's another Steve, there's a Steve Colbert, there's that kid before my father and my brother's died and it's actually kind of difficult. I've fairly vivid memories from right after they died to the present. It's continuous and contiguous, like it's all connected. There's this big break in the cable of my memory at their death. Everything before that has got an odd ghostly tone. It's like shorts of glass, like I feel like flashes. A little bit of it. Then the things that really like music because they died in September, the dad on September 11th, the dad on September 11th, the dad on September 11th, 1974 and the music from that summer leading up to it, like I will undo me in an instant. The song of the summer was banned on the run, do not play banned on their own run. Yes, you become a different person. I was personally reshattered. I was personally shattered and then you kind of reform yourself in this quiet, grieving world that was created in the house. My mother had me to take care of, which I think was sort of a gift for her of sense of purpose at that point because I was the last child. I also had her to take care of and it became a very quiet house and very dark and ordinary concerns of childhood suddenly kind of disappeared. I became, I want to say mature because that actually was kind of delayed by the death of my father. I was sort of restarting a ten, but I had certainly a different point of view than the children around me. There's a writer Mary Gordon who wrote about Fatherless girls, but I think it applies to my mom used to quote it's me all the time, but I think it applies to boys as well. And it's all paraphrase her. It's a fatherless child, things all things possible and nothing is safe. I never really understood it when my mom would say when I was lonely young, but I've come to understand it and things are possible in both the positive and the negative. Correct. Great things can happen, you know, the phone can ring in her whole life can change for better or worse. But I became what I referred to jokingly as a catastrophe because I wanted, I did not want to be surprised and hurt again. So I started sort of plunging head first into the things that scared me most. I would take survival courses in the wilderness to know that I could survive and, you know, I did not have that reaction. I read a lot of science fiction. But I have heard you say that you do believe in pushing toward things you are afraid of. You talked about standing in an elevator and having an awkward experience intentionally. That's awkwardness. That's, I suppose this is a fear involved in that. I, so your dad, guys, and your brothers who are almost as big as your dad because they're older brothers and they hung the moon in your mind. So suddenly this important thing disappears and important things suddenly lose some of their power, supposedly important things. Does me love your dad or brothers any less, but things supposedly have status, don't have status anymore. And so being willing to be ridiculous or not worrying what people thought of your status, suddenly became easier and actually the, sort of, the bits of embarrassment that you might feel about being ridiculous in public like singing out loud and an elevator full of strangers, which is an awkward and embarrassing thing to do. I would do it on purpose to get that feeling of embarrassment or kind of destruction of personal status, that protective feeling that you have, does they straight and to stay, sort of in control or well thought of. And I would purposefully embrace that awkward moment of embarrassment and it would kind of run through me like an electric little current. And I like that feeling. I think it has something to do with not thinking that anything is important, including my own embarrassment. I know you've said that's related to status. Right. Then you, I know you've said that school suddenly didn't seem important and teachers were tried out. No. I was like a great, I was like a golden child in terms of like my school. Right. One I was, but you were looking for that. I was like forget it. You blew off school, but you were reading a book a day at home. What I wanted to read though, I was reading, I was escaping into fantasy and science fiction, science fiction first and then fantasy later when somebody even told me. When you lost your, your two brothers, your dad and the boys as I knew, you referred to them. That's that it was always dad in the boys. That's how they were called dad in the boys. Peter and Paul, but dad, dad in the boys. And I knew most of your other siblings had already left. They were in college. They had their families. The row and so it was really just you and your mom. Yeah. But the most part. That is a difficult thing. That my mom, I talked to Howard Stern about this as well. You know, Howard Stern said he always sort of felt like he had to treat his mom like a Chinese cup, like a Chinese teacup, big and. And I always viewed my mom as a space alien who had landed on this planet and who ship was immobilized and I had to protect her and show her how to live in this world. And, and I felt that until the day she died. And now I look back at it and I realize one of my mom's greatest strength, which as a kid drove me bananas was how despite all, despite tragedies and losses, she was, she consciously chose to remain open and vulnerable and optimistic and believing the best in like everybody she met. And I felt like, okay, she can do that because I'm, you know, running interference and I'm scheming and plotting and, you know, willing to. Any chance that she was doing it because you were there and needed a good example? I don't think she thought those words to be honest. I'm not going to go that far. You know, she, she wasn't, you know, your mom, I think was very parental. My mom was more, she was, you know, an amazing creature. Well, because my mom was so shattered by the loss, not destroyed but shattered by the loss. We used to joke that I raised my mom after the age of 10. I completely, because I was interested. You know, in some ways, it's struck in a different way but a child's also resilient. Their worldview is not fully formed. Now my world view includes dad and your brother's time. That's part of the worldview. I'm not, my age now, which is around me is my father and my mother were when he died. I'm not sure if I could be as resilient. So I don't entirely know how she did it. I had a friend who lost someone recently, lost a child and she said, how did your mother do this? And I said, I wish she was here to tell you. But it had to do with love and then it had to do with her for loving God. And I have the crucifix on my wall that was hers. And I inherited it when she died. And she would pray to our lady and say, she knows what her sister lives a child. And her example of her faith stays with me. And that is the, we're asked to accept the world that God gives us and to accept it with love. You know, if God is everywhere and God is in everything, then the world as it is is all just an expression of God and his love. And you have to accept it with gratitude because what is the option? What is the option? It's one of things I have been touched by and sort of healed by the last two months. It's just people having real conversations with me about loss and grief and their pain. And I find it, you know, I'm a wasp, we're taught to sort of push all emotions deep down inside and pretend to have anything. It's great. But it's nice to actually kind of relate to somebody on that and talk about something other than this, this mischievous. Well, I think when you meet someone who's had a loss, you have two options. One is to say, I'm sorry for your loss, which is a perfectly lovely thing to do. But if you can share your experience, then they're not alone. Well, it's always interesting to me to have when you, you know, I bring it up, meeting somebody for the first time and they say, I'm sorry to bring it up. I, you know, and as if, what they don't realize is the person. I'm thinking about it all the time. I mean, it is as you say. Exactly. It is, you know, it's one of my arms. I mean, it is extension of who I am. Quite possibly for the rest of your life. Oh, without a doubt, it's been 31 years since my brother died. And you know, more since my dad and there's not a day that goes by, I don't think. To the point, sometimes I'll go like, why is nobody asking me about this? I don't know, it's the guy. Like my brother's died 40 years ago and sometimes I go like, how come nobody's asking me about Paul? But how would they know that? They don't know I'm thinking about him. Right. And they would be uncomfortable to ask. I actually, it's going to sound weird. But I've for a long time and probably still to this day, wish that I had a scar. I wish I had like a scar. Harry Potter. Yeah, no, like Harry Potter. More like a bonvillant. Like running down my eyes from my face, that's unavoidable for people to see. Because it would sort of, it would just be a silent signal to everybody I meet that I'm not the person I was meant to be or I'm not the person that I started out being. But you're entirely the person you were meant to be. I don't know. Maybe not. Maybe this is a warped version of of. So there's another timeline with a happier Anderson Cooper. Yeah. I mean, no, I mean, there's not. It doesn't exist in alternate universe. But yes, I guess that's what I mean about like, but that's my experience. That is your experience in the, for example, of my mother and from what I read and experience of my particular faith extremely imperfectly, admittedly, is that there isn't another timeline. And this is it. And the bravest thing you can do is to accept with gratitude the world as it is. And then, you know, as Gandalf says, so do all people who are in such times. You told an interviewer that you have learned in your words, love the thing that I most wish had not happened. I remember. You went on, say, what punishment of God or not gifts? You really believe that? Yes. It's a gift to a guest. It's a gift to exist. And with existence comes suffering. There's no escape in that. And I guess I'm either a Catholic or a Buddhist when I say those things, because I've heard those from both traditions. But I didn't learn it that I was grateful for the thing I most wish hadn't happened is that I realized it. Is that, and it's an odd, a lot of the guilty feelings. It doesn't mean you are not, I don't want it to have happened. I want it to not have happened. But if you are grateful for your life, which I think is a positive thing to do. And not everybody is. And I'm not always. But it's the most positive thing to do. Then you have to be grateful for all of it. You can't choose what you're grateful for. And then, so what do you get from loss? You get awareness of other people's loss. Well, that's true. And which allows you to connect with that other person, which allows you to love more deeply and to understand what it's like to be a human being if it's true that all human suffer. So at a young age, I suffered something so that by the time I was in serious relationships in my life with friends or with my wife or with my children is that I've some understanding that everybody is suffering. And however, imperfectly acknowledge their suffering and to connect with them and to love them in a deep way that not only accepts that all of us suffer, but also that makes you grateful for the fact that you have suffered. So you can know that about other people. And that's what I mean. It's about the fullness of your humanity. What's the point of being here and being human if you can't be the most human you can be. I'm not saying best because you're going to be a bad person and a most human. I want to be the most human I can be. And that involves acknowledging and ultimately being grateful for the things that I wish didn't happen because they gave me a gift. One of the things my mom would often say is that she said, you know, I never asked why me, why did this happen to me, she would always say why not me? Why would me be exempt from sure what has befallen? Sure. Everybody count this others over the centuries. And I think that's another thing that has helped me think, yeah, of course, why not me? This is part of being alive. I mean, the suffering is the sadness, suffering. These are all, you know, you can't have happiness without having loss and suffering. And in my tradition, that's the great gift of the sacrifice of Christ is that God does it too. That you're really not alone. God does it too. I heard you say something once, I just thought of it funny. You said that you don't proselytize because, you know, some of you, I'm going to follow it. But it's basically that you don't proselytize more Jesus for me. Exactly. I don't really really proselytize. I don't necessarily want to make any money. But you might, from my point of view, more Jesus for me. But here at the old heaven buffet. So I don't actually, even, I don't even have a well-defined enough cosmology. I have a sense of what's going to happen. But I want to talk about that gifts of God. What punishments of God are not gifts. That's actually I'm quoting Tolkien there. That's not me. That's Tolkien because in the Tolkien mythos, there are elves and men, which are the children of the Louvre Tarr, which is the one God within the Tolkien mythos. And the elves live forever. Elves live forever. They are part of the world. Whom do we know? Who's an expert on all things Lord of the Rings? Folks, when I spent my entire teenage years reading all of Tolkien. Not just the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings, I'm talking farmer giles of ham, Smith of Putin Major, Leaf by Nigel. I knew I was preparing myself for something important. Why else, what I ignore all my classwork, abandoned sports and achieve a paleness I have yet to shake off? Your mom, your mom had studied theater, wanted to be an actress. Yes. She was going to Carnegie. Was that something that she was then in Haiti for reasons I'm not sure of, which I felt- I think it was Haiti. It was in the Caribbean. And she got really sick with the tropical disease. You're like classical, like a rare tropical disease, almost like a cartoon of a disease. And she almost died. And then in that process of recovery ended up getting very, very, very, very, very, very. And instead of having acting career, she started her own theater, up and as a loved and children. And amazing. That's how it was. But did her desire to act, which was then given up to have this family? Was that something that you absorbed? It seems obvious that that would be one of my motivators that me, you know, with my mom, slash, um, ward, buddy, you know, in a way, like we became very close friends, that I would do this in some way for her. But it's just self-evident, right? Did not occur to me. Did not occur to me for many years. It really wasn't until she died that I realized a lot of what I did was still going back to, um, making her happy from those early years after a dad and the boy's died. Like we remember distinctly when she laughed for the first time, you know, like, that was like a year later or something like that. But all, you know, that's inside of you is a young person. You absorb that and digest that, but aren't necessarily aware of that until much later. I mean, when my sister Mary said a very interesting thing after that mom died, is that we were all going through this normal grief of my mother's death. And as I said after she died, like we were so lucky to have her for so long, but how long we had her to. 92, exactly, but that, you know, it might seem selfish to want more of someone you've known so long, but, you know, it merely amplifies the enormity of the room whose door is now so quietly shot. Like you can't ever open that door again. But on top of that, we realized, oh, now we also lost dad in the boys. In some ways, we were here for her because of her loss of her, her, her husband and her children. And when she went, she kind of took them with her in a way. And so we all, or at least I, and, you know, I talked to a couple of my brothers and sisters about this, but I assume it's a fairly general thing, is kind of re-experienced that. And there had been this delay dealing all of that over 40 plus years. And, and, and I realized in that moment, oh damn, I, I want to fall on a still-do comedy, because I kind of was doing this for her without, still enjoying it and having all the love and the friendship and the camaraderie up, but I realized, oh, the seed crystal was, make her laugh. Can you love your enemies? Can you love the, the people you dislike? She certainly should. You certainly should. I don't know. I suppose you can. I've seen people do it. Do you try? I've seen people do it. I don't hate. I don't, I try not to hate. Like, I people have come on the show and said, like, no, I don't know you've been trying to help. Like, no, I just don't trust the cat. And yes, I just said cat. Daddy, can you dig it? Are you happy to that seeing daddy out? Okay. Uh-huh. Yeah, I think that's how we'll handle it. Thank you. It was really a pleasure to talk to you. Nice talk to you, too. Thank you. And as a Cooper, everybody will probably back.
