## Transcript:
hello everyone
so as we are in this Yule tide
in between holidays I suppose happy
holidays to everybody and happy New Year
as well so I have been
from a number of factors I've been
inspired to focus so
in the morning routine with a morning
workout morning work morning phone calls
then to have a daily video
I'm going to be focused about this
rather than kind of the random daily
videos as interesting as they are I had
done in the past started on the nature
of order and I thought to myself
why not
the nature of order so uh
this is a book by Christopher Alexander
uh book one of four this is the first
book just go chapter by chapter and to
be very digressive to talk about this
his ideas and not limited to him to take
a a critical perspective on this and
also tie it into because when I when I
had the good the very good fortune the
great honor of speaking with Chris
Alexander about these ideas and shared
my thesis that I wrote on these ideas
with him one of the things he said
immediately which he said repeatedly is
what but what are you building
okay so I am doing that as well
livingprocess.net you can see the things
that we've designed things that are
moving forward into construction there's
a house very nice house we were happy to
work with people in the Yucatan that's
being moving forward I'm it's part of
what I'm doing today is sending those
plans out so we have a couple of new
kind of technical projects that just got
signed agreements on so without further
Ado uh let's go what what is this book
about
Christopher Alexander asked a very
simple question with very complex answer
that is is there a way
to discover
a method that anybody who's designing
could use to help make the building the
house the thing that they're designing
to help make it better and ideally to
help make it be that you start out with
the objective how can we make the best
thing possible what is the best thing
possible how do we discover that and I
think discover is the right word
so I'll start with the prologue here
and then I'll maybe go on to uh the the
preface there's the prologue then the
preface then chapter one
so the first book is called the uh
the phenomenon of life he thinks that we
need to redefine
how we think of what life is
so
he's saying that
um
when we understand the art of building
from this point of view of order it not
only changes our understanding of the
building process but has the capacity to
change our cosmology I did not start out
as a philosopher and I have no special
desire to write about philosophy or
about the nature of things
this is not my trade however he did I
think he's a pretty good writer he did a
lot of writing about this
um
moving along saying yet the problems we
must face if we are to make things
beautiful kept me coming again and again
to fundamental questions about the
nature of matter about the nature of the
empiricist tradition especially the
tradition which we ascribe to Renee
Descartes so Renee Descartes what he's
talking about there there's so many
things packed into this there's the
this book really starts with the
problems of uh industry his thesis his
dissertation uh dissertation thesis when
he was at Harvard notes on the synthesis
of form
If people really want me to get into
this book I could this is more technical
uh stay and this this is really a
statement of the problem the problem
being in the midst of the increase of
capacity of industrial production
what do we do how do we use this the the
machine separates
uh the means of production from the
immediacy of the decision in a context
there are all kinds of technical terms I
can go on about that but we'll leave it
at that for now and
so a lot of the custom fit advantages of
what in that book he called the
unself-conscious process the idea of
adapted tradition was pushed aside by
the capacity of Industry so we don't
want baby tossed out with the bath water
we don't want to somehow just go
back to all the good things and the bad
things of tradition we want to see okay
what was valuable and good about those
traditions and then also think now that
we are in an industrial situation
how do we make sure that the industrial
situation serves us instead of us
serving the industrial situation that's
a lot of what pattern language was about
so he stated the problem and notes on
since the synthesis of form an initial
framework of how to deal with these
design variable problems in pattern
language and came up with a with really
a client interaction method is what
pattern language is and we use that with
our clients our clients really like that
and then this these four books is it's
about how
you make
um so for people listening out there
um I think clients might be people who
want stuff to be built might be
interested in this generally but this is
more
this is more for people who are
designing to be to be thinking about uh
the pattern language type stuff is is
more about the dialogue of the of the
project this is about the dialogue of
the process about how you you internally
have your own design decisions optimized
and why why it's needed why it's
important
so and it gets very abstract but he
grounds it very practically so
and I think this is important because it
starts there talking about Descartes
about the way that we look at the world
about redefining what we mean life is
that life in in the book he makes a very
good argument that it is actually
extremely important and useful in the
context of industrialism to not be
limited by an idea of biological life of
biology being the limit of life but to
take more of uh more of a
subcontinental India or a a Japan
perspective or somewhat China the you
know
the
the
Neo confucianist concept of Lee the idea
of the the order in nature he called his
book the nature of order
getting a little bit rambly here we need
to focus it but
um
it's the idea that the way of looking at
the world as individuals separate from
the world instead of individuals in
dialogue with the environment around us
the idea of our feeling connected to
architecture
that's very very important making
decisions in the space which we've done
with some of our clients with great
results the idea of a home expansion and
full-scale mock-ups about where you put
that line based on how you are feeling
and sitting in the space all these
things are useful
so he says as a scientist trained in
mathematics at Trinity College Cambridge
I found that I was sometimes formulating
Concepts which were hard to believe
sometimes I felt I was betraying my
training the new principles I discovered
seemed questionable it was in many cases
even embarrassing to formulate them very
hard to allow myself to think these
thoughts I stood looking always at my
empiricist Tradition at that tradition
of thought which I learned at Cambridge
felt ashamed to be saying such things
anyway when he told his dad he wanted to
be an architect his his dad said get a
degree in mathematics first his dad was
a was from the outskirts of Vienna was a
high school a high school teacher this
was good advice
so this is very important so he's
looking at the he's discovered that
there's a block there's a mental block
in how we improve architecture that if
you're looking at the world
as humans as organic and the
architecture world as a machine which
the mental framework of Dick heart would
encourage you to do he's saying we need
to step past that and look at the whole
world as alive in some degree and things
are more alive or things are less alive
alive in a healthy way and alive in an
unhealthy way and with that awareness
where do we go from there
so he's talking about how we did the
pattern languages
um and someone had asked me he said how
do you come up with the pattern language
and that's an idea of coming up with
geometric interrelated geometric
Solutions where you where you define
good rules of thumb
where you you work with people and
understand their values and listen to
what clients want and you develop a
system of interrelated rules of thumb
which guide the design As you move
forward I think that's a good definition
of what a pattern language is someone
asked me how did you come up with a
pattern language how did you get the
actual material I said well it's not so
different from any kind any other kind
of science my colleagues and I made
observations looked to see what worked
studied it tried to distill out the
essentials and wrote them down there's a
guy that I know who actually lives
around the area here in Pasadena who's a
retired architect who studied with Chris
at UC Berkeley and said that uh in the
mid 70s as he was compiling pattern
language there would be a likely some
type of graduate research assistant
always following him around that strikes
me as a very Roman thing to do and
whenever he would think of something he
would have that person take notes
when he would think about another
element of a pattern language to be
explored later it was something his his
mind was always
on this
um I went on we did do one thing
differently we assumed from the
beginning that everything was based on
the real
nature of human feeling and this is the
unusual part
this is important this goes against he
debated Peter eisenmann very famously in
I believe 1982 at the Harvard GSD
and uh
reading that debate is instructive
because it'll it'll kind of
reflect back to people where their own
feelings are on on this debate and this
fundamental question
that was raised in that debate is
highlighted again here this is page
three of book one
I went on we did do one thing
differently we assumed from the
beginning that everything was based on
the real nature of human feeling and
that this unusual part the human feeling
is mostly the same from person to person
the same in every person of course there
is that part of human feeling where we
are all different that was eisenmann's
sticking point
each of us has our idiosyncrasies our
unique individual human character that
is the part people most often
concentrate on when they are talking
about feelings and comparing feelings
but idiosyncrasy IDI the idiosyncratic
part is really only about 10 of the
feelings which we feel one could debate
about that but
um ninety percent of our feelings I
think when you qualify this and say our
feelings about the built surroundings in
which we are if you qualify it that way
I think one could make a better argument
for that
um but the the thing is is you really
can't that that's one of the challenges
of this method is how do you quantify
how do you quantify the qualitative
that's really the challenge how do you
how do you measure feeling
very difficult you just kind of have to
look think about it talk with people
that's the best that we have now color
it's fascinating color used to be like
this color used to be just perception
and feeling similar with musical Harmony
and and we've been able we've been able
it's easier with music because you can
understand like a Pythagoras did about
the lengths of strings and half the
length of string being an octave and
then fifths being harmonious and and
thirds being
you know different
with color it was very
the feeling about color color itself was
Descartes considered color itself 100
subjective he didn't consider color to
be real turns out yes it is it's
extremely real I'm just just a
generation after Descartes Isaac Newton
started the empirical investigations
into color Gerta furthered this with
disagreeing with Newton so
science was hardly settled with color
right but now we can really objective
like color temperature
that that sounds very ooh that's out
there color temperature no it's very
empirical in fact you can get color
temperature with your with our iPhones
on a way that everybody can measure and
be roughly the same for sampling there's
still a little bit of fudging with it
but
so color has been brought
further into
objective quantitative measures now a
feeling this is fun
right there's that corner there
the type of feeling that's created by
space that we're in
I think it's pretty obvious to anybody
you can go into
you and what's a good example go into
say an Amish barn
and then go into and office made in the
70s
or maybe be a little bit more charitable
and say an office made in the 50s like a
nice one
there's a different there's a completely
different feeling that's caused by the
shape the color the acoustic the the
masses that surround you everything
and this is why architecture matters the
reason that architecture matters is this
sense of feeling engineering matters and
engineering and architecture need to be
together but the things the decisions
that are not engineering are what you
call design and that is the realm of
Architecture is those decisions and do
those things matter
I'd say yes they do they might they and
and do how does how people feel matter
absolutely so you we've been stuck for
so many decades in this big symbolic
thing that the only thing that matters
is kind of a narrative symbology that's
the post-modernist discourse
um
so
he says
from the very beginning when we made the
pattern language we concentrated on that
fact that we share a lot of human
feeling is shared especially about space
that is what the pattern language is a
record of the the shared feeling in us
which belongs to the 90 of our feeling
where our feelings are all the same when
I said this this was at a a premiere of
a documentary about him when I said this
a sort of cry went up people shouted and
clapped again stood up and cheered then
I dimly began to understand why they had
been clapping when I had come forward
when they saw what they saw in me was a
voice saying that our shared human
feeling has been forgotten hidden in the
mess of opinion and personal differences
what people find and what moves them and
all the work which my colleagues and I
have been doing for so many years is
that we have tried to honor and respect
the reality of this huge ocean the 90 of
our self in which our feelings are all
alike
the fact that this huge basis this huge
ocean has been forgotten and has perhaps
in my own Works been reawakened that is
what brought them there that day to see
that film that is what made them stand
up and shout this book is that rude
about the core of that 90 of our feeling
which we all share it is about a more
realistic conception of the world and of
the universe which comes into existence
and can come into existence only when we
acknowledge that to a very large degree
we are all the same
well that makes people very nervous
these days doesn't it
you get heard uh you get told so much
when you're in a design school or
perhaps any school about totalitarianism
and totalitarian thinking people get so
nervous about agreeing or finding an
agreement because they think that
that means people are being are being
coerced that we have to be all different
to to prevent totalitarianism but
I don't think that's true because
there's a certain kind of totalitarian
sense where what happens if someone's
telling you you're all different
you're all disconnected
you're you're an individual you're an
absolute individual just like everybody
else
and we've been living in this kind of
lonely
individualist alienation well
in terms of a project in terms of a
project it's it's a lot less dramatic
than all of this because you can simply
talk about who is uh
who's feeling what about the things in
the space there
and the whole idea of being physically
in the space makes the best answers
easiest to find
so that's been
I'd like to keep going
I think 20 minutes nearly 20 minutes is
enough so that's the preface I'm going
to get a bookmark

with something
yes
saw mark
this from the prologue then on to the
preface
so if I just go bit by bit day by day
and
as has been semi-traditional for my past
things see if anyone who cares or has
been uh guessing
it was high humidity today this morning
I think it's drier now hey Siri what's
the humidity
oh it's 66
thank you Siri
so the humidity is 66 percent
it was 80 percent in the morning
so maybe people want to to guess what I
had with my my pipe if you guessed
what's been popular lately with me with
high humidity with the Palmetto Balkan
you would be
incorrect the answer
was
the mcbaron
as McLaughlin group might say the answer
is McLaren in the Savinelli
so
I hope people can hear the uh
that is that is that is my landlord
practicing his saxophone
I feel like there should be some rambly
thoughts at the end
maybe it's self-indulgent I don't know
that's been important in some of the
other some of the other stuff
I had a stack of books that I put down
there
and there was uh the William Butler
Yates
of course the second coming is big and
dramatic in that one
turning and turning in the widening Gaia
or the Falcon cannot hear the falconer
Things Fall Apart the center cannot hold
near Anarchy is loosed upon the world
the blood dim tide is loosed and
everywhere the ceremony of innocence is
drowned
the best lack of conviction while the
worst are full of passionate intensity
it's a bit much right now really we've
had quite enough of that
but uh oh sailing to Byzantium I was
thinking about the uh the Isle of
Industry
I'll read sailing to Byzantium instead
is that the mark for industry
the lake Isle of Industry yes I have
that one marked too
I feel more like reading innisfree at
the moment
so in terms of uh being connected to
feeling and why we build things the way
we do as it's called sentiment and in
that case being sentimental is important
so
the lake Isle of innisfree
I will arise and go now and go to
Industry
and a small cabin build there of clay
and wattles made
nine Bean rows will I have there a hive
for the honeybee
and live alone in the bee loud Glade
and I shall have some peace there for
peace comes dropping slow dropping from
the veils of the morning to where the
cricket sings
their midnights all a glimmer and noon a
purple glow and evening full of the
linet swings
I will arise now
I screwed it up
I will arise and go now
so you gotta take it back this this is
the gonna be strict with Yates and
evening full of the Linux wings I will
arise and go now for always night and
day I hear Lake water lapping with low
Sounds by the shore
while I stand on the roadway or on the
pavement's gray I hear it
in the Deep heart's core
written 1890
he actually wasn't he I don't think
Yates ever went to Industry it was a
totally imaginary poem he was I believe
he was neither in Dublin or Belfast I
think it was Dublin
and he saw a tourist poster tourist
poster for this island of of Industry
is probably feeling
torn up about someone and
just just imagined to step out
of the uh the gray and the noise of
Dublin
but Dublin's very nice I've never been
there
it's one of the good cities of the world
so
tomorrow morning
it will be
waking up breakfast exercise
and uh
the next bit
of the uh the nature of order
probably with lots of comments about
Louis Sullivan Frank Lloyd Rye Walter
gropius meets Van Der rohe all this uh
all this stuff about about architecture
and uh I would definitely appreciate to
respond to questions as we go along
so
there's going to continue to be content
about the Rome course
but we can make new courses about all
kinds of things
like share and subscribe down below
thank you very much
um yes anyone who's listened this far
thank you for indulging me and hopefully
this will continue to be to be
interesting and worthwhile
have a good day
