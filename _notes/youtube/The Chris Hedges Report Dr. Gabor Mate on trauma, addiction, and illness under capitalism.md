Transcript:
(00:02) now you talk about Terror what about for me I've been terrorized all my days  Dr gabar mate in his new book The Myth of normal trauma illness and healing in a toxic culture which he wrote with his son Daniel argues that what is defined as normal in a consumer Society is at war with basic human needs the engine of capitalism defined by The Cult of the self thrives on the fostering of psychological and physical chronic disorders including high blood pressure diabetes anxiety depression addictions and suicide it rewards the core traits
(01:06) of psychopaths superficial charm grandiosity and self-importance a need for constant stimulation a pension for lying deception and manipulation and the inability to feel remorse or guilt personal style and personal advancement are mistaken for individualism equated falsely with Democratic equality we have a right in the cult of the self to get whatever we desire we can do anything even belittle and destroy those around us including our friends to make money to be happy and to become famous once Fame and wealth are achieved
(01:43) they become their own justification their own morality how one gets there is irrelevant the consequence of this dark ethic Dr Monte illustrates plays out on our bodies severely damaging our psyches and pushing us towards individual and social self-annihilation joining me to discuss his new book is Dr gaboramate Who has written several best-selling books including in the realm of hungry ghosts close encounters with addiction when the body says no exploring the stress disease connection and Scattered Minds the origins and
(02:20) healing of attention deficit disorder so I said before we went on the air this is a book that could have easily been three or four books so your readers are uh are rewarded um you write uh that uh most of us are in the grip of what you call a distant past a kind of psycho emotional Time Warp that prevents us from inhabiting the present moment this is what the psychotherapist Peter Levine calls the tyranny of the past can you explain this process yes first of all thank you for moving on your broadcast in my own life
(02:59) um coming to reflect on my many of my behaviors I've had to realize that often I wasn't reacting to the present I was reacting to some interpretation on the present based on Old traumatic programming for my Early Childhood so often when I get upset say my relationship with my spouse the degree of upset is not related to anything that's occurring right now but it's some dark pain or wound which is what trauma means based on a sense of having been rejected or not being loved or not being accepted when I was a very young infant
(03:35) and so that's what Peter means by The Eternity of the past that that the past colors are the Buddha said once that with our minds we basically create the world but what it didn't say is that before with our minds we create the world the world creates our minds so that the mind in fact the very brain itself including the physiology of the brain is programmed very early in childhood by our earliest relationships with our caregivers beginning In Utero and those imprints govern a lot of our behaviors even into adulthood
(04:06) well you write about it one of the things I liked about the book was it's honesty you give voice to uh your wife and your son and are quite Frank and I think Courageous about your own failings as a father we all have them it's painful to confront that we failed in some way those uh we love um and I wondered if you could just uh for people who don't know your story just tell us quickly what that trauma it is in the book but what that trauma that you endured was so in a large historical context the
(04:44) trauma was that I was born in January 1944 in Budapest two months before the Nazis occupied Hungary which is when the genocide began two months after I was born now the day after the Germans March into Budapest my mother phoned the pediatrician I was two months of age and she said would you please come and see Gabor because he's crying all the time and the doctor said of course that will come but I should tell you all my Jewish babies are crying so that infants and this is too you don't have the war on genocide for this
(05:18) infants absorb the stresses of their parents and that is an impact on their nervous systems so I spent the first year under predictably difficult even life-threatening circumstances which culminated with my mother gave me a total stranger in the street in Budapest because where we were living I would not have survived so I didn't see her for five or six weeks of course an infant can only abandon experience that as an abandonment and who gets abandoned somebody's not lovable somebody's not wanted so my sense of self on a deep
(05:50) unconscious level or somebody who's not lovable who's not wanted and that then leads to all kinds of behaviors in adulthood um not to mention that for the whole year I'm absorbing the stresses and Terrors of my mother which infants and children being narcissistic in the sense that they think it's all about them naturally I think she's suffering so much it must be my fault so this is too many sense of guilt and shame that comes with trauma it does not take historical trauma of those proportions it doesn't
(06:24) take war with genocide in a variant with my mother's described when I'm two weeks old before there were Nazis before the Germans occupied Hungary just how she was following doctor's orders not to pick me up and feed me when I was asking for it because then the ethic was you feed on schedule not on the child's demand that itself is a trauma but what message do I get is a two recall that my needs aren't important that I'm alone that the person who loves me doesn't care enough about
(06:54) me to pick me up and that kind of trauma is very common in all societies so I just don't want to create the impression that trauma is only under dramatic circumstances such as I endured as an engine well you're writing the book about your mother's instincts so that she didn't like it and and of course I think much of your book is a kind of Celebration or holding up those instincts against uh modern medicine or modern uh Psychotherapy the psychiatrist basil uh Vander called in uh excuse me yes Bessel Van Der kolk in uh
(07:32) the body keep score he writes that trauma is when we are not seen and known and you build on this idea uh the trauma is a fracturing of the self of one's relationship to the world you define this fracturing as the essence of trauma what do you mean by fracturing of the self and how does this fracturing work well so autonomy is owned uh wounding a psychic wound and you can loan people in two major ways you might say by doing terrible things to them such as the abuse that many people endure in childhood whether
(08:10) at home or in school  um but the other way you can hurt people is just not to meet their needs now one of the essential needs of human children I mean I'm talking about essential need in a sense that if it's not met the child suffers is to be seen and accepted for exactly who they are nine vessels words if you're not seen that hurts you because a child's develop a child develops their self-image their self-concept based on how he's seen and treated by the adults around them if the adults themselves are too limited to
(08:42) stress too traumatized to preoccupied to see the child in a child's fullness with all their emotions the child will develop a very limited sense of themselves so that's part of their fracturing um first of all first of all secondly when you're not being seen or worse if you're being hurt or abused it's just too painful to be in your own body and to expand your own emotions so literally as a survival adaptation quite unconsciously the child will cut off their sense of feeling their their gut feelings and they even disconnect
(09:17) from their bodies so that disconnection and fracturing the self which is the essence of trauma happens if you're not seen and accepted just who you are even more so if you're if you're hurt you've long argued that addiction is an outcome of childhood trauma uh you say this is based on or shame based view of ourselves a kind of negative self-percession a perception a loss of compassion for oneself you write I'm quoting the more severe the trauma the more total that loss can you talk about the loss and its effects
(09:56) sure so for 12 years I worked as a physician in Vancouver's downtown east side which is I don't know if you've ever been here because I have I have yeah and I have gone down to the east side yeah so it's shocking for people coming from even from the ghettos the United States so there's no North America's most concentrated area of drug use and in 12 years of work down there I never met a single female patient who had not been sexually abused as a child and all the men had been severely abused sometimes
(10:26) sexually sometimes in other ways neglected and so on not by accident thirty percent of our clients done every indigenous First Nations Canadians they make up five percent of the population they're also the most traumatized segment of the Canadian population a shocking fifty percent of the women in jail in our country are indigenous they make up five percent of the female population so what that trauma does is it Hollows out the self because again it's too painful to be connected to the self and that pain will break through and
(10:59) there's a sense of emptiness because the sense of fulfillment as a human being needs to come from within it needs to come from an Embrace of oneself as one is but when it's treated that badly one ends up rejecting oneself as the flawed hurt not hurt as a flawed deficient individual so underneath Ultra all trauma is a shame-based view of oneself and that shame is searing now all addictions are an attempts to escape from pain so I don't care if you're addicted to gambling or sex or shopping or the
(11:36) internet of self-cutting or eating or drugs or alcohol it's all about soothing the pain of that shame soothing the pain of what you endured and when that pain breaks through you have to soothe the pain by some addictive behavior so that's what I meant there so underneath addiction people think that they're ashamed of themselves because they're addicted it's at least as much the other way around they're addicted because they're so ashamed of themselves well you write about how consumer
(12:08) Society plays on this uh you say that if trauma entails a disconnection from the self then it makes sense to say that we are being collectively flooded with influences that both exploit and reinforce this trauma these are your words work pressures multitasking social media news updates multiplicities of entertainment sources these all induce us to become lost in our thoughts frantic activities gadgets meaningless conversations were caught up in Pursuits of all kinds that draw us on not because they are necessary or
(12:44) inspiring or uplifting or because they enrich or add meaning in our lives to our lives but simply because they obliterate the present those are your words so that passage reminded me of the lines from wh auden's poem September 1st uh 1939 faces along the bar cling to the average day the lights must never go out the music must always play all the conventions conspire to make this furniture make this fort assume the furniture of home at least we should see where we are lost in a haunted wood children afraid of the
(13:20) night who have never been happy or good I should have just published the book with that poem on it and forgot everything else because he he says it all you know yeah um well there are two classes of people who confuse their two large classes of people who confuse their desires with their needs one of them is young children when they want something they think they need it and they're desperate if they don't get it in the in the hands of healthy adults one learns that needs are not the same as desires the other class of people who confuse
(13:53) their desires with their needs of course are addicts of all kinds I need to go shopping I need to I have a drink you know these aren't needs these are desires but consumer Society is based on made in making an addicts out of everybody to confuse our need our desires with our needs it it's this is the Catholic monk whose work I'm sure you're familiar with Thomas Merton said you know the whole society is geared to um raising our need our desires to this fever pitch so that we can be consuming the products of the film studios and and
(14:32) all the other factories and and so a whole consumerism is based on creating false needs and if we weren't at this fever pitch of Desire all the time we wouldn't buy all the stuff that we buy Norwood will be you know coasting on the internet to fill every moment because we're so empty and we're so afraid of ourselves that we have to distract ourselves from our own Presence by whatever means now if you look on the internet or on YouTube for example what gets seen by millions there's a recently Eli
(15:10) Manning the former New York Times New York Jets was it no Giants um a quarterback went to this college and he uh pretended to be some somebody he wasn't then you know it doesn't matter it's trivial 11 million views in three weeks now how much does the average person so the average person in America knows a whole lot about what quarterbacking strategy the Denver Broncos or the you know the Tampa Bay Buccaneers should be pursuing and there's big discussions about this what does it matter to anybody
(15:47) but as as the average American or Canadian to Sting the string to intelligent sentences together about the history of Afghanistan or the history of Ukraine or even about climate change they're not able to do it so the whole society is designed the whole culture is designed to draw our attention away from and make us believe of what's important and make us believe that what's trivial is actually essential and that's both a consumer strategy but it's also a propaganda imperative well you write about the dopamine hits
(16:25) and and there's a constant need because you get a high but then you fall into a low and you get you need another hit and that consumer Society depends on this uh Pleasure Principle if we want to quote Freud uh uh but in fact of course what makes us content uh what provides Joy uh is outside of that kind of self-destructive Behavior absolutely and and and it's it's um this Society is perfectly I would say design but it's not actually designed I mean yes you and I know it's not that there aren't conspiracies at the top and in
(17:07) all aspects of corporate life but the whole thing is not a conspiracy as such it's like almost a self-organizing um organism that on the one hand deprives of our genuine needs as children and as the young people so that we create false needs to which you can cater so Society both creates these false needs and then creates an economy that caters to them in fact the economy couldn't survive is the way it is if it wasn't based on false needs so it's a it's a perfect mechanism and it couldn't have
(17:40) been designed better to sustain itself at the cost of human health of course and human life even I want to talk on about passing on trauma that's something that I've had to deal with uh that when we don't resolve that trauma you write in ourselves uh you say the home becomes a place where we unwittingly recreate scenarios reminiscent of those that wounded us when we were small can you talk about how this trauma is passed down you know I'm reminded of a statement of Primo Levy I don't know if you've read
(18:17) Primo of course he's one of the great writers one of the very very few great writers actually on the side he wasn't somebody who sentimentalized anything and he said at some point in one of his books um the last night we create in our homes the same conditions as existed in the camps and that may seem like a shocking statement because how can you possibly compare the two but in terms of wounding children you again you don't need those dramatic historical circumstances so I talked about my own formative year the first
(18:50) year of my life in the sense that I got I was lovable and wanted well the way I compensated for that in part was to go to medical school because when you go to medical school um you get a sense of self-importance and it's very traumatic to go to medical school but you come out of it with a lot of power and a lot of knowledge that makes you indispensable to the world and now they're going to want you all the time and the Beeper is always going every time the people goes you get a dopamine it oh they want me I'm so
(19:18) important but it's addictive because it never fills the emptiness inside so I'm a workaholic physician you know I mean and I'm carrying my depressions and anxieties and so on uh but not on the job they come out at home but what message do my kids get when that is not around because he's always busy looking after the people or when he is home he's kind of depressed and and more rules same message I got that they're not wanted and this is a middle class Vancouver British Columbia home in a leafy lovely
(19:53) neighborhood you know not no circumstances of abuse or deprivation or War and yet my children are getting the same answer Dragon you know so this is what we pass it on unwittingly and not because we don't love our kids and not because we don't do our best but simply because the best is constrained and informed by our own and result trauma and most of us so many of us we have children remember very young before we actually have resolved or even recognized our traumas yes I mean that was something I've dealt
(20:25) with I remember helping my kids build a gingerbread house when they were little and then just without thinking and I said let's play Bosnia and Burn It Down um you say that all illnesses if not psychosomatic in origin have psychosomatic components and there are long passages in the book where you tie trauma of individuals often childhood trauma to a variety of diseases you argue that confronting the underlying trauma often mitigates and even at times eradicates the disease stress you say may disable our immune systems capacity to control
(21:06) and eliminate malignancy that's a big topic and people are going to have to buy the book which they should do but can you touch on that yeah I've discussed this in a previous book of mine which you mentioned when the body says no but this is what's this is what's so frustrating Chris is that I'm talking here not about conjecture or intuition I'm talking about science so in 18 in 1860s or 70s whenever it was John John the French neurologist who first described and multiple sclerosis said that this is a stressive and
(21:39) disease stress driven disease James pager a British surgeon around the same time talked about breast cancer in women and and how it's inescapable to link between emotions and breast cancer it's truly mostly one of the founding physicians at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore said in 1890s I think that rheumatoid arthritis was a stress different disease without going into in in 1938 a great lecture at Harvard a physician whose name is still honored at Harvard in a research day named after him Dr somal Weiss myself
(22:16) like myself from Hungary he said that emotional factors are at least as important in the causation of illness as physical hormones and should be at least as important in the treatment this lecture was published in the Journal of the American on American Medical Association now they had no signs to back it up they just had their intuition since then we've had 80 years of science showing their relationship between emotions and and Physiology because you can't separate the Mind from the body scientifically speaking you cannot
(22:45) separate the Mind from the body and the emotional apparatus is part and parcel of the same system that runs the immune apparatus as well so when I say psychosomatic I'm not meaning imagined I mean literally the Oneness of psyche and Soma the the mind and the emotional circuits of the body and the Brain with the physiology of the rest of the body so is this what you mean by neurogenic inflammation well nutrient inflammation simply means that the nervous system can trigger inflammation in the body and inflamic
(23:18) and and of course the nervous system is easy to demonstrate is very much influenced by emotions I mean you have a certain emotional state your nervous system changes by definition and so that and that can initiate inflammation about it's a recent study a little bit of three weeks ago showed that the single episode of racism will instigate inflammation in the body and suppress the immune system so that everything is psychosomatic in that sense not in the sense of Imagine but that the psyche is influencing the Soma because they're one
(23:49) system long-term stress long-term release of stress hormones like cortisol suppresses the immune system makes it less able to resist malignant transformation and also can turn the immune system against oneself so that one has more of a chance of developing autoimmune disease which not surprisingly who's most prone for women of color because they they're women so they're more stressed or gender reasons and of color because they're more stressed because of racial racial racial racist reasons so the more um
(24:24) intersection there is of gender and race the more autoimmune disease you have it's strict science and the frustrating part of it is the average medical student doesn't get a single lecture on any of this stuff despite the voluminous science it's incredible the gap between science and Medical Practice on pages 101 and 102 you drop a list of Personality features that you share most often present in people with chronic illnesses what are the traits and why do so many chronically ill people have those traits
(25:02) yes so in Family Practice which I pursued for 22 years I think Senator incentive which also was the medical coordinator of the palliative care unit at Vancouver hospital I noticed that who got sick and who didn't wasn't accidental and as a family physician I did an advantage over my specialist colleagues and I knew my patients as people I knew them before they got sick I knew them in their families of origin I knew them in their multi-generational family context so I began to notice that people had developed chronic illness had certain
(25:36) character traits these were an automatic regard for the emotional needs of others like knowing their own rigid identification with the duty role and responsibilities so in other words their Duty are in the world their responsibility out there rather than who they were as individuals a repression of healthy anger healthy anger is a distinction between rage and unhealthy and healthy anger and finally um two fatal beliefs that one is responsible for other people feel and one was never disappoint anybody now these traits it's not again fancy for
(26:13) how they lead to honest because they all impose tremendous stress on individual I mean if you've ever been angry and if you know what a perturbation of the nervous system and the visceral anger involves imagine not feeling anger what energetic demand it is to repress the anger so much so you don't even feel it so you want these really nice people that never gets angry it's a tremendous um diversion of body energy that wears on the immune system and the nervous system so is that is that long-term stress then that leads to the illness
(26:47) not these traits cause the illness but these traits make you much more prone to be stressed without even you knowing it and therefore you're more prone to illness it's a very straightforward correlation I see that play out in the prison because my students in the prison cannot express anger to the guards yeah and you have uh it's just an epidemic diabetes hypertension yeah heart disease everything because of course they if they express that anger they're immediately punished yeah um yeah and no
(27:18) wonder you see like like James Baldwin once said I think that to be an American black is to be a constant state of suppressed anger yes and and the question is what to do with that anger it's no wonder that black American males have a much higher risk of high blood pressure it's got nothing to do with genetics their genetic relatives in Africa do not have the same as it has to do with uh the stress of being American black and not being allowed to be angry I want to talk about the tension or the clash between uh what you call two
(27:51) essential needs attachment and authenticity you call this ground zero for the most widespread form of trauma in our society can you explain that idea sure so attachment is simply the drive to be close to somebody for it's it's it's a biological instinctive psychological drive that's part of our evolutionary Heritage and we share that with other mammals because without attachment the drive to be close between parent and infant no mammalian infant would survive so we're simply wired for it and
(28:27) especially the young child is wired to attach because without that attachment there's just no life period now we also have another need as well which is what I call authenticity and that's consuming the word Auto for the self and uh being in touch with our feelings knowing what we feel and being able to act on that now don't forget we have all daughter in nature for millions of years and for hundreds of thousands of years until a blink of an eye ago inhuman even in existence of our own species believe
(28:58) that in nature how long does any creature survive in nature if they're not in touch with their gut feelings and that's what I mean by authenticity it's been connection with our bodies and our emotions however according to much of the toxic parenting advice that is doled out the tiger mom and and emiliosters Parenting by the numbers you know it's designed to teach parents to ignore their planning instincts and if a child shows up angry for example they should be made to sit by themselves so they
(29:35) come back to normal according to a very famous psychologists told her name who will blessedly remain unnamed in this program but it's Canadian he's named in your book isn't he his name's in my book and he says that an angry child should be made to sit by themselves until they come back to normal so anger in a child is not normal I can use for that psychologist anger is built into our brain as one of our essential brain circuits because it's an important boundary defense now if a child gets the message or
(30:03) Hillary Clinton who I talk about who runs into her mother's home at age four seeking protection from bullies and she's told there's no room for cards in this house do you get out there and deal with it when a child natural fear is not acceptable and a jazz desire for help is not acceptable when the child's natural anger is not acceptable the child's decision to make am I going to be authentic and be rejected by my parents or should I reject myself and be accepted my parents by my parents well
(30:38) the tragic tension invariably gets resolved in favor of attachment and a person adaptively suppresses their authenticity but then that becomes a lifelong Paradigm and we allow we live out of a fun sense of self we don't know what we feel we dare not ask for help um be there not say no at the demands of the world and that makes us sick so that's what the tragic tension is and a lot of people when they get sick they actually learn to be themselves and when they do not just as documented by myself but by others as well there's a much
(31:13) better chance for health yeah I think this is why you write that uh the personality traits we come to believe are us and perhaps even take pride and actually Bear the scars of where we lost connection to ourselves I'm going to stop there I want to thank the real news network and its production team Cameron grenadino Adam Coley Dwayne Gladden and Kayla Rivera you can find me at chrisedges.substack.
