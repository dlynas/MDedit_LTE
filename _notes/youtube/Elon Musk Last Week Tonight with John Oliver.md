Transcript:
(00:05) we're going to dive straight in with our main story tonight this is our final show of the year so we thought we'd focus on someone who's had a pretty big 12 months Elon Musk a man who can pull off pretty much any bad guy in a movie look there's a Lex Luther posing for the cover of metropolis Maniacs monthly there's why no Mr Bond I and my child bride expect you to die there's I just bought your media company I'm about to strip you for parts there's spaces first racist sheriff and finally the less
(00:32) reimagining of Billy Zayn's character in Titanic truly the man has range Elon has made news all year from test launching the most powerful rocket ever built to just this week having to recall two million cars due to safety concerns he even challenged Mark Zuckerberg to a cage fight to which Zuckerberg replied send me location and may I suggest to both of them interior volcano and then of course there is Twitter he now calls it X but the rest of us still call it Twitter he officially acquired it 12 months ago and
(01:07) since then it has been one Fiasco after another with the most recent coming when he tweeted his agreement with this anti-semitic post calling the great replacement Theory the actual truth that caused many big advertisers to flee and then in the midst of denying any anti-semitic intent Elon decided to taunt the sponsors who had left don't advertise you don't want them to advertise no what do you mean if somebody's going to try to Blackmail me with advertising blackmail me with money go yourself but go
(01:45) yourself is that clear I hope it is wow it is hard to say what's most embarrassing there the fact that the world's richest man is's playing the you're not breaking up with me I'm breaking up with you card or that he's doing it to confused silence while wearing a jacket from Ralph Lauren's midlife crisis collection he's clearly going for bad boy there but ended up looking more like red pilled chip from Rescue Rangers now that clip actually made the rounds but for my money this exchange a
(02:14) few seconds later is even better no actually what what this advertising boycott is uh is is going to do it's going to kill the company and you think that I but and the whole world will know that those advertisers killed the company and we will document it in great detail but there those advertisers I imagine are going to say they're going to say we didn't kill the company oh yeah they're going to say tell to tell it to Earth let's see how Earth responds to that yeah tell it to Earth and I
(02:47) honestly hope he does that I hope he tries telling every living creature on the planet including those weird deep sea fish all about how Advertiser boycotts are going to kill Twitter just so one of them can open its objectively horrifying jaws and say Yeah man cuz you said that weird about juice we live in a black void and even we understand the order of operations here and look I could talk for hours about what Elon has done to Twitter many in the media do because it's where they spend most of their work days but the truth is it's
(03:16) not the most important thing Elon is in charge of it's arguably not even the most important social networking site we all know the only social media app that matters these days is the comment section of venmo that is where the real drama is what musk's time at Twitter has definitely changed is how many people perceive him because for a long time he was seen as a one of a kind genius who'd save humanity and was described as a real life iron man it's a comparison that he even welcomed Cameo as himself
(03:46) in Iron Man 2 although I never really liked those comparisons as far as I'm concerned the only real life iron man is Troy Herby who spent his entire life designing a suit of armor that could withstand a grizzly bear attack and was kind enough to film the tests are you ready Troy I'm ready here it comes yes that is the hero we deserve that is my Iron Man still for a long time elon's Public Image was that of a Maverick celebrity inventor who cut through red tape revolutionized space travel and made electric cars cool and
(04:25) he does do a lot in addition to Twitter he's the head of five other companies Tesla SpaceX the boring company neuralink and xai and thanks to their roller coaster fortunes he can claim the twin distinctions of being both the richest person in the world and the first person ever to lose $200 billion which is hard to even wrap your head around it's like hearing someone won a marathon after accidentally running 200 miles in the wrong direction and to hear Elon tell it he's been doing this at least in part to
(04:55) benefit Humanity he recently said of Tesla I've done more for the envir enironment than any single human on earth demonstrating a pretty strong Messianic streak in fact samman the CEO of open AI who's both worked with and clashed with Musa said Elon desperately wants the world to be saved but only if he can be the one to save it which is a pretty big asterisk it's like Jesus says in the Book of Matthew love thy neighbor but more importantly me and if you don't you find your own Heaven Jay Grizzle out and I know there are people
(05:29) who love Elon and people who utterly hate him and there are going to be parts of this piece that irritate both groups there are also people who would understandably rather just ignore him but as you will see we might have passed the point where that is an option for any of us so tonight let's look at Elon Musk and let's start with how he earned his business genius reputation I'm going to skip over the early years the growing up in aparte South Africa then immigrating to the US via Canada during his college Years you can read any
(05:57) number of books on that or just ask your next bump Umble date who turned up in a fedora and a released the SN cut T-shirt ready to spend the entire night talking about it Elon first earned his fortune from creating a company called zip 2 with his brother before going on to help run PayPal alongside Peter teal and if I could only have been a fly on that wall I'd have flown straight into a hot light bulb he then invested that personal Fortune into space x a company that would create and launch its own rockets
(06:26) and spacecraft and that is a pretty gutsy move to go from an online payment system to literal rocket science although as some point out SpaceX wasn't exactly starting from Square One what SpaceX has been very successful at is taking basically off-the-shelf technology stuff that was developed by NASA 50 years ago and streamlining it so in that way he's kind of the Henry Ford of of of space because Henry Ford didn't invent the automobile he just figured out how to make the automobile you know commercially viable yeah like Henry Ford
(06:59) Elon Musk managed to build on the technology that others had invented uh that's not actually the only way he's like Henry Ford which you'd know if you ever Googled either of their names in the word anti-Semitism but let's not get ahead of ourselves here the point is musk took a big risk on starting a rocket company which nearly didn't work his first three attempts to launch one failed and then he made a truly audacious gamble when you had that third failure in a row did you think I need to
(07:27) pack this in never why not I don't ever give up 8 weeks later musk bet the company on another flight we have lift off and this time around everything worked perfect if that fourth launch hadn't worked that would have been it um we would have not had the resources to mount a fth you couldn't have gone on at that point we it yes death would have been I think inevitable that is genuinely impressive although I will say there are less weird ways to say we would have gone out of business then death is inevitable phrasing matters
(08:04) it's why people say we just had a baby instead of Lisa life out of her HOA same meaning different feeling and that Trend continued through spacex's subsequent effort something that as this former head of NASA points out is not something that they would ever be able to get away with if we lost rockets at the rate that that that Elon Musk loses his big Starship would have been out of business Congress would have shut us down if we lost one Starship let alone six or however many it's been we can't do that right the US government
(08:41) can't waste billions of dollars just blowing things up in the vague hope that it'll somehow turn into a success unless of course those things are Iraq or Afghanistan so SpaceX began with a big gamble had a flirtation With Disaster and then became a massive success and that patent persisted with Tesla that company was was funded in part by pre-selling cars to Future owners only to run into repeated production delays and spiraling costs just watch musk at one meeting of those early buyers where he told them that the price had gone up
(09:12) on the cars that they'd already bought we took faith in you and now you're just turning around and changing the price on us not telling us and then we find out about backwards and now we're kind of V hurt because we weren't told we can't sell cars for you know less than they cost us to produce if if anything more behind more than that it could than it was an accident there's a bunch of comments after it that all okay there seemed to be a little bit of Anger from some people in the room um
(09:44) who felt that we' kind of done a bait and switch uh and I mean that's that's sort of a little bit true that there was a bit of a bait and switch I mean it's uh that that's I mean kind of what happened it was very tough yeah you could see how baiting customers with one price and switching it for another might be considered a bait and switch there's actually a great econ book on the subject entitled words mean what words mean and yet Tesla is now a big success with factories on three continents
(10:15) delivering over a million Vehicles a year meanwhile SpaceX is currently valued around 150 billion making one of the most valuable private companies in the world although it is worth noting that his boldness sometimes comes with a tendency to overpromise and show off products long before they are ready like in 2019 when mus decided to demonstrate how indestructible his new Cyber truck was by having its chief designer Chuck a steel ball at its window Bron could you try to break this glass   please
(10:52) yeah sure yeah oh my well maybe that was a little too hard yeah not great but also kind of charming I'll be honest there is something I kind of like about the Cyber truck I mean I don't want to own one or drive near one it's basically a £7,000 smooshed up refrigerator moving at 60 M an hour being driven by odds are a real piece of but there is something appealing about a man so passionate about his idea that he's willing to ignore questions about Aesthetics performance durability practicality safety and who on Earth actually want to
(11:29) spend up to $100,000 to drive every child's first attempt at drawing a car and build it anyway and that's not his only embarrassing product launch two years ago he introduced a Tesla robot by showcasing a prototype that was just a dancer in a robot bodysuit and it was exactly as dumb as that sounds  I absolutely love it apparently all you have to do to launch a robotics company is invest in a spandex bodysuit and a dancer so with that in mind behold my new creation the robot race is on Elo the race is on look at him go okay okay
(12:24) enough enough robot enough enough enough enough you you can power down Rob thank you for your service look embarrassing moment aside there is a lot to like about elon's companies SpaceX has made real achievements like reusable rocket technology and making space easier and more affordable to access and Tesla has pushed automakers to take electric cars seriously in a way that would have seemed impossible 20 years ago but as one of elon's critics points out there are costs to that progress that often get overlooked is
(12:57) Elon Musk a net positive for society I would argue he is I think the EV race is a great thing space exploration is really hopeful and just kind of inspiring the problem is with the word net and that is once we decide an individual or a company is a net good for society we don't want to hold him or the company accountable for anything right even if you think Elon is a net positive it doesn't mean that we shouldn't talk about the that he's doing along the way and let's start with his employees many of whom have called Elon
(13:34) a nightmare to work for and not just at Twitter where he fired most of the staff and ordered the rest to work in quote extremely hardcore mode he's been like this at every company is this early employee at SpaceX will attest it was not unusual to have a phone call from him at 3: in the morning on your cell phone you better by God have that next to your bed to answer he's just gone into yelling fits against me telling me I'm stupid and I don't know what I'm talking about and and I've seen him do
(14:02) it to other very intelligent people so he'll definitely find your weakness in your personality in your in your character in your in your spirit and uh I wouldn't say exploit it but you you'll definitely uh crack well that sounds unpleasant not just your boss calling to abuse you but because there are only two reasons someone should be calling you at 3: in the morning and they are because a a loved one is having an emergency and need your help or your house is on fire and even then that could have been a
(14:33) text and the Damage isn't just emotional workers at his factories complain of immense pressure and unrealistic deadlines a report a few years ago on his Tesla Factory in Fremont California found employees complaining that style and speed trumped safety and that workers there have been sliced by Machinery crushed by forklifts burned in electrical explosions and sprayed with molten metal one worker even claimed that she'd been told Elon didn't want signs or anything yellow like caution tape in the factory which isn't good
(15:03) because caution tape is important it lets people know something might be dangerous and unstable like a skull and crossbones on a bottle or this jacket on a middle-aged M now now Tesla does deny that but its claims about its factories can be hard to verify even when Regulators try to get involved at musk's companies they can be strongly resisted for example his Nevada Giga Factory at one point denied entry to State Osan inspectors for nearly 3 months which is ridiculous the word gigafactory alone should be enough to Warrant an
(15:33) immediate inspection but it's not just workers who mus is willing to put at risk sometimes it's his own customers he's long been developing self-driving car technology and has sometimes knowingly exaggerated its capabilities the two pieces of software available are called autopilot and full self-driving but despite their names neither system can drive a car on its own yet in this 2016 ad it appears to be doing just that Amplified by the the introductory text that Elon personally asked for which reads the car is driving itself but that
(16:04) was extremely misleading it was driving along a pre-planned route it was only self-driving the way that your nana self-drives herself up and down the stairs and Tesla will note they tell drivers they should keep their hands on the wheel and take over if anything goes wrong and I sure hope drivers do that because he's been inviting them to try out full self-driving in beta mode basically having drivers find the bugs in new software even on complicated city streets and with predictable results we're going to make this left
(16:38) turn and I'm getting honked at I just but now it just turn right we're supposed to go left Ogen is not a professional test driver nor is he a Tesla employe instead he's one of the over 50,000 customers that Tesla has allowed to access FSD beta we just ran a red light we just ran a red light that is pretty alarming especially the moment where you see people pushing a stroller way too close to that car because even if Tesla drivers volunteered to take part in this high stakes experiment the people around them sure didn't no one
(17:16) got a push alert on their phone saying hey Tesla here please consent to take part in the beta test that's currently hurtling towards you do hurry time is a factor and musk have taken a pretty blly attitude towards self-driving ding deaths in 2016 when concerns were first emerging he told reporters that if they wrote stories that dissuaded people from using autonomous Driving Systems or Regulators from approving them then they would be killing people essentially arguing that any deaths in the present day will be more than offset by lives
(17:45) saved later and just this week when the Washington Post noted that they tallied about 40 fatal or serious crashes involving Tesla's driver assistant software Tesla responded by saying we believe it is morally indefensible not to make these systems available to a wider set of consumers given the incontrovertible data that shows it's saving lives and preventing injury but rather than producing that data it promised more detailed information will be publicly available in the near future which I'm sorry is just not data
(18:13) behavior and that is coming from TV's number one data anyone who collects incontrovertible data would give you a more specific date than the near future because data as we all know are also calendar and look I know myself and look history is littered with titans of business who were shitty or broken people from Thomas Edison through Henry Ford through Steve Jobs the difference is by and large they didn't open up their brain to let the whole world have a constant look inside but Elon does and the glimpses we get can be terrifying
(18:48) and that brings us back to Twitter musk has been a heavy user four years putting out classic tweets like I put the art in fart 69 days after 420 20 again haha and technically alcohol is a solution which technically isn't a joke and his biographer will tell you he's addicted to the app to a genuinely problematic extent one day he was traveling with a friend Antonio gracias and musk had kept tweeting late at night doing these ridiculous tweets sometimes very harmful ones and so the friend said let me take
(19:22) your phone and I'm going to put it in the safe here in the hotel room friend punches in the code and said that way you can't use it late at night at 3:00 in the morning musk calls hotel security to get him to open the safe and he starts doing tweets he was addicted to tweeting look I am sure when the average security guard is called up to a Billionaire's hotel room at 3:00 a.m.
(19:44) they have a list of things to expect and it begins and ends with dead body so it must have been a pleasant surprise when he wheeled an empty garbage bin into the room I he finded Elon Musk punching random numbers into his hotel safe just cuz he thought of I put the art in fart and the whole world simply had to know and look elon's tweets were never that great not like mine of course which are Banger after Banger after Banger after certified Banger I don't miss but in recent years they've taken a turn toward
(20:16) the nasty and conspiratorial getting increasingly into the realm of right-wing trolls and many point to one particular moment as the Turning Point here the pandemic lockdowns California has 40 million residents are in lockdown at the time the government had ordered musk to close his Tesla factories in California I mean he was pissed that his factories were kind of forced to close ultimately yes that's the thing he wanted them there and he wanted them working he thought it was the it was an existential crisis if Tesla didn't
(20:46) succeed he really that for the world for all of us and then it got weird free America now people their freedom back in California have been half empty this whole time people back their freedom musk told his employees that he intended to defy orders and go to work CEO Elon Musk tweeted I will be on the line with everyone else if anyone is arrested I ask that it only be me okay what that really drives home is just how different musk is from the rest of us because there is Rich and detached and then there's I've asked the cops not to
(21:18) arrest anyone else so we should be good rich and detached and look let's admit a lot of our brains got a bit broken during the pandemic I I think we can all agree that it' be really cool if the entirety of the pandemic chapter in future history textbook simply read weird time had to be there we did our best but Elon didn't Channel his anxiety in one of the normal ways like spraying groceries with disinfectant getting really into sourdough bread baking or tracking down and purchasing one of a kind rat erotica you know normal stuff
(21:47) that we all did instead his brain broke in the direction of right Wingers who were loudly opposing the shutdowns and once he started siding with them over those complaints he found himself sympathizing with their broader concerns about a woke mind virus and that they were being mocked and shadowbanned and generally disrespected by Twitter and since he was also the richest man in the world he could fix all of this by simply buying the whole thing which is what he then did and I don't have time to run through every bad decision that he's
(22:14) made at Twitter although real quick he cut about 80% of the staff dissolved the trust and Safety Council blew up the verification system exercised the same censorship he claimed to be against Rea reactivated the accounts of various White supremacists released the Twitter files in which he basically misook the email of various feckless left leaning Tech weenie struggling with the impossible job of content moderation for a vast Elite conspiracy to sign its right-wing changed the name to X put a gigantic X on the building which
(22:39) he then took down and just this week reversed his early decision and let Alex Jones back onto the site a decision that's be met with resounding praise from big loud quarterly and notably his time in charge of Twitter has seen a rise in unpleasant rhetoric from musk himself including boosting a transphobic documentary saying every parent should watch this responding interesting to a tweet reading blacks kill each other whites kill themselves and boosting this office meme falsely implying there had been a cover up about pizzagate I didn't think
(23:09) it was possible but it genuinely makes me miss the man who once posted send me your danst memes and this pict from a turtle on Wheels with the message science has gone too far and while Elon will dispute there has been a rise in hate speech on the platform or that he has panded to White nationalists you know who disagrees with him on that white nationalists just listen to Nick fenes telling Richard Spencer everything Elon has done for their movement it's only been a year since musk acquired Twitter which is not really a long time
(23:40) and the changes didn't even begin to roll out until less than a year ago and yet the change has been dramatic how much the window has shifted noticeably on issues like white identity which apparently is suddenly mainstream it wasn't for a long time it seemed like Charlie Kirk said one or two things about it last year and then this year now everyone's a white nationalist now everyone's a white identitarian you open up one of the social platforms it's so hot it's so fast it changes public
(24:08) opinion virtually overnight and and really in our favor wow all of that is horrifying but the use of the term white identitarian is just not fooling anyone that is what the word racist writes on a job application to make it sound like it went to college and the fact Elon seems to be getting increasingly radicalized is a big problem because we've put a lot of power into his hands and much more than you may realize remember when I said that no one is taking the big swings that he is that includes the government
(24:38) and over the years that means a lot of things that this country relies on have been outsourced to musk every day musk's companies control more of the internet power grid transportation system objects in orbit the nation's security infrastructure and its energy Supply to take just one example SpaceX has now put more than 4,500 starlink satellite ites into orbits meaning that musk's company now accounts for over half of all active satellites and that puts the US government in a bit of a bind just watch
(25:07) a National Security Council spokesman try to explain why it wouldn't be acting in response to elon's boosting of that great replacement Theory tweet there's Innovation out there in the private sector that we'd be foolish to to to walk away from I'm not aware of any specific efforts uh to address to to address our concerns over his rhetoric uh but that doesn't mean that we accept uh or or uh or agree with or condone in any way that anti-semitic rhetoric that he pushed yeah we're now at the point where the
(25:40) government is explicitly saying we've chosen to look the other way on the anti-Semitism thing or as it's more commonly known a daddy's home too and the problem isn't just the Optics of having someone as erratic as Elon in charge of half the world satellites his opinions can change the shape of world events when Russia invaded Ukraine one of their first actions was to S its internet access now musk to his credit agreed to provide Ukraine access to his starlink Network and donated Hardware enabling them to reach the internet via
(26:10) satellite and they were very grateful Lieutenant taras baret is a spokesman for Ukraine's military he told us Starling is crucial for commanding troops on the battlefield Elon mus we've been so grateful to space 6 and to Elon Musk we all starling think uh none of our offensives would be so successful it's true the Ukrainian military was Greatful to SpaceX and Elon Musk which is one of those headlines that even a few years ago would have sounded impossible like Panera Bread's lemonade linked to second death and Henry
(26:45) Kissinger finally dead and by the way I'm pretty sure it's the lemonade that got him but as time went on Elon toyed with the idea of withdrawing staring service complaining that the cost was too high even as he seemed increasingly Russia friendly at one point he said Russia should be allowed to Annex Ukrainian land and tweeted a proposed peace plan that would essentially just give Russia everything they wanted perhaps most notably he refused the Ukrainian request to activate starlink in Crimea enabling them to launch an
(27:14) attack on Russian ships reportedly because a Russian official warned him that that could lead to a nuclear response now guess that must be true right what are Russian officials going to do lie to an easily flattered CEO to get exactly what they want I don't see it and look Elon still insists that he is pro Ukraine and okay but us officials are now in the awkward position of having to defer to him on policy one Pentagon spokesman even said that he let a reporter interview an official only if musk gave permission saying we'll talk
(27:46) to you if Elon wants us to which isn't great you know before I respond on behalf of the mightiest military on Earth let me just run this up the chain and make sure it's cool with Admiral dank memes 420 Elon Musk could not have humiliated the Pentagon anymore if he'd opened up his own building next door called the hexagon the Pentagon that now the Pentagon has since signed a contract with Starling to take over certain services and rely Less on musk's whim but even elon's own biographer has
(28:16) expressed unease about just how important he's become so how does Elon feel about having this much Global power you know he says to me how am I in the middle of this but frankly he loves it he loves drama he loves being the epic hero I think it is a little bit dangerous because he loves it too much wait he loves drama I'm sorry I'm really not that comfortable with one of the most powerful people on Earth being summed up the same way you described Andy Cohen on New Year's Eve look the fact is whether we like it
(28:48) or not and the answer is absolutely not a huge number of very important things going forward are going to depend on how Elon is feeling which is a terrifying thing thing to say about anyone but especially this guy so so what can be done here well it's actually simple we just create a robust infrastructure economy that can resist Easy monopolization by private firms headed by overconfident billionaires and we do it about 15 years ago two problems with that one time machines don't exist and two the only person with the resources
(29:17) and ambition to build one is the last guy that you'd want to do that cuz he' probably use it to go back in time and high five Baby Hitler and look I'll be honest my feelings about Elon changed a bit in the writing of this piece I'm probably now more impressed by what he's doing but more worried by the fact that he's the one who's been doing it because he cultivates an image that he's simply too Visionary too original to play by other people's rules and he waves away the damage that he does as the cost of
(29:46) innovation and saving Humanity but the truth is that way of thinking isn't remotely original we've seen it so many times before the least surprising thing on earth is a middle-aged billionaire CEO with self-serving libertarian views increasingly racist politics and a messiah complex and it is long past time that he faced the kind of accountability that should come with that and not just from the echo chamber that he bought himself online but from everyone whose lives are very much affected by him and
(30:15) I know Elon might be unhappy with this piece he he might even permanently delete my Twitter account which is fine by me after all when this absolute treasure is gone elon's the one who will have to explain why to the Earth and he might say he's saving Humanity what have I ever done what industries have I revolutionized and I admit nothing yet but may I remind you I've already taken the first step toward building a robot Empire Bow Down and Worship your Metal Gods bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce
(30:56) bounce
