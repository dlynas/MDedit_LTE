(00:03) for whatever reason we are more likely to spend time planning for a road trip a big party or a date than we are for learning many students don't approach learning the same way they do other important aspects of their lives one of the biggest differentiators between successful learners experts and students who struggle is something called meta cognition cognition is the process of thinking about thinking one that is used to make decisions that maximize learning outcomes and help students meet their goals metacognition is thinking not just
(00:44) about the what of learning but the how ultimately metacognition is all about creating the best possible opportunity to learn what you are trying to learn so when you're learning something you stop to consider what you're trying to learn what you know how you're trying to learn it how effective your strategies are and what you can do differently to improve your understanding most people don't move beyond cognitive strategies when learning cognitive strategies are things tests ask you to do recall analyze interpret and apply
(01:21) information metacognition helps us see which cognitive strategies need to occur so we're best prepared for a test while also showing us what we need to do differently in order to be successful when we start looking at what we need to do our learning goal and how we're going to do it our plan for learning we are distinguishing between metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive regulation there are three basic stages of the metacognition process plan monitor and evaluate first plan your approach to learning a
(02:02) topic specifically how you will digest the information then monitor your comprehension of the topic as you study with actions such as practice tests finally evaluate the results of your learning when you're finished and modify your approach as needed these may sound like extra steps but there are actually essential parts of the learning process these steps help learners see that they've used their time to recall analyze interpret and apply information in other words metacognition helps students know that
(02:36) they really learned something so what does it look like in action as a learner you have to contend with their personal strengths and weaknesses the nature of the task and the strategies you have available to you to accomplish the task and overcome any challenges the process will look different for every student let's have a look at Marcus and his a CT study plan there are two ways he can approach his preparation process Marcus feels confident with most of the material although he's a bit iffy on the math and science sections his plan could
(03:13) involve reviewing an a CT study guide and a few practice tests leading up to test date the day will come he'll live with the grade and repeat the same process again the next time he takes the exam perhaps faring better or worse on the other hand Marcus could take time to consider which AC t-sections he already feels confident about which sections he needs more time to prepare for as well as exactly how he will monitor his progress during preparation he could regularly pause to ask is what I'm doing working if so how do I know
(03:51) after the test he can evaluate his overall process if there was anything he could have done differently and how he will prepare differently next time it's not hard to see which preparation method best sets Marcus up for success let's step back and consider the basic questions you can ask yourself before during and after studying to attend to the decisions that can make the difference in your performance before learning take time to plan what am I supposed to learn what strategies should I use how much time do I have
(04:31) while learning pause to monitor how am i doing am i on track with my plan do I understand where I'm learning should I adjust my pace after learning reflect and evaluate your process what did I learn did I achieve my goals what could I have done differently is there anything I still don't understand the answers to these questions may not come quickly but they create an opportunity for you to change how you approach your goals when things just aren't working out the way you want them to learning and practicing metacognition
(05:13) means that you'll be your own best indicator for whether you are prepared for a test or not the same time you're helping prepare yourself for more effective learning in the future because you will be able to make the best choices for yourself when your materials and teachers don't deliver what you need
