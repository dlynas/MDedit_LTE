(00:00) second thought is a 100% viewer funded operation if you'd like to help support the channel and get some great perks while you're at it consider becoming a patron at patreon.com/crashcourse  memories of Easter egg hunts with my family and now that I have a young daughter of my own I'm excited to give her the same experience so imagine my surprise when we go to the neighborhood playground on Easter and there are a handful of adults trying to keep kids from picking up a bunch of eggs seemed a
(00:46) little weird so I asked one of them what was going on and they said better not to look inside so naturally I had to look inside here's what I found  even for someone who keeps tabs on these freaks for a living this was a little shocking we live in a quiet suburb there's never any trouble and yet here we were standing somewhere designed for children to play picking up Easter eggs with fascist rhetoric inside and if you think about it this one little Easter egg is indicative of the whole fascist
(01:25) undercurrent in the US let's unpack what's going on here I think we should start with a quick rundown of the the proud boys and the other fascist groups in the US because the state of official fascist organizations has changed over the last few years the proud boys are an exclusively male hate group operating in the US and Canada besides their deeply funny no girls allowed rule these losers are big proponents of the white genocide myth the idea that white people a designation that seems to fluctuate whenever
(01:53) convenient are being replaced by encroaching hordes of nebulously ethnic babies the group has been described as an alt-right fight Club conservative extremists altl overtly islamophobic and misogynistic and all too willing to embrace racists anti-semites and bigots of all kinds they've engaged in political violence attended the January 6th Insurrection and have been banned from pretty much every social media platform officially the Canadian arm of the organization shut down after being rightly labeled a terrorist group The
(02:24) Proud boys were established in 2016 spearheaded by Gavin McKinnis one of the co-founders of Vice over the next few years they went through a handful of leaders the most recent being this guy Enrique tario who in 2023 was sentenced to 22 years in prison for his role in the Insurrection too is a Miami Cuban which tells you pretty much all you need to know as far as his politics goes but it came out during his trial that he was also an informant for the feds which led to a Schism in the proud boys who just couldn't believe that one of their own
(02:54) would work for the evil government got to love how naive these people are when the judge delivered the sentence tario begged the court please show me mercy I ask that you not take my 40s from me that's how quickly the tough guy act crumbles as of right now the proud boys seem to be in disarray they get kicked from every platform they try to organize on a bunch of their members got locked up after January 6th and they seem more than a little spooked that they got infiltrated by the feds a handful of State branches have said they won't
(03:23) acknowledge any national leadership and they're just kind of doing their own thing so with any luck the organization will die out that doesn't mean their remaining members aren't dangerous though so keep that in mind besides the proud boys we've got the oathkeepers the three percenters Patriot front and Patriot prayer the three percenters are the oldest group on the list the organization was founded in 2008 if you live in Texas like I do you've probably seen 3er bumper stickers the name comes
(03:51) from the assumption that 3% of a given country's population is enough to overthrow the government the group was officially dissolved in 2021 after January 6th then you'll start notice a trend there a bunch of its members were thrown in jail and once again Canada labeled them a terrorist group like the proud boys local branches of the 3centers still remain active the oathkeepers are the next oldest founded just one year after the 3centers this is another anti-government but Pro Constitution group and tellingly its
(04:19) membership is 2/3 former military and police and 10% active duty best guesses as to their numbers hover around 5,000 people but the org itself claims to have a membership of 38,000 these thugs are known for showing up at protests political rallies and whatever events they determin to be woke armed with guns and with their faces covered once again a number of their H high-ups are serving over a decade in prison for sedici conspiracy though this group seems to have been more resilient than their cowardly counterparts
(04:47) choosing not to shutter their operation in fact according to a data breach as of 2021 48 state and local officials and 10 sitting State lawmakers were listed among the group's members this this would suggest a different approach from the other fascist cells choosing to pursue electoral infiltration as opposed to strictly acts of Terror the final two organizations significant enough to mention are Patriot front and Patriot prayer they all love this Patriot stuff and we'll get to that in a bit Patriot
(05:16) prayer was founded in 2016 in the suburbs of Washington state suburbs that's another thing we'll talk about their whole stick is to harass liberal and left-wing groups in the Pacific Northwest and get in street fights with anti-fascists which have often been filmed and upload Ed to inspire other budding fascists to get involved more physically according to an informant there are only about 15 of these guys they've just been really good at making a name for themselves because typically fascists are cowards who will scatter
(05:42) when it looks like a fight is coming finally the youngest org on the list Patriot front this is another small organization but I bet you've heard more about them than some of the others where the rest play koi and beat around the bush these guys are explicit in their fascism they've even got the fasy as part of their logo if I had to guess which group would end up being the most influential in the fascist movement it would be Patriot front for a bunch of reactionaries they're pretty good at branding
(06:10) combining traditional Americana with fascist symbolism in every successful past fascist movement that's been a key element it takes on the flavor of whatever culture it boils up in you've probably heard the quote when fascism comes to America it'll be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross case in point Patriot front is another group that punch above its weight in terms of membership best estimates put the number at just 200 but they accounted for 82% of all incidents in 2021 that involve the distribution of fascist racist or
(06:41) otherwise bigoted propaganda in the US if you zoom out a bit this is all kind of interesting you've got your fraternity your militias your street thugs and your propagandists that's a pretty well-developed fascist undercurrent even if for now they seem to be licking their wounds what happens when they start organizing across the different groups speculation aside the important thing to realize about American fascism is that it's not confined to this handful of explicitly fascist groups it's become mainstream among the
(07:12) American right let me give you an example here's an exmilitary business owner back during Peak covid but it's not going to be peaceful much longer okay and this isn't a threat I'm not a criminal I've ever been a criminal but I'm telling you that good citizens are going to turn into real concerned and revolutionary citizens real soon and and nobody else is going to say that I'm probably the only person that has a ball to say what I'm saying right now that we're building we're organizing and
(07:37) we'll work with law enforcement or without law enforcement but you won't stop us when time comes because our families are starving and if you don't hear the seriousness of my voice I hope you open your ears and you absolutely listen to what I'm saying because this is a warning for what's coming it's not going to be peaceful much longer it's not going to be Rah R it's not going to be speeches it's not going to be gathering outside saying Pledge of Allegiance it's not going to be W from Flags it's going
(07:59) to be real when you've seen the things that I've seen I went to war for this country I've seen the ugliest dirtiest part of humanity I've been in combat and I never want to go back again but I'm telling you what I will to save this country if it has to be against our own citizens it will happen and there's a million people like me and you won't stop us sounds pretty bad but this is exactly the type of person we saw at the capital Riot all the fascist groups were there at least 700 members of their organizations got
(08:31) arrested but they were a drop in the bucket compared to what most people would call average conservatives only around 133% of those charged in the capital riots were formal members of militant groups like The Proud boys the 3centers and the oathkeepers the remaining 87% were a mix of garden variety Trump supporters and conservatives LARPing as revolutionaries the overwhelming majority of people who stormed the capital were just average Republicans and you can tell they didn't look like like the typical far-right
(09:00) extremists they were typically older with around 2/3 being over 35 they were much less likely to be unemployed a full 14% of the attendees charged were business owners and 30% were white collar workers these aren't normal far-right extremist demographics these are just Republican constituency demographics that's why fascists Target the suburbs as we mentioned earlier the aggrieved white middle class is ripe for radicalization the average American conservative wants to overthrow the government to estblished some weird
(09:30) anti-woke theocracy based on a mythologized version of the past and don't take my word for it they're literally advocating for it in their magnum opus project 2025 which we made a video about a while back okay why is this happening conservatives have always been reactionary but what's changed in the last decade or so well there are a few factors we'll start with a culture War issue the white genocide myth the great replacement theory is a classic among fascists it asserts that there is a plot with which really means they
(10:00) think it's a Jewish thing that the white race and white culture whatever that means are disappearing because of immigration from majority non-white countries fascists believe this will cause some general persecution of white people because of course they can't imagine the world being run without One race subjugating another this is the theory that motivated the Christ Church shooter Brenton tarant and the El Paso shooter Patrick crucius and it's both unfounded and blatantly fascist you won't be surprised to learn that this
(10:27) theory has a historical trajectory that starts in world War II runs through the European fascist movements the American Nazi party and has now found a home among the majority of the Republican electorate here's a clip of Tucker Carlson endorsing the theory on Fox calling it by name and likening it to Eugenics Jo Biden just said it to change the racial mix of the country that's the reason to reduce the political power of people whose ancestors lived here and dramatically increase the proportion of Americans newly arrived from the third
(10:55) world and then Biden went further he said that nonwhite DNA is the quote source of our strength imagine saying that this is the language of eugenics it's horrifying but there's a reason Biden said it in political terms this policy is called the Great replacement the replacement of Legacy Americans with more obedient people from far away countries they brag about it all the time but if you dare to say it's happening they will scream at you with maximum hysteria and here do you have Joe Biden confirming his motive on tape
(11:27) with a smile on his face this type of racist xenophobia isn't new every fascist project in history has needed to create a chosen people and a barbaric enemy to justify their anti-human politics even a cursory glance at any history book will make it clear where this trend comes from but why does it start in the first place human beings can be awful distrustful people but just randomly deciding to build an exterminatory worldview out of their bigotry doesn't make much sense we need to dig a little deeper and look beyond
(11:58) the culture War r Ric to really understand the appeal of fascism socialism and fascism are both on the rise and it's pretty easy to see why beneath every movement is an economic Catalyst fascism is seen as a solution to an economic problem just as socialism is but the difference is that fascism does not threaten the Primacy of capital or the comfortable position of the white liberal a critical Ally of fascist movements throughout history economic hardship creates conditions where bitterness distrust and Desperation can
(12:27) Thrive making the masses an easy target for charismatic and bombastic fascists think back to that town hall video what did the guy say was the spark for their aggression not being able to feed their families and you know what that's a perfectly valid reason to be upset the problem is the solution he and other fascists land on is to exterminate or Deport anyone deemed to be detrimental to white people making money and keeping their privileged position or in their eyes prevent hardworking Patriots from losing economic ground because their
(12:57) opportunities are being stolen by foreigners the economic base of fascism has always been the petite bouris or as I like to call them the roofing class small business owners the guys who have a handful of contractors and pay 1,200 bucks a month on an F-150 Raptor that's never been used for any kind of manual labor but I digress I really try my best to understand fascist because it's an interesting phenomenon socialism offers in my opinion a common sense solution to the ills of capitalism economic democracy the people who do the work
(13:29) have a say in how the work is done and profits can't be siphoned off by unelected corporate tyrants fascism on the other hand has to create this elaborate fantasy to justify why one particular group of people is destined to inherit the earth and conveniently it's the people in your country and the group you happen to fall into is the same gripe I have with Calvinists they believe that all humans are predestined to go to either heaven or hell and nothing we do can influence that Destiny I've never met a calvinist who believes
(13:57) they're going to hell if if I try really hard to check my basic human decency at the door I can see why fascist mythology could be appealing it lets you off the hook it justifies the worst cruelties because you are defending what is good and righteous from Human animals who want to tear down a beautiful civilization the problem is the civilization fascists claim to be defending has never existed it's a myth there is no single white race just ask the Irish or the Italians or the Russians or the ukrainians or the Jews
(14:30) who have all had their white card revoked or granted at some point there is no period in American history where everything was great for the white working class every worker in this country has always been at the mercy of the elite but not the elite fascists assume are pulling the strings it's not a shadowy cabal of woke Jews it's just the people who own the means of production they're not shy about it people like Warren Buffett routinely admit there's a class war being waged and that the capitalist want want to
(14:59) make sure that they win it the Glorious fascist Revolution that these self-proclaimed Patriots want it's not revolutionary at all it's just turning back the clock to a time where these class antagonisms were less apparent where the capitalist class still had complete control over Society but maybe black people had fewer rights if that's your vision of Utopia you're a you are risking decades in prison because you want to make sure the boot stays on your neck because you like the lies the
(15:27) boot spouts while it's stepping on you the Republicans love fascist because it's an ideology that maintains the economic status quo they don't like it when their useful idiots try to Lynch them so people have to go to jail for that but on the whole there's a reason the ruling class tolerates Fascism and not socialism socialism is genuinely revolutionary whereas fascism is just a cancerous offshoot of capitalism that can in their mind be used as a tool when needed and this isn't the first time the
(15:56) ruling class has taken advantage of economic precarity once upon a time a group of super wealthy capitalists hatched a scheme to try to convince a group of vulnerable Americans to launch an Insurrection and overthrow the government at which point the group of oligarchs would establish what amounted to a fascist dictatorship in the service of capital sounds a bit like January 6th doesn't it this attempted coup was called the business plot and it actually happened way back in 1933 the short version is that a
(16:24) retired General one Smedley Butler was approached by a wouldbe financier who offered him funding and 500,000 men to lead an Insurrection to depos then president FDR Roosevelt's election and subsequent economic reforms had horrified conservative businessmen who saw him as a socialist so naturally when given the choice between socialism and fascism they overwhelmingly sided with fascism telling Butler they hoped to install him as an all powerful Secretary of General Affairs while Roosevelt would assume a figurehead role unfortunately
(16:54) for the plotters Butler ratted them out in his later years General Butler had come to support FDR and was a fairly outspoken critic of capitalism referring to his past self as a highclass musclean for Wall Street the business plot failed and it gives us a great example of how economic precarity can be weaponized to fascist ends the capitalist understood that thousands of First World War veterans were disenchanted with the us having not received their promised benefits and they figured if they could just get a popular willing leader to
(17:22) stoke the discontent into a fascist fervor they'd have free reign of the country's economy creating an Unholy merger of capital and the state a Cornerstone of fascism what we are seeing today has the same Hallmarks of every other period where fascism has grown in popularity economic insecurity the formation of fascist paramilitaries and a series of charismatic figures trying to tap into the rising tide of far-right populism for personal gain while it's important to have empathy for people who are
(17:52) struggling economically and looking for answers once someone chooses to become a fascist they are a threat but it's also also important to realize that these people are by and large losers and cowards they talk a big game but they run away when faced with anti-fascist resistance instead of getting up on a soap box like their Idols they target children with hate speech and lurk online they wear ridiculous outfits complete with cardboard Shields and if we're being honest most of these people don't really match the Uber mench
(18:21) archetype at the end of the day they're pathetic reactionaries who whine about wokeness and weaponize culture and religion to spread a hateful message with no basis in reality but that doesn't mean they're not dangerous never underestimate your enemy especially when they've convinced themselves that they are the chosen ones and everybody else is subhuman so is the US headed for fascism yes and no the US is a settler Colonial imperialist project it's primed for fascism by default Any Nation dependent
(18:55) on the exploitation of others is one bad quarter away from going full mus that being said the economic conditions that allow for the growth of fascism also result in the growth of class Consciousness which gives socialism a chance to fight back under every single fascist regime in history the Socialists were the first to be targeted because fascists know that socialism is a threat to Capital and that any truly egalitarian system has to get rid of the exploitative system that is capitalism fascists don't want revolutionary change
(19:26) they want violent maintenance of the status quo and they want to turn the violence of the Empire usually reserved for foreigners inward suppressing whatever groups they don't like so yes fascism is on the rise so is socialism and it's our job to make sure this time fascists don't get their way and that instead we Forge a path towards a brighter more Humane  future I mentioned at the beginning of the video that this channel is entirely Grassroots funded since sponsors don't want to touch
