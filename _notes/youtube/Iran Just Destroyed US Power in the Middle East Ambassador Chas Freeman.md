Transcript:
(00:00) but at the same time and this is very important the Saudis the emiratis and others informed the United States that they would not permit American uh operations against Iran from their territory and Iran warned those states that if they did they would become targets so in a sense Iran has achieved the neutralization of American forces in the Persian Gulf that it long sought hello everybody this is Pascal from neutrality studies and today I have the great pleasure and honor to again talk to Ambassador Chas Freeman I know
(00:47) most of you know him he is a very great speaker and writer and thinker he served as US ambassador to Saudi Arabia he was the SEC assistant Secretary of Defense in the 1990s and he was also um Nixon's principal interpreter during his 1972 visit to China he's one of the America's greatest uh living foreign policy Legends and a while ago I talked to him he he's shaking his head but he really is um he's uh uh a while ago he was talking about the Middle East and and that it would make make much more sense
(01:31) now that we have a realignment between Iran and Saudi Arabia and other events um that we think about this place rather about West Asia than about the eurocentric Middle East and um I that was before October 7th that was before the start of what has to be described as genocide and what I am absolutely certain will be remembered in world history as a as a genocide um so um Ambassador Freeman welcome to this show and thank you for taking the time for an update well thank you for the flattering remarks well you know I am I am very
(02:08) impressed with all of the things you've done because you speak fluent Chinese you speak fluent Arabic you have been in foreign policy for a very long time and now you're one of these voices that dares to speak out and actually and Frames things you help us think about world affairs and I am really I really wonder how you um everything that happened since October 7th how does it impact your views on on the Middle East well it certainly had a major impact um I was um initially a fan of Zionism in the 1950s
(02:45) I admired what I thought Israel was I became a skeptic and then I became a Critic as I watched what Israel was doing uh but I've come to realize a number of things that I didn't know uh for example when Israel says or demands that others acknowledge its right to exist what does it mean it means no one else has the right to exist between the Jordan River and the Sea it is a positive statement of a negative proposition which is integral to Zionism that is to say that from the very beginning uh the phrase uh a people with without land for
(03:31) a land without people implied that there were no people in Palestine and Israel has devoted itself to ensuring that that is the case and this has now been brutally revealed in the genocide in vaza where Israel would be very happy to push the Palestinian population out but failing that it will kill them either bombing them or starving them to death uh this is a level of cruel evil if you will that I could not have imagined and it's particularly hard to understand coming from a population in which at least the European segment is the are
(04:14) the victims of the Holocaust the Holocaust in Europe of course the uh Arab Jews the the MIM the Oriental Jews did not experience that but we've now had the Israeli State conduct a program of indoctrination of its entire population including those from Arab lands uh who were forced to leave when Israel was established and for the first time there was uh a serious reaction against them in the Arab world um these people are now indoctrinated they they're taken to outs uh to be told that the entire world all
(05:03) the non-jewish world wants to murder them uh so this is a country which is now the only word for it I can think of is psychopathic uh it is a country that U has dehumanized the indigenous population to the extent that it it it's it's people feel no compunction at all about mass murder including murder women and children including the murder of infants and theolog theologians in Israel just justify this I could not have imagined this and I cannot imagine anything further from the tenants of Judaism as I
(05:45) have known it in the west and therefore I've come to the conclusion that Zionism is the negation of the Judaism it is uh not Judaism it is not Humane it does not depend upon ethical reasoning conducted through scholarship which is the essence of Judaism it is a fascist form of nationalism and we are seeing that played out so the October 7th and the subsequent events have had a profound effect on my uh my view of things I've also got to say that as an American I'm deeply ashamed of the enablement of genocide that my
(06:38) countries have been engaged in um the the the the antics of the United States at the security Council most recently today with the veto of the proposal to admit Palestine as a state on the grounds that we support a two-state solution which we have never really conducted a sufficient effort to support uh is uh egregiously dishonest and uh I think it deprives us of any remaining credibility in the world that we have had so as an American I'm deeply distressed I love my country I want it to be safe and secure I want it to
(07:24) succeed uh it cannot succeed if it engages in this kind of duplicity uh deception dishonesty hypocrisy and double standards so um on the one hand we condemn uh Russia for conducting Warfare in Ukraine some of which undoubtedly has included gross violations of Ukrainian human rights uh on the other hand we don't condemn Israel for doing something far more egregious and lethal um and so this is deeply distressing to me I really have not slept well for six months same same I I just wonder you know what we are witnessing here has a
(08:15) very special quality because um what I mean with quality is the double speak so you know um dishonesty in foreign policy dishonesty in political discourse in general is nothing new but it is difficult to find a a time when we have equally clear evidence for something egregious happening while at the same time the enablers the the the conducting power and the enablers uh pretend that there's no proof for that um the I mean Kirby said on on on state TV we have no we have no proof that there a single human rights abuse has
(08:57) actually taken place or or War crime sorry he said war crime we don't have a single proof for a war crime and Israel keeps saying we are just defending ourselves while literally going into Gaza and and and attacking that place I mean repelling the attacker is one thing but then going in and and after them is a completely different thing and especially if it costs like 40,000 lives and probably more um large part of them civilians and and and and children and this is happening in the open and you were the one who said they are worse
(09:25) than the Nazis on on my former program because the Nazis tried to hide the Holocaust they tried to hide it and then it came out and only post facto everybody learned how how huge a crime that was the US and so on the others did not go to war to stop the Holocaust they went to war because the Japanese attacked them and then Hitler did something stupid and you know but this is the first time that such a large crime is is done with pride and also with strategic intent and the Western world is pretending it's not happening
(09:55) and the the others can see that everybody else is seeing it in in in the global majority the Russians are seeing it the Chinese are seeing it the South Americans are seeing it and everybody is saying this is outrageous um how do you think this changes the entire equation of of global politics well I think uh one thing is clear and that is uh that Israel no longer has any credibility at all anything it says is immediately suspected of being duplicitous and and and and uh dishonest um but the United States is not far
(10:31) behind think about it U Israel attacked an embassy in Damascus um this is a violation of one of the very most basic Norms of international relations going back many thousands of years to the classical world enshrined in the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations um and uh the United States Britain and France vetoed the condemnation of that act um and then we have statements by people like Lord Cameron of Britain the foreign secretary uh who uh who says that the very um carefully contrived performative symbolic retaliation by Iran was
(11:27) disproportionate to the blowing up of the embassy in which a general and diplomats and others were killed and yet no one perished in from the Iranian attack because they very carefully signaled that they were going to do it they gave 72 hours of notice they used slow moving drones to signal that they were engaged in an attack uh they they Ed cruise missiles and ballistic missiles for the arrival of those drones um and uh and they did all this aiming purely at military targets no civilian Target and actually they hit the
(12:10) military targets we don't know how severely because the Israelis are lying about the damage but it appears that in the major base in the South where they struck they were able to achieve a level of accuracy that was quite extraordinary they seem to hit the Officer's Club swimming pool and an out building um they didn't kill anybody they allowed the Israelis to move the f35s that were stationed there and which conducted the raid on Damascus um and so what they showed was they had the capacity to um clog and and
(12:53) render Israeli defenses overburdened uh they now know where all of the radars and anti-missile sites are uh they have learned that they can send not their best missiles but um older missiles and strike an Israeli base um and U they have now said well from our point of view we've made our point we're not planning to do anything else um we don't know what Israel's going to do but Israel is threatening retaliation Iran has said that if that happen s instead of 320 flying objects going toward Israel
(13:35) there will be 1,500 uh so basically uh this changes all the rules of the game in the Middle East Iran had practice the policy called strategic patience which basically was passivity if it was attacked as it often was by Israel if its officers military scientific uh government politicians were assassinated as many were it did not retaliate in kind sometimes it assisted uh its clients uh other resistance movements in the region hisbah for example in lean uh to carry out a some kind of retaliatory act but it never acted directly uh Israel
(14:23) therefore felt that with American protection to which I'll come in a moment um it had a free in the Middle East they could act with impunity um that is no longer the case and I know that U at the cost of maybe $20 million in missile firings uh you know drones that cost a few thousand cruise missiles that cost a few hundred th000 and ballistic missiles that are more expensive uh Iran probably cost Israel $1.
(14:57) 3 billion in defense efforts succeeded in panicking the Israeli population over the course of the weekend demonstrated that it can overwhelm Israel's defenses if it chooses to do so and also that Israel cannot defend itself without the active participation of the United States the UK France and in this case Jordan acting Against drones Crossing its territory um a final Point here is that there's a great deal made of the uh so cooperation of Arab states with Israel against Iran what was that and with the exception of Jordan which did act to
(15:39) shoot down drones Crossing its territory the only participation was Intelligence sharing that is Saudi Arabia and others informed the United States and Israel of the tracks of the missiles coming across their territory at the same time and this is very important the Saudi the amires and others informed the United States that they would not permit American uh operations against Iran from their territory and Iran warned those states that if they did they would become targets so in a sense Iran has achieved the neutralization of American forces in the
(16:23) Persian Gulf that it long sought so this is as someone has put it from a tactical military point of view it was a nothing Burger to use an American slang expression it didn't amount to anything nobody was killed nobody was really damaged the swimming pool may have a hole in it and then Air Base but um otherwise not not much happened um but from a strategic point of view from a soft power point of view it was a huge success Iran its objective and it left Israel with an intolerable dilemma Israel cannot continue to behave as
(17:07) though it can act with impunity and let me pose a specific question if Israel now assassinates an Iranian if president RI of Iran's statement is to be believed Iran will retaliate in kind uh that should be sobering it has not been the case Iranian restraint has been broken furthermore there are now people in tan who for the first time are saying openly in order to counter Israel we are going to have to go Nuclear So Israel has crossed a line and let's remember despite all the spin in the western press this particular cycle
(17:54) began with an Israeli provocation not an Iranian provocation a the Israelis attacked a sacran target a Target that has political in diplomatic immunity namely the embassy of Iran and Damascus uh Iran was put in a position where it had to respond apparently the Israelis misjudged they thought that as in the past despite their escalation against Iran Iran would continue to exercise strategic restraint but I don't think the Iranian populist would permit the government in tan to do that and the government in tan
(18:41) also has clients in the form of resistance movements against Israel throughout the Middle East which also would not be impressed if Iran failed to act now some of those resistance movements apparently agree with the spin in the west that well Iran didn't do anything it just showed it was incapable uh and lacked will willpower I don't think that is correct uh and I know that Hezbollah and others do not appear to share that opinion so the next time Israel does something and we don't know what it will
(19:21) do but it is saying now that it does not believe that attacking is Iran's clients it's proxies if you will in the region would be enough that it has to act directly against Iran if it does that we don't know what's going to happen um the final notion here is that Mr Netanyahu failed to achieve his 35 yearlong objective of generating a war against Iran which would bring the United States in on Israel's side to destroy the largely mythical Iranian nuclear program uh nobody believes that the accept the
(20:03) politicians in Israel and in on Capital Hill in Washington that Iran has a nuclear weapons program but it does have is a program to achieve nuclear latency in case a decision is made no decision having been made yet apparently to build a bomb and what we're now seeing in Iran is a debate about making a decision to build build a bomb so from every point of view this is a disaster for Israel for the west and it leaves the situation very uncertain I I absolutely agree I wonder why it is that so many people do not see
(20:49) that the big achievements in West Asia and between like uh cooling down tensions were all achieved diplomatically when the when the nuclear deal the jcpoa was intact and because everybody I mean the the the The Observers that came from the from the the from neutral States right from the atomic energy agency they all attested no Iran is not building any weapons that was a great achievement and that was sabotaged in 2016 and then even now even in the in the war in the genocide in Gaza the only hostages that managed to be exchanged were the ones
(21:30) that were exchanged based on diplomatic on diplomacy the others are either still in Gaza or were killed by the IDF when they managed to escape it's like Israel didn't manage to to free a single one with Force only with diplomacy but two more observations that just would like to get your your view on um the maybe Jordan because when there was this act in in the US right to give uh Israel another $3.
(22:02) 8 billion about a month and a half ago about five six weeks ago and when I read through that act they saw that there's also the funding act that there's also 1.2 billion to Jordan which I didn't I I noticed but I didn't further think about it and now I realize oh that's actually another 1.
(22:18) 2 billion that are that are spent on another country in order to defend uh Israel which makes perfect strategic sense but Jordan itself I don't I don't see how Jordan could not shoot down missile that that that fly over its Sovereign territory which in a sense makes helps to deescalate right to make sure that Israel feels safe um what do you what will this do inside of Jordan I think that was clearly clearly the Jordanian reasoning was a desire to avoid a wider War but there's a complication here because uh a great majority of
(22:55) jordanians are Palestinian refuges from pistan um and in fact the uh the queen is a Palestinian uh and U so uh Jordan is always engaged in a balancing act and many jordanians are very angry about the fact that Jordan in effect helped to defend Israel um I think the Strategic logic of that is as you stated it's very clear Jordan cannot afford a wider War it want wants to does not want to fail to uh defend Israel to such an extent that Israel feels obliged to invade its airspace uh and so uh this was a defensive move aimed at Jordanian
(23:44) interests which are derived from Israeli interests in part so all that is true and um I think I think it's notable that um that uh Jordan like Egypt uh as a result of the Camp David Accords which were initially with Egypt alone and later later expanded to include Jordan in effect gets bribes from the United States to stay at peace with Israel regardless of Israeli Behavior now that is why Egypt gets the subventions it does it's why Jordan gets the subventions it does uh Jordan is a buffer State between is Isel and other
(24:29) countries Syria Iraq uh and even to even Saudi Arabia so um it has a certain geopolitical utility and it's able to derive rent from that so that is the fact the other question on my mind is that your assessment now is that uh is Iran is giving up its strategic restraint um strategy and has proven that it can actually overwhelm the Iranian defense on the other hand we see that the narrative in the west is clearly actually actually also deescalation right the United States creating the narrative that uh you know
(25:11) this is a win we we shut everything down Iran is so weak that's in order to deescalate and tell the Israelis don't do anything we actually at the moment we have this this interesting situation where the US wants to walk away from a war clearly clearly and tells the the Israelis don't don't this they tell them don't shoot back we don't want this and it's but the ball is in the court of the of the Israelis and my my problem is that the Israeli strategy has been the opposite of the Iranian one it has been
(25:40) strategic overwhelming if somebody shoots at us we shoot 10 times back if somebody kills one of us we kill 10 or 100 or thousands of them we will shock them into submission if the Israelis follow that strategy I could foresee even like a a tactical Nuclear Strike something outrageous outrageous or do you think that the Israelis this time will stand down um this is the most outrageously belligerent cabinet Israel has ever had um it is composed in part of Fanatics so this is not reassuring I want to make a number of points um Iran
(26:22) is desperate not to have a war with Israel and the United States in fact it's reported that Iran offered if uh the United States would uh bring the Gaza genericide to an end not to retaliate against Israel so it was prepared to make a political tradeoff uh it was only when it became apparent that there's no such will willpower on the part of the United States by the way US Congress is on the verge apparently of appropriating funds uh to reimburse Israel for its genocide and allow it to continue that uh so um anyway Iran is
(27:05) very restrained I think the Biden Administration behaved in an exemplary fashion in response to the Iranian retaliation against Israel they helped Israel defend itself they've now tried to dissuade Israel from continuing the fight but I don't think they can succeed because I think they fundamentally misread Israeli intentions uh and as you said the Israeli strategy has been diplomacy free it basically has consisted of disproportionate savagery and uh that is the basis for what the Israelis call deterrence other
(27:47) people would call it intimidation and terrorism but Israel basically has sought security by terrorizing its restive native Arab population and its neighbors uh the fact that Iran has now said it will retaliate in kind raises real questions about whether Israel can continue that policy um we don't know whether Iran is bluffing or not U perhaps they are but I think they've been put in a difficult position with their own clients uh and their own populace that will require them to make good on their threat to retaliate
(28:29) massively against any disproportionately if you will against any Israeli um violence directed at them so this is a very dangerous situation you raise the nuclear question Israel is in the very OD position of denying or at least not confirming that it has nuclear weapons while boasting about them and threatening them others with them this is a contradiction uh but then so much of this is contradictory um one thing you can say uh about the broader implications of what is happening is that this is the death throws of international law as a
(29:12) force in international politics um you cannot explain the condoning and enablement of genocide in terms of international law you cannot explain the vetos of ceasefires in those terms you cannot explain the failure to condemn an attack on an embassy in those terms and by the way there's an echo of that in Kito with the Ecuadorian invasion of the Mexican embassy so this could be contagious we should think about that you know um uh nobody really likes the United States or the UK in many parts of the world and our
(29:54) embassies have become fortresses because they've been assaulted in in the past you know if it's okay in terms of the so-called rules-based order to attack an embassy then I think we need to watch out uh so we are we are seeing the collapse of everything that uh has been achieved in terms of regulating International Affairs by rules since the 18th century when uh this began uh and uh you know one can find other examples but I think the most dangerous is in fact in the Middle East and uh Israel has made it very clear all along uh it's
(30:40) not a signatory of the nonproliferation treaty it's not subject to inspection uh it uh it developed its nuclear we weapons clandestinely while lying about what it was doing it considers that Iran may be doing the same thing it did That's the basis of its suspicion or I would say in this case mostly delusion but you know this may be a case of self-fulfilling paranoia in the end U so Israel has not has talked about something called the Samson option which basically says if we go you all go too we'll take you down with us just as
(31:23) Samson pulled down the Philistine Temple rather than submit um so uh I think this is very dangerous we have people in in the war cabinet in Israel uh who in any other society would probably be locked up uh as the war criminals as as sociopaths as people uh who are inciting M violence uh they're guilty of all of that um so what can we say u in the end um I suppose some restraint is imposed on Iran by the Judgment that Israeli Israelis are crazy enough uh to bring an end to the to everyone with nuclear weapons but that's not much of a
(32:15) reassurance no it's not it's it's a it's a very very scary moment um I have two observations though um on the one hand I am in a very bizarre situation to have been asked for the first time a few months ago to teach in international uh human rights law and now I'm teaching human rights law right now which is to me the greatest kind of contradiction but then again we are seeing something that is interesting which which which repeats over history which is that the weaker party still maintains or still
(32:47) sticks to international law because Iran is the weaker party in this uh you know Israel plus United States plus Europe equation right and they didn't attack another Embassy which which they could have that would have been direct proportional right but they decided let's not because it still is better for everybody if we can show to the rest of the world who's not the US and Europe that we stick to it and we see this over and over that weaker parties try to stick to international law and and try to also maintain the the the the the
(33:19) framing of it right it it officially said we only strike a military Target I mean they they are very fairly and squarely inside that so that gives me a little bit of Hope second that's an observation um second question where does where does Israel get its uranium from and plutonium I don't think they cannot get it themselves right so how do they get around the mechanism of the the the npt that restricts uranium and plutonium sales to to places that are not part of it well there are various answers to that the initial uranium for
(33:50) their nuclear weapons program was stolen from Pennsylvania U and uh they then got a lot of uranium from South Africa as due to their cooperation with the apartate regime in developing nuclear weapons it goes that far back the uranium that they still have now I don't know where they get it now um um I'm sure there are plenty of people who are willing to sell uh uranium uh for an adequate price um and U and and basically International regulation of of trade is is always spotting uh I want to go through your
(34:28) first point or your first observation there's a great irony here I think uh the edifice of interational law you mentioned human rights law which you're teaching is the great legacy of Euro Atlantic culture and civilization this is something that was invented really in the enlightenment um in Europe U and uh the United States spent much of the 20th century uh trying to realize this in the form of Institutions and rules the United Nations various International conventions to which we enthusiastically participated in
(35:11) drafting um more recently we have not ratified any such kind of conventions and we have shown total contempt for the United Nations so I think what is really ironic here is that the the global South if you will the colonized part of the world which had these rules inculcated by their colonial Masters now is the great defender of them and the West which invented these roles disparages and ignores them and that exactly coincides with what you said namely the purpose of law is the protection of the weak against the
(35:53) strong um and the weaker parties tend to be those including countries like China which you know began as a totally Lawless Revolution 1949 but which is now a major defender of the West faan idea of national sovereignty uh and no interference in Internal Affairs and so forth which is the the backbone of the event Charter whereas the US engages in regime change operations ignore sovereignty is at the moment occupying part of Syria in a totally un illegal manner is in Iraq and will not leave despite the demands of Iraqis and so
(36:38) forth so we have an inversion we came up with some very good rules admirable system that worked for a while uh we have now abandoned that system um because we're strong uh and weak uh are defending it because they're weak and this is very ironic situation indeed you know the weak suffer what they must but the weak also do whatever they can and and a good idea remains a good idea and this good idea was invented while the people who invented it committed genocide themselves right but the good idea remains a good idea
(37:21) and it's it's it's it's it gives me a little bit of hope that other parts of humanity then pick up the good ideas of others disregarding who invented them and try to further develop them I don't want to Veer off into a a broader strategic discussion because I think we've covered pretty much enough ground to this point but let me just observe that one of the collateral damages of everything that has been happening uh is the United Nations uh it has been shown to be factless uh to be uh incompetent uh to uh be a vehicle
(38:02) that cannot rise to the challenges facing the planet uh or human societies uh on the planet and therefore the question arises is there an alternative to preserve those values that the UN was intended to exemplify and my belief is that there is there are mechanisms to do that and that the model for those Alternatives exists in the various organizations and institutions that have been created uh to supplement complement uh and remedy the deficiencies of uh World post World War II institutions like the Breton Woods
(38:47) banking system so we have the uh Asian infrastructure Investment Bank we have the new development Bank we have the bricks we have a whole series of institutions arising which have the potential uh over time uh to take over or user if you will perhaps that is a bad word but maybe displace uh the role of the United Nations and certainly that of the global Hedon the United States uh as the formulator of rules and the enforcer of rules you know there is absolutely no reason that the world has to put up with the American veto in support of genocide
(39:31) in vaza U why is there no ad hoc conference uh in which countries get together and authorize for example uh boycott disinvestment and sanctions against the perpetrator it's an interesting question basically the UN the existence of the UN is becoming an obstacle to the realization of the ideals the UN was established to um perpetuate uh and so I think at some point somebody's going to come up with uh with an answer that we won't like because it will deprive uh us I speaking for Americans it will deprive us of our
(40:16) veto uh it will complicate International Affairs in that the veto will also not be available to others Russians Chinese French whoever uh and u uh and we will have a a replacement for this organization which you know clearly represents the constellation of power as it emerged from World War II but not the current constellation of power and which also uh is serving to perpetuate an American pracy which more and more countries see as an ins superable obstacle to accomplishing what has to be done so I think U I think this is a uh
(41:00) geopolitical um moment uh geopolitical sea change if you will in the making uh and we're not seeing it quite happening yet but we see bits and pieces that are very suggestive U and why should the UN be in New York uh you know there were reasons for that um but are those reasons valid now shouldn't it be in Bermuda or you know in in Andor or uh you know some other place um lonstein maybe even Switzerland but the second headquarter is in Switzerland right because the League of Nations used to be there and
(41:44) this is the main reason why I do these neutrality studies because as we see the current order crumble and move toward multipolarity and as we see this 100-year experiment of the un/ League of Nations which is the experiment of creating top- down structure right a pyramid and this is failing it hasn't it hasn't done what it was supposed to and everybody's seeing it and as you're correctly saying I think we are seeing now the gradual development of regional Arrangements bricks asien the African
(42:13) Union is getting closer together and is is is formulating problem solving mechanisms and is replacing what the UN should be doing um and in this in this constellation it will be more and more important to have actors that are that that can serve as meeting grounds and we're seeing it live what what Qatar how Qatar is serving as a as a as a mediator how Oman is serving as a mediator they're having second thoughts as we speak um due to criticism by Pro Zionist politicians in the west oh well we're
(42:46) seeing the the spill over from this well you mentioned uh the legacy of uh the League of Nations and um the presence in swi the Geneva in particular of international organizations the WTO the World Trade Organization um has been sabotaged by the United States with the result that um there are more and more Regional and bilateral Arrangements uh to for trade liberalization and dispute management because the WTO can no longer serve that purpose but there are other spillover effects look at the the destruction of
(43:26) freedom of speech in Germany for example oh yes you know um this is quite extraordinary um and uh you know the German National Security apparatus is Now intent on silencing anyone who says anything remotely critical of genocide by Israel um and Def you know refusing entry to those people um breaking up conferences uh arresting people U you know uh this is uh a kind of um quasi totalitarian activity that would have been unimaginable before what has now happened U Germany was a model democracy it's losing that character and
(44:14) so are others in the name of Defending it in the name of Defending what you're yourself destroying and it's so tragic so tragic that is always the case every Revolution takes place in order to reinstate mythical past values uh every counterrevolution takes place uh in order to defend the values of the uh of the society and destroys them in the process both are very destructive so here we are anyway um I think uh I have to take my my leave but I wish you pleasant day in in Japan thank you Ambassador Freeman very much for your
(45:02) time today no no typhoons and and a pleasant uh meal maybe some yakit I will get some tonight thank you very much Ambassador Freeman all the best to you and enjoy your drink okay thank you byebye
