I don't think it's overly dramatic to
say that the spirit of free and open
debate in Western democracies today is
under threat
it's not that we lack things to disagree
about it's just that we seem to be
forgetting how to disagree well
perhaps the reason for this is that the
values that make good faith debate
possible like Mutual trust and respect
are at an all-time low
they've been steadily eroded by a toxic
mix of polarized politics conflicting
ideologies and misinformation
and as a result the quality of public
discourse has taken a nosedive
whether it's an argument with a stranger
on Twitter or a heated discussion with a
relative at dinner The Exchange is often
so bitter and so hostile that it
resembles more of a shouting contest
than an actual conversation
what's more
many people avoid participating
altogether out of fear of getting caught
in that Crossfire
but avoiding conflict out of fear isn't
going to heal social division
what we need to learn is how to approach
our disagreements in a more constructive
way
according to author and debate Champion
Bo so the key lies in competitive debate
he argues that if we only approach our
disagreements with the same skill and
respect that competitive Debaters do
disagreements can actually be a force
for social connection rather than a
wedge driving us apart
my name is Inez and in This Blink to
boso's good arguments we'll discover the
wisdom of competitive debate so you can
learn to disagree more productively
and you'll learn some of the core
principles of debate as well as which
exercise real professional Debaters use
to improve the way they think and speak
before we begin we must introduce the
star of the show
Bozo was born in South Korea
but at the tender age of eight his
parents took that risky decision to
uproot their lives and move their family
to Australia in search of greener
pastures
at this point so spoke no English and as
one might expect he struggled to find
his place in his new home
at school unable to communicate with his
peers or even understand his homework so
receded into himself
eventually giving up speaking altogether
he learned that to get by In This World
it was easier just to keep quiet and do
as he was told
for several lonely years so was your
typical Wallflower
he was never loud he never asserted
himself he just kept his head down and
studied slowly getting to grips with the
nasal Aussie English
but in the fifth grade something
happened that would change his life
forever
his teacher invited him to take part in
a debate competition
if you don't know competitive debate is
like a formal game where two rival teams
participate in this verbal battle in
order to persuade judges to join their
side on some issue
it's a sport that thrives in schools and
universities around the globe and
actually a surprising number of
presidents CEOs and civil rights leaders
have competed
the roles are pretty simple
the opposing teams are assigned a motion
so the topic of the debate 15 minutes to
one hour beforehand so they have time to
prepare
after that the debate begins
each team takes turns speaking in front
of the judges for about five or so
minutes
and once it's over the team that's
judged to have spoken most convincingly
is declared the winner it's pretty
straightforward
so this is the world so it stumbled into
in his first ever debate he was asked to
defend the motion all zoos should be
banned
up on that stage between the fearful
walk up to the podium
and the thrill of unbroken Applause at
the end something happened to sow
he found his voice
and over the course of the next decade
so entered one competition after another
gradually honing a skill and rising in
the rankings
and he didn't just excel at debating
either
it turns out that the skills he was
learning in debate logical thinking
composition public speaking all helped
him to excel in his social and academic
life as well
eventually his passion for debate
carried him to places he never dreamed
possible
first he won the world high school
championship and then he went on to
study at Harvard where he led the team
to yet another victory at the world
University championship
so needless to say competitive debate
transforms so's life for the better
not only did it expose so to a
mind-boggling range of ideas from
Science and History to politics and
philosophy but more importantly it had
given him a reason to care about
learning
for so debate was a powerful tool in his
continued education and it can be for
you too
so let's shift gear and turn to the
principles of good debate
the first thing any budding debater has
to learn is how to spot the disagreement
in an argument after all
how are you supposed to know what to say
if you don't even know what the subject
of the argument is
and yet you'd be surprised how many
people run headlong into arguments
without thinking about this question
it's no wonder that so many conflicts
are unproductive
so try it yourself
think back to the last few arguments you
had doesn't matter who with
just try to recall what was said
and what sparked it
then answer this question
what was the disagreement
now what was the argument about but what
did you actually disagree on
if you can put your finger on that
disagreement it's possible that there
may not have been one to begin with
kind of like bad dreams Petty arguments
are forgotten just as quickly as they
come
so that's the first thing a debater does
armed with a pen and paper Debaters
write down the disagreement
and they don't bother arguing unless
there's really one to be had
so broadly speaking there are three
types of things that people disagree
about
facts judgments and prescriptions
so let's take a look at each of these a
bit closer
facts you know already Factor claims
about the way things are for example
it's a fact that Jakarta is a mega City
and it's also a fact that the boiling
point of water is 100 degrees Celsius or
212 degrees Fahrenheit
on the face of it facts may seem
impeachable but given that humans are
always working with limited knowledge
and evidence there's typically that room
to argue that your opponent has got it
wrong
now judgments they're a little different
from facts and that they involve
subjective opinion the statements Berlin
is dangerous or lying is wrong are
examples of judgments
disputing judgments usually involves
disputing the facts or assumptions on
which they're based
and finally there are prescriptions
these are judgments about how we ought
to act
think about those should statements like
you should go to the gym or the
government shouldn't limit free speech
disagreements about prescriptions
usually Center on the likely
consequences of the action
so those are basically the three types
of disagreement unfortunately as you've
probably noticed life is rarely that
neat and tidy
in real world arguments we usually
disagree about all of these things at
the same time
and to make matters worse we're often
forced to untangle the different threads
of a disagreement mid-argument
so to make our job a little easier we
can repurpose a technique from
competitive debate called topic analysis
Debaters use this technique to draw out
the different layers of disagreement in
a topic so for example the topic could
be parents should not send their
children to private school
okay first you would write the topic
down
and then you draw a circle around all
the contentious words in that sentence
in other words everything you could have
a disagreement about
and at first glance the disagreement
here might seem straightforward
this is clearly a prescriptive
disagreement about whether one should or
should not send their children to
private school
so the word you would circle is send
but take a closer look and it turns out
that there are other parts of that
sentence you can disagree about too
if you want pause and have a think the
statement is parents should not send
their children to private school
you could for example Circle the words
private school
because you might have factual
disagreements about the quality of
private schools or even what counts as a
private school
you might circle the word should because
you disagree about the value of private
schools or the obligations of parents
towards them
you might even circle the word children
because you could disagree about what
children's needs and wishes are
so now what appeared at first to be a
purely prescriptive statement about what
Parents Ought To Do
turned out to contain this bundle of
assumptions about facts and judgments as
well
the failure to recognize the plural
nature of arguments often causes people
to talk past each other as they argue
over different things
you can basically use topic analysis in
any of your personal or professional
disputes
it helps you identify the most important
disagreements of any argument which
makes them more focused and more
manageable
all right
once you've identified the disagreement
the next step is to argue your case
in the world of competitive debate
argument Reigns Supreme
this makes competitive debate pretty
exceptional in our culture
in most other areas of life arguments
tend to decline in value
ours is a culture of images not
arguments
maybe you're not convinced
so let's take the world of Commerce for
example
pictures of abs and cleavage can
persuade us of a lot anything from
buying sodas to signing up for a gym
membership
and even in politics the traditional
home of debate politicians try their
best to avoid making arguments
instead preferring the power of a photo
op
then consider this
in the workplace we're expected to
follow instructions and not argue or
question them
so it's no wonder that many people have
either never learned or have forgotten
how to construct a proper argument
let's start with what an argument isn't
an argument is not a slogan or a pep
talk nor is it a list of facts or an
assertion of your feelings
it's not a description or an explanation
and it's definitely not raising your
voice louder
so what is it then
an argument is a conclusion that you've
arrived at logically from a set of
premises supported by evidence
so to unpack this jargon a little
there are basically two things that
every argument has to prove first that
the claims it makes are true
and second that they actually support
the conclusion
let's look at an example
imagine for a moment that you're a
vegetarian who wants to convince a meat
eater to give up eating meat
the conclusion you're trying to sell is
essentially you should give up meat
so to construct an argument write that
conclusion add the word because next to
it and then fill in the blank
what you write after this because is the
main claim of the argument that you'll
have to prove
for example you might write we should
give up meat because modern industrial
farming causes great suffering to
animals
after that you'll need to establish the
truth of your main Claim by supplying
evidence such as further facts and
information
you might point to the conditions in
which animals on factory farms live you
could say they live in extreme
confinement or unhygienic conditions
or you might point to their behavior
such as signs of abnormal aggression and
distress
evidence takes many forms so there are a
lot of possibilities here
and once you've sufficiently Justified
the truth of your main claim is your job
done
not quite
you still need to explain why the main
claim supports your conclusion that
people should stop eating meat
that last part of an argument is the one
that's most often forgotten
in the rush to pylon reasons and
evidence for the main claim people often
forget to explain why it all matters
just consider a meat eater might accept
everything you've said about the
conditions of animals on factory farms
and yet they could still shrug their
shoulders
and they have a point so far it isn't
clear why anyone should stop eating meat
as opposed to say eating meat less often
or being a bit more selective about
which meat they buy
so you need to make that connection
explicit
in this example You could argue that not
eating meat is the strongest action you
can do as a consumer to pressure the
meat industry to change its ways
and then you can support this claim with
further Evidence
that is an argument it's not quite as
simple as it first sounded as it
it requires careful structuring and
logical progression and it helps to have
a good memory for facts and details
try writing your arguments down the more
you practice putting arguments together
on paper the easier it'll be to make
them when you're speaking
now unless you're having an argument
with yourself which of course is fine
you're not going to be the only person
making arguments in a debate your
opponent might also be making some good
points and that means the next skill you
need to get good at is rebuttal
as we've just mentioned every argument
has to prove two things that the claims
it makes are true and that they support
the conclusion
so to refute an argument you simply need
to do the opposite you need to show
either that the claims your opponent is
making are not true or that even if they
are they don't actually support the
conclusion
so let's look at another example this
time a little less serious
let's say your partner is trying to
convince you to buy a new car because
the old hatchback you're driving just
isn't fashionable anymore
you on the other hand are quite fond of
your old clunker you don't really feel
like forking over the money for a new
one
you need to rebut her point so what do
you say
first you could Target the truth of her
claim in which case you have several
options
you could either argue straight up that
her claim is factually incorrect no
people are buying more hatchbacks today
than they ever have before and I can
prove it
alternatively
You could argue her view lacks evidence
you could say you haven't even given me
any reason to believe that Fashions are
changing
or if she does have evidence You could
argue that it's inconclusive
it's true that fewer people in our
neighborhood drive houchbacks but that
doesn't necessarily reflect a national
trend
your other option is to accept that your
partner's claim is true
but argue that it doesn't support the
conclusion that you should buy a new car
here you have two more options
you can either argue that it's not
important at all yes I know it's
fashionable but I don't care what other
people think
or you could argue that the argument is
outweighed by other factors
yes I would prefer to drive a
fashionable car but I also have to think
about the money
hopefully this exercise has given you a
sense of just how many directions you
can go in for pushing back against
another person's arguments
of course not all arguments are going to
be so easy to refute
you can avoid a lot of hemming and
hawing if you show up to an argument
prepared
the real world doesn't always afford US
time to prepare
but if you do know you have an argument
coming up
try this it's a debate prep technique
called side switch
side switch involves stepping into your
opponent's shoes to try and guess what
they're going to say
so for five minutes really try to set
your own convictions aside and consider
the debate from their perspective
then
brainstorm as many arguments as you can
in favor of their View
when that's done all that's left is to
come up with a rebuttal for each one of
these arguments
that way you'll know exactly what to say
if they raise this point in real life
the purpose of side switch is to help us
pre-empt our opponent's lines of attack
but the effect of this imaginative
exercise is often that we see our
opponent's side more clearly
our own convictions become unsettled and
we usually end up approaching the
argument with more seriousness openness
and respect
okay so far we've covered the content of
what you should say in an argument but
what you say isn't everything
you also need to think about how you say
it that's where rhetoric comes in
rhetoric is the study of how to speak
persuasively
it's a broad subject which includes
everything from the words and structure
of your speech to the tone of your voice
to the body language you use to express
yourself
all of these can affect how people
perceive you
and just think who are you more likely
to believe someone who speaks
confidently and fluidly or someone who
appears nervous and breaks into um every
few seconds
admittedly rhetoric has a bad reputation
these days
it's often used synonymously with the
kind of hollow and misleading speech
that politicians use to obscure the
truth and manipulate the public
and there's definitely something to this
criticism
but there's also another side to
rhetoric that's decidedly more positive
when used in the right way rhetoric can
be truth's greatest Ally helping to
spread ideas further and inspiring
people to act on what they hear
the fact is people have a very high butt
off the couch threshold in other words
it takes a ridiculous amount of energy
to move people to act in this world
you can't just rely on facts alone to
move people only people can do that
so we shouldn't give up on rhetoric just
yet
thankfully
Bozo has come up with a few handy rules
of thumb for more persuasive speaking
let's take a look at these
the first rule is Clarity is key
you won't convince anyone if they don't
know what you're talking about
so avoid using abstract words and ditch
those confusing metaphors
what's more be specific use concrete
examples to explain your points
the second rule is cut the excess
cut anything from your speech that
doesn't contribute to the arguments you
make
that means stick to the point don't
Bramble avoid unnecessary repetition and
excessive qualification
don't bother with long-winded
introductions just get to the point
before you lose the listener's attention
and here's the third rule make it
personal
if you can strike an emotional chord
with your audience they'll be more
engaged and more sympathetic to your
cause
so speak to the listeners needs and
experiences directly
sprinkle in some stories from your own
life
and relate your arguments back to what
they mean for real people
and finally you also need to pay
attention to the manner of your speech
you'll appear far more persuasive if you
can speak fluidly without stops and
starts
speaking fluidly is perhaps the most
difficult thing to master
but you can get there through practice
competitive Debaters do speaking drills
to improve their flow and weed out
distracting quirks in their speech
take this drill for example
give a one minute speech to a friend
every time you trip up or say um
your friend throws a paper ball at you
repeat that speech until you can get
through it without being hit
and here's another one
try making an argument while inserting a
random fruit between every word like
this
tax banana Haven's banana should banana
bee banana band banana
doing speaking drills over and over
again can be tedious
but it comes with the promise of a great
reward An Elegant form of speaking
that's sure to make people stop and
listen
you've just been introduced to the
principles of debate what to say and how
to say it
you can already begin practicing by
trying out the exercises outlined in
This Blink of course the easiest way to
harness the power of debate is just to
debate
if the idea of staging a formal debate
with teams and judges seems a bit
awkward to squeeze into your daily
routine don't worry about it
you can reap all the benefits of formal
debate just by debating with your
friends and colleagues in the normal way
the important thing is to remember that
all parties consent to having an
argument you treat each other with
respect and you try your best not to
take it personally
when it comes to Society at large many
leaders are beginning to appreciate the
power of debate to enhance learning and
solve problems
as you hear this movements are already
underway all over the world to
incorporate debate into school
curriculums and workplace procedures
Warren Buffett for example recently
floated the idea of hiring two advisors
before making any big acquisition
one to argue in favor of the move and
the other against
these are exciting developments
still debate has the potential to be so
much more than a decision-making tool
debate holds the key to solving some of
today's most pressing problems
if democratic governments only committed
to educating their citizens and debate
and established forums for doing it such
as citizen assemblies debate could be a
powerful force for repairing social
Division and invigorating Democratic
participation
as Citizens we have a responsibility to
learn how to debate well to deliberate
with our neighbors on matters that
affect everyone to settle our disputes
with reasoned argument rather than
violence to listen to one another's
concerns and make compromises
debate is the very soul of civic
participation
and to give up on it would be to give up
on the social project all together
