(00:00) this episode is brought to you by curiosity stream get free access to nebula the new streaming platform built by and for creators when you sign up for curiosity stream at the link below well governments globally are enacting strict measures to contain the corona virus raising questions about individual freedoms and privacy rights during a pandemic Netanyahu has caught for the formation of an emergency Garmin South Korea's takin similar steps by using mobile phone and satellite technology to track potential carriers Congress has
(00:34) granted additional powers to president without death to address the kovat 19 outbreak in the country the emergency decree gives various powers including the potential restriction of domestic travel censoring the media but what we're really concerned about is that this location tracking this health related information is going to be used for other purposes particularly by governments who are using surveillance to track down activists or human rights defenders or journalists or even opposition figures you know what they
(01:05) say you should never let a good crisis go to waste for would-be autocrats around the world any chance to secure evermore iron-fisted control of their country is a good thing and the corona virus pandemic is quite an opportunity what better chance do you have of implementing draconian laws than when all your citizens are under strict shelter-in-place orders it's no surprise that some world leaders have jumped at the chance to consolidate power but under such dire circumstances are their actions justified a deadly global threat
(01:32) does call for an unprecedented response but there's a difference between unprecedented measures and unlimited control the laws passed and powers granted during crises are often hastily reviewed or voted upon without much deliberation and this can lead to serious problems it's not uncommon to see laws passed in response to a particular crisis situation stick around long after the crisis is resolved for example Congress the White House and the Pentagon have all been mighty busy this week but what more do we know after a
(02:00) week of shifting messages concerning health politics and war today the president signed a big new anti-terrorism bill that would expand the government's ability to track down terrorists but at some cost mr. speaker some of my colleagues today will offer a bill to reauthorize the Patriot Act it'll have the thin varnish of reform on it designed to whitewash the egregious constitutional violations that have been going on the Patriot Act was drafted in response to 9/11 it was designed to make it easier for
(02:34) intelligence agencies to gather information on suspected terrorists with the unpleasant side effect of allowing drastically increased surveillance on the American public that was back in 2001 it's now 20/20 almost two decades later and were still stuck with it this is pretty common once a population is used to something they become desensitized so what if the government is spying on us right 9/11 gave the United States in particular very useful cover in expanding the power of the state in keeping an eye on its citizens
(03:01) what we're seeing with coronavirus is much more widespread and shockingly authoritarian the Philippines Israel Thailand the US Britain Bolivia South Korea and in the most brazen example Hungary have all granted emergency powers that would be unthinkable under any other circumstance Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu has given his security agencies the power to track citizens using their cell phone data and has ordered the nation's courts to shut down conveniently for stalling his trial for corruption South Korea who should be
(03:31) commended for flattening the curve in their country still implemented incredibly intrusive surveillance measures that will likely remain in place after the pandemic passes in the Philippines president Duterte who once compared his country's constitution to a scrap of toilet paper was granted near limitless power to handle the corona virus which is rather alarming considering his track record of jailing critics threatening journalists and pushing for the return of the death penalty to aid in his violent war on
(03:54) drugs the Prime Minister of Thailand has assumed the authority to censor the media and journalists have been threatened and sued for criticizing the government's response to the crisis in Bolivia elections have been suspended another instance of convenient timing because the upcoming presidential election which had been scheduled for May was going to be quite high-profile the previous President Evo Morales had been deposed in a military coup after violent protests rocked the nation the interim president has now consolidated
(04:20) power ordered military police to suppress large demonstrations and intends to formally run for the office sometime later in the year the United States I avoided new legislation that would have allowed the indefinite detaining of citizens without trial as well as the repeal of legal protections for asylum seekers even British leadership has ended up with some very questionable new powers including a two-year license to indefinitely detain people suspected of having coronavirus banned protests and put 20,000 troops on standby which
(04:46) supposedly won't be used for additional policing while authorizing the detaining of citizens based on suspicion alone is very problematic what we're seeing from Hungary is downright terrifying Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban already widely denounced as a wannabe dictator has finally found his chance to snatch up all the powers he's ever wanted our bond now has the power to suspend already existing laws bypass Parliament on new ones that he doesn't like limit freedom of expression and suspend all elections and referenda and
(05:14) just to be safe he demanded these powers indefinitely he is now ruling the country by personal decree so there you go that's how you get a dictator some additional new legislation gives Orban broad authority to arrest and imprison anyone he finds to have distributed distorted or false information as defined by himself of course our bond is perhaps the clearest example of a politician obviously and successfully dragging their country to autocracy over the past decade the ruling party led by Viktor Orban have waged war on every
(05:43) institution that could challenge their propaganda machine they took over the majority of the nation's media handing it off to one of Orban's childhood friends they shaped University curriculum to suit their twisted view of history they've torn down old monuments and replaced them with installations honoring Hungary's interwar fascist regime now after a decade of work the transformation into an intensely nationalist and as one Hungarian philosopher put it post fascist Hungary is complete our bond has secured total
(06:09) control including a puppet Parliament erased the actual history of the nation and fabricated a glorious new mythology watch what happens in Hungary the track record of giving people like Orban unlimited power is not very good but there is a glimmer of hope some of the Hungarian people have put up a sort of protest art installation in Freedom Square they've installed barbed wire and placed shoes pictures letters clothes and other items that belong to murdered Hungarian Jews in the square as a reminder that there is a more accurate
(06:36) version of history and it's not what orb√°n and his cronies are pushing power grabs like those we're seeing in Hungary are not uncommon in times of crisis and if there's not a legitimate crisis around when they need it would be autocrats have no problem fabricating one but whether real or fabricated authoritarians often ride a wave of popular support to their end goal of absolute power take for example the deadly apartment bombings in Russia in 1999 allegedly committed by Chechen terrorists the bombings resulted in a
(07:02) surge of support for then Prime Minister Vladimir Putin which allowed him to consolidate power and crack down on his critics we've seen it all throughout history Hitler using the 1933 Reichstag fire to stoke fear curb civil liberties and enable the creation of the Nazi Party the fabrication of a communist plot to overthrow the Brazilian government in 1937 which allowed President Vargas to dissolve the Constitution and establish a dictatorship a failed 2016 coup in Turkey leading to a two-year state of emergency during which air to gan
(07:29) tightened his grip on the nation and now or bonds ascension to Supreme Leader in part thanks to a legitimate global health crisis the rest of the world needs to take notice of how Hungarians are standing up to Orban besides keeping themselves and their families safe opposing the spread of authoritarianism is the most essential thing any citizen can do in times like these and that goes for people in any country not just those on the brink like Hungary if the people don't stand up to the lawmakers passing
(07:53) draconian legislation that trampled on their rights and essential freedoms then there's likely no stopping them it's always much more difficult to get rid of laws that have become part of the status quo like the Patriot Act so yes we need to take unprecedented action to prevent the spread of coronavirus but we also need to be aware of how those in power take advantage of crisis scenarios for their own benefit it's up to average citizens to hold their leaders accountable and fight for not only the
(08:16) preservation of democracy but also its expansion when you see the power start to consolidate in the hands of a tiny minority it's time to speak up if you'd like to learn more about the crisis making these authoritarian power grabs possible I highly recommend you check out coronavirus race for a vaccine on curiosity stream it's a nice short documentary about the methods used to slow the spread of the virus while we search for a solution if you watch my videos you'll know I'm a big fan of curiosity stream it's an online
