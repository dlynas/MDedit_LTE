Transcript:
(00:05) um me that's a welcome what is it a tuesday and you get a welcome like that you gotta be some mad to give people i give a welcome like that on a tuesday i appreciate it right let's start with the headlines i swear now started swearing in my stand-up comedy 10 years in the game i've been a pretty clean comedian and i effing jeff that much and as a result i've attracted a demographic who to be frank i hate it's a bunch of old people and christians every goddamn show i'm sick of it gotta ditch these
(01:08) christos asap seriously man after every single gig some mum comes up to me oh me and my daughter love that one may as well quit now then if you and your daughter are enjoying it on the same level the am i doing i hate old people so god damn much those stupidest people in the world and they tell comedians how to do comedy every night of the week oh it's so refreshing to see a young comedian who doesn't have to resort to swearing to me you should never have to swear in order to be funny you know back in my day comedians didn't need to
(01:43) swear no they were all massive bigots and you love that don't tell me what isn't isn't offensive you old i know some of you are sitting there all smug oh i'm okay i'm not an old person or a chris oh i'm in the clear yeah perhaps but you do know who your patronus is you're a dork a dorky old christos night after night most of my audience are white the worst of all the races plus middle class as hell watching me and laughing while spilling your slur all over the shop it's embarrassing it's an embarrassing
(02:23) career and chill out like just because i swear now and i'm cool that doesn't mean you've accidentally bought tickets to see an edgy comedian and i understand your concern most edgy comics look like me race and gender wise they say whatever they like edgy comedians no one tells them what they can and can't say they walk straight on stage top of their specials sometimes do 10 solid minutes just slagging off transgender people but straight out the gate just making fun of transgender people if people on the internet get upset
(02:55) about it the comedian's always like bad luck that's my job i'm a stand-up comedian i'm meant to challenge people if you don't like being challenged don't watch my shows what's the matter guys to challenging fire that's my job i'm a stand-up comedian i'm meant to challenge people if you don't like being challenged don't watch my shows what's the matter guys too challenging for you that's my job i'm a stand-up comedian i'm meant to challenge people if you don't like being
(03:22) challenged don't watch my shows what's the matter guys to charging fire oh yeah because you know it's been long overdue a challenge the trans community oh they've had their guard down for too long if you ask me they'll all be checking their privilege on the way home now thanks to you your brave little cis boy i used to name one of the comedians that was about in that routine but it always got really awkward in the room so apparently it's 2019 most people still more than happy to laugh at
(03:59) transgender people not as comfortable laughing at ricky gervais yet i've discovered that's the line night after night off leave ricky alone oh this is classic liberal are what i can't make for the transgender people anymore but it's fine for you to gang up on ricky gervais is it i thought liberals are about to treat everyone the same nope ah no actually not to treat everyone the same we haven't got equality yet can't go around treating everyone the same before you've got equality what you go past the school
(04:31) see a bully punch another kid in the face and get out your car go up to the bully you make me sick and just for balance you're a piece of as well that was even handed i'm a good person i'll treat everyone the same you
