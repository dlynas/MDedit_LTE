Universals of Language Part 3

## Transcript:
of language
uh path to a new primer so we're still
in chapter three of the primer guide
so during this segment we're going to be
looking at linguistics and how that
affects developing literacy primers
so we've been talking about in the
previous two segments the
oral part of language the sound and
the words and the sentences and the
discourse
but now we're going to be looking at
moving from what we call the
sound to the graph theme or the written
symbol and it's completely
to
that can vary from language to language
so when we go from oral to written we
realize that some languages have a
one-to-one correlation of a sound
to a symbol and some of the newer uh
translations of the bible and the manure
the languages that are more recently
been
gone from an oral to a written tradition
the linguists have tried to keep that
core
one-to-one correlation more uh
there the other languages have a mixture
so for example english is very
one of these so one graphene cannot have
multiple sounds
sliding
by
literacy to try and show people what the
sound is that goes with those
symbols also in english we have one
sound and multiple graphemes so like
ah the toning ah
in english can be written with the aw
saw or the au because
and so once again it makes linguistics
the literacy a little bit more
challenging
now we have different writing systems
that have developed over time
one is the alphabet a set of symbols
used to represent the basic
sounds of a language they have like our
roman alphabet which many of us are used
to english uses the roman alphabet
french a lot of our
different languages korean is an
alphabet although it's
it looks very different than
one symbol a symbol to sound correlation
and here you can see
as you like mentioned in some of those
eastern european languages
it is
we have what we call a syllabary and one
symbol is equal to a syllable
so for example the devanagari script
that's used in hindi and many other
languages around
india um so this symbol by itself
means ka so it's the k
and the ah sound so in each of these
symbols it's
the consonant sound plus the ah
vowel sound and so you can see that
um but then when they're they're put
together then they would
uh get again like a consonant cluster
that kind of thing
we have arabic which is also a syllabary
so each symbol in arabic brings with it
an intrinsic vowel sound as well
then we have pictographic or idiographic
writing system
such as the chinese writing system now
chinese
is kind of a misnomer in terms of
language because
there's many different languages in
china cantonese
mandarin that use this writing script
so for instance the chinese script
for dog is this right here
but the word the sound for dog
would be different in cantonese and
mandarin
so you can't really read with a
sound sound symbol correlation for those
so it's
that picture of the idea that's behind
that
so along with all of those things we
think about social linguistics
and this is the study of the relation
between language and society
they think about different dialects of a
language you know like in english you
have
in english spoken in england you have
english spoken in north america
canada usa but then even within those
like usa you'll have different
or any of those countries different kind
of pronunciations or words associated
with
that area or that part of the country
and so how those all relate together is
very important
one example is the like the
akan primer in ghana
akan is kind of a larger language
group and within a con there's four or
five different
dialect groups and they're actually
mutually understandable
but they seen as very distinct languages
by the people who speak those
and so when the bible society tried to
have a
um one bible and one
literacy primer that covered all those
dialects it ended up not working because
the different language dialect groups
had not
agreed they they wanted their language
so now
donna is in the process of making those
individual
bibles and literacy primers
and pragmatics is concerned with the use
of language and social context and the
ways
in which people produce and comprehend
meanings through language
when we think about all those things how
does that mean for our primers
so in the prayer looking
uh reading uh the language to get to
meaning
so so the symbols that are used to make
words
and those words that are then used to
make sentences and then
story or discourse so the letters letter
groupings clusters the syllables etc
that we'll use to in our lessons
how the words are broken down into
syllables is important
how how that that can work and the
natural discourse of course
that we want natural story
in in each lesson we need good teamwork
between the language experts
i.e the native speakers or linguists who
have studied the language
and know a lot about it and the premier
method experts are the
i the lei train consultants it's very
important to have that partnership
so why can we use the same primer method
for many languages
the answers universals of language and
while the languages are distinct with
their combination of sounds to meaning
their phonology and unique
with their their
graphemes often they're they're
universal and using the same building
blocks
so we've been talking about those over
the course of these three
um things so i'd like you in the class
comments to list the building blocks
come into all languages
and maybe just share a little bit about
your first language about some of the
building blocks that are in there so
thank you and
we'll see you in the next video
