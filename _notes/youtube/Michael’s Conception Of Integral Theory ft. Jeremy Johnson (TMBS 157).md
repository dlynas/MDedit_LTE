![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HGGAAquvVM)

## Transcript:

i
am here with jeremy johnson and i'm
making him re-record this
intro because i butchered the name of
his book
and i want to do it justice so jeremy is
a author host of a podcast
editor and his book the infamous
seeing through the world gene gepsler an
integral consciousness did i do it
almost kept sir
jeremy was a a dear friend and colleague
of my brothers
uh he hosts the podcast mutations
got that one okay michael is on episode
five you definitely should check out
that conversation
and jeremy um i think the last time you
had a kind of longer conversation with
michael on tnbs was episode 103
and today um jeremy and i
watched michael's live stream which
everyone should check out from july 16th
michael had this really beautiful live
stream it's about 20 minutes
and um we're about to play a clip and
it's it's like the eight minutes in the
middle and
michael just really gets going and just
really starts
breaking down what this you know
international cosmopolitan socialist you
know kind of theory
and and um you know what what really
what what he meant by that and what he
thought we needed to
be open to and and how we had to be um
nuancing and widening our thinking to
really get there
and um jeremy if you just wanna you say
hello i love your jacobin i love you
against the web thanks for
for that of course glad to represent um
but yeah again thank you um for having
me
on tpnbs it's an honor to be speaking
with you and to
be talking with the tmbs community um
yeah i think this video
is a really good example of the kind of
thinking michael was
advocating for that the left needed and
that really kind of comes across
and we'll talk about it in in the
recording after the com
after his uh clip that you know complex
thinking and flexibility and empathy are
just so
vital for the left and this is really a
kind of
like i think we mentioned this as well
like this is this is what
our project is you know like in terms of
what do we do now
and and how does the left continue to
evolve and i think
michael had a very clear vision so
this is a model that is about like what
does it actually mean to be truly global
to the extent we can local national and
international simultaneously east west
north south
but from a place of actual growth and
empathy
and this is where again this this
questions of consciousness come in
the questions of cultivating empathy
cultivating compassion cultivating
awareness
the complete antithesis of social media
modes
long-term thinking compassion seeing
complexity
comfort with oneself solitude
the opposite of instant gratification
the attempt to constantly
humanize and not dehumanize your fellow
humans
these are all completely countervailing
forces
to the market technologic that subsumes
all of us today
and so integral theory
which is something that a lot of you
know it covers a lot of uh
people sri aurobindo was a great indian
interval theorist william irwin thompson
was a fascinating public intellectual
the most well-known guy is probably a
guy named ken wilber who i'll tell you
uh
in my opinion has some you know he's
when it comes to things like politics
policy history the guy this is not the
guy's i believe it's very diplomatic
just not his strong suit
he's not uh informed or up on that stuff
then it affects his analysis
but this model has
definitely created some brilliant maps
of integrating world views
which we really need to do we need to
have a much greater understanding
of both how other people are seeing
experiencing and then enacting in the
world
this is a necessity it's a necessity
with all of the extraordinary splits in
the united states and the kind of
serious analysis we need to figure out
even the different types of ruling class
right now in this society
thank you so much and it also is going
to be
very necessary as the united states
declines
relatively speaking that's one of the
things you know that shows up in the
china coverage on the show
of course we need to talk about the
crisis dealing
you know and the horrific repression of
the eugers as an example and i care
quite a bit about
the tibetan uh oppression as well
but we also need to understand literally
the chinese world view
to the extent we can we need to
understand these things not in
and and in a bipartisan way uh
and well beyond that boring word in the
united states
not in that milktoa centrist
we all just figured out meat in some
crappy middle
but literally that we need to humanize
as many as possible and then try to
create cohesion
to enact real systems change because
right now you see so much of these
velocity of serious social action in the
united states i mean
they still we're we're still
hugely behind there isn't the
countervailing force of labor to capital
these uprisings are extraordinary where
are they going
in some good directions but also the new
boon and the toxic horrifying grotesque
hr industry
the diversity consulting scam which is
often just companies covering their
asses from discrimination lawsuits they
should
face with very little empirical basis in
the research and then of course a
renewal
and another cycle of the horrifying
toxicity of online culture
so we need to get to this place with
of of of humanization understanding and
synthesis and
ultimately my frame is that cosmopolitan
socialist frame that's what i'm most
excited about but the integral frame
what it does
is it has um among other things a
quadrant model
which i think is fascinating i'll just
explain it to that this is the book
it's uh it's not a great i mean it's a
good book it's got some good theory it's
very dated in other ways but it's got
some
good outlines here it's called the
theory of everything by ken wilbur
and the quadrants
map different views of the world
what you have on the right side is
objective systems and on the left side
subjective systems and then you have at
the base
uh social and at the uh top individual i
could be actually mixing those up
so in other words let's take it you know
really clearly
you're an individual you're dealing with
something like depression
uh which familiar with
there could be subjective and objective
components of it
maybe you're you know maybe there's
something happening with you
physiologically
you address it that way but then there's
also deep questions of your life and
meaning
and how you feel and how you treat
others and how you're treated
and those are the subjective realms they
both matter in the
lore and the um social systems
there's objective systems there's
objective systems that this is the way
we
remove currency this is how technology
works this is how economy works
but then there's always cultural stories
that correlate with them
right this is again we go back
historically we look at the rise
of the taxonomy of european racism and
white supremacy
it correlates there's the expansion of
your of colonialism and imperialism
and then we do uh and then and then
those cultures
manifest taxonomies of other human
beings and stories and narratives
religious and quote unquote scientific
to justify racism so those things
are working in the objective and
subjective realms
and inc and so what he does is he kind
of shows you that a lot of different
world views
they all can have validity but they're
usually coming from one of these
different viewpoints a lot of people
will say like okay the main source of
the action
is individual subjectivity right the
main source of the action is individual
objectivity the main source the action
is social materiality
or the main source of the action is uh
cultural stories and myths and the
answer from wilbur and the answer
actually if you read gramsci in a
certain way is integral and then
it's all it's all of the above
and then we start to have this
perspective of wanting to have some
flexibility in how we look at things and
and and a deep tolerance like the
tolerance that someone like a pepe
mojica talks about
not a kind of you know yeah well you
just got to tolerate everybody it's it's
it's deeper because like also ultimately
you do it's another
dynamic
tolerate everything you have battles in
politics but you
you you want to understand the engine of
different world views
and in that mix he's including
and better modernism in certain ways
points to this and certainly you know
jeremy johnson the contemplative work
and at its best some connection to a
spiritual
practice or any type of conscientious
cultivation of empathy
now we're all trying and we're all
failing that's the point that also
cultivates the self-compassion is going
to give us some of the capacity
to have some of the sort of flexibility
of mind and emotions
to move in between world views pivot in
between them and start to create some of
that synthesis
that sort of real range of empathy and
intellect
well um that's quite a dense clip i feel
like there's
multiple uh you know it seems like
michael is kind of writing many
thesis within that you know that was
only part of a 20-minute live stream
i i suggest everyone go and watch all 20
minutes
um but jeremy i mean
do you want to just start off with just
this idea
of how i guess my takeaway
and maybe this is different than yours
but i guess like the fundamental thread
that i hear michael's touching on
is cultivating this deep empathy
and this ability to
not only understand our truth and and be
clear in
in that but also understand that there
can be so many truths
and i feel like so much of what michael
practiced and emulated was
deep empathy and compassion and clarity
that there was great evil
and and really horrific things happening
in the world
but also everyone's
reality is valid and that is their truth
so i know that's like
quite a a jumping off point but that was
kind of
i don't know at least how i interpreted
what he was getting at
no i thought i thought uh essentially
the same thing in this in this
presentation like
we need to have empathy for where people
are coming from but
it's not enough just to have the
intellectual assessment that okay here's
the
historical analysis or here are the um
general conceptions of this particular
worldview we also have to go like what
is the experience that people are
enacting in the world why are they
driven to do this
like can i empathize enough with them to
understand
and i think it's also important that he
did mention like political battles
are still going to happen there's still
going to be conflict it's just
we have to be coming from a place where
we really understand
our our opponent in a sense and and
almost um i used to practice martial
arts
when i was a little younger and there's
this kind of sense of really kind of
becoming
your opponent in that in that sort of
exchange
um on the battlefield or on the on the
in the dojo or whatever you want to call
it so like i think there is this
empathy taking that's really important
and it's central to
a capacity to take that other position
and
you need you need both you need like the
empathetic capacity which is like a
consciousness capacity and then you also
need more of the
the kind of cognitive intellectual
curiosity to go
go ahead and you know read your
opponents and read what the
the intellectual dark web is talking
about and how they're organizing their
world view
if you can't then you're not really
going to be able to reach them you're
not really going to be able to
understand their motivations and drives
and ultimately you know it's it's doing
a disservice to
you know the ultimate aims that
michael's talking about in terms of
creating a better a better world
creating a more
uh uh you know cosmopolitan socialism
uh an ecumenical planetary culture
you know um so we need that capacity
it's like i think it's really
that was what i got from it just we need
to develop
these capacities both of empathy and
cognitive
flexibility and so integral theory for
for
michael and for me as well was like an
introduction to that
and he kind of goes into the the
quadrant analysis and he talks about you
know
you have to kind of consider the
subjective and the inter-subjective
and the systems but then also the
individual and then also maybe
you know the biological and medical so
like
everything's kind of in that picture but
i like to think of interval theory as a
sort of
like a training wheel situation where
it's teaching us to think with
complexity and
kind of nudging us to make that a daily
practice in terms of like understanding
uh what's going on in the world and as a
start
yeah no i think it's important and i i i
see this behavior in myself and i see it
a lot on the left where
lots of times the impulse to kind of
narrow one's thinking or shut something
out comes from a reaction of like seeing
something that feels really grotesque or
hateful
and and so the impulse is to like
protect the people around you or protect
yourself from from this type of thinking
but then
you know it's challenging terrain to
navigate
like you know re training your brain to
hold multiple truths
but also not make any you know
justification or exceptions for for
things that just truly
need to end you know michael is so good
at saying like it's disgusting that's
bad analysis that's incorrect but
i think oftentimes the reason he was
able to speak just so definitively and
so clearly
was because he was holding so many
truths at once
it wasn't just that he kept we talked
about this yesterday when we were on the
phone like
the idea of not just reading to
reinforce your world view
um so i i guess when i'm when i'm
listening to michael when i'm listening
to you and you know
my understanding of integral theory is
very thin i've read a little bit of
wilbur it kind of ends in the in the
color wheel of it all
um but it's it's like kind of
how do we encourage
you know feeling like you're you're
standing
in what's important to you culturally
and morally
but also challenging yourself to kind of
stretch your
thinking not to compromise what you feel
is right and wrong but to
deepen and and make what you feel
or see as right and wrong in the world
something that you can kind of express
and connect with more people around is
it
is that kind of you see that
yeah like like almost developing a kind
of resiliency like knowing you can go
into
um a different media bubble and actually
know that language
and still be firmly situated in a
critique of it but actually your
critique goes deeper because you're
really kind of hearing
empathizing understanding that
orientation or perspective worldview
and then being able to there's more
power in that there's more power in them
actually feeling like your opponent
actually feeling heard and acknowledged
and not straw manning their position
um and really getting under their skin
in a way and i think that
develops a capacity in in you of
resilience
and being able to do that right so um
i i think against the web was a good
example because michael was engaging
with
the idw for a number of years and sam
harris and
and and all that stuff um i don't know
how deep we want to go
into all that but but he was able to
really kind of look at what they're
actually saying
and at least take it seriously enough to
deconstruct it and then
i think the other element of this um
isn't just deconstruction and kind of
like winning over
um the right but really kind of
answering some of these
very human drives that would drive
people towards
you know the idw in terms of meaning
making
spirituality um uh living a meaningful
fulfilling life which is
very difficult and what did he call it
um the the the market technologic
right this sort of deep sense of
atomization so many people are feeling
and so you know we have to look at the
motivations and drives
that people um are going to these
communities are orienting around
um and what those are actually like
subjectively like
and then when you do that i think you
have you stand a better chance to say
like
look i understand where you're coming
from i understand the tensions here
but here's here's another offering and i
think this is what he really wanted to
do michael
in the sense of like offering a
constructive
regenerative uh synthesis-oriented left
which is
which was not afraid of spirituality not
afraid of you know
meaning making but also deeply deeply
rooted and grounded in
material analysis and yeah i mean
i think but but to do that
we really kind of need this capacity for
intellectual curiosity um i've been
floating this word around it's from
a paper by mary oxman she's calling it
anti-disciplinarity just like
really being voracious in our
intellectual curiosity and jumping
across disciplines and
and looking at different perspectives
and just sort of
seeing how those differences can
actually kind of combine into something
novel and emergent
and so i think michael was just really
good at that just naturally and so
integral theory for him was like oh
that's kind of my brain right so and i
think he was encouraging the left to
take that up as a capacity because
as he says like it's so necessary today
