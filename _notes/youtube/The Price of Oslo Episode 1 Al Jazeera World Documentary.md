(09:24) have in no way in the late 1970s there was a common bond of socialist ideology between Norway's Labour Party and its namesake in Israel one of the key players in this special relationship was a prominent Labour Party member of Norway's Parliament Johann Juergen Holst mister Holst was a first person at the political level to meet mr.
(09:54) Lara thoughts he was deputy minister and state secretary in all the Ministry of Defence he came to Beirut and was traveled on too easy to Israel in July I think it was in 79 he met with Yasser Arafat and the after our effort invited the whole group to a very pleasant dinner mr. host had very close contact with Israelis and that that aspect of mr.
(10:31) horse made him even more interesting to mr. Arafat yesterday with our efforts interesting Norway was ideally only context visa we are taught well that in noise I hear conflicting emitters and so fair enough autonomy Roman leaders investors in conflict Nirvana's class a-advanced : in revitalizing Bisutti Holston state who can neighbors ear develop a route was aramis a trauma tell that you come to another school Hana Hana Mazzara Kuwaiti a memo to the Fijian Oh bleep man in 1979 the Shah of Iran fled into exile Israel lost an ally and a major oil
(11:15) supplier the United States asked Norway to guarantee to sell its North Sea oil to Israel concerned about repercussions for its UN troops in Lebanon Norway sent its diplomat hands longer to seek assurances from Arafat mr. Arafat after defecting only for a few seconds he said I will have no objection to such an Allegiant guarantee to Israel on one condition benign in the secret back channel to Israel you provided Yasser Arafat wanted the Norwegians to act as intermediary between himself and Israel in regions and region government were just shocked
(12:06) to hear the message coming back from Arab Earth so from 1979 and every air from their own words the Norwegians tried to set up a secret back channel between the PLO and Israel but Israel were absolutely not women at all to listen to anything that the Norwegian could come up with from Arafat and the PLO in 1982 the PLO lost its space in Lebanon Palestinian fighters were forced to depart following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon three months earlier a u.s.
(13:05) brokered deal led to Arafat and his entourage moving to Tunisia it was actually an imitation from our effort to my predecessor as foreign minister near inland and myself I have been defense minister and he went in 1982 for New Year's Eve without a thought in Tunis at that time I referred asked us directly if he could help him getting a direct contact between Peru and the Israeli labor party and I was at that time a member of the Assembly of the socialist international and it turned out to be a strong interest in the socialist international for trying
(14:11) to contribute to normalization all the relationship between Palestinians and the Israelis to help with his charm offensive Arafat turned to senior PLO member he Sam citta we to act as his main go between I love what appointed dr. sad Toby and he came here visit me because I should take care of this from the region side and I had a very good impression of him I believe that the PLO has been the greatest achievement of our suffering people I believe that the P and O is the most needed object but it be undone we should meet in albufeira
(14:59) there was the socialist international had its assembly meeting now very important and then there were some shooting suddenly and we rushed out in the lobby and there was there was south of adulticide are we killed shot down he Samsa tari lay where he'd been killed by a lone gunman who pumped five shots into his chest it has never been clearly verified who ordered the assassination of Satara but the motive appears to be because he was talking to the Israelis on Arafat's behalf dr. Soto we took his own position
(15:44) he did swim against the stream in face of great objection and danger Arafat continued a double game on the one hand seeking discreet diplomatic channels to Israel via the Norwegians while on the other hand publicly maintaining a revolutionary rhetoric Oh and the fatigue larimar bedeck we who do digital ma Stoltenberg death eden vo do la yaani liking that Khun Arif initial ELISA Sally let me know Stoughton back in myself and the work of diamond is Hezbollah man Meza has been there - right like Nana Yanni Hefner and NAB de Vienna

(17:29) no other thing I had promised never to tell anyone I have not told anyone and I am Telling You no ID and part of my success in life is is not coming from what I say but from all the things I didn't say in the mid-80s the Labour Party in Israel formed a coalition government with the its action ia's liquor party shamea gave a nod and a wink for la cude member mascha Amer EV to hold secret talks with Palestinian politician Faisal al husseiny in Jerusalem discussion centered on PLO recognition of Israel autonomy on the West Bank and
(18:14) a federal relationship with Jordan the so called am arab Husseini plan became a model for the subsequent Oslo Accords years later but all that was soon dwarfed by the outbreak of the First Intifada a Palestinian uprising which took both Israel and the PLO by surprise stop the riots and let's stop mr.

(19:34) Minister Stoltenberg to Israeli Foreign Minister Peres Stoltenberg wrote that only by relieving itself of the burden of the occupied territories can Israel succeed and prosper I am ready to talk with any Palestinian that will renounce terror that will accept two for two and three three eight and recognizes that come and negotiate with us then you can play whatever you want the menu terminan Equis Adele Philistine Iggy armlet Zephie most on aha they can fill Walker can yes Arafat you read on your cool not new new offical car are meeting with ten

(23:13) terrorism all forms of tourism including and the Arafat had accepted the Israeli terms to start negotiations I repeat for the records in December 1988 PLO leader Yasser Arafat known to his colleagues as Abu Ammar and publicly renounced violence or formas or God it is over the years Norway had discreetly been talking to the PLO with Arafat renouncing violence Norway was now ready to pay him an official visit at the PLO headquarters in Tunis so the Chalmette lung the god fertilizer or they are rather still 3 2 count a pillow artists
(24:11) coalition itself or this golden to oust anti-terrorism David yeah I thought it was the first time I know its environment is the visited PLO it was definitely an successful visit because it was a breakthrough for official contacts the same foreign minister toured about Stoltenberg the father of the Prime Minister of Norway today and he went on a mission at tomb Arafat in Tunis in 1989 and I thought meetings they had a secret part that no one knew about the Norwegians worked with Arafat on creating a channel of communication
(24:56) between the PLO and Israel far from public scrutiny as I miss Arafat first time he explained how he saw contacts with Israel being established and the idea of using a Norwegian research institution was the idea of mr. Yasser Arafat's which he outlined during the meeting they hadn't planned or decided which Research Institute in a way but they they agreed that that would be a good cover and they also agreed that the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs should pay for it all that was also a read in the document farfel was a
(25:46) tank in Oslo founded by the trade unions and connected to noise Labour Party it was chosen by the Norwegian foreign minister as the perfect host for secret talks between Israelis and Palestinians its director was Terry Arad Larson he would go on to become a key figure in the negotiations that led to the Oslo Accords with funding from the Norwegian foreign ministry in 1989 father started to undertake research in the Middle East its first study examined the living conditions in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip Leverkusen a circus and far
(26:26) for Yana 50 occupied tamura-san vient a net martini the living condition of of young people growing up under the Intifada what kind of effects on them maybe maybe more on the sort of mental psychological effect of our growing up in such sort of a violence and environment but then it was more a social economics but it turned out to because because that was sort of the speciality of our for and so it it it turned up to be a little more on the sort of more socio-economic and I mean unemployment all these kinds of
(27:13) indicators of social economic life so who were the researchers that worked on this project from Norway yeah there were there were and there were many and one of them does thought I was heading and the that special service was money on the hay bag who who was the the wife of and he wasn't at the time but he later became the new Norwegian foreign minister you Hungarian host I was I was working in this out of what we call them the foreign ministers cabinet or there or the Secretariat and my husband was with farfel and young Eglin was the
(27:55) state secretary muna you'll and I had studied political science in the university we had been skiing together we had been to university camps together and her husband David Larsen I also knew from his work as an academic and his work in creation of farfel the trade union think-tank so these were my friends when I became already when I became the deputy of tava Stoltenberg in the Minister of Foreign Affairs it's often difficult for foreigners to understand that law is a very very small traffic and the Labour Party has moved
(28:40) lower for the most of the post-war period so you have collections and you are almost families married together within the Labour Party like almost built sometimes called it the Royal Labour Party because they are like a dynasty this dynasty was very tight-knit Foreign Minister Stoltenberg appointed yarn Eggland's as his deputy and Mona you'll as a gallant secretary she was married to Terry Arad Larsen the director of farfa Stoltenberg sister-in-law was Mary Ann Heiberg who worked in fafa she was married to
(29:20) Defense Minister Johann Juergen Holst this made Holtz and the Foreign Minister Stoltenberg brothers-in-law Holst himself later became foreign minister this extended political family became the Norwegian team in the secret Israeli PLO talks they could use that research institution the institution as a as a front for a diplomatic effort to to facilitate peace talks between the two parties and then do that in all secrecy you are very critical about this why I think research is in should not usually be in the devil take on two hats or be
(30:07) in double roles in Tel Aviv another Research Institute was also acting as a cover for communication between the Israelis and Palestinians this was the Economic Cooperation foundation set up by Israeli Labour Party MP you see Velen the NGO that we were leading huge fear in myself an NGO which was created earlier by bailing and heels Feld we were able to go between the two sides in Jerusalem and pass messages and come with ideas and even bring the two sides unofficially together under our umbrella of an NGO I was involved with talking to the
(30:46) personal side for many years in a very informal way mainly with the people like Hanan Ashrawi and Faisal Husseini and from his Jerusalem and with whom it was easy to talk by 1989 with the Palestinian Intifada in its second year there were few signs of hope for peace hundreds of Palestinians had been killed and thousands detained when the two met last week mr.
(31:38) Bushwick the United States under President George Bush started to increase the pressure on Israeli prime minister especially the peace process will be composed of two stages first stage will be an interim interim conditions and this will include the full autonomy etc the second stage will be direct negotiations without any preconditions between Israel the Palestinian Arabs and some Arab countries if they will join the negotiations we are ready to embark immediately on peace talks for that purpose we are ready to hold elections
(32:19) in the administer territories that will produce a democratically chosen representative leadership of the Palestine everything changed in the region when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 the United States led a coalition of Nations that retaliated against Iraqi forces us two hours ago Allied air forces began an attack on military targets in Iraq and Kuwait these attacks continued as I speak arafat rejected a military solution to ax racks invasion of kuwait this proved a costly decision before the Gulf War PLO received big financial support from
(33:17) the Arab Gulf states after the war because of Yasser Arafat's support Saddam Hussein that financial support disappeared they came out of that war very weakened and I think frankly data that was also one of the reason while this Raley's we're more interested in discussing with them after the girl for than before we of course have close relations with the united states america we they're the lie they are a friend and we made those secret or will contacts with the PLO obviously and we she had some of over
(34:09) assessment based on our communication with PLO build of our american friends yes in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War the United States and the Soviet Union co-hosted a peace conference in the Spanish capital of Madrid we have an opportunity I think a real opportunity to see Arabs Arab States sitting down face to face in direct negotiations with Israel Madrid oh cool - rohtul Ettie buddha at wat el hakumen Israeli Abu Klea - Amir a Yama a no mom no mono da Matta Terrell Tacoma masala Voyager ban Yakunin waft hora mental are

(36:41) did not support an independent Palestinian state Israel again can do what the hint is to look him what as I refer to him and now self another had that horrible malaria probably Leonie him L am broke a theorem Israelis who celebrated the end of Hanukkah in Washington arrived five days late an attempt to make it clear to the United States that they're here on their own terms and won't respond to pressure after Madrid negotiations moved to Washington DC we sincerely feel that our ideas are fully in conformity with the
(37:27) framework of this process as it was laid ahead and we speak with a joint Jordanian Palestinian delegation hello good evening everybody we met like we met in the morning the heads of delegations we discussed the matter of procedures and we could not reach yet an agreement there is Rayleigh government shifted unabashed to the intransigent and openly declared position of claiming all Palestinian territory not conceding anything for the Palestinians and refusing to recognize the unity the unity of the Palestinians inside and

(40:31) the Israelis would like to negotiate with the Palestinians so they must agree we share together presented over the Palestinians well present over the Palestinians is the bureau if they disqualify the PLO then they're not going to have any Palestinian to dr.

(41:56) under the Kalamazoo young PLO starts to send signals to us here abuela comes that we no way could become their link to Israel if Israel was interested then came bassam al sharif and he was even more explicit and said I am talking directly I have a message straight from the top Yasser Arafat Norway should try to do this and it has to be directly linked with PLO Tunis leadership only the minutes of their secret meeting in Oslo revealed that Bassam Abu Shareef told the Norwegians that if there were peace the PLO would influence the Arab
(42:48) world to stop the boycott of Israel it takes two to tango we did not have the Israeli sight I had met Jakub in before he was elected on one of my missions to to Israel on April 1992 in April 92 we met a guardian that he came for breakfast and then wigeon embassy and we asked him what is your approach to the Palestinian he said I am keen to see some kind of a negotiated settlement in 1992 the Israeli Labour Party led by Yitzhak Rabin won the general election Rabine continued Israel's policy of settlement building
(43:40) in public he spoke optimistically a progress in the peace negotiation it will be possible to reach an agreement with the Palestinian delegation about the establishment of autonomy what will be the first and most important task for a government you and your colleagues when you're the peace process and the web straight ahead into the enemy implementation Shimon Perez was appointed foreign minister you see Balin here on the Left was appointed his deputy and Orissa veer on the right their general manager Balin was given the green light to start
(44:22) the secret direct negotiations with the PLO in Norway the point about Norway was because Norway was out of the EU it had independent foreign policy we had meetings with telly a Lausanne with his people and we had many many many meetings but very little came out of it but I then started to understand much better the mindset of both parties Balin actually told the Norwegians that it's good that they will make contact with useful later I joined in order to facilitate in order to that you know that you'll have like two NGOs to
(45:04) non-governmental dialog this was the and we met he had met a blouson before I met him April and later we found a brother in a way and men who thinks very similar to our way of thinking his wife was the head of the office of the minister his deputy and second is the minister and the deputy were very close friends of Lausanne all of them from the Labour Party all old friends mr.
(45:33) Stoltenberg was the Foreign Minister I knew him very well and they he was very very enthusiastic about the process mr. salt bat met Shimon Peres was the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Israel and in New York yet opening of the General Assembly in September and in on the basis on those contacts and follow-up contacts the head full of salt day the assessment was that time was right to follow the I suggested to mr.
(46:16) Oliver the PLO and Arafat were exactly weak enough so this was exactly the time that Israelis should choose to start negotiating with PLO outside PLO before Oslo was almost dead this book was the strong power and Israel decided who to talk to when to talk the terms of the negotiations they told Norway that nobody could like it or dislike it they could do as Israel said say or go home a new and self-confident Israeli government and a PLO still cast as outsiders by the world community they were now on the secret road to the Oslo
(47:03) Accords but much would need to happen before the diplomatic finale on the White House lawn
