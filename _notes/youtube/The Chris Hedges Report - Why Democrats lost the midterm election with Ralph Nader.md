Transcript:
(00:02) the total cost of the 2022 Federal midterm elections is projected to exceed 9.3 billion dollars but what do we get from what must surely be the most expensive electoral system on the planet there's little real Choice the dismantling of our democracy which took place over the last few decades on behalf of corporations in the Rich has been a bipartisan project leaving only the outward shell of democracy the Court's legislative bodies the
(01:06) executive branch and the media including public broadcasting are captive to corporate power there is no institution left that can be considered authentically democratic the corporate coup d'etat is over they won we lost the wreckage of this corporate coup is appalling endless and feudal Wars to enrich a military industrial complex that bleeds the U.
(01:32) S treasury of half of all discretionary spending deindustrialization that has turned U.S cities into decayed ruins a slashing and privatization of social programs including education utility services and health care which saw over one million Americans account for one-fifth of global deaths from covid although we are four percent of the world's population Draconian forums of social control embodied in militarized police functioning as lethal armies of occupation in poor urban areas the largest prison system in the world a virtual tax boycott by the richest
(02:11) individuals and corporations money saturated elections that perpetuate our system of legalized bribery and the most intrusive State surveillance of the citizenry in our history how are we to interpret these elections which will create even more political paralysis with Republican control of the house and what should we expect in the next presidential election joining me to discuss the political landscape and the wake of the midterm elections is former presidential candidate and consumer Advocate Ralph Nader you can find him at
(02:50) ralphnader.substack.com Ralph let's begin with the midterms uh it wasn't the blowout of the democratic party that many expected how do you interpret what happened well the coming off the list that you just described about the situation in this country and its impact on the world my first reaction was there are 535 people in the Congress who could change it all and and they don't all have to be unanimous they could just be a plurality or a majority of members so what are we waiting for check off your entire list Chris and we
(03:33) got the votes the corporations don't have the votes they have money but the members of Congress want the money to get the votes against their primary or General Electric general election opponents 30. it just uh is very intriguing that people thrash around groaning moaning being sickened injured blocked discriminated against deprived and they don't focus on the kyber pass which is Congress whether we like it or not that's the institution that has the greatest authority to take on these big corporations
(04:13) and take on the Predators and to drive peace in the world instead of war and Empire and we're listening to all these recountings of the ills ailments and injustices and the brutish scenarios coming up in the future with climate disruption and reneging on any kind of compact uh with posterity and we don't focus on Congress and so you know the midterm election um they're running around the campaigns like they're Ward bosses you know we we're going to fix this pothole here and we're going to make sure that there is a
(05:00) uh a public service there and instead of looking at the big picture of the concentration of power they're doing this piecemeal retail assurances of the public which of course drives the expectation of the people even lower and when you drive the expectation lower as to what members of Congress running for election or challengers running to defeat them when you control those expectations at such a low level the members of Congress get away with their responsibility for the country under the Constitution We the People
(05:40) they're the ones who get the taxing power in Congress the spending power the confirmation of judges and official power the right not to go to war just there's no end to it so I keep saying if the if all of these efforts for justice around the country small large National local do not focus on Congress and the state legislatures and the town councils they're going to be spinning their wheels forever as this country is driven into the ground I want to talk about the impediments though first of all you have
(06:20) redistricting so most races are not actually competitive the Democratic party redistrict the seat that Dennis kucinich had to to drive him out and number two if you aren't Awash in money and you saw this in your own campaign you you were drawing crowds I think you filled Madison Square Garden everybody had to pay five dollars to get in uh so I don't know how many thousands of people but you didn't have access to uh television which would have given you an audience of millions so there are serious
(07:01) impediments to essentially breaking the the power of this duopoly yeah but the impediments Melt Away if people organize in every congressional district to reflect the congruence of left-right opinion in this country which is deleted from the news the council like to talk about polarization red state blue State conservative liberal we know that on the fundamental necessities of life there's a huge convergence 70 80 90 percent in the polls there was one poll a few years ago Chris 90 of people wanted to break
(07:41) up the big Banks ninety percent you got 75 percent or so want Universal Health Care even without a major party pushing for and and it just goes on and on whether it's cracking down on corporate Crooks where they're changing the campaign Finance system whether it's controlling what people own like Pension funds and and uh mutual funds which uh together on three quarters of the stock of the companies on the New York and NASDAQ stock exchanges so the people have the power but they've allowed it to
(08:18) be seized because they don't do their homework back home they don't spend time on their civic responsibilities and they don't say to the members of Congress hey we're the ones who have the Sovereign power you've got it from us and you're using it against us and we're not going to tolerate it anymore so the only place where democracy comes before work is in the dictionary and so we've got to stop spinning our wheels and recounting disaster after disaster when we can control the legislative bodies local
(08:56) state and National look at the initiatives in Nebraska and and uh right-wing States they have passed minimum wage increases against massive corporate opposition saturating the television Florida Arkansas uh in uh in the one conservative State South Dakota the republican-dominated legislature the governor and the corporations all opposed an initiative to constitutionalize Medicaid not just to send a statue but to put the constitution of South Dakota who won the people one because they they started working they
(09:43) rolled up their sleeves otherwise all we're doing is documenting despair perdition pessimism which discourages people and and turns them into cynics which leads to withdrawal from the political Arena and which makes the corporations laugh all the way to the bank I want to talk about fear because I think Matt taybe wrote that most Americans don't vote for what they want they vote against the political figure they hate uh the the divisions largely as you point out there's a majoritarian opinion on many of the issues just cited
(10:24) uh but there is this cultural divide uh and people employ fear uh Biden's own record as a in the Senate uh and even as vice president is pretty appalling from supporting Anita Hill to I think five years before the invasion of Iraq he talked about taking Saddam down he uh of course has rehabilitated Muhammad bin Salman a fervent supporter of the apartheid state in Israel he fought School bussing uh he passed the uh was aggressively he sponsored the 1994 crime Bill uh and the three strikes you're out the third violent Federal penalty law
(11:11) where you can't get parole uh the uh NAFTA glass-steagall uh um and so these are not issues that we look back on and support uh but the Democrats like the Republicans play on this fear the fear of uh and and I do see as you do a figure like Trump to be frightening in these Fringe candidates to be frightening but it seems that that is the primary currency of at this point of our political system yeah well there are millions of people who don't buy it we need tens of millions of people who don't buy it we
(11:53) need people talking to one another in the neighborhoods we need people to turn out for Town meetings there are all kinds of jurisdictions in this country that allow for the referendum uh to be stocked with all kinds of progressive legislation at the federal at the state and local level most people don't even know about it they don't even use it why because our schools don't begin teaching these children and Civic knowledge Civic skills and Civic experience learn by doing all of this comes down to how much
(12:30) time do people spend to produce a deliberative democracy that wages peace and Justice equality and foreseen forestalling The Perils for our posterity like climate disruption that's what it comes down to and if we don't address it at that level if we don't highlight the victories of the people over powerful interests that occur from time to time in this country we're just documenting despair producing discouragement producing withdrawal from the political system and uh people then just dive into their
(13:13) own uh this discouraging lives and uh watch entertainment bet on sports we got to turn it around and the the nice thing about this approach is you only have to turn around a super majority of 535 people and you know what they want more than anything else they want to win and that means votes so you focus votes to nullify the effect of money I mean look at the victory Of Summer Lee uh coming out of Pittsburgh she's 32 years old and she's going to be the next representative in car in the house from from the area around Pittsburgh
(14:02) she was opposed by corporations she took on the dark side of the United steelworkers they opposed her aipac put a million to two million dollars just before the election to defeat her she beat them all how she developed a grassroot coalition based on the principle that they all bleed the same color it doesn't matter what labels they put on themselves and she forged this Coalition and beat them all a spectacular story which the New York Times is not spending much time reporting on they're too obsessed with
(14:41) Taylor Greene the madcap representative from Georgia putting her on the cover of the New York Times magazine and they give all kinds of attention to Crazy right-wing groups and institutes and they give people the impression nothing's happened on the Progressive side uh during the election period so the you know Pittsburgh you know it's not it's it's not Ann Arbor it's not Cambridge uh it has a lot of conservatives and she beat them all energy that's the Civic energies what's needed
(15:24) you have people you have like 82 percent of Republicans against citizens united which is a Supreme Court decision over a decade ago that said corporations could give unlimited money for and or against um candidates in elections Unlimited and a lot of it dark money you got over 80 percent of Republicans when they're pulled down there or against it has to be organized otherwise the divide and Rule strategy of the two-party duopoly fronting for giant corporations will forever control the people who are the
(16:04) only people who have the votes I mean bad as corporations are Chris they don't yet have the vote not yet at least let's talk about the inevitable paralysis with the Republican control of the house Biden's already been stymied by mansion and uh uh Democrats who essentially vote as Republicans what is that going to mean for going ahead well it's going to mean that nothing's going to be done other than the routine stuff of just passing budgets for government agencies uh the Republicans have such a narrow
(16:43) margin they're not going to get anything done and they'll be blocked in the Senate um so it's two years um of very little being done and it's the Democrats all thought I mean it's the worst Republican party in history you cannot find a Republican party since 1854 that has so many positions that are against the health safety and economic interests of children of women of workers of small taxpayers of communities all over the country of consumers of patients this is a vicious callous inbred ignorant in corporate indentured uh
(17:27) corrupt party and what is the Democrats they lose to them and then they they say hey look at the pundas they said it was going to be a red wave and it wasn't a red wave so it's a victory that's how they fool the people victory what would happen if there were no poles and no pundits with the Democrats have pleaded Victory they lost the House of Representatives For Heaven's Sake right well they they lost because on all the issues they just cited they they have surrendered yeah they lost because starts with the
(18:04) nomination process they exclude third parties okay who's they who's they it's the state legislatures they have these ballot access barriers and allow this to happen they lost for reasons of their own making um for example they wanted to John Larson of Connecticut wanted to increase the benefits of Social Security and it hasn't been increased he said in 40 years so he puts in a bill and it's very comprehensive and he's sweet talked by Nancy Pelosi and his chairman of the house Ways and Means
(18:42) Committee the crypto uh Republican Democrat name only Richard Neal from Western Massachusetts and he starts pressing he says why aren't you passing this through the house and they say well it's not the right time we'd want to be accused of excessive spending so he drafts the letter which is is he wants his Democrats in the house to co-sign he drafts the letter accusing the Senate of sabotaging the whole process the Democrats in the Senate using the filibuster as an excuse and he says let the Republicans
(19:20) filibuster let them go on the floor hour after hour after hour on natural television against increasing the benefits of social security for millions of elderly Americans and he was blocked and stymied now any active citizenry Chris would have dug into that and made it a major issue inside the Democratic Party that's the way you start up upending these indentured senior Democrats who have concentrated power in the hands of three members Pelosi steny Hoyer and uh and the third one and they control the subcommittees and
(20:05) the Committees and all this started with Newt Gingrich who did who did this when he was speaker in in 1995 and the Democrats never changed it he cut budgets of committees cut staff cut the GAO the monitor of spending as executive branch waste Fraud and Abuse eliminated the office of Technology assessment which would have expose some of these massive uh weapon and civilian technology boondoggles and the Democrats inherited it so you always got to go back to the people what do they think what do they know uh what do they want for their families
(20:47) okay and you got to organize it look labor never became unionized without Rank and file people co-ops were never established without Rank and file people it never was top down it's all bottom up so we got to focus on the people here let's talk about Trump who's just announced uh what What's your read on the Trump candidacy and the future tactics of the Republican Party well first of all under Section 3 the 14th Amendment any state can ban him from running for election based on this January 6th findings of insurrection
(21:30) that's the Insurrection section of Section 3 the 14th Amendment um the January 6 committee report is going to be out soon and they could recommend that to the states and say you know start enforcing Section 3 the 14th Amendment you know if he if he is banned from running for reelection of four or five states he can't possibly compete even at the primary level the second thing is um Jack Smith the new special counsel people have said that you couldn't pick someone better for the Attorney General to pursue two criminal violations
(22:15) against Trump which could end his in his indictment and it's very unlikely that he's gonna have much course to the primary Victory if he's under indictment from those two uh violations not to mention the one that's being prepared in New York State against him and uh one was uh stealing classified documents and that's one that Garland is handing over to the special counsel to pursue and the other of course is Insurrection in January 6.
(22:53) of course Garland left out about 10 other violations of federal statutes including the Hatch Act which was designed to prevent presidents from using the power of the federal government and property against their opponents and he had campaign events on the White House lawn he signed millions of checks twisting arms over a treasury for the pandemic relief programs a Garland just is giving a free pass on one violation after other and Bruce Fine and I have written Garland listing all these violations more than once you never get an answer
(23:27) however uh two criminal statute violations are are more than enough uh to retire Trump now if that doesn't occur Trump is going to want a lot of competition at the primary level that's how he wins you know he had 16 Republican opponents in the primary in 2016 and you know he's the best known he's the most egregious uh attention getter and he would like that he split it 10 ways you know he'd say Okay young can Virginia come on board uh primary me and okay DeSantis come on board primary me but I don't
(24:10) think he's going to get that far so what do you see happening I see he's going to be indicted there is a Civic civilian suit excuse me there are civil suits against him obviously from uh assaulted women and other people that he's fleeced um and uh I think there may be a coordinated rebellion in the in the Republican Party itself you just uh you just don't get anywhere with other Republican candidates Senators Governors if the head of the ticket is is not only under indicted under indictment but may
(24:54) have actually been convicted but the Republican party that which is has essentially become this proto-fascist entity uh and certainly while Trump held sway kultish isn't going to change its stripes is it no it's not it changes its uh camouflage you know they really pursue everything Trump has pursued whether it's immigration On the Border um Wall Street Trump and them are on the same page the whole plutocratic system the anti-union system the tax cuts at an all-time low for the super rich and the
(25:39) big corporations but it's the camouflage you know he embarrasses them he uses bad language he attacks people specifically he doesn't have their style of control but that's serious that's a serious problem among politicians that that system not a matter of cosmetics and uh and they know they can lose a lot of traction with his kind of blunderbuss and is lying and his uh uh mischaracterizing people and accusing people of homicides without a single bit of evidence like he has done in the past um and they're also afraid of the
(26:23) violence of his audiences that he can unleash and you know that can make you lose an election that could scare a lot of conservative Republicans around the Midwest and elsewhere when they see the eruption of violence and you know he said they're going to be riots in the street if he's denied the nomination so there is a real deep conflict not over economic uh issues but over how the party presents itself to a public that it it doesn't want to scare he scares people does the inevitable paralysis now
(27:04) within Congress empower the Republican party for the presidential elections no because they'll be viewed as the do-nothing house you can't get anything done that's the Democrats is smart they'd go on the floor of the house as the Republicans did against them years ago and throw the gauntlet down why aren't you supporting Medicare Medicaid Social Security why are you against kids why don't you expand why don't you extend the 300 a month child tax credit that went to 58 million kids from
(27:44) conservative and liberal families you blocked the extension in January why are you freezing the minimum wage at a paltry 7.25 cents an hour uh when you're making huge money in terms of what the taxpayer is paying you and all the benefits and uh they could just throw one Gauntlet down why are you why are you soft on corporate crime why are you letting these corporate Crooks get away with ripping off the people and endangering their health and safety uh that's what they got to do and if if they don't do that we'll just have
(28:23) another very very close election and any kind of idiosyncratic event can tip it one way or another regardless of the Left Right polls supporting basic change in this country coming in at 70 75 80 85 percent I mean you can't stop that that's an Unstoppable Coalition if the court if the Democrats will get rid of their corporate political media consultants who are losing race after race for the Democrats because they have corporate clients throughout the year and they're conflicted and because they
(28:59) don't want to do a ground game which is what democracy is all about and they want the 15 huge television buys right now in Georgia there's this runoff Chris between Senator Warnock and Herschel Walker hey wernick has spent 20 million dollars already charging that Walker is neither competent nor knowledgeable nor fit to be a U.
(29:27) S senator um well they're going to put 200 million between them in from November 8th to December 6th I've just imagined 200 million dollars are coming in there how much of it is the ground game well as little as possible if the Consultants have to say which is what they do they want the 15 Commission so Warnock should go around the state of Georgia and change his heavy focus on Walker everybody knows about Walker now and start saying go vote for a raise go vote for Universal Health Insurance go vote for cracking down under corporate
(30:07) Crooks that are on your back and in your pocketbook every day you know go vote for freedom to vote go vote for freedom for women equal pay for equal work go vote for the children get that 300 back into the poor families uh pocketbooks I mean that's the way you win an election but the the corporate Consultants who who should be the subject of major exposes by The Washington Post New York Times Wall Street Journal you know they got the reporters uh they're the ones who are destroying the Democratic party and they've been doing
(30:48) it for years well if if walker uh or Warnock went around and uh called for those kinds of programs that corporate money would dry up wasn't it Ralph there's no time for it to dry up they already got it it's December 6th is the runoff and by the way the more you can get people on your side by your message in your policies the less money you you need I mean the money wasted on these TV and social media ads it's just staggering not only is it wasted it's the same ad it's dull it's repetitious
(31:27) it's not authentic and it irritates people in other words it boomerangs against itself summer Lee summer Lee was tremendously outspent but she had a ground game right that was former presidential candidate and consumer Advocate Ralph Nader you can find him at ralphnader.substack.com I want to thank the real news network and its production team Cameron granadino Adam Coley and Kayla Rivera you can find me at chrisedges.substack.
