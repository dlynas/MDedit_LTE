![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdCP3UdL7Qo)

## Transcript:





this is the Michael Brooks show was
broadcasting from Filipino sound in LA
or Koreatown
East LA where luckiest best as it is
everywhere else with two producer Malik



chief economist David risky

I'm in my Scarface chair how's everybody
doing
thank you for being here how are you
guys doing I'm very well are you 420
Matt I'm not actually I'm completely
just I would see I was very on brand
today I took a hot yoga class
yep it was deep David are you like with
even like smoking like unfiltered and
low cash David's been buying cowboy
boots I've been buying counted beautiful
la cowboy boots that's right see your
patreon money goes around a little bit
circulates that's the trickle-down right
there exactly so we always start in the
first couple of minutes but we're gonna
ask everybody this why I was gonna come
up in a second he's ready the question
we have for tonight though that we're
gonna start with the three of us I'm
gonna we're gonna go in and and by the
way I think David's answer we're gonna
let David have but nobody else can hello
this way if there was one right-wing
figure one and I want to say this really
clearly because I'm a big fan of the
game f marry kill now I know you are and
I wanted my show to be sort of like the
socialist version of the aristocrats of
that game however I played that game
once and I lost two patrons and they
said that I was being very like
authorizing and
and it was mean and I'm enough of the
capitalists to be like okay I
guess that's me
so in lieu of F marry kill we're playing
who would you stay in eternity with from
the right in a bunker the world is on
its knees once you say Wow Wow no
actually I'm interested just cuz you
could be like you could just be like hey
Dave
go and he just knew he hey Dave
I have an idea I should make my dinner
hey Dave it's safe outside yeah hey Dave
why don't you guys exchange some ideas
outside so that's the question and I'm
going to ask everybody this David
Griscom I think I know your answer and I
just want to say preemptively no one
else can get this answer because it's
too easy and it's too obvious but yeah
well here's the thing Texas well I've
been thinking about this a little bit so
my first reaction was I have to go with
Alex Jones I'm sorry I need somebody
with spirit and vigor but I've been
thinking about it more and more and I
don't know if that's a good answer
because I don't know if I could spend
eternity with him you're not gonna like
who you spend eternity with I think I
want to survive her I want somebody
who's never prepared for this somebody
who might have been selling preparedness
for the apocalypse
oh so I've been thinking Jim Baker
so if you don't know Jim Baker's a
televangelist he's a survivor first of
all he went to prison yeah and they came
out and created a new grift which was
selling ridiculous preparedness meals
the drift grift in your opinion so Jim
Baker is the perfect person to me no
loss
he's got the food and in a
post-apocalyptic situation I want to be
with the man with the food
I think there's audience respect for
that pick Matlack who you spending a
turn who are you sharing your audible
password with an eternity Glenn Beck
well I could barely share the planet as
is why and it's it's not because of his
you know historical understanding or
your racial attitudes
it's his sense of decor people who don't
know he's been suitable before Glenn
Beck lost a lot of money on the blaze he
was broadcasting out of a recreation
Oval Office that was his his studio for
his radio show that's pretty cool and
that is what I'm gonna spend eternity in
a bunker I want somebody who's gonna
make it at least sort of interesting
like that so I want to be answer the
like I imagine like a room that's just
the Senate so yeah Glenn Beck is who I
would believe is important to know is
this Glenn Beck before he transitioned
into a hipster this is like right after
the Samantha be reclamation ah God Wow
all right well I'm the host so so I'm
gonna do a little bit of a loophole is
that okay
settle right do we like it all right so
right this person is absolutely a
right-wing figure if you know anything
that's what he is some people might not
perceive them that way but I'm gonna
spend the eternity with obviously the
brother Minister Louis Farrakhan we are
gonna be on a regimen together we're
gonna pray we're gonna eat like yams
from like whatever like Muslim spot the
bean pies will be stopped and I think we
probably share a lot of ideas from
Israel

Jake joking I didn't say the Holocaust I
said Israel not that way
damn and I think you could be you could
pep you here like you'd you'd be like
god this is terrible D but I know
brother Michael that's what I want I
wish I already had it as a matter of
fact we were wearing cotton in Egypt
when you were crawling on all fours and
now you're gonna give up no I'm not
gonna give up Thank You mr. Farrakhan
all right guys here's what we're gonna
do we're gonna go we're gonna have three
guests up at a time or one guest up at a
time and then everybody's gonna be up on
stage at the same time we're gonna play
a couple of games later the games are
gonna be who said it
Mark Cuban or Mussolini who said it Tony
Robbins or Hitler what was the third one
ben shapiro and alex jones Spence
so but first we're gonna each have these
three I mean I just have to say please
do this is the cheap one but you got to
do the pre-emptive applause for Nando
Vila woz kneel hombre and Anya Kasparian
these people they're all actually in
fact very good friends of mine
they're three of the most talented
people in this whole whatever the
it is we're doing
brilliant ethical on point but don't
take themselves seriously but are
serious about what they do people and
I'm honored to do this with them
of course Matt and David help us crush
this show every week I'm honored to work
with them I'm proud of what we do I
appreciate each and every one of you and
I'll tell you more about that later but
first was these two get up here he's the
first guest
music number one question is can the
fans get up I got Ben Genesis X Games a
bitch-ass Bennett's and who pump
and drive gonna take that picture
this some let's go okay see your
face
yeah Big Sight sprinkle cocoa on the
floor make it drug-related shall set a
LAPD I only ever remember the shoots
water in the calf muscle I'm yeah
sinister but then when you're black you
remember that Dave Chappelle spring a
little coke on them that's that's I just
killed a you know semi-retired your kid
with a BB gun
this is TPMS right we can say what we
want right yes please and this is also
woke Rose in fact a listen on the black
opinions matter feed yes yes make sure
y'all subscribe to that don't just run
away don't be just hoarding your
subscriptions and she's doing TM PST PST
MBS majority blow you this
better subscribe to black of he's mad at
rose thieves
sorry guys approach you to killers sue
me who would you spend life with in a
bunker why that's on the right that's
easy and I could tell y'all this because
my girl is here
Tom Mars she's right there
but you know what was in the bunker
which I sense trouble and culture I said
this is the one every time I hear black
men and this is not the only time talk
about Ann Coulter that is the only time
that I I'm like really listen just to
any blonde woman will do though listen
is she good enough for JJ Evans she good
enough for me Dino
so that's that's a dated reference some
of y'all know too young for that
good Tom Scott damn Florida got what
though it was a very important show this
was wise how do we meet each other tell
that story man I'm not afraid to tell
and I've told this story trillions of
times but I'm not afraid to tell it um I
was already a fan of majority report and
of course shouts the same cedar shouts -
Kelly r.i.p chemist or she never show
any more alive and well
what are IP o-- transitions
so i was a so i was a fan of the show
and i remember i was watching a michael
monday in the end of the funny thing
that you guys would laugh at is that I
used to skip the Michael Monday to skip
it tell you why cuz I got on the show
office Sam being on um Chris Hayes and I
was like all right on Mondays he lets
his low Lackey do the show at the bar
you know like I'm not gonna watch the JD
show so that I said I whatever but
I caught a michael Monday and I was like
starting to catch the Michael Mondays
and then one day Michael relax it's not
that type of party
one day Michael he made an incredible
joke which has turned into an ongoing
joke which is he did the five percent of
Obama and for somebody like me I'm from
New York I know like actual people who
abide by five percent of Principles
shouts ADEA coops um thank you welcome
shall superhero scientists but like
Michael told this very pointed joke
right like if you have to understand
what five percenter is you have to
understand Obama's own politics you have
to understand why it's ridiculous to
even make this joke so I'm sitting in my
crib when I left him like this is a
genius joke like it's a genius
joke to put these two things together in
the way that he did and you know I mean
and Oh Mike and honor we had dinner last
night and I was telling them because
they asked me how I met Mike I was like
look I'm not the type of person when I
ingest content I'm like yo let me why
don't I hit of Bruce Willis 2-toned I
heart was great like I just wouldn't do
that
That's not me but I just loved the joke
that's me a documentary we do be finding
be honest it's a lot from white beater
in die hard was sake of finding Bruce
Willis with a big wad so I reached out
to my and I was like yo bro that five
percenter joke that Obama five
percentage owe me as a black man as a
person who understands like what 5% ISM
is and understands that Barry's just
like a Harvard centrist
that joke is incredible because the
people who
we call our adversaries that's how they
think of barrier they think he's a
revolutionary they think he's you Inu
and they think this about Mary and
he's just not
and so that joke that my told just
touched me to my core so I hit him up I
was like once when I was like yo bro
that joke was fantastic and
here's why bah bah bah bah blah and Mike
was like wow and you
like one of three people who got it
thank you
let's have dinner that's exactly right
and so a friendship with us five percent
joke for the five percent by the way by
the way our friendship Mike is Obama's
America cuz there's no red or blue
that's exactly right
there's only a wall canary we're the
remnant of the Obama exactly rusty red
model across across we down trees to
stay up yeah we that
that you gotta clean at the bottom of
your sink after you wash your dishes
this what we already about my area maybe
remember at least between how what you
said to me when Trump got elected let me
turn my three don't happen in y'all
a she she'd about to be really
bad
we got a reality star as the president
white people gonna laugh at my face till
I die but at least we got three more
months of battery goddamn me it's a
black man I was very happy about that
what is that you were saying though cuz
we were talking we're gonna talk about
Nipsey Hussle in a minute but like why
is this less than peace why is it though
that like Donald Trump is funny
yeah he's objectively funny to me in a
very disgusting will no that's I think
that's what it is cuz like I remember I
talked to a guy in Seattle once and I
realized that like he just didn't have
any of like the grime
like he was just like well why would
that be funny oh we had that was they
invented farm-to-table well right you
think they're gonna understand why
Donald Trump is funny right but why this
Michael hable jerk off with gloves on
come on they're not gonna understand why
Donald Trump is funny he's hilarious did
you see that tweet he put in Sweden see
him and he's not all of his follow-up
work to the primaries have been a real
fall but sometimes he will show you
knowing you're gonna explain because in
a second I want you to explain like how
going to high school in Queens
the UPS planes Donald Trump this is
important cultural strategy on insight
here but he did one six months ago where
he put out a tweet I guess John Kerry I
don't even know about this but I guess
John Kerry's like oh I'm thinking of a
president yes stop and Trump tweets out
he's like I heard that uh junqeira it
might be running for president - I
should be so lucky
period and then he's like but seriously
the 20/20 field of the shape 2020
Democratic field is shaping up to look
really good dot that dot for me and all
bold letters he gets it he understands
the the way that you cut somebody down
like he gets it it's like you're lower
than this
you're worse than this and guess what
all of those insecurities that you might
have had about yourself they're
true boom
they're true and that's when he
understands he could sense weakness if
anything and by the way he he sends his
confidence when this people he's like no
I like to cuddle at God's gym I just
like him well did you see and I mean I'm
assuming in this crowd Kamala Harris
boom easy easy that's fine
she's pretty although I will say I like
I I don't like her politics but I get
her like I kept you do hi kitty and what
was funny to me because in Napa
California she's the worst we know she's
the worst no I'm gonna make me don't
make me be whoa
so don't know but here's what happened
no it just speaks to your point cuz it
was like an interview and at this point
Warren and Harris were running and he's
like and what I noticed was that they
were like so who do you think out of the
game it's the strongest right and he's
like well I have to say Camila and they
put in parentheses pronounce Camila then
he's like she had a great rally great
rally lots of people lots of people and
then it was almost like dot dot dot like
oh I want to talk about that and
he's just like but elizabeth warren's
had a really hard time with the
Pocahontas
I think she's doing ok I don't have a
nickname for her yet that yeah
elizabeth warren what is about Queens
though that explains that so ok so
Donald Trump is he's from originally
before they got the money because if
you're not from New York or from the
outer boroughs you don't know this but
like aspirationally Manhattan is the
North Star it's like I get some bad
that's where I go but he's from Jamaica
estates and Queens right anding and I I
went to high school in Queens middle
school in Queens um before I got to high
school shots to say for
prep shots to the Terriers there's no
Terriers India but I shot them anyway
you always take care of them but um no
so my first time ever interacting with
non black or Latin people cuz in one of
my middle schools we had some Puerto
Ricans which doesn't count but whatever
so we had no so when I got to high
school that was my first time ever
actually interacting with white people
and I got to homeroom right white people
but that's what it was for me it's like
but not white people like matter Dean no
of course not we didn't have any people
from the Dakotas right frog you know for
all you know as we discussed last night
Wyoming and Dakotas could be a Cohen
cell operation against blacks could be a
I know anybody who's been there or
seen it Matt tells me the Dakotas exist
allegedly proofy that's very new york
show me some artifacts from the Dakota I
mean Louis
you need to read Meriwether Lewis is
journals whoa whoa I'll get right on
that and so no so I get to high school
homeroom and I have a what I conceive to
be white people and immediately you know
I'm disavowed of all of my ignorance is
right like all of the white people when
they play the dozens over there um
making fun of each other it's like the
Italian kids are like they tell the
Polish jokes which is like how many
Polish people does it take to turn a
light bulb it's three people one nurse
standing on the ladder want to turn the
light on what no whatever
Polish people are dumb in white parlance
Irish people are drunks Italian people
are kind of blood whatever
but again I'm learning this I'm learning
this as a black person one like or child
all crackers bleh yeah I don't know and
then you know later in life I got to the
Jewish portion I was a holy you
know it's so Trump and he's bad he's
from that lineage right like it's this
idea that of course you're gonna
separate yourself you otherwise yourself
you're gonna put yourself at the top
like obviously if I'm Italian I'm better
than the Polish people obviously the
Irish people are dumber than me less
culture than me they're these nasty mix
and all that like that's what he
comes from that's New York City quote
unquote ethnic White's Donald Trump is
an ethnic white who always wanted to be
a waspey that's not the
answer and that is why the insecurity
like that's why it's so ridiculous
because he's your charge so much that's
why he's obsessed with in your times
that's why even though he's a
trust fund baby he still does feel
aggrieved it is also why the really
funny part and then will pivot off of
this but like there's another one I have
to admit was very funny to me could you
see any low cuz this whole base of
southern right even though he's like the
quintessential New York guy
did you guys hear his impersonation of
Jeff Sessions at CPAC he did a 7ex no no
it wasn't just a southern accent it was
an accent that I would have been like
Aria maybe he literally he's like he
goes he goes into jam sessions he goes
I'm gonna rookie's my Layla be
straight-up dead
a good raqi's bomb sale he's not lying
Teddy's bunker gear
my bad I'm pissing myself I should do do
baby why not I remember I remember
during the 2016 campaign because you
know he really wants to be a wasp and he
feels very grief because of it I
remember him talking about something
Marlo go if people don't know you know
these country clubs in the South are
really terrible and they don't let Irish
and they don't let Jewish people and and
he made a big deal about how it's like I
let everybody into my clubs actually
because nobody understands that except
for Donald Trump right right right
I was very progressive right I bet I
shook Magic Johnson's he had serious L a
reference shall Stanley wise let's talk
about Nipsey Hussle well we're gonna get
into well of course but this is an LA
crowd shouts to the City of LA man as a
transplanted you know New Yorker been
here since 2017 of September I came here
expecting the worst but it's been
incredible beautiful what did you expect
no I just expected a bunch of
with nose rings and sheep
sound would be and lionize
expected some I just expected
some but honestly I lay as
being incredible I love Ellie I was
wrong I'm not afraid to admit when I'm
wrong that's why I'm a good lefty
actually that's what I'm a bad lefty you
a good left do you never know what's the
work a lot more to engender the humility
and process part of the left yeah right
we gotta get rid of that's true
talk about Nipsey Hussle though we did a
show we didn't walk bros about this i do
think it is actually important to talk
about him while we're here he was
somebody who did definitely you know I'm
not gonna exaggerate I was a fan
is like in the sense that I actually
listened to his music but I know those
people much more interested in his
discography than I was but he was more
like his death and what he represented
did echo more of like basically those
people that were birder than the 90s
that really meant yeah thing that was
distinct other than just you know well
that's awful if anybody dies young but
he really was putting something together
he also was the only person I I found
this very interesting anytime an
entertainer criticizes like greed or a
practice of a record label or something
like that and they don't say like greedy
or but like he specifically used the
word capitalist just very interesting to
me yet so what like talk about him man
so yes I'll submit see hustle we got a
we got a you know I like like you I
found Nipsey Hussle music only last year
February when his first major record
label out Rock marathon I'm excuse me
victory lap um which you know I never
listen to previous but people who
are respected with like no you need to
listen to Nipsey Hussle like he's dope
in my own ignorance my own New York City
hubris I was like alright no me
is a nose ring I don't want to listen a
gangbang banker from Los Angeles we get
it we've seen it already
gangbangers can't ride they gangbang
whatever I was I was being that person
and you know it took a couple of people
that was very close to whose opinion in
the arts that I respect and they were
like no you need to listen it I listen
and I was literally I literally I was
blown away like just the guys clarity
and message his clarity of vision it is
just clarity when I listen to what his
music you understood what he was trying
to achieve like literally he put it
there for you right in your face like I
want to get money yes but I want to
reinvest in my neighborhood not because
you
I wanna make more money no it's like I
want the people from where I'm from to
understand that nice things aren't
reserved for everybody else we deserve
nice things too and that was his message
in his songs right and a lot of times as
a rat fan I've been listening to rap
long enough to know that's nice a lot of
times that is the message in your song
but this guy was putting it in his works
like out in the world his deeds
reflected that right like everything he
did was about empowering the people from
where he came from and you know
everybody in this room like we're in a
position enough that way we could show
up to a lot of podcasts have fun go home
not worry about a goddamn thing we gotta
worry about a that we know
maybe gets shot maybe getting robbed may
begin this maybe we don't think about
those things on a day-to-day basis let
alone an hour-to-hour basis this is the
type of environment this guy's from so
to watch him do this like actually do it
that's the part that's important because
people make music a lot of people make
music powerful music what they call
protest music this guy was out doing it
and so when he dies in front of his
store in front in his neighborhood that
he grew up in you know doing the works
it just hurt me because it's like you
know I thought about my people then when
I say might not think about black people
it's like it's not enough to just do
something like a lot of people they get
to get rich or get money or be
successful you don't got to reach back
you can just move on with your life in
your success but when you're black you
got to reach back well that's part of
the wealth got to learn exactly it's
part of what we talk about
and that's why I think it's important
that's why my man Mike chuckling what
are we gonna talk about the reason why
the nipsey topic is important it's not
just because me and Mike are you know
people who love the arts of course but
his story is very indicative of what
y'all do on TPMS every day right every
single day like his story is a part of
the story that y'all trying to tell and
I'm trying to tell that there are people
who don't have it right and it's not
because they're not smart enough late
and I said think about knit that it's
nice now that everybody's realizing it
but like it's not because they're not
smart like nobody's smarter than it's a
hustle this guy was a computer geek
this guy this guy went his stuff he went
has studied he got a bad deal first
he wouldn't study that deal better than
the lawyer that was supposed to be
representing was he wouldn't learn that
deal to where when he do his next deal
he could represent himself right like
this is a guy who went out and did the
work and so this guy got killed because
of the culture the environment of where
he's at and it's not one thing that's
gonna change that but the reality is and
I hate to bring it back to slavery and
whites oppression and white supremacy
but that's just it
like the reason why self central is what
it is it's not an accident right like my
neighborhood in Queens is not like South
Central it's not because these people in
South Central like special people who
only act this way in this neighborhood
know like this is a system that bred
that environment that a person from his
own neighborhood to look at him as a
person like you know and I was telling
people is like you know you know when
Nick died I look at it it's like how two
cops look at it right you kill a cop
it's like not only did you kill my homie
you kill as somebody who is supposed to
be doing the deeds so this is like a
triple murder not only did you kill
somebody which is against the law you
killing somebody who's pulling
blah right and so the environment that
allows for you know I don't know this
dude that killed I don't know anything
about him but just then he he can be a
person who thinks it's okay to kill
Mitzy Hussle you gotta know he's from an
extreme background that he can't
understand that this is a bad thing to
do you know and so you know the NIP
thing was just is so it just everything
that we talk about all the time about
income inequality opportunities to quote
the so-called meritocracy
like there was nobody with more married
than Nipsey Hussle right and so you know
it's it's up but it's nice it's
nice that the world and we go you know
berry cloud chasing lily that's okay cuz
I'm gonna say we have a couple minutes
left
can't we get petty for a minute yes
that was beautiful and I actually hope
that the energy of what was just
conveyed is what people will leave this
room with and let's get petty for a
minute of course okay so and notto
pointed this out but we all know like
president obama has always had a very
well calibrated every time I saw his
playlist I was like there's some people
in his communications team that know
what they're doing yes Koecher wide like
he really had I remember even down and
I'm not saying this even to NAS stand
but I noticed in one list cuz he was
always like jay-z and then fire he was
like jay-z's a toner well that was the
thing though is that finally I remember
i'ma brought one list he was like but
listen to NAS and I was like oh that's
the real tweet like good just like noir
tells a Stevie Wonder little NAS and
also Neil Young hey calm down
Bruce Springsteen thank God God God God
love love supreme so so okay a tweet for
Nipsey Hussle which by the way I'll be
even more petty Barack Obama in 2009 met
Lula da Silva and said this is the man
right here most popular politician on
the planet maybe it sweep about your
friend runs a better presence in you
being a political prisoner okay I don't
play identity politics when it comes
(Laughter)
everybody's on their own merit a Lula so
but that being said maybe a tweet for
nipsey that he really was the entire
press release
like I guess what it is is it's like I
that Obama did get into jay-z and Nas
niche is already at another generate
like it's just like yeah no there's no
way he was listening to um I ain't
nothing like these Brad
there's no chance he's ever heard that
song I'm not though no you know in
whatever berry his media savvy it could
be looked at two ways is like at least
he's smart enough to do it but if you
could look at it in a cynical fashion
like Jesus bro you really sent a letter
signed sealed delivered to Nipsey Hussle
service it felt like damn this
popping right now so one of those things
over there that's what it felt like you
know but but again but to me um to be in
it might sound like naive and I might
sound like an idiot for this but I think
all of these things are actually good in
the sense that like people will see like
if you go out in the world and you try
to actually touch the lives of the
( __ )
cuz around you in a meaningful fashion
people will actually take notice of that
and so it feels like that with men
and because every other day did some
other cuz even when Trey came on
with us and again Trey is a tell a cat
he's like nip don't play ball he uses
money to renovate some hoop some some
some park some ball courts he's like
this is where the people hang out
let's renovate it let's make it some
that they could use he's not a
Hooper this hoop is from LA who never
did that so like it just makes me
feel like when you do deeds maybe just
maybe good things will come out of that
we're like this guys getting
recognized for deeds not his raps like
the biggest thing we'll see him in on
this is his like nah well the guy just
wasn't just just a rapper now he they
don't put a school he opened up a shared
workspace I mean the guy actually I was
like cuz I did I wondered that I was
like how was nipsey gonna be covered
because he's brilliant he's talented he
did serious community investment and and
he's literally a gangster yes how is
that gonna be perceived and then I saw
he invested in a we workspace I was like
oh no he's good but he will definitely
get good coverage or space and you know
and I think oh I think it's important I
think it's important for you know but my
kid y'all do like I love it not just
because Mike is my personal friend but I
feel like you guys are putting out
in the world in a way that the people
can actually receive it right like it's
not about oh I'm wearing a fancy soon
I'm one of cable news this I'm gonna dis
and this and that
it's like your soupy let me I see you
gotta tell me but like you guys are
putting it out in a way for people
comment people regular people like you
and I to receive it and be like you know
what man I understand what the
these dudes are talking about the whole
and I know why I gotta do it and I think
you know I would never act as if I'm
some emissary and nipsey hussle but I
but what I received from this cat is
that you should deliver your message in
the most clear passionate true way that
you can so that the people can receive
it the you trying to give them what
you bring every single time thank you
I love you man I love you too thank you
for this phone and I'm gonna be back for
part four don't worry about the
that's right
we're back for the contest give it up
for waswas come on don't forget that
you'll be really ready for the contest
woz is the best man you deliver so the
next person I hope that was picked up on
camera the next person I'm gonna bring
out on stage is someone that I could not
have more admiration for someone that
I've grown a real and sincere friendship
with someone who I think brings a dynamo
and intelligence a clarity and integrity
of purpose but is also again like
everybody up here is also very reckless
and very funny and just a legend
ana kasparian at the young turks


I'm so glad you're here I gotta ask who
you spending eternity with in the bunker
sorry to welcome you that all right let
me let me just say Ana you're amazing I
can't wait to talk about why job
statistics are not real with you that's
gonna be fascinating and make 50 Ruben
with you it had to be that you're
amazing all right who would you spend
eternity with so I put a lot of thought
behind this and at first I'm like okay
this is actually a great opportunity so
at first my mind went to who do I want
to fight and I was like Laura Ingram
like Laura Ingram I you know get to
practice some of the kickboxing that I
used to you know train be amazing but
I'll get tired of it pretty quickly
stuff right you don't want to live with
some buddies you have to up all
this so then I thought about how people
who would likely shut the up all
the time and I decided I'm tired I'm
exhausted so I would go with Ben Carson
cuz I feel like we would mouth
it'll be like living next to a
relaxation team I'll get a lot of rest
and then what have you tried to convert
you like what have uses that you know
Anna there are only two people left
there's one of us understands the work
and you don't understand the work so
you'd have to kickbox him I might I
might have to but the other option could
be Clarence Thomas because he never
talks so that would be perfect as well
but I mean he's got other issues I mean

Jesus all right thank parson unless ben
Carson had like a stabbing relapse Ben
Carson wasn't the stabber
somebody tried to stab him and his belt
buckle other than the no no he's tried
to stab someone
and the belt buckle got in the way my
apologies by the way as it's running for
president he thinks it's a good idea to
disclose this information remember that
was another I'm sorry to do this but
that was another great Trump highlight
or he's that was like there was a minute
where Ben Carson was ahead of him in the
polls and he's like in Iowa's like the
guy stabbed somebody and I'm losing to
him what's the matter with you he
literally was like what's the battery
and how much would you pay Obama to
display the devil's double-digit growth
what's the matter with you actually kind
of did that a couple weeks ago right
he's a SideReel for a lot of oil he
white people
where's the credit I wish you know I'm
actually impressed by how you're able to
laugh because it's true like Trump is
funny
he says funny things I remember enjoying
the Republican debates way more I
wouldn't say way more but I was more
entertained by the Republican debates so
when Jake would ask hey who's available
to cover the RNC or whatever
publican nonsense it's going on if you
like yeah I'm into it definitely yep
count me in and then with Democrats any
type of event that Hillary was doing if
it was a Town Hall what what can I come
up with and so luckily I planned my
wedding during election season with
anything I don't know I got a pic
centerpieces I'm sorry it's very
important to be clear you are married
for the man of your dreams and that was
not why you got married to avoid being
around Hillary Clinton but you expedited
it yeah so people think it's crazy like
how could you plan a wedding while
you're working in news during a giant
election like a huge controversial
election but it was it was a good excuse
for getting out of things that I didn't
want to do and honestly that that year
was disastrous like it was non-stop Hey
and by the way Monday Monday 5 Town
Hall's on CNN that we're all covering
which sounds pretty terrible right well
I like doing a show that has more sort
of like history focus and long-term
value like that's the design to be so it
I could because you have the obligation
to cover and not only cover but like
because you do actual work you have to
like provide actual snow you can't just
be like you know hey this is CNN and you
know the Mellie's board and there's
definitely works and clovers are like a
really great boss I don't know yeah you
have to actually do it I can be like
what's up it's not my Haiti I don't
watch any of that but you do
something that no one else is doing
right so I gotta be honest other shows I
kind of struggle to sit through the
entire thing because it's the same stuff
that we're covering so they might come
at it from a different perspective but
usually it's the mainstream non
controversial non analytical perspective
but I love I have no idea what you just
said it's okay I got it though you don't
need to do it again
I got your brother but it's kind of
crazy to come across someone in the
media that gives a about history
who actually wants to understand like
the dynamics and other countries you
know who cares so much about a political
prisoner in a different country like
you're an American right Americans don't
do that and so it's very refreshing to
see someone who cares about you know
some of the injustice around the world
I'm honored by that but I also think
like everybody all of us who are like
doing work on like the progressive or
left or whatever the you have to
think historically some what to do what
we do right cuz we're contextualizing
things like you do that all the time
you'll always work backwards like
alright this is the policy set but
here's like the environment that it's
flowing out of and the whole other side
that is a very basic dividing line it's
all like okay this is the world just is
and that could be it just is because of
science or God and like in a way it
doesn't really matter they're just
because they don't want to figure out
why we're at where we're at yeah 100%
and it's not just about the history that
got us to where we are today which by
the way you look at history and it's
supposed to be just lessons you know
you're supposed to take lessons from our
history so you don't repeat the same
mistakes and of course we don't do that
if you look at our economy if you really
look at our economy you can see that
we're making the exact same mistakes
that we did you know in the lead-up to
2008 but the one thing that I people
cared more about is the history of
candidates in the history of politicians
and how they got to where they are when
it comes to their stated policy
positions because I just see a lot of Oh
progressivism trendy right now so I'm
gonna go ahead and use the progressive
label but no you don't get to exploit
that for your own political gain
what what is your career been so far
what have you stood for so far and I
just don't buy this whole argument about
well you know in those years I ran in a
more conservative district so I was a
giant douche bag who you know supported
all these policies that have been
disastrous
that was the beta O'Rourke section
what's really admirable is when you come
across someone who is willing to lead
and a leader puts him or herself in an
uncomfortable position and fights for
the right thing even knowing that it's
not popular at that moment even knowing
that it's unconventional at that moment
definitely bringing of course I mean I
watched I played on the show a couple of
weeks ago
you know Cornel West was on with Mehdi
Hassan and Cornel West is that's my he's
my favorite dude that's my 11:00 TV and
he said he was like he was like look
like Bernie's like me he's old like he
doesn't know all the buzz words but he
has commitment and he's not what like I
know he would be arrested with me today
and it's just different it's different
like of course I respect Elizabeth
Warren of course I like Elizabeth Warren
you know and then that's pretty much it
Bernie's got something's just different
it's a level of commitment and an
understanding about conflicts one of my
favorite Bernie videos is from you know
right after you know the recession
happened and I believe it was the Senate
yeah it was definitely the Senate
they're questioning Alan Greenspan yeah
it was like a hearing without Alan
Grayson it was one of my favorite videos
because Bernie Sanders just was asked
asked very pointed questions did you or
did you not say XY and Z prior to the
recession Greenspan looks like a
he knows that he's caught right and he
had to admit that he was wrong he had to
admit that those economic policies were
wrong and it just felt good to see
someone in elected office actually
fighting for the right purpose and also
feeling vindicated right you can see it
in this
she's feeling vindicated executing
everyone know your exact well because
there's clips of him going back because
you know there's tons of clips of him
like that in the 90s when he's saying it
and Alan Greenspan's on the cover of
Time magazine exactly yeah and in the I
can't say that I feel the same
frustration that he does but we keep
seeing bad behavior get rewarded over
and over and over again and for the
first time in a while you see someone
and not just Bernie I mean you're seeing
it with some of these freshmen Democrats
these young women by the way
bill 101

we stand within lon
every day on this song I just I
love a sassy right I love when
strong women stand their ground despite
all this wave of hate and and all these
attacks and these threats against them
you know Ilan Omar in the middle of the
country going against her and making her
out to be something that she clearly
isn't she she's thank you she I she
stands up and she's like look I didn't
get elected to be quiet I got elected to
fight and represent my district I love
it I really do and she's changed the
game I mean what she's done in the past
couple of months moving the window over
talking about American imperialism
abroad talking about Israel and
Palestine has been so significant and
this is like where you really make a
difference is by being strong and not
backing down and a lot of people have
you know backed out too much
what is she yeah I like I like when she
but she also what I of course what I
like about her is that she's so low-key
she is that like AOC is actually very
nice
Rashida's totally like galley I don't
give a whatever like she that's
like very clear I love that I love that
too but then L on is actually like you
really like them more like did you see
that clip where some comments she
criticized Obama's record and like
rightfully so she criticized about
things like drones like 100 percent
and then Waze is my black conscience
every time I get to critical of Obama
like by did you see his daughters his
daughters
yeah he's now exactly you are no longer
by black conscience was exactly thank
you
maybe we have an impromptu gulag segment
but she said she was getting harassed
you know some idiot was like what I
should say that they were like you know
doing the hallway mic thing and they
were like you know what about like are
you saying that Trump and Obama are the
same and she's like of course not one is
human and the other is not like
literally how I would describe my dams
like know what does a human be you want
to talk about also why job statistics
were yeah so I talked about
this it's more about the general
coverage of the economy in the
mainstream media which drives me crazy
and I feel like we're losing the
narrative as progressives and we need to
do maybe a better job in revealing
what's really going on in the economy
it's just it's so funny to me that you
keep hearing people in the media say
that oh the economy's booming and the
stock market's doing really well I mean
yeah homelessness is skyrocketing
everywhere and people aren't living in
tent cities everywhere but you know the
economy's doing really well but the
economy doesn't start and stop with the
stock market right are not putting money
in the soft market most people are not
especially with all these you know new
jobs a lot of them are part-time a lot
of them are temporary a lot of them do
not pay a living wage so you can do like
a super shallow superficial view of the
jobs numbers but what's the quality of
those jobs so we talk about that on TYT
a lot and I feel like sometimes i annoy
the people around me because like we
need to talk about what the jobs numbers
really say you should do you put on that
voice and meeting no but but the funny
thing is I do feel like the annoying
grandma at work sometimes because like
jank is this very passionate person and
when he should I do it should I do it
should should I do the oppressing should
I do it you know I'm not gonna do it

job numbers are progressive
I love Jiang you're kidding so obvious
when my impressions are of love or
concern so sometimes like okay we go
live at 3:00 Pacific time right and he
has this habit of coming down like to
where all the producers are and comes to
my desk and he's like did you see this
story the story just broke it's like
wait it's 2:45 we're gonna go live in 15
minutes and and I'm like uh no I haven't
seen the story he's angry about it he's
like here's what we're gonna do we're
gonna cover the story alright I'll
present it I'll present it and then
we're gonna call for a campaign to do
this and that and the way way way way
wait hold on so like I I feel like kind
of the old lady behind the scenes was
like look we got to really stop and
think about this first
you know what I mean and but we do
you're ready let's let's actually have a
plan in place and let me let me look
into this story first like let me let me
decide how I feel before I have to
comment on it for this giant show with
this giant audience so but he's the
thing that I love about him is he's go
go go right like he's a fighter he
doesn't want to stop and he's so
relentless and I'm not gonna lie there
have been I don't know five hundred
times where I just wanted to quit and
I'm like this this this is
and I should just go sell pictures of my
feet I could make so much money

I'm not kidding I can make a lot of
money selling picture I have no doubt of
any outlandish I hear I could be
sold online but he he motivates me to
keep going right and not sell you feet
not say yeah I actually had a
conversation with him about he's like
don't sell pictures of your feet
I would love to see shanks reaction to
that yeah he's like he's this optimist I
don't know and I don't understand it I
really don't
he's very awkward you don't know on some
level yes but I mean part of it is just
I will pull Colston like New England New
York that cynicism is there you guys
definitely are a little bit and I
understand I I told him about it took a
hot yoga class today I get it I'm
feeling very optimistic I did it crazy
that's why I woke up with obviously so
but but why instead of selling your feet
why don't you go out and sell ideas
well the marketplace is is very
lucrative for a certain type of idea
right is a certain type of ideas that
anything the people are interested in
yeah so for instance if I mean I'm
sharing my ideas right and it's not very
profitable and that's okay because it's
the right thing to do but if I wanted to
take a more lucrative route I could do
things like you know feminists are
really what's wrong with America right
get that coke money yeah we you know you
know what the problem is with education
the teachers okay
let's go after the teachers the unions
those are the really bad guys that we
need to go after like that's what would
make me money that would have there's a
lot of ideas in that all right so Anna I
do want to spend a few minutes with you
making fun a day true but I gotta tell
you
absolutely look look I'm willing to do a
lot of but I don't particularly
want to get sued and there is some
uncovered audio and I should just
actually I'll just bury delete half of
this audio is real half of this audio is
fake but I think Dave Rubin might be in
his way I mean a definitely
demonstrating that he's watching our
for sure and and B I think he's got
some pretty clear impulses going on
about what he wants to do about it can
we play the Prager University sketch
please thoughts on two separate topics
cobbling them together and then
suggesting that was my position as you
started open line was this a public
person is this an actual rip and make
you listen yeah there's an anonymous
account so what do you do in a case like
that okay you can defend yourself uh yet
it we've all done this but I'm starting
to think that that's not enough and it's
an odd place that I have Robert Barnes
here a couple weeks yeah a lawyer and
it's like it's an odd lease for the
free-speech guys to be going we have to
figure out what are the legal
protections around speech because it's
so not and I and I hate it like in the
worst position for me to possibly write
there's position for me to possibly
moments later in the Praeger you locker
room banana
beneath dennis prager x' house dave
rubin is dissatisfied with ben Shapiro's
lack of receptivity to the idea of
weakening the First Amendment so the
intellectual dark web can sue people who
dunk on them online this is cat abuse is
that please seems like you necessarily
want to come to my wedding every street
and now he's not interested in the idea
of suing people that make fun of us and
millions it is a strange position being
because as a free market guy and I
believe in markets and ideas and freedom
and ideas and markets but me and I
really think I'm a summation that it
might be the government that makes it
illegal for someone to call me stupid
and I wish there is more receptivity
oh look said a dog are we scared of Dave
suing us for calling the idiot I
mean he'd have to think in order to go
through the process of suing someone no
he's not a fat alex jones is though
I'm just stating the facts like people
get upset at the facts but I mean we've
all seen the pictures before and after
the before before no but it's just I
mean Dave Rubin and like it's just wild
cuz you like are literate like you're up
at 6:00 a.m. you're doing all your store
and he's like yeah there's some ideas
but here's the thing what what is the
deal with this guy well so I
think that grifting is a special skill
right like like I don't respect it but I
think that you need to at least know
your and know how to back up your
argument even if it's like a BS argument
you need to have an argument yeah and
you doesn't even take like he doesn't
even do the legwork to be a grifter
right like how do you do how do you
agree to a 3-hour podcast with Joe Rogan
where you're gonna have to talk about
your positions and not do a little like
okay what should my talking points be
right he wasn't saying that electricity
electric wires feed not next to water
who's gonna help you with that
did you see though what he did a couple
weeks ago okay I'm sorry
it's wrong but somebody tweeted this at
me and they said watch Dave Rubin do an
impersonation of you doing an
impersonation of him
and he's literally you saw this this was
the this is the Tim Poole where
he's like he's like here on Jill Rogan a
lot and first of all Tim Poole if Tim
Poole has you on your back heel god damn
he was like you know a lot of people
give you our time about that Joe Rogan
thing and he's just because of the stuff
about that you said about building
protection what is it and David what I
love the room does the like yeah as an
icky snap shut you and then he goes
and he's like yeah I'm interested in
ideas
how many times do you need to make a
fool out of yourself before you try to
figure out how you're gonna have an
argument like an argument to back up
your ridiculous ideas and also you're
gonna make strong comments about how
Amazon is better than the post office
can you can you please at least figure
out how Amazon works logistically and
whether or not they contract the post
office wait what the post office program
don't even think about Willis I bought
the post office I learned about that
that would be really cool I I feel like
at this point most people know he's a
fraud right I mean you guys have no idea
this is sue for all we know you could be
super earnest and I think what we
call you stupid it's pretty descriptive
that's more like an objective versus
subjective but anyways good agree when
he first left I mean he left on good
terms and then when he like went on his
talking he left on good so he was
like Judas dum-dum like what happens he
left right he even did a video with jank
like a departing video and it was like
very positive and like spank
yeah yeah yeah everything was good and
then all of a sudden like I remember the
first thing that happened was he started
bad-mouthing us the first time he was on
Rogen's podcast and he claimed that we
we edit things out of interviews which
we don't like and you I think he was
specifically talking about the sam
harris debate that Jake had which was
literally three hours long there was
nothing at it I mean sighs I mean it was
literally three hours it was it was
three hours
it was so hard to like remain quiet
especially for someone like me as he was
just going around lying about us lying
about why he left lying about what his
ideology is and so for years literally
years I told myself okay I'm just I'm
not that person I'm not gonna badmouth
him I'm just gonna let this go and I was
on the left shoulder like a person on
TBS Dave's a idiot
let's talk about some good new tube
clips and and that's that day came it
came I came to it you drop them but it
was hard like when people didn't know he
was a fraud yet and they actually
thought we were the bad guys I was like
what all things dark come to light like
just wait just wait and then little by
little I mean again if you're gonna be a
grifter you are gonna go out there
you're gonna make your arguments but
people are gonna ask questions and if
you don't have answers to those
questions you're gonna be revealed as a
fraud by the way the thing that got me
through it was listening to you and Sam
make fun of her
it's like I I love this this is therapy
and they get it and hopefully others
will too and of course later they did
such assets no way we know it's great I
love it I'm happy too we are yeah
for the righteous
just like tormented day I like the fact
that the dude literally cannot say our
name I'm reading John Stuart Mill did
you see that even Colette knows that
Dave Rubens a fraud
Colette yes touch on this for a minute
so cool that posted a piece saying why
is the IDW the intellectual dark web why
is it all right wingers and dave rubin
got upset cos that it specifically
explained that he was a right winger
hanging out with Charlie kirkin evidence
oh that's brand I got a tweet from Dave
Rubin to the editor of coolant right
here it's a sad turn cleaner you guys
got crushed on the garbage piece your
own publication refuted part of its
basis all you had to do was not double
down you defended yourself all the time
on here when you get unfairly attacked
not sure what's what's going on with you
and Claire Lehmann who's not good don't
follow her but right but she responded
saying it was mild rational criticism
stop being a big baby I know you know
and and and and then I saw Dave put out
a tweet where he said I'm going to New
Jersey for a few days and then he had a
Sopranos gift that was like what and I
just tweeted out I quote tweeted it with
two thumbs down emojis and then I put
hashtag ideas
love-a-lot operating at commute so
you're gonna come back up for the game
obviously but what what is one thing
that you actually are optimistic about
right now I do want to know it's it's
cautious optimism because so early but
following Bernie's performance on the
foxes
so I was talking about this a little bit
you know off stage but one of the things
that really stood out to me was there's
this podcast I listened to called left
right and center and rich Lowry who's
the conservative he writes for National
Review and all that he's look I don't
agree with him on the vast majority of
things but he's a straight tribal
he's he's at least reasonable like he's
not he's not like a Trump era Republican
which is oh like maybe we put him in the
gulag for a couple years just give him a
little workout but he was commenting on
Bernie's performance and yet nothing but
positive things to say and when you have
a conservative saying you know what this
is what I respect about him he has a
message that he genuinely believes and
he is ready to share those ideas and
back them up because he feels sincere
about them and you know that I think
Bernie does have this ability to reach
across the aisle in a legit way not in a
like we need bipartisanship ie
we're gonna concede to Republicans on
everything right that's not what
Bernie's about Bernie actually
understands the economic frustrations
that unite us all regardless of
it's just so awesome to do work with you
Anna
it's awesome I appreciate me so
much you're gonna come back on and play
Tony Robbins our Mussolini with us thank
you so much thank you ana kasparian
where you going Matt all right all right
well Matt's
we were supposed to do a shout out
before we get Nando on stage but uh Matt
ready for it do you want to you all
right buddy I'll stick around for the
show No
yeah yeah stick around for the shout out
if you wouldn't mind can we get the
shout out back back dinner dinner how
many agree but if Dan Turkey could give
us a shout out BtoB
you know Joe top of the line the
Russians let's get to the shout out
shadow shadow shadow
we're China China China this is crazy

you're exactly right exactly right so we
got to do a couple of shout outs but
first I just had an MVP which all of you
are but a patron hands me this note and
say that I should shout out the
California Poor People's Campaign the
website that you can check out is end
child poverty CA org and so what they're
trying to do is my understanding is the
make there's several things on the table
probably the most broad and important
out of the gate is universal pre-k for
the state of California which is huge
that's an incredibly important goal and
my understanding is is that your
governor basically he wants to sign this
he doesn't care what's in it he just
wants to sign a big bill that he can say
he did something big on so what these
people are doing is they're working to
make sure that what is actually inside
that bill is aggressive is left is on
point is going to do serious things to
help the children in people of
California so we want to shout them out
a hundred percent
now I'm gonna keep this all anonymous
but there is a big universe of shows
around this show right
obviously majority report then you have
mean and of course you auntie father
most importantly of literary hangover
and then you've got people who interact
with us who you know I just don't I mean
I'll be honest I'm getting used to the
idea that I'm on some type of like
profile or something it's still very
weird and new to me in spite of my very
healthy ego so but I don't like I think
of us all as peers and all of us in the
same community just doing different
things I don't there's no separation in
my opinion and part of the way that
manifests is some people like call into
these shows and they're doing incredible
work like there's a show called the
redirect by Ronald Reagan that dude is
it as a genius and you'll get
perspective on immigration law that's
unparalleled like I listened to that
podcast for my own job we know that
dissident peasant you have that great
podcast we know I know there's another
one that I dude who goes by Kentucky
Fried comrade on Twitter is trying to do
on Kali politics that's great and I also
really want to shout out another one the
patreon just dropped for it I became a
patron as I am of these other shows
actually called ghetto news network

I would really really really really
subscribe to and listen to that sure so
there it is there it is all right I got
you
and of course I have to say as always I
mean a Lula does mean a lot to me and I
think through my relentlessness maybe it
started to mean a lot to other people as
well
free Lula I mean I think if you look at
somebody who literally did live 40
million people out of poverty who held a
type of leadership that nando and I are
actually going to talk about in a cup in
a minute
that there is a desire in the world for
you know there's this fascist rise but
there's a left rise but he did this when
George W Bush was president and this guy
was able to pull off huge gains for his
people and also be cool with Bush Obama
OCH medina ja china all of his pink tied
comrades as well as open up new
diplomatic pathways in africa and i
think him being in prison is an insult
to the planet and a major damage to
latin america which we all know affects
us and obviously affects them the
supreme court of brazil has given him
he's gonna do his first major interview
next week and i think they're using that
as leverage against the president but
we'll see and I would keep asking about
it and talking about it again this is
one where Bernie's the only one who's
ever said anything about this so
lu la libre i is mondo back there and
you go get a drink
alright


all of my mates realize that
pretty soon this is a Cuban national
anthem
cuz I'm from Miami and we're all Cuban
right bassist
sure I was also more thinking like you
and I share an admiration for Fidel yeah
you get me in trouble man fine that's my
job
who would you spend first of all again
knows another dude that I've gotten to
know just yeah it's your it's a blessing
to be around really good people and
Nando is awesome if you've seen
him fusion documentaries but then he's
also writing about the World Cup for the
athletic thank you for having me who you
spending your time was in the bunker oh
you know I thought about this a lot I
originally thought Barbara Bush but
she's dead yeah what is the thinking
behind Barbara Bush Barbara Bush is
amazing you know dare she other way to
tell you nanda was very anti-drug just
so you know
is not joking Jesus Christ that actually
was gonna get you in trouble look at la
420 crumbling this is not funny man
let's kick enjoying myself
I also Barbara Bush she fought uncle
Luke for years on the on the you know
parental advisory stuff and he won't
dream court cases what is there an
audience package absolute good night
uncle looked at it when do Supreme Court
cases yeah well that was a very like no
that had a lot of authority whoever did
that should consider broadcasting
no no no I'm starting to understand Bill
Maher more actually yeah you're always
like don't know get out yeah okay so the
guy who I love you I love you who I
actually would want to spend Bill
Maher's eternity don't want Bill Maher
was the best at being the worst
well Bill Maher was also part of what
she was either one you were gonna spend
eternity with no no okay all right
that's why God didn't stop it okay
listen to that nonsense just like you
know making jokes like you know you know
the president you know he is a Cheeto
that's why he looks like an orange but
if Obama was like shaft maybe this
wouldn't have happened okay yeah I said
it look like Bill Maher is still saying
yeah I said it about that's like
yeah we expect yeah yeah yeah expect you
just say like 20 years ago so the guy
the guy I'm actually spending the rest
of eternity in the bunker with is
Charles Barkley I think he is the best
all right you're gonna you can explain
it but then I'm gonna go to the informal
judges here and we're gonna be not
counting yeah super producer bat-like is
on board all right what's your reasoning
and then we go to the chief of
Colorado's Berkeley is one of my
favorite basketball players of all time
I mean he was like shorter than me and a
power forward and you know let Iligan
rebounding and all his good stuff he was
in Space Jam which
which are all cool things exactly
where's the right-wing campaign I put in
here Charles Bergman Space Jam was
hitting three-pointers all over the
place I remember that and then he
couldn't do it anymore couldn't he
couldn't never do that Charles but there
was never a 3-point shooter
anyways that's Matt that's why that's
why that movie never really took off
but Charles Barkley is one of these like
is one of these people who is like he's
like a big like Reaganite like pick
yourself up by your bootstraps you know
like if you're struggling it's your own
damn fault you know he always he always
has that kind of discourse so he's 100%
on the right well what's your vote III
just committed to an eternity with
Jim Baker and you're gonna say
like Charles Barkley Barkley all the way
up this is the options it's all I've
said okay fine yeah I'm changing my
answer to Morrissey the other that's
actually good for like new order yeah
that's actually a good one also
definitely I'll change my answer to
eazy-e it was like at a bush fundraiser
like easy yeah the other option I mean
another good one would be Roger stone
that would be a good time I respect that
would I feel like he would get so
annoying maybe he's got some
stories man would have some stories died
I actually had this I I hate myself for
saying this but I had a Twitter
interaction with Roger stone once Roger
stone falls Michael Bragg yeah no it was
it was just no no it was not know it was
rural areas was that I don't know it to
this day why he started following me
this was well before the show I am so
he's a friend of the friend of the pod
yeah his friend of the pod friend of the
pod Roger stone and and it was like it
was during the I don't
I said some about John Kasich Roger
stone like went to bat for Johnny no no
no not at all he replied he's like yeah
he's probably too high from all the
drugs he was doing in the 80s or some
and I was just like did I just like
it enlisted to do like dirty
tricks Roger stone that's better that's
kind of Awesome by it I think I favored
it it and it's just like that's the
cop-out
you know it's like yeah I appreciate
that
alright alright yeah Charlie I guess
Roger stone checks out Charles Barkley
was but that checks out
Oh Michael Jordan Michael truth is
definitely on the friend as well yeah I
think he'd be like unbearable yeah they
could recreate civilization again and
I'd still be number one yeah let's talk
about the pink tie though sure first of
all could you tell everybody like like I
we talk about it a lot on the show
obviously and obviously it matters a lot
to the show but like how would you
define them and like do you remember
like when you first became aware of
these guys like shabbos and Lula like
there was it wasn't just that they were
left there was like a lot of charisma
that was like the part of the world
where something different was happening
well yeah I mean I grew up in Miami
Florida which is where a huge percentage
of the oligarchs of Latin America fled
after the pink tide to happen so sort of
around the year 2000 Miami had a huge
influx of wealthy Venezuelans and
Colombian Brazilians Argentinians and it
really changed the city and like that's
that was kind of like my first
introduction to these figures which was
unbelievably negative like I remember it
was like I mean it was like Hitler and
I'm like Chavez was
one really below from like right-wing
Venezuelans I've met I thought it would
be more like okay that's a good idea
Chavez Hitler but it really is like a
remarkable thing that happened because
it wasn't preordained that it couldn't
that should have gone that way you know
the Latin America history is one of you
know it's a very tragic one large
largely thanks to my former my people or
Spaniards you don't talk about that he's
a real Spanish person that's okay guys
yeah but you know I'm not I can't that's
a touchy subject we can't talk about
that but but uh but yeah it wasn't it
was definitely not preordained that that
was gonna go that way they could have
easily just you could have easily seen
like all these militaries come and just
take power again which they had done
throughout the twentieth century several
times but there was such a mass
mobilization such a large popular
movement that even the military's
couldn't come in and and an overturning
it was it was really a remarkable thing
and you know we could you know we could
talk about their mistakes and there's
been many and we can discuss it but at
the end of the day like you said earlier
lula lifted forty million people out of
poverty in brazil overall in latin
america the pig tide lifted seventy
million people out of poverty since 2002

that's pretty good when you talk about
the mistakes that's what's interesting
right because what is the actual mistake
like it's very comfortable for people to
go at the ones that went in a more I
don't know what the right I don't really
know what the right word to use but a
more heavy-handed direction right and
then on the other hand like a guy like
Lula who really did he created a win-win
and then others kind of like straddled
the middle but it's like what what was
the actual mistake right like was it
because the ones that were tougher or
has more resilient in power well not him
obviously I mean not in Brazil though I
think the DOJ definitely helped this
process happen for sure and they funded
yeah absolutely
lava jato is definitely us back thing
there's sanctions have been as well and
the coup in Honduras started all of it
in 2009 yeah I mean obviously the United
States has been behind repression and
anti democracy in Latin America since
since the United States has existed
since the beginning but I mean the
biggest obvious mistake well I mean it's
hard to call it a mistake because it's
an incredibly difficult thing to
overcome is the just the sort of the
over reliance on resource extraction on
commodities right I mean most of the
pink tide successes came on the backs of
a giant commodities boom in the 2000s
right yeah you know oil copper soy all
these things that Latin America has
incredible resources and for these
countries and for these leaders like
it's like they're sitting on this gold
mine and it's just like it's so tempting
to just rely on that
than you know developed native
industries and all these things and I
couldn't repay you yeah okay but yeah I
mean and it's obviously easy to say that
from where we're sitting but that's that
that's the real that's the real kind of
tragedy of Latin America the real kind
of curse that that that will always
follow that Americas how do you move
beyond resource distraction as your main
economic engine because if you keep
doing that then you are always always
always at the whim of international
markets and and also that same colonial
domination absolutely because the
conduit is all of those commodities
absolutely and raw materials going back
to like I mean do you were meant like
when do you when you first read you
don't have to have read like I haven't
read much right but I know you like when
you first read about the coup in
Guatemala against our pens in the 50s
right and you got like first of all this
is up because this is literally
where the phrase Banana Republic comes
from yeah like they're literally saying
this country is a subsidiary of what was
the company the United Fruit Company
United for a company currently current
page Chiquita banana right yeah and and
Arbenz comes into power in the 50s more
on that Lulla end right like okay guys
like we're still gonna have elections
I'm gonna do some land reform
you can't just pillage this country
totally yeah and the land reform in
Guatemala wasn't even it was he wasn't
even expropriating productive land in
Guatemala that belonged to the United
Fruit Company it was only land that was
unproductive who was just sitting there
doing nothing this is land reform in
South Africa right now by the way and
when you see those like big right wing
fear campaigns cuz South Africa's become
like a global talking point for white
supremacy right now oh yeah but that's
exactly what they're talking about
they're talking about unused
unproductive land from corporate
conglomerates essentially remember we
have a Milton al-ahmadi on the
show sometimes who's awesome this
amazing journalist I learned so much
from but I was like just to be clear
like you're not talking about small like
African or farms except you owe me not
for Conor right exactly
the whole this land get on the levy
Department's beer yeah get on the land
might be what do you see happening there
now though like with the right dominant
and also like is there I mean you still
have not only used I mean that as well a
is absolutely complicated I think the
most basic position is opposing us c'mon
Graham there period that's the bottom
line
but Ava Morales is still actually
delivering a lot Bolivia yeah we I mean
I remember whenever Morales was first
elected and it was like in in the
Western media I mean there was no bigger
laughingstock I mean it was I remember
in in Miami there was a radio show that
it was famous for impersonating like
political leaders and then prank calling
them like they prank called with Chavez
and they prank called the at the time
the president of Spain a guy named
thought they'd oh but they prank call
everyone at least pretending to be the
president of Spain and like offering all
this stuff and like you know like
embarrassing him and stuff and like
everyone had a good laugh and like Evan
what always has outlasted them all the
first native democratically elected
leader in Latin American history and
Bolivia's economy has grown I think like
something like forty two percent since
everyone on this took power
so it's an unqualified success the guy
who like no one gave a shot like no one
it was the head of the cocoa farmers
union and he became you know yeah he's
an indigenous leader who was universally
mocked and disrespected and yeah I mean
he's an unqualified success from Bolivia
which doesn't even have way
that much of a strategic position to
resist us pressure from absolutely and
it's been constant yeah yeah I mean and
you know obviously like believe you
still relies on you know resource
extraction largely for there but he's
been he's been a little bit smarter than
some of the other ones he has a more
diversified economy than say Venezuela
which is like largely reliant on oil and
that's really at the heart of the crisis
is the collapse in oil prices but that's
how you would frame like what's what are
you thought something as well a real
quick it's it's a legitimate crisis you
know it's a legitimate humanitarian
crisis there are always a huge amount of
suffering event as well it's like I
don't think it's useful to deny that it
is Maduro is kind of a kind of a you
know just to kind of whatever a guy you
know he's not he's nowhere near the
political talent that like a Chavez or
Lula or any or Morales is but you also
just you cannot except for one second
you know the the mainstream narrative
about it that that this guy long why
though just declares himself president
after cutting a deal with Mike Pence in
which they but he told them like oh yeah
president you recognize me and then
tomorrow the military leaders will just
like come to my side and then it's gonna
be good
and I'm not ballet well yeah
get Carcetti get out of here I take that
job
I mean this is one of the struggles
right is when you're talking about
trying to build left-wing governments in
Latin America is the power of the
International Finance community when it
comes to cracking down because do you
know what no one in the united states
except for you know some people on the
left are very worried about this pig
bolson are oh who wants to privatize
much of that economy oh my god the
Bursar's Medora who might not be the
most capable like you know generational
talent politically right is trying to
maintain some forms of very hard-fought
there is no Leila doubt in my mind
without any I agree you don't whitewash
Venezuela you don't whitewash Maduro but
if your perspective is coming from
primary concern for poor people or
unions or indigenous people already
Brazil is in a deeper crisis for those
people than Venezuela is to the
definition it drives me crazy to see
like Bloomberg News or The Economist or
what I think was like yesterday the day
before in Time Magazine's 100 most
important people whatever bolsa narrow
is one of them with Ian Ian
Bremmer
or is that liberal like very respected
liberal geopolitical analysts or
whatever from like something tank boat
oh he runs a private editor at large
he runs a private consultancy called
racial rearrangement yeah yeah and they
advised my Asia group they can be large
on political risk
he's a Davos Whisperer is it yeah he's
one of these guys that's job is to go to
rich I spin ideas festival yeah be like
you know what we really need is you know
we really need to deregulate the
economies of Sudan Burundi and Brazil
obviously and then you will see
democracy flourish in all these places
and good things will happen and yeah
that's great I had a post oh you got the
tweet I got the tweet yeah read this
Ian Bremmer says this is a bowl
scenario a poster boy for toxic
masculinity whoa
and Brazil's best chance for in a
generation to enact economic reform
economic reforms that is the baddies of
Township but that's the perfect like
he's he's concerned enough to be like I
better throw some woke nonsense
into this before I endorse like one of
the most horrific people on the planet
because bottom line is I don't care if
he's literally you know in fact they
need to strip protections for indigenous
people because that's how look at the
Amazon but like I don't care that he you
know the stuff that would offend people
like Ian Bremmer like both scenario said
I prefer my kid that died than be gay so
I have to be like well that's that's
terrible but you know what you might
slash people's pensions you know it's
it's worth like insisting upon the fact
that like any new you type on something
to show all the time and it's that's why
your show is amazing but Boston are oh
sorry you're talking about the show that
I do with you that you drag down
Oh Ann Coulter are you gonna be father
or daughter father daughter are both no
are you gonna be in it for the contest
you get to go on the field holy
can we book Mike Huckabee like I would
love to get Mike Huckabee on the show to
talk to why I haven't played a face tell
jokes what were you saying about how
amazing my show is yeah you shows
amazing but it's worth it's worth it's
just upon the fact both Cynara
bolson are Oh makes Donald Trump look
like well-respected
sober States makes Donald Trump lovely
Hillary Clinton he really does yeah and
and you know the the business press and
a lot of liberal press are like yeah you
know he might say some crazy things
every once in a while but you know like
that all those poor people that made all
those games in Brazil they're gonna
reverse all that and that's gonna be
good then Michael Brooks show rocks man
all right I love it no but this is why
it's so important though we talk about
bolson are you tell me what's going on
in Venezuela returnable scenario and the
relationship with the DOJ that why it's
important not only for us be recognizing
what's going on in Latin and South
America but also to be working as hard
as we can to elect left-wing governments
of the United States to be challenging
the American imperialists project
because because there is a right wing in
that part of the world and they are
powerful we shouldn't whitewash and be
so focused on America that we can't
recognize that those right wing for that
right wing is so powerful because they
have the United States military the
United States financed and the United
States military power monetary fund
exactly roll bang grow Bank I am at
that's why it's so important for us to
be you know part of these movements for
liberation yes you asked Anna like what
she was optimistic about and she said
that like Bernie has a legitimate shot
of winning the Democratic nomination
it's not slam dunk but it's possible
it's but and Jeremy Corbyn has a
legitimate shot of winning the prize to
shape the absolute boy in the UK and
maybe I'm being slightly naive but like
I feel like if those two things happen
at the same time you just see cascading
benefits all over the third world mostly
because you know two largest capitalist
economies in the world will just kind of
just get out of the way in the third
world who've been trying to make it to
make a change for decades and have
always been forwarded by you know the
international power structure led by the
United States now that's exactly in the
last couple of minutes though before
everybody comes up on stage of the
contest thank you
we as the audience love your soup choice
let's think was the only person on earth
that breaks me would you see parallels
between people like like the Sanders in
Corbin moment of today went then with
the pink tide when they rose the power
yeah absolutely I mean you know the the
pink tide really came about after about
you know 10 years before in the early
90s there was a huge you know in the in
the eighties there was a big Latin
American debt crisis which was followed
by a giant push toward neoliberal
economics austerity whatever you want to
call it which is about exactly what
happened ten years ago after the
financial crisis in the Western world
where there was a giant economic
collapse in position of austerity
especially in the UK but also United
States and it's not surprising that
about 10 years after that you're
starting to see the rise of you know
left-wing governments as well as
left-wing politicians as well as
right-wing politicians and the question
is who's gonna win you know are we guess
the question left is best because it's
not gonna be Cory Booker it's not gonna
work ok turns out we know you know some
other whatever in the UK I
don't even know who that would be wise
really hates Cory Booker yeah and Cory
Booker's fake drug dealer friend t-bone
yeah we don't like t-bone
I kind of like John McCain I'm a 999
right so here's what we're gonna do no
Russ wise was go get some water
and come over this way all right so
here's what we're gonna do now those
stay right here I know you're
amazing I appreciate this the range
range the range from the world cup to
the IMF no one's doing it better than
Nando Vela it's harder to work with you
man all right so here's what we're gonna
do everybody is gonna come back out on
stage and it's gonna be okay
and a tongue why I know nobody's getting
me down
damn we're competing now yeah that's
actually a good idea we should have put
on affirmative action for this country
is going to I remember why I got
affirmative action up here music for me
man can you find affirmative action can
anybody in the audience find it no no
thank you they're tiny if you find
affirmative action you can just put it
on person number is seven one eight
eight one thanks all right you're gonna
do now
have you ever heard of jay-z biggie
small here's all gonna do Celine Dion oh
them wide all Caribbean people love
Celine Dion so I know everybody don't
know what we do we love someone should
interview I watched an interview with it
might be Candida I don't know what it is
Korean people of Canada I watched it
cook wait there's a lot of country music
canada you'd be surprised
i watched an interview with chronic sun
I saw Cool Runnings haha we all did to
make it pop 17 yeah we're gonna play
this game now what's the first round
yeah so let me just real quick we're
gonna go ahead so we're going to do
three rounds for each round we're gonna
have three quotes and you have to guess
what speaker is which the first round is
going to be Tony Robbins Michael Brooks

good they're a fast-growing market I use
it to fund the operation other
revolutionaries rob banks and kidnap
people okay I don't do that Alex Jones
are ben shapiro ben shapiro also some of
it yeah some of it yeah it's so Shapiro
has a quote that's robbing people and
kidnappings that my respect for him will
increase significantly so though they
know it's not him though they both sell
pills that trust me they really do
expand your mind
it's like cognitive powers
he Jose Canseco with the supplements all
right we got two more Alex Jones or Ben
Shapiro oh good okay is this Ben Shapiro
or Alex Jones a society of essential
oils and self-esteem has replaced a
society of logic Ben Shapiro dickship
hero has he ever had sex with a woman

like that's illogical you don't know
that presumably never see me like
workshop that you're gonna be sick any
yeah but I kind of don't want to do it
so you know and the audience Benjamin
irritant times actors were considered to
be fundamentally untrustworthy because
they can assume other personalities and
I get disturbed absorbing some of the
things from these people not even
kidding sorry I just like saying
I've had sorry tomorrow she has one Matt

very wise quote it's extremely me
alright so here's what we're gonna do we
are gonna take literally like only one
or two questions but don't worry we'll
be out in the back you can talk to us
we're not gonna run off in a second
because we do want to wrap up soon but
we'll well at least I'll be around I
think we'll be around wise we're gonna
stretch it for you well also be telling
any jokes in the stretch is that a BBC
joke with them I watching a porn to know
what that means I don't know what the
that means Jesus actually don't the

loud and I'll repeat it back in the
microphone I'm black and I'm proud your
West Coast chapo Trap House question

to explain that cuz I don't know what
that is
are you really from New York you could
tell New York who would be would be in
our West Coast chapo Trap House I'm
gonna say Hassan who was here
tonight
say Ana it's a different plan it's a
different brand you're doing something
different on a different Coast you make
me laugh Oh need me alright so okay who
else who rounds it out boss is a really
good answer actually alright I'm with it
what about Glenn Greenwald you you best
Great Wall this is my best friend why do
you want me to promote Chapo at my live
show please I'm gonna communist to take
counsel
here you go yes sir can we get a hot
take on the massacre that was Peterson
be Dziedzic did anybody watch it no none
of us watched it it just like to show
how cheap a lot of unfortunately
humanities PhDs can be that you cannot
read the Communist Manifesto
that's a hot take you might understand
it and quote young and think that you're
not I gotta say I got I got some love
for Jesus he makes me laugh I love G
Jeff of course I just have one line
sublime object of ideology is actually a
very good book a day when your
government Zeppelin's run a kiss at the
stage right now that was a that was a
decent joke relax guys come on
Jesus Christ what's up brother
normy if we use for the Lakers
okay so David David Griffin who's not
gonna lie he's one of my few friends in
the NBA family meaning he's at a
professional GM job and he'll pick up
our goals whatever David Griffin took
the New Orleans job um the Lakers okay
so what they should do I'm just now
realizing I'm in LA with a bunch of
Laker fans so what the Lakers
should do okay what they should do is
start a search they have the most
desirable job in all of the NBA you get
to live in LA you get to work for these
when it comes to basketball money no
team in basketball maybe outside of the
Knicks makes more money than the Lakers
relax the Knicks make money that's all
that matters
the Lakers they make a lot of money so
there's no like there's no blocks in
front of your job meaning you can spend
money you are in a desirable market you
work for a prestige franchise this is a
desirable job but your owner is a trust
fund baby word she got the team from her
dad she didn't buy the team she's unlike
so say Steve Ballmer whatever we want to
say about the tech pros this guy spent 2
billion on a team he's very invested in
making sure that team works moves
operates in a way that is profitable
that is good Jamie got the team from her
father she did not buy the team she did
not work for the team whatever if the
Lakers did a good search if they put
their might the Laker might behind the
search they should get Bob Meyers the
guy was the GM of the Golden State
Warriors the team that is currently down
in basketball you should call Bob my is
to say what's your price
what do you want what do you want to do
Bob Myers do what you did over there for
us Bob Myers is the answer so
Bob Myers is the answer we have
two more people I just want to say
that's a beautiful feed loss sweater but
yeah that's good like that sweater
Carla oh you bros back my boy I let you

heckling strategy and then the last
question is

a way to incorporate that in the
question yeah well this competitions

evening to you sir okay
we finally got a brother up here God
Tammy she oh yeah this is a lot of
pressure but I haven't heard any any
progressive really talk about this any
progressive youtuber talked about this
to their credit but you know we're here
tonight and we're all having fun people
are drunk so don't be really petty
question yes really really petty we meet

because you might know the the players
better mm-hmm what do you make I don't
get it what do you make a rosario Dawson
and Cory Booker
we also actually dress the best question
ever
give it up for the best lesson of the
evening Wow I'm gonna shave myself all
right I'm so happy
he said that careful was calm down we
all sort of movie kids directed it
because I love the drums like oh he was
saying that he was saying that you look
like the type of progressive chick that
might be into court no no he was not he
was saying that she might know them you
know was pretty close to TYT during the
last election so I I was pretty shocked
to be honest with you because she felt
so strongly about progressivism and she
felt so strongly against corporate as
democrats and cory booker is the epitome
of that
yeah of a corporate Democrat so I don't
know I mean I got a lot of thoughts on
the ADI Cory Booker Rosario
first of all she went from Eric Andre to
Cory Booker which has to be one of the
all-time great like downgrades in
history also no no no she lying next to
yes sure yeah I think is that I think it
was this week Cory Booker was asked
about it and he goes I am a single man
yes I am dating a person who has a day
job and she happens to be an actress so
you guys are which leads me to believe
that they have like some sort of like
freaky open relationship you know which
you know he's trying to go for the flame
Democratic primary of like all the like
annoying people who are like you know
actually actually uh I'm Polly I wanted
deregulate Pharma but you know tax
credits for chart it's charter schools
and you know recognize sapiosexual as a
real oppressed demographic in the
American quality translation and rosario
Dawson she like egged yes I don't know I
said then this is Mike Gousha I was
trying to be a good guy for my brother
Michael Brooks I love this dude
