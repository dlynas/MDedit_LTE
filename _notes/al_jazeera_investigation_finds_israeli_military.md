	What hasbara will Zionists spin from this I wonder. Even factual video footage of IDF war crimes wont convince these Zionists theyre evil.

			The funny thing is once in a while your be able to find a ToI or Haaretz article that sides with AJ, and then the zionists mind explodes

		They know they are, they are just trying to convince the audience and themselves that they are not

		Zionist have in inability to criticize IDF.
		
		I was talking to one about the three hostages who were killed blatantly by IDF. And he said "It was an accident, it's all hamas fault anyhow"

		They'll brand the whole idea of questioning the IOF as antisemitism and say there's an internal investigation going on that isn't finished.

	Well if the Palestinians weren't such terrorists, the IDF wouldn't be so scared as to shoot their own civilians by mistake! It's obviously their fault!

	 -Some Hasbara guy probably definitely

		This was seriously the reaction of one Zionist guy I know!

	Where's the outrage from those "liberal" Israel supporters, those who claimed to care about Jewish lives, but are somehow silent - no anger, no "it's all hoaxes" - about this monstrous, deliberate killing of Jewish civilians by Israel?

		They’re in vehement denial mode.

	They’ve been killing their own people for years - this is nothing new. And sadly I doubt it will change anything. 

	Israel’s strategy since day one has been to spread misinformation through mass media, garner public support because of it, and use it as an excuse to massacre Palestinians. Days, weeks, or months later, the truth comes out. But by then it’s too late because thousands of innocent people had already been killed, hospitals, mosques, churches, and schools destroyed. Rinse and repeat.

	Seemed obvious on the actual day of 10/7 that the IDF was wilding inside their own borders trying to cause as much chaos as possible to justify what they were going to do after.
