It's hard for us to understand voter disenfranchisement outside of numbers barred from the polls. Even then. A 1.8% decrease in participation by folks who experience interactions with law enforcement — NOT EVEN ARRESTS!! — is enough to swing elections. [boltsmag.org/a-police-stop-](https://t.co/xwND1Tu7hM)

Clearly there’s a vicious circle here where voter intimidation from the right leads to more law enforcement at polling places.

Strategy and branding for the Left. Black woodworker. Birder. Slow prepper. Anti-fascist. Abolitionist. Practical.
