## After saying 15,000 women and children have been killed by the IDF, CNN’s Dana Bash says “yeah, sure but at least Israeli soldiers aren’t raping them” —The sole purpose of the mass rape lies is to justify genocide

								OR it is given a pro Israeli spin. CNN is notoriously biased on Palestine and this would, imho, lend credence to the accusation that it is an Israeli mouthpiece. 
								
								
								But I do understand that sources need checking however , when you can put a positive spin on that genocidal rampage then it's hard not to see it as a propaganda tool.

				Do you even read the links you post?
				
				The long-awaited report is not a full-fledged U.N. investigation, according to its author, the U.N. special representative for sexual violence in conflict. Israel has blocked such an investigation by the U.N.'s human rights office over what the country's leaders allege is anti-Israel bias. 
				
				So we didn't do an investigation but it's likely based off hearsay. 
				
				And to be fair I think it's probable that some rape and sexual assault did happen, but hardly systemic. The same way an investigation was done and showed Palestinian woman getting raped and sexually assaulted in jail, a thorough independent investigation should be done. But this has repeatedly not been allowed.
				
				This has been an often repeated lie to dehumanize the Palestinians and justify any atrocity against them. This is actually a very common trope if you look at what was happening during the civil Rights movement there was a big fear about black men raping and tainting innocent white women.
				
				p.s. And to all the idiots out there saying broken pelvises, please look up how much force it takes to break a pelvis, I can't do all your homework for you,  I know some people think Hamas are gigachads(not me), but they don't smash that hard.

						The argument is about the UN report which was not allowed to investigate any of those people or interview them. They have to base it based off of public interviews given, that's not the way investigations are done. That's the way sensationalist news stories are published.
						
						People have reportedly quoted survivors and witnesses only for the people around those survivors to say that's not what happened and to please stop misattributing it, and the witnesses to be proven to be biased sources like the unofficial emergency services people. 
						
						I'm just saying if you want credibility you allow an independent organization to verify your claims. That's what they did with the women in Israeli prisons, directly interviewed and spoke with those people. 
						
						Like I said I don't doubt that some of it happened but we will never know the scope and truth of it until an independent is allowed to study it, of course Israel will never allow that because then they can't control the narrative.

				that report was based on information people already knew, the UN didnt interview anybody and was not investigate by their own admission. one the main sources for rape on october 7th is zaka, an organisation notorious for making up stuff like the 40 beheaded babies, babies being put into ovens, pregnant women being cut open etc etc. The un report is no different than the nyt article that was debunked. not to mention that israel refused to let the UN talk to any victims or witnesses. what are the credible reports you have mentioned? can you name a single source of evidence that proves it beyond reasonable doubt? because if women really were raped on october 7th, then the people reporting on it and gathering evidence are incredibly bad journalists.

	1. Yes, sexual abuse of Palestinians by the IOF (including , but not limited to r***) has been well-documented. Unlike the allegations of sexual abuse on Oct 7 towards Israelis.

	2. Most people would prefer to be a r*** victim than dead.

	3. Many unspeakably horrible things are being suffered in Gaza, including extreme hunger, spread of disease, destruction of hospitals and health facilities. Many of these things are worse than r***.

		You're wrong, Dana Bash isnt saying that rape is worse thank killing.  She's saying that rape of a WHITE (Israeli) woman is more of a crime than anything you could possibly due to Palestinian women and children, even murdering them.  
		
		 At its core, its a racist statement, based on dehumanization and devaluation of Palestinian lives, but she cant say that outright, so she attempts to make it seem like argument rape is somehow worse than murder to conceal the true intent of her statement.  Most disgusting outright racist Ive heard yet on CNN, she should be fired.  Complain and write to this [link](https://help.cnn.com/us/ContactUs)

			1) some Israeli women (may) have been r*ped on Oct 7th (no concrete proof still)
			
			2) 15,000 Palestinian women and children have been brutally killed
			
			she's saying "okay 2) is happening but at least it's not as bad as 1)"

					>The trip was not investigative in nature; instead, it was to gather, analyze and verify information for potential inclusion in the annual U.N. report on conflict-related sexual violence, she said.  
					>

					>  
					>Patten said the lack of forensic evidence collection posed a challenge to her team.  
					Patten said her team did not interview any survivors of sexual violence
					
					&amp;#x200B;
					
					If you actually read it, they say that they have no evidence, and the only thing they have is "This person said that another person saw" statements.  
					
					
					Of the 5 'credible' accusations, none of them have evidence.  
					
					
					>During her trip, Patten also visited the West Bank city of Ramallah to meet with Palestinian officials and former detainees regarding allegations of sexual violence by Israeli security forces and settlers. She said officials and four former detainees described threats of rape and other dehumanizing behavior toward Palestinian detainees, including forced nudity and invasive body searches. 
  
					
  
					Israeli officials say they are investigating allegations of misconduct against Palestinians by Israeli security forces and settlers.
					
					As usual, slipped into the story somewhere is one single bit about how the IDF is raping Palestinians, and all they did was ask the IDF about it who said "nah".
					
					And it is fucked up how people and the media spread the unconfirmed and baseless accusations about Hamas rape yet no one mentions the accusations against the IDF.
					
					Feel free to criticize Hamas for their violent resistance, but rape has never been a thing they do in Hamas. And definitely not a policy as some claim.

	How much more a disgusting and dehumanizing statement is it to say than, well at least the children dying werent raped first?  What does that even mean?  

	It means Palestinian children getting murdered is less of a crime than an Israeli woman getting raped.  

	Does anyone think if she wasnt a white woman she wouldnt have been canned already for claiming that killing a child is less than a white woman getting raped?  

	And btw, the dogwhistle is that it is a white (Israeli) woman getting raped.  Cause they dont care enough about the Palestinian getting raped to even mention it.  But white women, raped oh no thats the highest possible crime ever committed, even stacks of murdered innocent children cant compare!!

	Was there sexual violence on Oct 7th? For sure.  

	Is there captives who might be facing sexual violence? Also true. 

	But to blanket them all in this way as if it’s better because Israel isnt raping all 15k of them, as if they have the right to, is absolutely insane and does nothing but stand in the way of the actual atrocities on Oct 7. There’s plenty that was done on Oct 7th that can be pointed out directly but there’s been zero evidence of widespread sexual assault. 

	Oh btw Israel’s burying all the cars they obviously blew up. No news agency wants to touch that though.
