## How accurate is the narrative presented in Fog of War regarding McNamara?

> Specifically his role in the Vietnam War. The film seems to suggest that he was a voice of moderation, advocating troop reductions and the like. Is this accurate?

	McNamara is a bit of an enigma. *Fog of War* more or less allowed him to speak and what we got was not necessarily an objective examination of the man and his role, but rather the equally interesting- though historically subjective- perspective of how McNamara saw himself.

	McNamara was a technocrat: give him enough data and he could crunch the numbers and tell you how to do things: how to bomb German industry, how to make thousands of Chevrolets efficiently.

	What he could not tell you was how to break the will of a peasant people seeking independence and to emerge from colonial subjugation to take their place in the world. Because that's not something amenable to data, spreadsheets, and cost-benefit analyses.

	McNamara's recommendations changed over time. It is important to bear in mind that he was appointed by Kennedy, who had great self-confidence and grew into the presidency. He could filter McNamara's ultra-rationalism with his intuition and subjective instincts.This is not to say Kennedy was a genius, but that he was willing to take this balanced approach.

	Johnson was a different man, perhaps in a sense catching up with the times. He was more the Washington operator and fixer, susceptible to rolling over when confronted by men who had all the answers, and all the data to back them up. McNamara was guilty of constantly proposing 'solutions' to stop the communist/nationalist Vietnamese. The whole administration laboured under the delusion that the Vietnam was was directed by Beijing and/or Moscow and with enough force the Chinese/Russians would desist, just as the US later did in the South.  But North Vietnam was not South Vietnam, it had a legitimacy and already had experience of years of struggle against strong opponents.

	McNamara's grand failure, and one of which he remained oblivious, was his inability to see the limitations of his over-technical, rationalist approach.  He was an ideal man to run a car factory. He was a disaster as a leader in war (which is what he was, even if he preferred to pretend he was more an advisor and others did the leadership).

	Rumsfeld repeated his folly almost exactly, though with much more mendacious motivations.

		These two statements are very problematic. The Republic of Vietnam was an independent nation state. It also had a strong basis of legitimacy, albeit heavily contested by domestic and outside opponents. But nonetheless many people in the RVN saw it as a legitimate state. Several hundred thousand South Vietnamese fought and died for it. The war ended in 1975 with North Vietnamese tanks rolling through Saigon, not South Vietnamese storming the presidential palace. Tens of thousands fled, and in the subsequent years ten of thousands more risked great danger to flee on boats into the sea. None of that means the US war effort was appropriate, just, or wise. But that doesn't mean we should pretend an entire country did not exist or that it never had legitimacy. The problem with histories of the war is that they wrote it to build consensus to end the war. Diminishing the Republic of Vietnam became a means to illustrate that the war wasn't worth (Americans) fighting. That's how this image of an 'invented' or artificial South Vietnam came about -- American writers with little knowledge of the country penning histories that they hoped would convince Americans that the war wasn't legitimate. But America's war in Vietnam is a separate issue from South Vietnam's own history.

			Excellent point, both about the status of RVN and the way history gets re-written (strictly speaking "reinterpreted" or with a "different emphasis" but there isn't much difference).
			
			It also strikes me that you could replace RVN with DRV in the above statements and it would be equally true.

				Exactly. The historical record doesn't yet have a thorough history of dissent in the DRV, but it was there. Revolts in the northern highlands. Resistance to land reform. Or the intellectuals pushing for government reform in the Nh√¢n VƒÉn Giai Ph·∫©m affair, who were then ostracized or sentenced to long prison terms. And recall that Vo Nguyen Giap ordered the execution of DRV soldiers at Dien Bien Phu for cowardice because they didn't charge fortified positions. There was coercion on both sides.
				But yes, in the US and France, anti-war writers tended to adopt the DRV perspective as an 'indigenous' (ie non-US) source for information, though it was propaganda. Only now are we starting to get histories of Vietnam's wars that aren't heavily influenced by the domestic anti-war movements in France and the US.

			South Vietnam certainly gained legitimacy through the process of the war. But it had very little in the 1950s when it was created for Western purposes, as a temporary situation. The 'invention' of South Vietnam dates from the 50s, not the 70s or 80s. It has no political reality in the negotiations before 1954, those who fought the French were either communists or pursuing local interests.
			
			But there is little question that at most stages of the war the communist regime had an enormous advantage from its leadership of the independence war.  The South might have done better if not led by an autocratic fool like Diem: 10 years was lost before the Southern government stabilised. Diem symbolised the manufacture of the South: a man with no local backing who'd schmoozed in the West, while the communist leadership had done the fighting and lived in the jungle.
			
			One could say 'North Vietnam' similarly had little legitimacy as a concept. But the respective regimes certainly had very unequal legitimacy, however much those exiled since 1975 might hate that.
			
			I would add I don't see the independence/civil war in flowery communist terms of peasants yearning to be free, obviously there was lots of coercion and politics. But I stand by the generalisation.
			
			The war was not worth fighting, regardless of whether one sees Western historians as part of a conspiracy to devalue the conflict, or not.  It cost billions, killed millions, heavily damaged US prestige (as it would have even if the 1973 situation had remained), and the Asian communist nations are turning into capitalist economies anyway.

				That's what is in the current literature, written by western writers who have not studied the Vietnamese side. It's also not correct. The State of Vietnam (Quoc Gia Viet Nam) government was the other Vietnamese government fighting in the First Indochina War. It was partially independent, it certainly still had colonial aspects. But prior to 1954, this government had popular support (more Vietnamese soldiers died fighting for the State of Vietnam than French), held elections, did land reform, etc. It had political support from non-communist nationalist groups like the Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang, Dai Viet, Hoa Hao, Cao Dai, and more. These groups had since 1945-1946 fought with the DRV government. Those groups had all fought **against** the French in 1945-1948, before switching their allegiance to the State of Vietnam government. In essence they opted for a moderate path to independence, one not directly subordinate to the DRV's communist leadership. There were many non-communist leaders in the resistance who switched to the State of VN.
				
				That statement on Diem is too simplistic. He was a well known and popular figure in Vietnam since the 1930s when he resigned his post in the mandarinate as a protest against the French. Edward Miller's new book *Misalliance* covers Diem in an evenhanded way. He was authoritarian. So too was the DRV. Explaining his failure then, requires a more complex answer.
				
				I agree there was always a disparity in legitimacy. Those advocating moderate choices and negotiation to attain independence aren't really romantic in the popular imagination. Ho was very unpopular in 1946 when he kept pushing for negotiation with France. And we should also keep in mind that from 1946-1975 there was no free press operating and its cultural-historical output was mandated by the party to support their policies. That was quite different than the State of Vietnam and Republic of Vietnam. There's an imbalance then. Just the same as the authoritarian policies of Diem regime and communist regime in the DRV. The DRV was far more repressive, yet that information is still locked away in Vietnamese archives, so an uneven picture remains in the historiography.
				
				We can agree the war wasn't worth Americans fighting. It was not a conspiracy, rather an understandable tendency that emerged as they tried to use academic writing to oppose US policies. My hope was to say that US actions after 1965 should not be the lens to interpret all Vietnamese history. From one Vietnamese perspectives the war was worth fighting. It's possible to say the US war was unnecessary and wrong, even that Nguyen Van Thieu was a poor leader, and to still acknowledge that South Vietnam had a real legitimacy, nationalism, and support among its public (again heavily contested). If you study US public opinion of South Korea in the 1970s-80s, you'll find a similarly dismissive critique of its character and legitimacy. But the combined democratization and economic growth of that government, and the new information learned about North Korea and its history took public opinion in a much different direction to where it is today.

					Wow, I'd never heard that before. It was always Ho and the Viet Minh alone fighting the Japanese and then the French. I don't know if anybody planned the one sided information as propaganda, but if they had it would have been brilliant.

					Another fascinating and important piece of information I'd never heard. Thank you.
					
					Another question: is there any truth to the idea that the ARVN soldiers didn't fight very hard? If not, do you have any idea where the myth started?

						I think it's pretty indicative that the Pulitzer prize history book from last year, Embers of War, is about the First Indochina War and has almost no information on the State of VN. Hopefully that will change in the next 5 or 10 years.
						
						As far as ARVN, there were problems. Corruption, nepotism, etc. The presence of 590,000 foreign troops and massive influx of US money in VN certainly was a terrible decision that hurt the RVN's legitimacy and gave the opposition a very clear Us vs. Them dynamic. Cultural biases and a language barrier between US troops and journalists also contributed to a negative impression of ARVN. While the 'other' VC and NVA was an unknown entity with a kind of romantic mystic, and it was never subject to open domestic or Soviet or Chinese criticism. There's quite a bit of positive coverage on ARVN earlier in the war. The tone was much more negative after Tet. The more accurate answer is probably that the collapse of the country, when there were understandably soldiers fleeing the oncoming invasion, is the enduring memory. Andrew Weist has a good book on ARVN, called 'Vietnam's Forgotten Army: Heroism and Betrayal in the ARVN'. The hyper critical view of ARVN began, though, with an Army official John Paul Vann's withering critique of the battle of Ap Bac (see the book A Bright Shining Lie), which has been challenged by some historians.
						Just to add: I don't subscribe to any of the stabbed in the back theories about ARVN. They lost because their organization was weaker. It's leadership was worse. US support was in many ways a weakening factor. But (especially older) Americans are always thinking of WWII and want wars to be morality tales.

		Could you elaborate a bit more on those parallelisms McNamara-Rumsfeld? It seems rather interesting.

		* üüß **[PantsTime](https://www.reddit.com/user/PantsTime)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2 _(2015-06-30 18:22:20)_

			In short: McNamara was sure if North Vietnam were bombed enough ('and here's a list of targets and why it will work, Mr President'), they would desist from undermining the South. Rumsfeld was sure that with a small army using 'shock and awe' tactics, and no occupation plan, Saddam would fall and Iraq would be all 'Germany 1946'. 
			
			Both were former CEOs who don't understand that while they can bully/persuade underlings and attract consumers, political and social forces are subtle and chaotic.  I would argue that perhaps McNamara was genuinely trying to solve a political problem as best he could, Rumsfeld probably just wanted the war to happen for the personal benefit of him and his small clique, and didn't really care if he was wrong about the aftermath.
			
			Successful management of conflicts actually requires a sound knowledge of history and people, and modern democracies fail to value these characteristics.

		you make a very interesting point about Kennedy vs Johnson here. An example would be the Cuban Missile crises where Kennedy disregarded the hawks and found his own path through his intuition. 
		
		I would not label Johnson "susceptible" although I do think that he was hampered by the military apparatus that he had to deal with. He couldnt just change the mentality there and that he was essentially on for the ride. David Hackworth makes an interesting case about the mentality of these days in About Face. 
		
		Can you elaborate on this dynamic between Johnson/Kennedy and McNamara? thanks.

		>McNamara's grand failure, and one of which he remained oblivious, was his inability to see the limitations of his over-technical, rationalist approach.
		
		He would have agreed the statement as it pertains to his tenure as SecDef. He would also have said that he realized this many years later. In the film *Fog of War*, he said that a "**lesson**" took from the Missile Crisis was that "**rationality will not save us.**"
		
		>Rational individuals: Kennedy was rational; Khrushchev was rational; Castro was rational. Rational individuals came that close to total destruction of their societies.
		
		"At the end," he said, "we lucked out."
