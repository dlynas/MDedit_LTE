**Murray Bookchin** (January 14, 1921 – July 30, 2006<sup id="cite_ref-Guardian-20060808_1-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-Guardian-20060808-1">[1]</a></sup>) was an American [social theorist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_theory "Social theory"), author, orator, historian, and [political philosopher.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_philosophy "Political philosophy") Influenced by [G. W. F. Hegel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._W._F._Hegel "G. W. F. Hegel"), [Karl Marx](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx "Karl Marx"), and [Peter Kropotkin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kropotkin "Peter Kropotkin"),<sup id="cite_ref-EoF-2005_2-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-EoF-2005-2">[2]</a></sup> he was a pioneer in the [environmental movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_movement "Environmental movement").<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> Bookchin formulated and developed the theory of social ecology and [urban planning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning "Urban planning") within [anarchist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism "Anarchism"), [libertarian socialist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialist "Libertarian socialist"), and ecological thought. He was the author of two dozen books covering topics in politics, philosophy, history, urban affairs, and social ecology. Among the most important were _Our Synthetic Environment_ (1962), _[Post-Scarcity Anarchism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Scarcity_Anarchism "Post-Scarcity Anarchism")_ (1971), _[The Ecology of Freedom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ecology_of_Freedom "The Ecology of Freedom")_ (1982), and _Urbanization Without Cities_ (1987). In the late 1990s, he became disenchanted with what he saw as an increasingly apolitical "[lifestylism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_anarchism "Lifestyle anarchism")" of the contemporary anarchist movement, stopped referring to himself as an anarchist, and founded his own libertarian socialist ideology called "communalism", which seeks to reconcile and expand [Marxist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism "Marxism"), [syndicalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndicalism "Syndicalism"), and anarchist thought.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

Notable ideas

 | Communalism, social ecology |

Bookchin was a prominent [anti-capitalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-capitalist "Anti-capitalist") and advocate of social [decentralization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization "Decentralization") along ecological and democratic lines. His ideas have influenced social movements since the 1960s, including the [New Left](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Left "New Left"), the [anti-nuclear movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-nuclear_movement "Anti-nuclear movement"), the [anti-globalization movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-globalization_movement "Anti-globalization movement"), [Occupy Wall Street](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street "Occupy Wall Street"), and more recently, the [democratic confederalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_confederalism "Democratic confederalism") of the [Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_Administration_of_North_and_East_Syria "Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria"). He was a central figure in the [American green movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_movement_in_the_United_States "Environmental movement in the United States").

## Biography [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Murray_Bookchin&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Biography")

Bookchin was born in New York City to [Russian Jewish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Russia "History of the Jews in Russia") immigrants<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> Nathan Bookchin and Rose (Kaluskaya) Bookchin. He grew up in the [Bronx](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx "Bronx"), where his grandmother, Zeitel, a [Socialist Revolutionary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Revolutionary_Party "Socialist Revolutionary Party"), imbued him with [Russian populist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narodniks "Narodniks") ideas. After her death in 1930, he joined the [Young Pioneers of America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Pioneers_of_America "Young Pioneers of America"), the Communist youth organization (for children 9 to 14)<sup id="cite_ref-youtube2007_8-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-youtube2007-8">[8]</a></sup> and the [Young Communist League](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Communist_League_USA "Young Communist League USA") (for youths) in 1935. He attended the [Workers School](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Workers_School "New York Workers School") near Union Square, where he studied [Marxism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism "Marxism"). In the late 1930s he broke with [Stalinism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalinism "Stalinism") and gravitated toward [Trotskyism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trotskyism "Trotskyism"), joining the [Socialist Workers Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Workers_Party_(United_States) "Socialist Workers Party (United States)") (SWP). In the early 1940s, he worked in a foundry in [Bayonne, New Jersey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayonne,_New_Jersey "Bayonne, New Jersey"), where he was a trade union organizer and shop steward for the [United Electrical Workers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Electrical_Workers "United Electrical Workers") as well as a recruiter for the SWP. Within the SWP, he adhered to the Goldman-[Morrow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Morrow "Felix Morrow") faction, which broke away after the war ended. He was an auto worker and UAW member at the time of the great [General Motors strike of 1945–46](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Auto_Workers_(UAW)_strike_of_1945%E2%80%931946 "United Auto Workers (UAW) strike of 1945–1946"). In 1949, while speaking to a Zionist youth organization at [City College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_College_of_New_York "City College of New York"), Bookchin met a mathematics student, Beatrice Appelstein, whom he married in 1951.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> They were married for 12 years and lived together for 35, remaining close friends and political allies for the rest of his life. They had two children, Debbie and Joseph.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> On religious views, Bookchin was an atheist, but was considered to be tolerant of religious views.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELight199827_11-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-FOOTNOTELight199827-11">[11]</a></sup>

From 1947, Bookchin collaborated with a fellow lapsed Trotskyist, the German expatriate Josef Weber, in New York in the [Movement for a Democracy of Content](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_for_a_Democracy_of_Content "Movement for a Democracy of Content"), a group of 20 or so post-Trotskyists who collectively edited the periodical _[Contemporary Issues – A Magazine for a Democracy of Content](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Movement_For_a_Democracy_of_Content "The Movement For a Democracy of Content")_. _Contemporary Issues_ embraced utopianism. The periodical provided a forum for the belief that previous attempts to create utopia had foundered on the necessity of toil and drudgery; but now modern technology had obviated the need for human toil, a liberatory development. To achieve this "post-scarcity" society, Bookchin developed a theory of ecological decentralism. The magazine published Bookchin's first articles, including the pathbreaking "The Problem of Chemicals in Food" (1952). In 1958, Bookchin defined himself as an anarchist,<sup id="cite_ref-youtube2007_8-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-youtube2007-8">[8]</a></sup> seeing parallels between anarchism and environmentalism. His first book, _[Our Synthetic Environment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Synthetic_Environment "Our Synthetic Environment"),_ was published under the pseudonym Lewis Herber, in 1962, a few months before [Rachel Carson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Carson "Rachel Carson")'s famous _[Silent Spring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Spring "Silent Spring")_.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

In 1964, Bookchin joined the [Congress of Racial Equality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Racial_Equality "Congress of Racial Equality") (CORE), and protested racism at the [1964 World's Fair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_World%27s_Fair "1964 World's Fair"). During 1964–1967, while living on Manhattan's [Lower East Side](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_East_Side "Lower East Side"), he cofounded and was the principal figure in the New York Federation of Anarchists. His groundbreaking essay "Ecology and Revolutionary Thought" introduced environmentalism and, more specifically, ecology as a concept in radical politics.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> In 1968, he founded another group that published the influential _Anarchos_ magazine, which published that and other innovative essays on post-scarcity and on sustainable technologies such as solar and wind energy, and on decentralization and miniaturization. Lecturing throughout the United States, he helped popularize the concept of ecology to the [counterculture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture "Counterculture"). His widely republished 1969 essay "Listen, Marxist!"<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> warned [Students for a Democratic Society](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_for_a_Democratic_Society_(1960_organization) "Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)") (in vain) against an impending takeover by a Marxist group. "Once again the dead are walking in our midst," he wrote, "ironically, draped in the name of [Marx](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx "Karl Marx"), the man who tried to bury the dead of the nineteenth century. So the revolution of our own day can do nothing better than parody, in turn, the [October Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution "October Revolution") of 1917 and the [civil war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War "Russian Civil War") of 1918–1920, with its 'class line,' its [Bolshevik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshevik "Bolshevik") Party, its '[proletarian dictatorship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat "Dictatorship of the proletariat"),' its [puritanical](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritanical "Puritanical") morality, and even its slogan, 'Soviet power'".<sup id="cite_ref-Walker_16-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-Walker-16">[16]</a></sup>

In 1969–1970, he taught at the Alternate U, a counter-cultural radical school based on 14th Street in Manhattan. In 1971, he moved to Burlington, Vermont, with a group of friends, to put into practice his ideas of decentralization. In the fall of 1973, he was hired by [Goddard College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goddard_College "Goddard College") to lecture on technology; his lectures led to a teaching position and to the creation of the Social Ecology Studies program in 1974 and the Institute for Social Ecology (ISE) soon thereafter, of which he became the director. In 1974, he was hired by [Ramapo College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramapo_College "Ramapo College") in [Mahwah, New Jersey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahwah,_New_Jersey "Mahwah, New Jersey"), where he quickly became a full professor. The ISE was a hub for experimentation and study of [appropriate technology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriate_technology "Appropriate technology") in the 1970s. In 1977–78 he was a member of the Spruce Mountain Affinity Group of the [Clamshell Alliance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clamshell_Alliance "Clamshell Alliance"). Also in 1977, he published _[The Spanish Anarchists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spanish_Anarchists "The Spanish Anarchists")_, a history of [the Spanish anarchist movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_Spain "Anarchism in Spain") up to the [revolution of 1936](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Revolution_of_1936 "Spanish Revolution of 1936"). During this period, Bookchin briefly forged some ties with the nascent [libertarian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism "Libertarianism") movement, speaking at a [Libertarian Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_Party_(United_States) "Libertarian Party (United States)") convention and contributing to a newsletter edited by [Karl Hess](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Hess "Karl Hess"). Nevertheless, Bookchin rejected the types of libertarianism that advocated unconstrained individualism.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

In 1980, Bookchin co-established the New England Anarchist Conference (NEAC) to organize the [anarchist movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist_movement "Anarchist movement") in the United States. At its first meeting in October 1980, 175 anarchists from the [northeastern US](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States "Northeastern United States") and [Quebec](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec "Quebec") attended. By the second conference in January 1981 in [Somerville, Massachusetts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerville,_Massachusetts "Somerville, Massachusetts"), the NEAC devolved into [sectarianism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectarianism "Sectarianism"), which moved Bookchin to lose faith in a [socialist revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Revolution "Socialist Revolution") happening in the US.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>

During the 1980s, Bookchin engaged in occasional critiques of [Bernie Sanders](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders "Bernie Sanders")' mayorship in Burlington. Bookchin criticized Sanders' politics, claiming he lacked a drive to establish [direct democracy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy "Direct democracy"), followed a Marxian deprioritization of ecology, and was a “'centralist' who narrowly focused on economic growth."<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> Bookchin and his social ecologist colleagues in the Burlington Greens, which he co-founded, criticized the Sanders administration for pushing for a luxury condo waterfront redevelopment, which was eventually rejected by Burlington voters. They advocated for a moratorium on growth, a moral economy, and social justice rooted in grassroots democracy.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>

In 1988, Bookchin and [Howie Hawkins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howie_Hawkins "Howie Hawkins") founded the [Left Green Network](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Green_Network "Left Green Network") "as a radical alternative to U.S. Green liberals", based around the principles of social ecology and libertarian municipalism.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>

In 1995, Bookchin lamented the decline of [American anarchism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_anarchism "American anarchism") into [primitivism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-primitivism "Anarcho-primitivism"), anti-technologism, neo-[Situationism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situationism "Situationism"), individual self-expression, and "ad hoc adventurism," at the expense of forming a social movement. He formally broke with anarchism in 1999, describing himself in 2002 as a "Communalist" in a major essay elaborating his late-life views, called "The Communalist Project".

He continued to teach at the ISE until 2004. Bookchin died of [congestive heart failure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestive_heart_failure "Congestive heart failure") on July 30, 2006, at his home in Burlington, at the age of 85.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

## Thought [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Murray_Bookchin&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Thought")

In addition to his political writings, Bookchin wrote extensively on philosophy, calling his ideas dialectical naturalism.<sup id="cite_ref-EoF-2005_2-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-EoF-2005-2">[2]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 31">: 31 </span></sup>  The [dialectical](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical "Dialectical") writings of [Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel "Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel"), which articulate a developmental philosophy of change and growth, seemed to him to lend themselves to an organic, environmentalist approach.<sup id="cite_ref-EoF-2005_2-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-EoF-2005-2">[2]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 96–97">: 96–97 </span></sup>  Although Hegel "exercised a considerable influence" on Bookchin, he was not, in any sense, a Hegelian.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> His philosophical writings emphasize [humanism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism "Humanism"), [rationality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality "Rationality"), and the ideals of the [Enlightenment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment").<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup>

Bookchin does not clearly define many of the key terms of his philosophy.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECurran2007[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidnzwWDAAAQBAJpgPA174_174]_26-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-FOOTNOTECurran2007%5BhttpsbooksgooglecombooksidnzwWDAAAQBAJpgPA174_174%5D-26">[26]</a></sup>

### General sociological and psychological views [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Murray_Bookchin&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: General sociological and psychological views")

Bookchin was critical of class-centered analysis of Marxism and simplistic anti-state forms of libertarianism and liberalism and wished to present what he saw as a more complex view of societies. In _The Ecology of Freedom: The Emergence and Dissolution of Hierarchy,_ he says that:

> My use of the word [hierarchy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy "Hierarchy") in the subtitle of this work is meant to be provocative. There is a strong theoretical need to contrast hierarchy with the more widespread use of the words class and State; careless use of these terms can produce a dangerous simplification of social reality. To use the words hierarchy, class, and State interchangeably, as many social theorists do, is insidious and obscurantist. This practice, in the name of a "classless" or "libertarian" society, could easily conceal the existence of hierarchical relationships and a hierarchical sensibility, both of which—even in the absence of economic exploitation or political coercion—would serve to perpetuate unfreedom.<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>

Bookchin also points to an accumulation of hierarchical systems throughout history that has occurred up to contemporary societies which tends to determine the human collective and individual [psyche](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psyche_(psychology) "Psyche (psychology)"):

> The objective history of the social structure becomes internalized as a subjective history of the psychic structure. Heinous as my view may be to modern [Freudians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud "Sigmund Freud"), it is not the discipline of work but the discipline of rule that demands the repression of internal nature. This repression then extends outward to external nature as a mere object of rule and later of exploitation. This mentality permeates our individual psyches in a cumulative form up to the present day-not merely as capitalism but as the vast history of hierarchical society from its inception.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>

### Humanity's environmental predicament [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Murray_Bookchin&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Humanity's environmental predicament")

Bookchin's book about humanity's collision course with the natural world, _[Our Synthetic Environment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Synthetic_Environment "Our Synthetic Environment")_, was published six months before [Rachel Carson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Carson "Rachel Carson")'s _[Silent Spring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Spring "Silent Spring")._<sup id="cite_ref-:0_29-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-:0-29">[29]</a></sup>

Bookchin rejected [Barry Commoner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Commoner "Barry Commoner")'s belief that the environmental crisis could be traced to technological choices, [Paul Ehrlich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_R._Ehrlich "Paul R. Ehrlich")'s views that it could be traced to overpopulation, or the even more pessimistic view that traces this crisis to human nature. Rather, Bookchin felt that our environmental predicament is the result of the cancerous logic of capitalism, a system aimed at maximizing profit instead of enriching human lives: "By the very logic of its grow-or-die imperative, capitalism may well be producing ecological crises that gravely imperil the integrity of life on this planet."

The solution to this crisis, he said, is not a return to hunter-gatherer societies, which Bookchin characterized as xenophobic and warlike. Bookchin likewise opposed "a politics of mere protest, lacking programmatic content, a proposed alternative, and a movement to give people direction and continuity."<sup id="cite_ref-:0_29-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-:0-29">[29]</a></sup> He claims we need:

> ...a constant awareness that a given society's irrationality is deep-seated, that its serious pathologies are not isolated problems that can be cured piecemeal but must be solved by sweeping changes in the often hidden sources of crisis and suffering—that awareness alone is what can hold a movement together, give it continuity, preserve its message and organization beyond a given generation, and expand its ability to deal with new issues and developments.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_29-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-:0-29">[29]</a></sup>

The answer then lies in Communalism, a system encompassing a [directly democratic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy "Direct democracy") political organization anchored in loosely confederated popular assemblies, decentralization of power, absence of domination of any kind, and replacing capitalism with human-centered forms of production.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_29-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-:0-29">[29]</a></sup>

### [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Murray_Bookchin&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Social ecology")

Social ecology is a [philosophical theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_theory "Philosophical theory") associated with Bookchin, concerned with the relationship between ecological and social issues.<sup id="cite_ref-Bookchin-Psichenatura_31-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-Bookchin-Psichenatura-31">[31]</a></sup> It is not a movement but a theory primarily associated with his thought and elaborated over his body of work.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELight19985_32-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-FOOTNOTELight19985-32">[32]</a></sup> He presents a utopian philosophy of human evolution that combines the nature of biology and society into a third "thinking nature" beyond biochemistry and physiology, which he argues is a more complete, conscious, ethical, and rational nature. Humanity, by this line of thought, is the latest development from the long history of organic development on Earth. Bookchin's social ecology proposes ethical principles for replacing a society's propensity for hierarchy and domination with that of democracy and freedom.<sup id="cite_ref-Stokols2018_33-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-Stokols2018-33">[33]</a></sup>

It emerged from a time in the mid-1960s, under the emergence of both the [global environmental](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_movement "Environmental movement") and the [American civil rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement "Civil rights movement") movements, and played a much more visible role from the upward movement against [nuclear power](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power "Nuclear power") by the late 1970s. It presents ecological problems as arising mainly from social problems, in particular from different forms of hierarchy and domination, and seeks to resolve them through the model of a society adapted to human development and the biosphere.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELight19986_35-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-FOOTNOTELight19986-35">[35]</a></sup> It is a theory of radical [political ecology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_ecology "Political ecology") based on [communalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communalism_(Bookchin) "Communalism (Bookchin)"), which opposes the current [capitalist system of production](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism "Criticism of capitalism") and [consumption](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumerism "Consumerism").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELight19987_36-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-FOOTNOTELight19987-36">[36]</a></sup> It aims to set up a moral, decentralized, united society, guided by reason.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELight19988_37-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-FOOTNOTELight19988-37">[37]</a></sup> While Bookchin distanced himself from [anarchism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism "Anarchism") later in his life, the philosophical theory of social ecology is often considered to be a form of eco-anarchism.<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup>

Bookchin wrote about the effects of urbanization on human life in the early 1960s during his participation in the civil rights and related social movements. He then began to pursue the connection between ecological and social issues, culminating with his best-known book, _The Ecology of Freedom_, which he had developed over a decade.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELight19985–6_39-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-FOOTNOTELight19985%E2%80%936-39">[39]</a></sup> His argument, that human domination and destruction of nature follows from social domination between humans, was a breakthrough position in the growing field of ecology. He writes that life develops from self-organization and evolutionary cooperation ([symbiosis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis "Symbiosis")).<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELight19986_35-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-FOOTNOTELight19986-35">[35]</a></sup> Bookchin wrote of preliterate societies organized around mutual need but ultimately overrun by institutions of hierarchy and domination, such as city-states and capitalist economies, which he attributes uniquely to societies of humans and not communities of animals.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELight19987_36-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-FOOTNOTELight19987-36">[36]</a></sup> He proposes confederation between communities of humans run through democracy rather than through administrative logistics.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELight19988_37-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-FOOTNOTELight19988-37">[37]</a></sup>

Bookchin's work, beginning with anarchist writings on the subject in the 1960s, has continuously evolved. Towards the end of the 1990s, he increasingly integrated the principle of communalism, with aspirations more inclined towards institutionalized municipal democracy, which distanced him from certain evolutions of [anarchism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism "Anarchism"). Bookchin's work draws inspiration from, and expands up, anarchism (mainly [Kropotkin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kropotkin "Peter Kropotkin")), [Syndicalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndicalism "Syndicalism"), and [Marxism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism "Marxism") (including the writings of [Marx](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx "Karl Marx") and [Engels](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Engels "Friedrich Engels")). Social ecology refuses the pitfalls of a [Neo-Malthusian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Malthusian "Neo-Malthusian") ecology which erases social relationships by replacing them with "natural forces", but also of a technocratic ecology which considers that environmental progress must rely on technological breakthroughs and that the state will play an integral role in this technological development. According to Bookchin, these two currents depoliticize ecology and mythologize the past and the future.

In May 2016, the first "International Social Ecology Meetings" were organized in [Lyon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon "Lyon"), which brought together a hundred radical environmentalists, decreasing figures and libertarians, most of whom came from France, [Belgium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium "Belgium"), Spain and [Switzerland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland"), but also from the United States, [Guatemala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala "Guatemala") and Canada. At the center of the debates: libertarian municipalism as an alternative to the nation state and the need to rethink activism.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup>

#### Kurdish movement [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Murray_Bookchin&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Kurdish movement")

Bookchin's reflections on social ecology and libertarian municipalism also inspired [Abdullah Öcalan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_%C3%96calan "Abdullah Öcalan"), the historical leader of the Kurdish movement, to create the concept of [democratic confederalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_confederalism "Democratic confederalism"), which aims to bring together the peoples of the Middle East in a confederation of democratic, multicultural and [ecological](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecologism "Ecologism") communes.<sup id="cite_ref-utopia1_43-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-utopia1-43">[43]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-diplo1_44-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-diplo1-44">[44]</a></sup> Adopted by the [Kurdistan Workers' Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers%27_Party "Kurdistan Workers' Party") (PKK) since 2005, Öcalan's project represents a major ideological shift away from their previous goal of establishing a [Marxist–Leninist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism "Marxism–Leninism") state.<sup id="cite_ref-utopia1_43-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-utopia1-43">[43]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-nyt-2015_45-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-nyt-2015-45">[45]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-haaretz-2019_46-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-haaretz-2019-46">[46]</a></sup> In addition to the PKK, Öcalan's internationalist project was also well received by its Syrian counterpart, the [Party of Democratic Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Union_Party_(Syria) "Democratic Union Party (Syria)") (PYD), which would become the first organization in the world to actually found a society based on the principles of democratic confederalism.<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup> On January 6, 2014, the cantons of [Rojava](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rojava "Rojava"), in [Syrian Kurdistan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Kurdistan "Syrian Kurdistan"), federated into autonomous municipalities, adopting a social contract which established a decentralized non-hierarchy society, based on principles of [direct democracy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy "Direct democracy"), [feminism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism "Feminism"), ecology, [cultural pluralism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism "Multiculturalism"), participatory politics and [economic cooperativism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperativism "Cooperativism").<sup id="cite_ref-nyt-2015_45-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-nyt-2015-45">[45]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-haaretz-2019_46-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-haaretz-2019-46">[46]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup>

### Municipalism and communalism [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Murray_Bookchin&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Municipalism and communalism")

Bookchin's vision of an ecological society is based on [highly participatory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy "Participatory democracy"), [grassroots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots "Grassroots") politics, in which municipal communities democratically plan and manage their affairs through [popular assembly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_assembly "Popular assembly"), a program he called [communalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipalism "Municipalism"). This democratic deliberation purposefully promotes autonomy and self-reliance, as opposed to centralized state politics. While this program retains elements of anarchism, it emphasizes a higher degree of organization (community planning, voting, and institutions) than general anarchism. In Bookchin's Communalism, these autonomous, municipal communities connect with each other via [confederations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation "Confederation").<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup>

Starting in the 1970s, Bookchin argued that the arena for libertarian social change should be the municipal level. In 1980 Bookchin used the term "libertarian municipalism" to describe a [libertarian socialist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialist "Libertarian socialist")<sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> system in which institutions of directly democratic assemblies would oppose and replace the [state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity) "State (polity)") with a confederation of free municipalities.<sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup> In _The Next Revolution_, Bookchin stresses the link that libertarian municipalism has with his earlier philosophy of social ecology. He writes:

> Libertarian Municipalism constitutes the politics of social ecology, a revolutionary effort in which freedom is given institutional form in public assemblies that become decision-making bodies.<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup>

Bookchin proposes that these institutional forms must take place within differently scaled local areas. In a 2001 interview he summarized his views this way:

> The overriding problem is to change the structure of society so that people gain power. The best arena to do that is the municipality—the city, town, and village—where we have an opportunity to create a face-to-face democracy.<sup id="cite_ref-Vanek_55-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-Vanek-55">[55]</a></sup>

Libertarian municipalism intends to create a situation in which the two powers—the municipal confederations and the nation state cannot coexist.<sup id="cite_ref-Vanek_55-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-Vanek-55">[55]</a></sup>

## Legacy and influence [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Murray_Bookchin&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Legacy and influence")

Though Bookchin, by his own recognition, failed to win over a substantial body of supporters during his own lifetime, his ideas have nonetheless influenced movements and thinkers across the globe.

Among these are the Kurdish [People's Protection Units](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Protection_Units "People's Protection Units") (YPG) and closely aligned [Kurdistan Workers' Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers%27_Party "Kurdistan Workers' Party") (PKK) in Turkey, which have [fought the Turkish state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish%E2%80%93Turkish_conflict "Kurdish–Turkish conflict") since the 1980s to try to secure greater political and cultural rights for the country's [Kurds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_people "Kurdish people"). The PKK is designated as a [terrorist organization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorist_organization "Terrorist organization") by the Turkish and United States governments, while the YPG has been considered an ally of the US against [ISIS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant "Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant").<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup> Though founded on a rigid [Marxist–Leninist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist%E2%80%93Leninist "Marxist–Leninist") ideology, the PKK has seen a shift in its thought and aims since the capture and [imprisonment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprisonment_of_Abdullah_%C3%96calan "Imprisonment of Abdullah Öcalan") of its leader, [Abdullah Öcalan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_%C3%96calan "Abdullah Öcalan"), in 1999. Öcalan began reading a variety of [post-Marxist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Marxist "Post-Marxist") political theory while in prison, and found particular interest in Bookchin's works.<sup id="cite_ref-biehl_dialectics_58-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-biehl_dialectics-58">[58]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup>

Öcalan attempted in early 2004 to arrange a meeting with Bookchin through his lawyers, describing himself as Bookchin's "student" eager to adapt his thought to Middle Eastern society. Bookchin was too ill to accept the request. In May 2004 Bookchin conveyed this message "My hope is that the Kurdish people will one day be able to establish a free, rational society that will allow their brilliance once again to flourish. They are fortunate indeed to have a leader of Mr. Öcalan's talents to guide them". When Bookchin died in 2006, the PKK hailed the American thinker as "one of the greatest social scientists of the 20th century", and vowed to put his theory into practice.<sup id="cite_ref-biehl_dialectics_58-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-biehl_dialectics-58">[58]</a></sup>

"[Democratic confederalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_confederalism "Democratic confederalism")", the variation on Communalism developed by Öcalan in his writings and adopted by the PKK, does not outwardly seek Kurdish rights within the context of the formation of an independent state separate from Turkey. The PKK claims that this project is not envisioned as being only for Kurds, but rather for all peoples of the region, regardless of their ethnic, national, or religious background. Rather, it promulgates the formation of assemblies and organizations beginning at the grassroots level to enact its ideals in a non-state framework beginning at the local level. It also places a particular emphasis on securing and promoting [women's rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_rights "Women's rights").<sup id="cite_ref-biehl_dialectics_58-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-biehl_dialectics-58">[58]</a></sup> The PKK has had some success in implementing its programme, through organizations such as the Democratic Society Congress (DTK), which coordinates political and social activities within Turkey, and the [Koma Civakên Kurdistan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koma_Civak%C3%AAn_Kurdistan "Koma Civakên Kurdistan") (KCK), which does so across all countries where Kurds live.<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup>
