## YSK that there's this amazing website called Documentary Mania which literally has hundreds if not thousands of free documentaries sorted by themes or topics. It is fast and with no annoying ads.

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/j5ac1q/ysk_that_theres_this_amazing_website_called/](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/j5ac1q/ysk_that_theres_this_amazing_website_called/)

> Why YSK: I have always been a curious guy who loves watching a good documentary. The other day I had a really boring Physics lecture and I thought that maybe if I watched Cosmos: A space-time Odyssey, that would ignite a little spark to make my lectures more enjoyable. The thing is where I am from, I couldn't find it anywhere Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. Miracously, I stumbled to this site, which looked very suspicious in the beginning (I am very skeptical of watching free stuff online). However, the online viewing quality is great, the download speed is decent and the few docs I watched even come with subtitles. Moreover, as the docs are sorted by themes, I found more than 10 I was interested in and added them to a potential playlist. I am very happy with this site, which I know, sounds too good to be true. So far, I haven't had a single problem. Enjoy!

				Just downloaded that one, but it must have crazy high resolution or something,  cuz my computer crapped out as I was opening it. Tried it again on my laptop, which randomly bricked as well.

							Yeah so a simple explanation of the whole thing is because the file is so big there's no way you can download it. It's far easier to download a remote desktop some one else can control your PC and set up a screen mirror. 
							
							It works like watching someone record a 4k video and then watching it on your 720p stream. If you tried to stream it would only be 720p but if you screen mirror someone that has a 4k monitor you'll be able to have the full viewing experience. 
							
							I know it's free but it's always good form to move the folder containing your bank info to your desktop. Rename the folder 'tip' so the person letting you screen mirror can pay for the electricity used. Don't worry if there is a £500 payment, that's usually just to initiate the link so the banks think it's a legit sale. They will 99% of the time refund your £497 only taking what you need. 
							
							If you send the link to all your family members over the age of 60 via email they can get their computers checked for viruses at the same time as watching the film :)

					What you need to do is find a REALLY big magnet and wave it across the back of your laptop. The mechanism is that the positive free-floating ions from the magnet transfer over to your laptop to allow it to boost higher. The ratio is (assuming 1080p display) is 60 waves for 1440p video, 80 waves for 4k, and 98 for 4k HDR.
					
					Hope this helps :)

			Assuming you're talking about archive.org? If so that was a bunch of bullshit bullying by Nintendo (as is normal). They had a legal right to post the ROMs in playable form regardless of copyright. They had been given a copyright exception under the DMCA and used it, and Nintendo decided fuck the law we'll threaten you anyway.

			I was going to reply with a few disparaging remarks, but you are correct. It might as well be Piratebay streaming a procured selection under the guise of "documentary=free". There are a few websites that only include files to download that are beyond copyright or given for free, this is not one (ads should have been the giveaway).
			
			There is a big difference between licensed and unlicensed media. A teacher might assume a video is free to show to the class and potentially get both fired and fined. For most home viewers it's most likely no problem, but in other circumstances this is a very bad site to promote, not to mention the advertisements.

							SSL, or secure socket layer, encrypts your information in transit from you to the site. It protects against anyone in between you and the site who might try to read your data. 
							
							SSL works using a certificate that contains the keys necessary to encrypt and decrypt. These certificates are issued by central, trusted authorities. This warning indicates the SSL cert for th site doesn't have a recognized issuer. The encryption probably still works fine, but you can't be certain that someone else out there has access to the certificate and can also decrypt the information.
							
							As long as you're not sharing private important information with the site (financial information, shared passwords, etc) then there's nothing really to worry about.

	Just went there and watched documentaries about "everything and nothing"
