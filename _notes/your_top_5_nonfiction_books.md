			Anything by Jon Ronson is a must read.

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 75 _(2022-06-20 14:34:23)_

	Educated by Tara Westover. (A woman brought up in a fundamentalist religous family, gripping and horrifying in equal measure). 

	Voices from Chernobyl by Svetlana Alexievich. (Anything by Alexievich is enriching and heartbreaking; tough subjects. This is the story of Chernobyl as told by the firefighters families, the physicians, politicians - the people who lived it. The recent series is based on this).  

	Into Thin Air by John Krankauer. (1996 Everest disaster where 8 climbers died. Couldn't put it down). 

	Nothing to Envy by Barbara Demick. (Stories of people in North Korea. Utterly human, heartbreaking, a tragedy on a huge scale, but with such lovely people at its heart). 

	Stalingrad by Antony Beevor. (One of the best books about WW2. I've enjoyed all of his books).

		Have you read Escape From Camp 14? It's about the first known North Korean prisoner born in a camp who managed to escape. I read it right before the "freedom" protests were happening in my city and was just so upset that these people had no idea how much freedom we have in our country compared to NK.

		Beevor is amazing. I love WW2 books and it’s history. I recommend The Good War and I just recently picked up Every Man A Hero. Stephen Ambrose is pretty great too.

		* 🟧 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 3 _(2022-06-21 01:27:30)_

			Thanks for the recommends. Interestingly when I did a search for The Good War, there's a book about Afghanistan with the same name that looks right up my street too so thats two for the price of one! I've read a few of Ambrose books, probably like most started with Band of Brothers because of the tv show. Every Man A Hero sounds good, I'll give it a go. My grandad was at the Normandy landings and spoke about the ships being horrendous. It makes me sad to think that peoples stories are being lost as the survivors die. The things that will be forgotten. (Sorry for the injection of melancholy!)

	* 🟨 **[dimmynadd](https://www.reddit.com/user/dimmynadd)** ⬆️ 3 _(2022-06-20 17:39:56)_

		Nothing to Envy was so eye-opening and real. I find it so difficult distinguishing it from fiction because it was so far from my reality.

		* 🟧 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 3 _(2022-06-21 01:32:56)_

			Honestly, I tear up thinking about some of the stories in it. So far out of my comfy western bubble. Theres a story at the start about >!a young teenage couple who sneak out after dark when their parents aren't watching (because they're all in bed because there's no power!) just go for walks and talk. In my head I'm thinking "aye right, just walking and talking", but when it explains that they had never even seen couples kissing on tv or at the cinema, they were super shy about these things,!&lt; it just blew my mind. The other thing I think about often is >!eating grass.!&lt;

		Ian Mortimer is friggin ridiculous, upvote-but I’d recommend Millenium. It covers a thousand years instead of a century so it is more time covered with less focus on the thirteenth century. Still crazy fascinating and a good alternative if you’re not into the 1300s for some reason🤷🏻‍♂️

			I really love books on the history of disease. Plagues and Peoples delve into the impact of disease on our human history. It's a fascinating read. During the first phases of the COVID pandemic I ended up reading a lot of books like this. The Great Morality by John Kelly, The Butchering Art by Lindsey Fitzharris and How to Survive a Plague by David France are a few.  Additionally I was listening to This Podcast Will Kill You.

		[**Why We Can't Sleep: Women's New Midlife Crisis**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51285456-why-we-can-t-sleep)
		
		(By: Ada Calhoun | 267 pages | Published: 2020 | Popular Shelves: non-fiction, nonfiction, feminism, self-help, psychology)
		
		>When Ada Calhoun found herself in the throes of a midlife crisis, she thought that she had no right to complain. She was married with children and a good career. So why did she feel miserable? And why did it seem that other Generation X women were miserable, too?
		>
		>Calhoun decided to find some answers. She looked into housing costs, HR trends, credit card debt averages, and divorce data. At every turn, she saw a pattern: sandwiched between the Boomers and the Millennials, Gen X women were facing new problems as they entered middle age, problems that were being largely overlooked.
		>
		>Speaking with women across America about their experiences as the generation raised to “have it all,” Calhoun found that most were exhausted, terrified about money, under-employed, and overwhelmed. Instead of being heard, they were told instead to lean in, take “me-time,” or make a chore chart to get their lives and homes in order.
		>
		>In Why We Can’t Sleep, Calhoun opens up the cultural and political contexts of Gen X’s predicament and offers solutions for how to pull oneself out of the abyss—and keep the next generation of women from falling in. The result is reassuring, empowering, and essential reading for all middle-aged women, and anyone who hopes to understand them.

		[**The Book of Separation**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33413885-the-book-of-separation)
		
		(By: Tova Mirvis | 320 pages | Published: 2017 | Popular Shelves: memoir, non-fiction, nonfiction, religion, memoirs)
		
		>The memoir of a woman who leaves her faith and her marriage and sets out to navigate the terrifying, liberating terrain of a newly mapless world.
		>
		>Born and raised in a tight-knit Orthodox Jewish family, Tova Mirvis committed herself to observing the rules and rituals prescribed by this way of life. After all, to observe was to be accepted and to be accepted was to be loved. She married a man from within the fold and quickly began a family. But over the years, her doubts became noisier than her faith, and at age forty she could no longer breathe in what had become a suffocating existence. Even though it would mean the loss of her friends, her community, and possibly even her family, Tova decides to leave her husband and her faith. After years of trying to silence the voice inside her that said she did not agree, did not fit in, did not believe, she strikes out on her own to discover what she does believe and who she really is. This will mean forging a new way of life not just for herself, but for her children, who are struggling with what the divorce and her new status as “not Orthodox” means for them.
		>
		>This is a memoir about what it means to decide to heed your inner compass at long last. To free the part of yourself that has been suppressed, even if it means walking away from the only life you’ve ever known. Honest and courageous, Tova takes us through her first year outside her marriage and community as she learns to silence her fears and seek adventure on her own path to happiness.

		[**Cultish: The Language of Fanaticism**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55338982-cultish)
		
		(By: Amanda Montell | 310 pages | Published: 2021 | Popular Shelves: non-fiction, nonfiction, audiobook, audiobooks, psychology)
		
		>The author of the widely praised Wordslut analyzes the social science of cult influence: how cultish groups from Jonestown and Scientology to SoulCycle and social media gurus use language as the ultimate form of power.
		>
		>What makes “cults” so intriguing and frightening? What makes them powerful? The reason why so many of us binge Manson documentaries by the dozen and fall down rabbit holes researching suburban moms gone QAnon is because we’re looking for a satisfying explanation for what causes people to join—and more importantly, stay in—extreme groups. We secretly want to know: could it happen to me? Amanda Montell’s argument is that, on some level, it already has . . .
		>
		>Our culture tends to provide pretty flimsy answers to questions of cult influence, mostly having to do with vague talk of “brainwashing.” But the true answer has nothing to do with freaky mind-control wizardry or Kool-Aid. In Cultish, Montell argues that the key to manufacturing intense ideology, community, and us/them attitudes all comes down to language. In both positive ways and shadowy ones, cultish language is something we hear—and are influenced by—every single day.
		>
		>Through juicy storytelling and cutting original research, Montell exposes the verbal elements that make a wide spectrum of communities “cultish,” revealing how they affect followers of groups as notorious as Heaven’s Gate, but also how they pervade our modern start-ups, Peloton leaderboards, and Instagram feeds. Incisive and darkly funny, this enrapturing take on the curious social science of power and belief will make you hear the fanatical language of “cultish” everywhere.

		[**Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10847.Under_the_Banner_of_Heaven)
		
		(By: Jon Krakauer | 400 pages | Published: 2003 | Popular Shelves: non-fiction, nonfiction, religion, history, true-crime)
		
		>A Story of Violent Faith
		>
		>A multilayered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, savage violence, polygamy, and unyielding faith. This is vintage Krakauer, an utterly compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behavior.
		>
		>Jon Krakauer’s literary reputation rests on insightful chronicles of lives conducted at the outer limits. In Under The Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith, he shifts his focus from extremes of physical adventure to extremes of religious belief within our own borders. At the core of his book is an appalling double murder committed by two Mormon Fundamentalist brothers, Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a revelation from God commanding them to kill their blameless victims. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this "divinely inspired" crime, Krakauer constructs a multilayered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, savage violence, polygamy, and unyielding faith. Along the way, he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America’s fastest-growing religion, and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief.
		>
		>Krakauer takes readers inside isolated communities in the American West, Canada, and Mexico, where some forty-thousand Mormon Fundamentalists believe the mainstream Mormon Church went unforgivably astray when it renounced polygamy. Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City, the leaders of these outlaw sects are zealots who answer only to God. Marrying prodigiously and with virtual impunity (the leader of the largest fundamentalist church took seventy-five "plural wives," several of whom were wed to him when they were fourteen or fifteen and he was in his eighties), fundamentalist prophets exercise absolute control over the lives of their followers, and preach that any day now the world will be swept clean in a hurricane of fire, sparing only their most obedient adherents.
		>
		>Weaving the story of the Lafferty brothers and their fanatical brethren with a clear-eyed look at Mormonism’s violent past, Krakauer examines the underbelly of the most successful homegrown faith in the United States, and finds a distinctly American brand of religious extremism. The result is vintage Krakauer, an utterly compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behavior.

I find him to be an endlessly fascinating individual myself so was able to slog through some of the more dense parts on paintings. Isaacson really does his research though and can write a pretty great biography. It also contains a lot of full page images of da Vinci's paintings and a lot of his hand sketches from his notebooks - very fascinating!)

		I have Naked on my shelf right now. What did you like about it? Toying with the idea of reading it!

		* 🟧 **[HamiltonBlack](https://www.reddit.com/user/HamiltonBlack)** ⬆️ 6 _(2022-06-20 17:01:48)_

			It’s incredibly funny and self-deprecating. Sedaris has a razor sharp wit and can make grand entertainment from the smallest of scenarios. Just enough snark as well.

			* 🟦 **[Vkmies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Vkmies)** ⬆️ 3 _(2022-06-20 18:23:57)_

				How does it compare to "Me Talk Pretty One Day"?
				
				I remember reading that and enjoying it okay, but also feeling like that might be enough Sedaris for one lifetime. Been thinking about reading another one at some point. Is one of them (like Naked) clearly above the others?

				* 🟪 **[HamiltonBlack](https://www.reddit.com/user/HamiltonBlack)** ⬆️ 4 _(2022-06-20 19:09:04)_

					I think if Me Talk Pretty One Day was "just okay" to you, I'm not sure Naked will convert you. I think Naked is his best. You probably know you can read any chapter randomly as they're unconnected stories. So pick up Naked and read the chapter C.O.G., which to me is probably some of his finest writing and one of his best and funniest stories from start to finish. If you're not convinced after that, he may not be for you. Since it's on your shelf, give it a shot!

				* 🟪 **[hitoribocchan](https://www.reddit.com/user/hitoribocchan)** ⬆️ 3 _(2022-06-20 18:47:52)_

					In my opinion, Naked is definitely one of his best/funniest ones. But I think Calypso is his strongest book overall (I've read them all but the very very newest one that just came out). While Calypso is still funny, it's more muted in its humor, and more reflective in nature as he looks at heavier topics, like his sister's death, his mother's alcoholism, and his father's aging. I think it's his most serious book and it's my personal favorite, but if you're more interested in the humor then Naked is my second recommendation after Calypso because it's also very good

			It was great! Got me to start seeing therapy as something similar to going to the gym for improving health as opposed to seeing it as something meant for “broken” people with “real” problems. We all talk to friends and family for advice sometimes, therapists are similar except they are professionally trained to give advice, whereas friends and family aren’t. It helped me destigmatize therapy and it’s for sure worth checking out!

	5. running after antelope- scott carrier ( uncategorizable- he is such a cool and strange and natural writer, its about the western united states, about brotherhood and family, about the magic and the stupidity of humans and yes there is running after antelope- little known but a classic in my mind!)

	Assad or We Burn the Country by Sam Dagher. An excellent work of journalism about the Syrian Civil War, published in 2019.

	Primed for Violence by Paul Brykczynski. An analysis of the assassination of Gabriel Narutowicz and its effect on Polish politics. An extremely understudied topic, though probably a fairly niche interest.

	Voices from Chernobyl by Svetlana Alexeivich. A collection of the stories of people who lived through Chernobyl, I think I've seen it commented a few times already.

	Following the Leader by David Lampton. A political history and analysis of the Reform era in China. So far the best book I've read about the country, though Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China is near the top of my list and if I ever finish it, it will probably take this place on my top five.

	Narrative non-fiction is my favorite genre. I picked my favorites from 5 different authors but they have mostly written other very good books as well. Any book by Daniel James Brown or David McCullough would be great. I loved all of Caitlin Doughty’s books. Richard Preston has a couple other related and equally good books, I just recommend The Hot Zone because it comes chronologically first.

	Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid - Douglas Hofstadter - Touches on a lot of fields to get to the main argument, that our mind is built from layers of complexity creating emergent properties forming a feedback loop. If you've heard "I think, therefore I am" and were left wondering "but how though?" this may be good for you.

	A Brief History of Time and The Universe in a Nutshell - Stephen Hawking - The classic of mindbending astrophysics, and my main introduction to that field. Still absolutely worth the read.

	A History of American Law - Lawrence Friedman - Fairly dense academic work putting together how American Law has taken shape. Covers various fields in law, and maybe worth a look if you were considering law school someday.

	Alexander Hamilton - Ron Chernow - A main source for the Broadway smash hit. Has intrigue, drama, humor, and theory around the proper establishment of a national banking system in spades. Hamilton is just an interesting dude.

	The Big Short - Michael Lewis - If you lived through the 2008 financial crisis and want to know what that was all about but don't want to be thoroughly bored, this is a great overview from the perspective of several investors in various positions who took a unique heading into that fiasco.

	Deep Dark Down by Hector Tobar. The story of 33 Chilean miners, the collapse of the mine, and their rescue. It's not just the collapse, the starvation, the fungus; it's every turn in this journey that keeps the tension so high and makes this book completely enthralling.
