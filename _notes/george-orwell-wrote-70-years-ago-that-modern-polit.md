## ✍️ George Orwell wrote 70 years ago that modern political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable. 

When it comes to the media’s coverage of Israel’s illegal occupation of Palestine, unfortunately there is a lot of modern political language masquerading as journalism aimed to perpetuate the status quo. 

The language is designed to rob the oppressed of their very struggle for dignity.

Having worked with many of these news organizations, I know this pattern all too well, a pattern that dates back decades, and that aims to dehumanize Palestinians and absolve Israel of any accountability for the countless crimes they commit on a daily basis.

These news organizations intentionally obfuscate facts and erase fundamental context to shield Israel from facing consequences for the crimes of collective punishment, ethnic-cleansing, apartheid and occupation, protecting the racist and rogue zionist state. 

Their complicity is as obscene as it is obvious and I can assure you that they know exactly what they are doing.
