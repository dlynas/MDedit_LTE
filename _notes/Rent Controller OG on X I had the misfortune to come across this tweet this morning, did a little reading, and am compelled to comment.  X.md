I had the misfortune to come across this tweet this morning, did a little reading, and am compelled to comment.

Quote

Prof. Thrasher

As the sheriff evicted an elderly couple and was removing a handicapped woman with Parkinson's disease from their home, her partner doused himself with gas and set himself on fire. "This," Aaron Bushnell so presciently said, "is what our ruling class has decided will be normal."

The tenants had lived there for some years. Indeed if you can bear the fire video, it looks like they’d been there for a long time. The wife suffered from Parkinson’s and dementia, which means that her husband was her caregiver.

Interestingly, this wasn’t a non-payment of rent case. The tenants were evicted on a 30-days notice. In most states, a tenant can be evicted for any reason or no reason at all by service of the statutory notice. Most of the time, the tenant is fucked, and just has to move.

Moving is particularly hard on elders. They’ve often lived in a place for a long time, and even if neither is disabled, it’s a big big job. And that’s in addition to the cattle call that is today’s rental market, where you put up with any abuse to pay a lot for rent.

It becomes even harder when one spouse is the caregiver, of course. They have to continue with their caregiving duties, pack up the house, find a new place to live that is suitable for the disabled partner, arrange for movers, set up the new house…

A few words about disability. They would need a place without stairs, with an accessible bathroom, or one that could be made accessible easily. You have no idea how hard this can be. The number of bathtubs that are too narrow for a shower chair…

A lot of elders have made their place work for them. I remember John asking me how I’d get down the front steps if I had to evacuate and he weren’t home. I told him that I’d sit down on the top step and scoot down on my butt, assuming the the emergency personnel would pick me up.

Now the Writ of Possession was endorsed on March 4, which means that the 30-days notice was likely issued on February 1. Gee, add insult by evicting elders in winter. The eviction was carried out within three weeks of the Writ.

Once the Writ is endorsed, the tenants are screwed. They have an eviction “on their record,“ and it would become nigh on impossible for them to rent anything. It is really like having a criminal record, but for housing.

This is why you occasionally read about murder-suicides of elders being evicted. They have no options. And it’s one reason I’m appalled by the YIMBYs trying to move rent-controlled elders out of their apartments so younger, richer people can occupy them.

The nicer of them might offer me a decent tent.

Moving on from my unfortunate snippiness, a couple of concluding remarks. I am going to shut up, really.

The immediate solution is strong rent control and just cause protections nationwide. And then the revolution, as there’s no amount of filtering that fixes this.

The widow will likely end up in Medicaid-funded assisted living, which will be immensely difficult for her—removed from familiar surroundings and missing her primary caregiver.

And now you also understand why elder homeowners don’t sell their homes and go into the rental market. Eve if you can only live in three rooms, it’s better than having this happen to you.

One more thing. These folks may not have had pets, but this is how you find 10-year-old bonded cats or dogs down at the shelter, petrified at the loss of their family, and unlikely to be adopted. When they should never have faced this in the first place.

Just one more thing. I mean it. I really will shut up. I have been rattling on forever about people retiring into homelessness, either because their partner dies, or they get a big rent increase, or they get evicted. This horror is going to become more common in future.

But I can’t just stop. Even for people who are young and unencumbered can’t move easily in 30 days. There’s no way older and/or disabled people can do that.
