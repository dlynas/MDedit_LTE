there's this really bizarre thing that happens to you when you first start to learn rigorous mathematics, which is that geometry is taken away from you and you have to conduct a series of arcane rituals to get it back. to get back the \*pythagorean theorem\*, you need to:



1\. construct the natural numbers N using the axioms of peano arithmetic or similar 2. construct the integers Z as equivalence classes of ordered pairs (a, b) of natural numbers (representing the difference a - b)

3\. construct the rationals Q as equivalence classes of ordered pairs (a, b) of integers where b is not zero (representing the quotient a / b) 4. construct the real numbers R as either equivalence classes of cauchy sequences of rationals or as dedekind cuts

5\. construct the euclidean plane as the cartesian product R^2 = R x R, define the euclidean inner product and distance / length on it, define orthogonality in terms of the inner product, and then \*finally\* prove: if v, w are orthogonal then |v + w|^2 = |v|^2 + |w|^2

this is sort of a hazing ritual you have to go through to properly enter the domain of "actual mathematics" and as far as i can tell it would have looked completely perverse to any practicing mathematician working before the year 1900 or so

the reason we have to do this is to reassure ourselves that the euclidean plane "actually exists," and the reason we have to do \*this\* is rooted in the foundational crisis in mathematics: russell's paradox, the incompleteness theorems, all that stuff

we pay prices for doing things this way. one of them is that the real numbers contain a bunch of bizarre numbers (e.g. non-computable numbers) that are impossible to write down explicitly but also which essentially never occur in practice. they're sort of "junk" numbers

another is that the real numbers contain a bunch of bizarre \*subsets\*, namely the non-measurable subsets (e.g. the ones in the banach-tarski paradox). these also essentially never occur in practice. nevertheless one has to invent measure theory just to avoid them

from the point of view of a classical mathematician working before 1900, pre-crisis, all of this is quite strange. in the european tradition at least, the whole concept of a number is deeply rooted in geometry. geometry comes \*first\* if you're steeped in euclid

they would tell us that our definition of the cartesian plane and the euclidean distance is completely backwards conceptually: why would we have ever written down the sum of the squares of the differences of the coordinates without \*already knowing\* the pythagorean theorem?

to my mind the modern "proof" of the pythagorean theorem borders on circular. i've never really understood it and this has bothered me for years. i've been thinking about it more lately and i think the issue really comes down to this prior-ness of geometry

years ago i ran across this book called the mathematical mechanic that contained "physical proofs" of the pythagorean theorem, from e.g. conservation of energy. they're very cute but i never felt like i understood them either

i think ultimately the actual content of the pythagorean theorem has to come down to some preconceptual understanding of what it is like for us as human beings to move through space and observe + manipulate objects moving through space. for example:

what do we actually do to measure the length of a physical object? we don't do it by computing coordinates and calculating sums of squares. we do it using a \*ruler\*; that is, we take a rigid stick-like object and \*move it over\* to another object to compare the two

this tells us two things: 1) lengths are relative: we only ever measure the length of a thing relative to another thing. this is hidden in the modern approach using cartesian coordinates 2) the length of a (sufficiently rigid!) object doesn't change when you move it

this second point about lengths being invariant under motion is the real key, i think. specifically it means that lengths are invariant under translations and rotations and i think this is the real heart of the matter but i have not fully worked this out to my satisfaction

what you have to do to get back \*rotations\* in modern mathematics is truly awful. you have to define either what a matrix is or what a complex number is, you have to prove that the trigonometric functions exist... again, completely backwards conceptually, from the classical pov!

what i think i would consider an actual satisfying "modern proof" of the pythagorean theorem is any development of the relevant concepts in which geometric concepts like length and rotation are fundamental or close to fundamental, and don't require such bizarre efforts to define

by contrast i would say the modern fundamentals of, say, group theory are not bizarre in this way. the axioms are simple and well-motivated, the basic properties follow easily from them, it's all very straightforward compared to what you have to do to define a \*circle\*!

anyway, i know i don't normally tweet about math stuff but i know there are some math or math-ish people around, if anyone has some relevant reading material to share on or around this topic i'd appreciate it, thanks 

there are some categorical characterizations of the closed interval \[0, 1\] which are interesting, e.g. freyd's characterization or escardo-simpson's, but they don't seem to make the pythagorean theorem or rotation easy or natural

oh nice this looks spiffy

I wonder what you make of this account of math. Not suggesting you should read the book, because I haven't myself, but just based on the wikipedia article I think it might be onto something en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where\_Mat
