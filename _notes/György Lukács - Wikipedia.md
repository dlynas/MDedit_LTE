He developed the theory of [reification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(Marxism) "Reification (Marxism)"), and contributed to [Marxist theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_theory "Marxist theory") with developments of [Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx "Karl Marx")'s theory of [class consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_consciousness "Class consciousness"). He was also a philosopher of [Leninism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leninism "Leninism"). He ideologically developed and organised Lenin's pragmatic revolutionary practices into the formal philosophy of [vanguard-party revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguard-party_revolution "Vanguard-party revolution").

Lukács was especially influential as a critic due to his theoretical developments of [literary realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_realism "Literary realism") and of the [novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel "Novel") as a [literary genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_genre "Literary genre"). In 1919, he was appointed the Hungarian Minister of Culture of the government of the short-lived [Hungarian Soviet Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Soviet_Republic "Hungarian Soviet Republic") (March–August 1919).<sup id="cite_ref-Benét's_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Ben%C3%A9t's-9">[6]</a></sup> Lukács has been described as the preeminent Marxist intellectual of the Stalinist era, though assessing his legacy can be difficult as Lukács seemed both to support [Stalinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalinism "Stalinism") as the embodiment of Marxist thought, and yet also to champion a return to pre-Stalinist Marxism.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-10">[7]</a></sup>

## Life and politics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Life and politics")\]

Lukács was born Löwinger György Bernát in [Budapest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest "Budapest"), [Austria-Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary "Austria-Hungary"), to the investment banker József Löwinger (later Szegedi Lukács József; 1855–1928) and his wife Adele Wertheimer (Wertheimer Adél; 1860–1917), who were a wealthy Jewish family. He had a brother and sister. He and his family converted to [Lutheranism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheranism "Lutheranism") in 1907.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-11">[8]</a></sup>

His father was knighted by the empire and received a baronial title, making Lukács a [baron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron "Baron") as well through inheritance.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-12">[9]</a></sup> As a writer, he published under the names Georg Lukács and György Lukács. Lukács participated in intellectual circles in [Budapest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest "Budapest"), [Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin "Berlin"), [Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence "Florence") and [Heidelberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidelberg "Heidelberg").<sup id="cite_ref-SEP_2-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-SEP-2">[2]</a></sup> He received his [doctorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctorate "Doctorate") in economic and political sciences ([Dr. rer. oec.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(title) "Doctor (title)")) in 1906 from the [Royal Hungarian University of Kolozsvár](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Joseph_University "Franz Joseph University").<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-13">[10]</a></sup> In 1909, he completed his doctorate in philosophy at the [University of Budapest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Budapest "University of Budapest") under the direction of [Zsolt Beöthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zsolt_Be%C3%B6thy "Zsolt Beöthy").<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-14">[11]</a></sup>

### Pre-Marxist period\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Pre-Marxist period")\]

Whilst at university in Budapest, Lukács was part of socialist intellectual circles through which he met [Ervin Szabó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ervin_Szab%C3%B3 "Ervin Szabó"), an [anarcho-syndicalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalist "Anarcho-syndicalist") who introduced him to the works of [Georges Sorel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Sorel "Georges Sorel") (1847–1922), the French proponent of revolutionary [syndicalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndicalism "Syndicalism").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELukács1972ix–x_15-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-FOOTNOTELuk%C3%A1cs1972ix%E2%80%93x-15">[12]</a></sup> In that period, Lukács's intellectual perspectives were [modernist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernist "Modernist") and [anti-positivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-positivism "Anti-positivism"). From 1904 to 1908, he was part of a theatre troupe that produced [modernist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism "Modernism"), psychologically [realistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(theatre) "Realism (theatre)") plays by [Henrik Ibsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Ibsen "Henrik Ibsen"), [August Strindberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Strindberg "August Strindberg"), and [Gerhart Hauptmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhart_Hauptmann "Gerhart Hauptmann").<sup id="cite_ref-Kołakowski1991_16-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Ko%C5%82akowski1991-16">[13]</a></sup>

Between 1906 and 1909 while in his early twenties, he worked on his 1,000 page _A modern dráma fejlődésének története_ (_English: History of the Development of the Modern Drama_).<sup id="cite_ref-ModernDrama1_17-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-ModernDrama1-17">[14]</a></sup> It was published in Hungary in 1911.<sup id="cite_ref-ModernDramaHu_18-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-ModernDramaHu-18">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ModernDrama2_19-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-ModernDrama2-19">[16]</a></sup> He was despaired when it won a prize in 1908 because he did not think the jury was fit to judge it.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-20">[17]</a></sup>

Lukács spent much time in Germany, and studied at the [University of Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Berlin "University of Berlin") from 1906 to 1907, during which time he made the acquaintance of the philosopher [Georg Simmel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Simmel "Georg Simmel").<sup id="cite_ref-Kołakowski1991_16-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Ko%C5%82akowski1991-16">[13]</a></sup> Later in 1913 whilst in Heidelberg, he befriended [Max Weber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber "Max Weber"), [Emil Lask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Lask "Emil Lask"), [Ernst Bloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Bloch_(philosopher) "Ernst Bloch (philosopher)"), and [Stefan George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_George "Stefan George").<sup id="cite_ref-Kołakowski1991_16-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Ko%C5%82akowski1991-16">[13]</a></sup> The [idealist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealist "Idealist") system to which Lukács subscribed at this time was intellectually indebted to [neo-Kantianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Kantianism "Neo-Kantianism") (then the dominant philosophy in German universities)<sup id="cite_ref-Kołakowski1991_16-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Ko%C5%82akowski1991-16">[13]</a></sup> and to [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato"), [Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel "Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel"), [Søren Kierkegaard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard "Søren Kierkegaard"), [Wilhelm Dilthey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Dilthey "Wilhelm Dilthey"), and [Fyodor Dostoyevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoyevsky "Fyodor Dostoyevsky"). In that period, he published _[Soul and Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_and_Form "Soul and Form")_ (_Die Seele und die Formen_, Berlin, 1911; tr. 1974) and _The Theory of the Novel_ (1916/1920; tr. 1971).<sup id="cite_ref-Benét's_9-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Ben%C3%A9t's-9">[6]</a></sup>

After the beginning of the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"), Lukács was exempted from military service.<sup id="cite_ref-SEP_2-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-SEP-2">[2]</a></sup> In 1914, he married the Russian political activist Jelena Grabenko.<sup id="cite_ref-SEP_2-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-SEP-2">[2]</a></sup>

In 1915, Lukács returned to Budapest, where he was the leader of the "[Sunday Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonntagskreis "Sonntagskreis")", an intellectual [salon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_(gathering) "Salon (gathering)"). Its concerns were the cultural themes that arose from the [existential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism "Existentialism") works of Dostoyevsky, which thematically aligned with Lukács's interests in his last years at Heidelberg. As a salon, the Sunday Circle sponsored cultural events whose participants included literary and musical avant-garde figures, such as [Karl Mannheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Mannheim "Karl Mannheim"), the composer [Béla Bartók](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Bart%C3%B3k "Béla Bartók"), [Béla Balázs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Bal%C3%A1zs "Béla Balázs"), [Arnold Hauser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Hauser_(art_historian) "Arnold Hauser (art historian)"), [Zoltán Kodály](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zolt%C3%A1n_Kod%C3%A1ly "Zoltán Kodály") and [Karl Polanyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Polanyi "Karl Polanyi");<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-21">[18]</a></sup> some of them also attended the weekly salons. In 1918, the last year of the First World War (1914–1918), the Sunday Circle became divided. They dissolved the salon because of their divergent politics; several of the leading members accompanied Lukács into the [Communist Party of Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Hungary "Communist Party of Hungary").<sup id="cite_ref-SEP_2-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-SEP-2">[2]</a></sup>

### Pivot to communism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Pivot to communism")\]

In the aftermath of the First World War and the [Russian Revolution of 1917](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1917 "Russian Revolution of 1917"), Lukács rethought his ideas. He became a committed [Marxist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist "Marxist") in this period and joined the fledgling [Communist Party of Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Hungary "Communist Party of Hungary") in 1918.<sup id="cite_ref-Tar1977_22-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Tar1977-22">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Breines1979_23-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Breines1979-23">[20]</a></sup> Up until at least September 1918, he had intended to emigrate to Germany, but after being rejected from a [habilitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habilitation "Habilitation") in Heidelberg, he wrote on December 16 that he had already decided to pursue a political career in Hungary instead.<sup id="cite_ref-Tar1977_22-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Tar1977-22">[19]</a></sup> Lukács later wrote that he was persuaded to this course by [Béla Kun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Kun "Béla Kun").<sup id="cite_ref-Tar1977_22-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Tar1977-22">[19]</a></sup> The last publication of Lukács' pre-Marxist period was "Bolshevism as a Moral Problem", a rejection of Bolshevism on ethical grounds that he apparently reversed within days.<sup id="cite_ref-Breines1979_23-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Breines1979-23">[20]</a></sup>

Lukács in 1919

As part of the government of the short-lived [Hungarian Soviet Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Soviet_Republic "Hungarian Soviet Republic"), Lukács was made People's Commissar for Education and Culture (he was deputy to the Commissar for Education [Zsigmond Kunfi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zsigmond_Kunfi "Zsigmond Kunfi")).<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-24">[21]</a></sup>

It is said by [József Nádass](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=J%C3%B3zsef_N%C3%A1dass&action=edit&redlink=1 "József Nádass (page does not exist)") that Lukács was giving a lecture entitled "Old Culture and New Culture" to a packed hall when the republic was proclaimed which was interrupted due to the revolution.<sup id="cite_ref-jac_25-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-jac-25">[22]</a></sup>

During the [Hungarian Soviet Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Soviet_Republic "Hungarian Soviet Republic"), Lukács was a theoretician of the Hungarian version of the [red terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_terror "Red terror").<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-26">[23]</a></sup> In an article in the [Népszava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%A9pszava "Népszava"), 15 April 1919, he wrote that "The possession of the power of the state is also a moment for the destruction of the oppressing classes. A moment, we have to use".<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-27">[24]</a></sup> Lukács later became a [commissar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissar "Commissar") of the Fifth Division of the [Hungarian Red Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Red_Army "Hungarian Red Army"), in which capacity he ordered the execution of eight of his own soldiers in [Poroszlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poroszlo "Poroszlo"), in May 1919, which he later admitted in an interview.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-28">[25]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-29">[26]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-30">[27]</a></sup>

After the Hungarian Soviet Republic was defeated, Lukács was ordered by Kun to remain behind with [Ottó Korvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ott%C3%B3_Korvin "Ottó Korvin"), when the rest of the leadership evacuated. Lukács and Korvin's mission was to clandestinely reorganize the communist movement, but this proved to be impossible. Lukács went into hiding, with the help of photographer [Olga Máté](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olga_M%C3%A1t%C3%A9 "Olga Máté"). After Korvin's capture in 1919, Lukács fled from Hungary to Vienna. He was arrested but was saved from extradition due to a group of writers including [Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mann "Thomas Mann") and [Heinrich Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Mann "Heinrich Mann").<sup id="cite_ref-Congdon2014_31-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Congdon2014-31">[28]</a></sup> Thomas Mann later based the character Naphta on Lukács in his novel _[The Magic Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Mountain "The Magic Mountain")_.<sup id="cite_ref-Kolakowski1978c_32-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Kolakowski1978c-32">[29]</a></sup>

He married his second wife, Gertrúd Bortstieber in 1919 in Vienna, a fellow member of the Hungarian Communist Party.<sup id="cite_ref-jac_25-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-jac-25">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-SEP_2-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-SEP-2">[2]</a></sup>

Around the 1920s, while [Antonio Gramsci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci "Antonio Gramsci") was also in Vienna, though they did not meet each other,<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-33">[30]</a></sup> Lukács met a fellow communist, [Victor Serge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Serge "Victor Serge"), and began to develop [Leninist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leninism "Leninism") ideas in the field of philosophy.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-34">[31]</a></sup> His major works in this period were the essays collected in his _magnum opus_ _[History and Class Consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_and_Class_Consciousness "History and Class Consciousness")_ (_Geschichte und Klassenbewußtsein_, Berlin, 1923). Although these essays display signs<sup id="cite_ref-cdlib-Miller_35-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-cdlib-Miller-35">[32]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-38">[d]</a></sup> of what [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin") referred to as "[left communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_communism "Left communism")"<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-39">[35]</a></sup> (with later Leninists calling it "[ultra-leftism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-leftism "Ultra-leftism")"), they provided Leninism with a substantive philosophical basis. In July 1924, [Grigory Zinoviev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Zinoviev "Grigory Zinoviev") attacked this book along with the work of [Karl Korsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Korsch "Karl Korsch") at the Fifth Comintern Congress.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-40">[36]</a></sup>

In 1925, shortly after Lenin's death, Lukács published in Vienna the short study _Lenin: A Study in the Unity of His Thought_ (_Lenin: Studie über den Zusammenhang seiner Gedanken_). In 1925, he published a critical review of [Nikolai Bukharin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Bukharin "Nikolai Bukharin")'s manual of [historical materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_materialism "Historical materialism").<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-41">[37]</a></sup>

As a Hungarian exile, he remained active on the left wing of Hungarian Communist Party, and was opposed to the Moscow-backed programme of [Béla Kun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Kun "Béla Kun"). His "Blum theses" of 1928 called for the overthrow of the counter-revolutionary regime of [Admiral Horthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral_Horthy "Admiral Horthy") in Hungary by a strategy similar to the [Popular Fronts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front "Popular Front") that arose in the 1930s. He advocated a "democratic dictatorship" of the [proletariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat "Proletariat") and [peasantry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peasantry "Peasantry") as a transitional stage leading to the [dictatorship of the proletariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat "Dictatorship of the proletariat"). After Lukács's strategy was condemned by the [Comintern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comintern "Comintern"), he retreated from active politics into theoretical work.

Lukács left Vienna in 1929 first for Berlin, then for Budapest.<sup id="cite_ref-SEP_2-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-SEP-2">[2]</a></sup>

### Under Stalin and Rákosi\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Under Stalin and Rákosi")\]

In 1930, while residing in Budapest, Lukács was summoned to [Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow "Moscow").<sup id="cite_ref-SEP_2-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-SEP-2">[2]</a></sup> This coincided with the signing of a Viennese police order for his expulsion. Leaving their children to attend their studies, Lukács and his wife went to Moscow in March 1930. Soon after his arrival, Lukács was "prevented" from leaving and assigned to work alongside [David Riazanov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Riazanov "David Riazanov") ("in the basement") at the [Marx–Engels Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%E2%80%93Engels_Institute "Marx–Engels Institute").<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-42">[38]</a></sup>

Lukács returned to Berlin in 1931<sup id="cite_ref-Brit_8-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Brit-8">[5]</a></sup> and in 1933 he once again left Berlin for Moscow to attend the [Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Philosophy,_Russian_Academy_of_Sciences "Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences").<sup id="cite_ref-Brit_8-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Brit-8">[5]</a></sup> During this time, Lukács first came into contact with the unpublished works of [the young Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Marx "Young Marx").<sup id="cite_ref-SEP_2-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-SEP-2">[2]</a></sup>

Lukács and his wife were not permitted to leave the Soviet Union until after the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War"). During Stalin's [Great Purge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge "Great Purge"), Lukács was sent to internal exile in [Tashkent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tashkent "Tashkent") for a time, where he and [Johannes Becher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Becher "Johannes Becher") became friends. Lukács survived the purges of the [Great Terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge "Great Purge"). There is much debate among historians concerning the extent to which Lukács accepted [Stalinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalinism "Stalinism") at this period.<sup id="cite_ref-SEP_2-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-SEP-2">[2]</a></sup>

In 1945, Lukács and his wife returned to Hungary. As a member of the [Hungarian Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Communist_Party "Hungarian Communist Party"), he took part in establishing the new Hungarian government. From 1945 Lukács was a member of the [Hungarian Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Academy_of_Sciences "Hungarian Academy of Sciences"). Between 1945 and 1946 he strongly criticised non-communist philosophers and writers. Lukács has been accused of playing an "administrative" (legal-bureaucratic) role in the removal of independent and non-communist intellectuals such as [Béla Hamvas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Hamvas "Béla Hamvas"), [István Bibó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istv%C3%A1n_Bib%C3%B3 "István Bibó"), [Lajos Prohászka](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lajos_Proh%C3%A1szka&action=edit&redlink=1 "Lajos Prohászka (page does not exist)"), and [Károly Kerényi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1roly_Ker%C3%A9nyi "Károly Kerényi") from Hungarian academic life. Between 1946 and 1953, many non-communist intellectuals, including Bibó, were imprisoned or forced into menial work or manual labour.

Lukács's personal aesthetic and political position on culture was always that socialist culture would eventually triumph in terms of quality. He thought it should play out in terms of competing cultures, not by "administrative" measures. In 1948–49, Lukács' position for cultural tolerance was smashed in a "Lukács purge," when [Mátyás Rákosi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A1ty%C3%A1s_R%C3%A1kosi "Mátyás Rákosi") turned his famous [salami tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salami_tactics "Salami tactics") on the [Hungarian Working People's Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Working_People%27s_Party "Hungarian Working People's Party").

In the mid-1950s, Lukács was reintegrated into party life. The party used him to help purge the [Hungarian Writers' Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Writers%27_Union "Hungarian Writers' Union") in 1955–1956. [Tamás Aczél](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tam%C3%A1s_Acz%C3%A9l "Tamás Aczél") and [Tibor Méray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibor_M%C3%A9ray "Tibor Méray") (former Secretaries of the Hungarian Writers' Union) both believe that Lukács participated grudgingly, and cite Lukács leaving the presidium and the meeting at the first break as evidence of this reluctance.<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-43">[39]</a></sup>

### De-Stalinisation\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: De-Stalinisation")\]

In 1956, Lukács became a minister of the [brief communist revolutionary government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution,_1956 "Hungarian Revolution, 1956") led by [Imre Nagy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imre_Nagy "Imre Nagy"), which opposed the Soviet Union.<sup id="cite_ref-Kołakowski_2005_997_44-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Ko%C5%82akowski_2005_997-44">[40]</a></sup> At this time Lukács's daughter led a short-lived party of communist revolutionary youth. Lukács's position on the 1956 revolution was that the Hungarian Communist Party would need to retreat into a coalition government of socialists, and slowly rebuild its credibility with the Hungarian people. While a minister in Nagy's revolutionary government, Lukács also participated in trying to reform the Hungarian Communist Party on a new basis. This party, the [Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Socialist_Workers%27_Party "Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party"), was rapidly co-opted by [János Kádár](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1nos_K%C3%A1d%C3%A1r "János Kádár") after 4 November 1956.<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-45">[41]</a></sup>

During the [1956 Hungarian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1956_Hungarian_Revolution "1956 Hungarian Revolution"), Lukács was present at debates of the anti-party and revolutionary communist [Petőfi Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pet%C5%91fi_Society&action=edit&redlink=1 "Petőfi Society (page does not exist)") while remaining part of the party apparatus. During the revolution, as mentioned in _Budapest Diary,_ Lukács argued for a new Soviet-aligned communist party. In Lukács's view, the new party could win social leadership only by persuasion instead of force. Lukács envisioned an alliance between the dissident communist [Hungarian Revolutionary Youth Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hungarian_Revolutionary_Youth_Party&action=edit&redlink=1 "Hungarian Revolutionary Youth Party (page does not exist)"), the revolutionary [Hungarian Social Democratic Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Social_Democratic_Party "Hungarian Social Democratic Party") and his own Soviet-aligned party as a very junior partner.

Following the defeat of the Revolution, Lukács was deported to the [Socialist Republic of Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Republic_of_Romania "Socialist Republic of Romania") with the rest of Nagy's government.<sup id="cite_ref-Kołakowski_2005_997_44-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Ko%C5%82akowski_2005_997-44">[40]</a></sup> Unlike Nagy, he avoided execution, albeit narrowly. Due to his role in Nagy's government, he was no longer trusted by the party apparatus. Lukács's followers were indicted for political crimes throughout the 1960s and '70s, and a number fled to the West. Lukács's books _[The Young Hegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Young_Hegel "The Young Hegel")_ (_Der junge Hegel_, Zurich, 1948) and _The Destruction of Reason_ (_Die Zerstörung der Vernunft_, Berlin, 1954) have been used to argue that Lukács was covertly critical of Stalinism as a distortion of Marxism.<sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-46">[42]</a></sup> In this reading, these two works are attempts to reconcile the [idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_idealism "German idealism") of Hegelian-[dialectics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectics "Dialectics") with the [dialectical materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism "Dialectical materialism") of Marx and Engels, and position Stalinism as a philosophy of [irrationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrationalism "Irrationalism").<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-47">[43]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-48">[44]</a></sup>

He returned to Budapest in 1957.<sup id="cite_ref-Brit_8-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Brit-8">[5]</a></sup> Lukács publicly abandoned his positions of 1956 and engaged in self-criticism. Having abandoned his earlier positions, Lukács remained loyal to the Communist Party until his death in 1971. In his last years, following the uprisings in France and [Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia "Czechoslovakia") in 1968, Lukács became more publicly critical of the Soviet Union and the Hungarian Communist Party.<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-49">[45]</a></sup>

In an interview just before his death, Lukács remarked:

> Without a genuine general theory of society and its movement, one does not get away from Stalinism. Stalin was a great tactician... But Stalin, unfortunately, was not a Marxist... The essence of Stalinism lies in placing tactics before strategy, practice above theory... The bureaucracy generated by Stalinism is a tremendous evil. Society is suffocated by it. Everything becomes unreal, nominalistic. People see no design, no strategic aim, and do not move..." Thus Lukács concludes "\[w\]e must learn to connect the great decisions of popular political power with personal needs, those of individuals.

### _History and Class Consciousness_\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: History and Class Consciousness")\]

Written between 1919 and 1922 and published in 1923, Lukács's collection of essays _History and Class Consciousness_ contributed to debates concerning Marxism and its relation to [sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology "Sociology"), [politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics "Politics") and [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy").<sup id="cite_ref-Meszaros_50-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Meszaros-50">[46]</a></sup> With this work, Lukács initiated the current of thought that came to be known as "[Western Marxism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Marxism "Western Marxism")".<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-51">[47]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-52">[48]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Breines1979_23-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Breines1979-23">[20]</a></sup> At Lukács' direction, there was no reprinting in his lifetime, making it rare and hard to acquire before 1968. Its return to prominence was aided by the social movements of the 1960s.<sup id="cite_ref-Breines1979_23-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Breines1979-23">[20]</a></sup>

The most important essay in Lukács's book introduces the concept of "[reification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(Marxism) "Reification (Marxism)")". In [capitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist "Capitalist") societies, human properties, relations and actions are transformed into properties, relations and actions of man-produced things, which become independent of man and govern his life. These man-created things are then imagined to be originally independent of man. Moreover, human beings are transformed into thing-like beings that do not behave in a human way but according to the laws of the thing-world.<sup id="cite_ref-Petrovic1_53-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Petrovic1-53">[49]</a></sup> This essay is notable for reconstructing aspects of [Marx's theory of alienation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_alienation "Marx's theory of alienation") before the publication of the _[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_and_Philosophical_Manuscripts_of_1844 "Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844")_ — the work in which Marx most clearly expounds the theory.<sup id="cite_ref-Avineri_54-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Avineri-54">[50]</a></sup>

Lukács also develops the Marxist theory of [class consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_consciousness "Class consciousness") - the distinction between the [objective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy) "Objectivity (philosophy)") situation of a class and that class's [subjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity "Subjectivity") awareness of this situation.<sup id="cite_ref-Fetscher1_55-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Fetscher1-55">[51]</a></sup> Lukács proffers a view of a class as an "historical imputed [subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_(philosophy) "Subject (philosophy)")".<sup id="cite_ref-Fetscher1_55-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Fetscher1-55">[51]</a></sup> An empirically existing class can successfully act only when it becomes conscious of its historical situation, i.e. when it transforms from a "class in itself" to a "class for itself".<sup id="cite_ref-Fetscher2_56-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-Fetscher2-56">[52]</a></sup> Lukács's theory of class consciousness has been influential within the [sociology of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology_of_knowledge "Sociology of knowledge").

In his later career, Lukács repudiated the ideas of _History and Class Consciousness_, in particular the belief in the proletariat as a "[subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_(philosophy) "Subject (philosophy)")\-[object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy) "Object (philosophy)") of history" (1960 Postface to French translation). As late as 1925–1926, he still defended these ideas, in an unfinished manuscript, which he called _Tailism and the Dialectic._ It was not published until 1996 in [Hungarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_language "Hungarian language") and English in 2000 under the title _A Defence of History and Class Consciousness_.

#### _What is Orthodox Marxism?_\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: What is Orthodox Marxism?")\]

Lukács argues that methodology is the only thing that distinguishes [Marxism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism "Marxism"): even if all its substantive propositions were rejected, it would remain valid because of its distinctive method:<sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-57">[53]</a></sup>

> Orthodox Marxism, therefore, does not imply the uncritical acceptance of the results of Marx's investigations. It is not the 'belief' in this or that thesis, nor the exegesis of a 'sacred' book. On the contrary, orthodoxy refers exclusively to method. It is the scientific conviction that dialectical materialism is the road to truth and that its methods can be developed, expanded and deepened only along the lines laid down by its founders.
> 
> — §1

He criticises [Marxist revisionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_revisionism "Marxist revisionism") by calling for the return to this Marxist method, which is fundamentally [dialectical materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism "Dialectical materialism"). Lukács conceives "revisionism" as inherent to the Marxist theory, insofar as dialectical materialism is, according to him, the product of class struggle:

> For this reason the task of orthodox Marxism, its victory over Revisionism and [utopianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopian_socialism "Utopian socialism") can never mean the defeat, once and for all, of false tendencies. It is an ever-renewed struggle against the insidious effects of bourgeois ideology on the thought of the proletariat. Marxist orthodoxy is no guardian of traditions, it is the eternally vigilant prophet proclaiming the relation between the tasks of the immediate present and the totality of the historical process.
> 
> — end of §5

According to him, "The premise of dialectical materialism is, we recall: 'It is not men's consciousness that determines their existence, but on the contrary, their social existence that determines their consciousness.' ...Only when the core of existence stands revealed as a social process can existence be seen as the product, albeit the hitherto unconscious product, of human activity." (§5). In line with Marx's thought, he criticises the [individualist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualist "Individualist") [bourgeois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeois "Bourgeois") philosophy of the [subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_(philosophy) "Subject (philosophy)"), which founds itself on the voluntary and conscious subject. Against this [ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology "Ideology"), he asserts the primacy of social relations. Existence – and thus the world – is the product of human activity; but this can be seen only if the primacy of social process on individual consciousness is accepted. Lukács does not restrain human [liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty "Liberty") for sociological [determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism "Determinism"): to the contrary, this production of existence is the possibility of _[praxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxis_(process) "Praxis (process)")_.

He conceives the problem in the relationship between theory and practice. Lukács quotes Marx's words: "It is not enough that thought should seek to realise itself; reality must also strive towards thought." How does the thought of [intellectuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual "Intellectual") relate to class struggle, if theory is not simply to lag behind history, as it is in Hegel's philosophy of history ("Minerva always comes at the dusk of night...")? Lukács criticises [Friedrich Engels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Engels "Friedrich Engels")'s _[Anti-Dühring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-D%C3%BChring "Anti-Dühring")_, saying that he "does not even mention the most vital interaction, namely the dialectical relation between subject and object in the historical process, let alone give it the prominence it deserves." This dialectical relation between subject and object is the basis of Lukács's critique of [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant")'s [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology"), according to which the subject is the exterior, universal and contemplating subject, separated from the object.

For Lukács, "ideology" is a projection of the class consciousness of the [bourgeoisie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie "Bourgeoisie"), which functions to prevent the [proletariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat "Proletariat") from attaining consciousness of its revolutionary position. Ideology determines the "form of [objectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy) "Objectivity (philosophy)")", thus the very structure of knowledge. According to Lukács, real science must attain the "concrete totality" through which only it is possible to think the current form of objectivity as a historical period. Thus, the so-called eternal "[laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_(principle) "Law (principle)")" of economics are dismissed as the ideological illusion projected by the current form of objectivity ("What is Orthodoxical Marxism?", §3). He also writes: "It is only when the core of [being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being "Being") has showed itself as social becoming, that the being itself can appear as a product, so far unconscious, of human activity, and this activity, in turn, as the decisive element of the transformation of being." ("What is Orthodoxical Marxism?", §5) Finally, "orthodoxical Marxism" is not defined as interpretation of _Capital_ as if it were the Bible or an embrace of "marxist thesis", but as fidelity to the "marxist method", [dialectics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectics#Marxist_dialectics "Dialectics").

Lukács saw the destruction of society as a proper solution to the "cultural contradiction of the epoch". In 1969 he cited:

### Literary and aesthetic work\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Literary and aesthetic work")\]

In addition to his standing as a Marxist political thinker, Lukács was an influential [literary critic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_critic "Literary critic") of the twentieth century. His important work in literary criticism began early in his career, with _The Theory of the Novel_, a seminal work in [literary theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_theory "Literary theory") and the theory of [genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre "Genre"). The book is a history of the novel as a form, and an investigation into its distinct characteristics. In _The Theory of the Novel_, he coins the term "[transcendental homelessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_homelessness "Transcendental homelessness")", which he defines as the "longing of all souls for the place in which they once belonged, and the 'nostalgia… for utopian perfection, a nostalgia that feels itself and its desires to be the only true reality'".<sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-63">[59]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-64">[60]</a></sup> Lukács maintains that "the novel is the necessary epic form of our time."<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-65">[61]</a></sup>

Lukács later repudiated _The Theory of the Novel_, writing a lengthy introduction that described it as erroneous, but nonetheless containing a "romantic anti-capitalism" which would later develop into Marxism. (This introduction also contains his famous dismissal of [Theodor Adorno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Adorno "Theodor Adorno") and others in Western Marxism as having taken up residence in the "Grand Hotel Abyss".)

Lukács's later literary criticism includes the well-known essay "Kafka or Thomas Mann?", in which Lukács argues for the work of [Thomas Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mann "Thomas Mann") as a superior attempt to deal with the condition of [modernity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernity "Modernity"), and criticises [Franz Kafka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka "Franz Kafka")'s brand of [modernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism "Modernism"). Lukács steadfastly opposed the formal innovations of modernist writers like Kafka, [James Joyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce "James Joyce"), and [Samuel Beckett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Beckett "Samuel Beckett"), preferring the traditional aesthetic of realism.

During his time in Moscow in the 1930s, Lukács worked on Marxist views of aesthetics while belonging to the group around an influential Moscow magazine "The Literary Critic" (_Literaturny Kritik_).<sup id="cite_ref-66"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-66">[62]</a></sup> The editor of this magazine, [Mikhail Lifshitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Lifshitz "Mikhail Lifshitz"), was an important Soviet author on aesthetics. Lifshitz' views were very similar to Lukács's insofar as both argued for the value of the traditional art; despite the drastic difference in age (Lifschitz was much younger) both Lifschitz and Lukács indicated that their working relationship at that time was a collaboration of equals. Lukács contributed frequently to this magazine, which was also followed by Marxist art theoreticians around the world through various translations published by the Soviet government.

> The collaboration between Lifschitz and Lukács resulted in the formation of an informal circle of the like-minded Marxist intellectuals connected to the journal Literaturnyi Kritik \[The Literary Critic\], published monthly starting in the summer of 1933 by the Organisational Committee of the Writers' Union. ... A group of thinkers formed around Lifschitz, Lukács and [Andrei Platonov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Platonov "Andrei Platonov"); they were concerned with articulating the aesthetical views of Marx and creating a kind of Marxist aesthetics that had not yet been properly formulated.<sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-67">[63]</a></sup>

Lukács famously argued for the revolutionary character of the novels of [Sir Walter Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Walter_Scott "Sir Walter Scott") and [Honoré de Balzac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor%C3%A9_de_Balzac "Honoré de Balzac"). Lukács felt that both authors' nostalgic, pro-aristocratic politics allowed them accurate and critical stances because of their opposition (albeit reactionary) to the rising [bourgeoisie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie "Bourgeoisie"). This view was expressed in his later book _The Historical Novel_ (published in Russian in 1937, then in Hungarian in 1947), as well as in his essay "[Realism in the Balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_in_the_Balance "Realism in the Balance")" (1938).

_The Historical Novel_ is probably Lukács's most influential work of literary history. In it he traces the development of the genre of historical fiction. While prior to 1789, he argues, people's consciousness of history was relatively underdeveloped, the French Revolution and Napoleonic wars that followed brought about a realisation of the constantly changing, evolving character of human existence. This new historical consciousness was reflected in the work of Sir Walter Scott, whose novels use 'representative' or 'typical' characters to dramatise major social conflicts and historical transformations, for example the dissolution of feudal society in the Scottish Highlands and the entrenchment of mercantile capitalism. Lukács argues that Scott's new brand of [historical realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_realism "Historical realism") was taken up by Balzac and Tolstoy, and enabled novelists to depict contemporary social life not as a static drama of fixed, universal types, but rather as a moment of history, constantly changing, open to the potential of revolutionary transformation. For this reason he sees these authors as progressive and their work as potentially radical, despite their own personal conservative politics.

For Lukács, this historical realist tradition began to give way after the 1848 revolutions, when the bourgeoisie ceased to be a progressive force and their role as agents of history was usurped by the proletariat. After this time, historical realism begins to sicken and lose its concern with social life as inescapably historical. He illustrates this point by comparing Flaubert's historical novel _[Salammbô](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salammb%C3%B4 "Salammbô")_ to that of the earlier realists. For him, Flaubert's work marks a turning away from relevant social issues and an elevation of style over substance. Why he does not discuss _[Sentimental Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentimental_Education "Sentimental Education")_, a novel much more overtly concerned with recent historical developments, is not clear. For much of his life Lukács promoted a return to the realist tradition that he believed had reached its height with Balzac and Scott, and bemoaned the supposed neglect of history that characterised modernism.

_The Historical Novel_ has been hugely influential in subsequent critical studies of historical fiction, and no serious analyst of the genre fails to engage at some level with Lukács's arguments.

#### Critical and socialist realism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Critical and socialist realism")\]

Lukács defined [realistic literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(literature) "Realism (literature)") as literature capable of relating human life to the totality. He distinguishes between two forms of realism, [critical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_realism "Social realism") and [socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_realism "Socialist realism"). Lukács argued that it was precisely the desire for a realistic depiction of life that enabled politically reactionary writers such as [Balzac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honore_de_Balzac "Honore de Balzac"), [Walter Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Walter_Scott "Sir Walter Scott") and [Tolstoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy "Leo Tolstoy") to produce great, timeless and socially progressive works. According to Lukács, there is a contradiction between worldview and talent among such writers. He greatly valued the comments made in that direction by [Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin") on Tolstoy and especially by [Engels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Engels "Friedrich Engels") on Balzac, where Engels describes the "triumph of realism":

> Balzac boldly exposed the contradiction of nascent capitalist society and hence his observation of reality constantly clashed with his political prejudices. But as an honest artist he always depicted only what he himself saw, learned and underwent, concerning himself not at all whether his-true-to-life description of the things he saw contradicted his pet ideas.<sup id="cite_ref-68"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-68">[64]</a></sup>

Critical realists include writers who could not rise to the [communist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism "Communism") worldview, but despite this tried to truthfully reflect the conflicts of the era, not content with the direct description of single events. A great story speaks through individual human destinies in their work. Such writers are not naturalists, allegorists and metaphysicians. They do not flee from the world into the isolated human soul and do not seek to raise its experiences to the rank of timeless, eternal and irresistible properties of human nature. Balzac, Tolstoy, [Anatole France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatole_France "Anatole France"), [Romain Rolland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romain_Rolland "Romain Rolland"), [George Bernard Shaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw "George Bernard Shaw"), [Lion Feuchtwanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_Feuchtwanger "Lion Feuchtwanger") and [Thomas Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mann "Thomas Mann") are the brightest writers from the gallery of critical realists.

Lukács notes that realistic art is usually found either in highly developed countries or in countries undergoing a period of rapid socio-economic development, yet it is possible that backward countries often give rise to advanced literature precisely because of their backwardness, which they seek to overcome by artistic means. Lukács (together with [Lifshitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Lifshitz "Mikhail Lifshitz")) polemicized against the "vulgar sociological" thesis then dominant in Soviet literary criticism. The "vulgar sociologists" (associated with the former [RAPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Association_of_Proletarian_Writers "Russian Association of Proletarian Writers")) prioritized [class origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class "Social class") as the most important determinant for an artist and his work, categorizing artists and artistic genres as "feudal", "bourgeois", "petty-bourgeois" etc. Lukács and Lifshitz sought to prove that such great artists as [Dante](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Aligheri "Dante Aligheri"), [Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare "William Shakespeare"), [Cervantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_Cervantes "Miguel de Cervantes"), [Goethe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe "Johann Wolfgang von Goethe") or [Tolstoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy "Leo Tolstoy") were able to rise above their class worldview by grasping the [dialectic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectics "Dialectics") of individual and society in its totality and depicting their relations truthfully.

All [modernist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism_(art) "Modernism (art)") art – [avant-garde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avant-garde "Avant-garde"), [naturalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalism_(art) "Naturalism (art)"), [expressionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressionism "Expressionism"), [surrealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism "Surrealism"), etc. – is the opposite of realism. This is [decadent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decadence "Decadence") art, examples of which are the works of [Kafka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka "Franz Kafka"), [Joyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce "James Joyce"), [Musil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Musil "Robert Musil"), [Beckett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Beckett "Samuel Beckett"), etc. The main shortcoming of modernism, which predicts its inevitable defeat, is the inability to perceive the totality and carry out the act of mediation. One cannot blame the writer for describing loneliness, but one must show it in such a way that it is clear to everyone: human loneliness is an inevitable consequence of [capitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism") social relations. Whereas in Kafka we meet with "ontological solitariness", depicted as a permanent situation of man and a universal value. In this regard, Kafka stops at the description of the phenomenon, given directly, he is not able to rise to the totality, which alone can reveal the meaning of loneliness. Therefore, Kafka acts like the naturalists. In order for the image of chaos, confusion and fear of the modern world and man to be realistic, the writer must show the social roots that generate all these phenomena. And if, like Joyce, one depicts the spiritual world and the sense of time of a person in a state of absolute decay, without bothering to search for reasons and prospects for a way out, then the writer gives a false image of the world, and his works must be recognized as immature.

So, modernism is deprived of a historical perspective, tying the person to positions and situations that are not really historically and socially determined. Modernism transforms such situations into transcendental qualities. The great images of great literature, [Achilles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles "Achilles") and [Werther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sorrows_of_Young_Werther "The Sorrows of Young Werther"), [Oedipus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus "Oedipus") and [Tom Joad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grapes_of_Wrath "The Grapes of Wrath"), [Antigone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigone_(Sophocles_play) "Antigone (Sophocles play)") and [Anna Karenina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karenina "Anna Karenina"), are social beings, for [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") already noted that man is a social being. And the heroes of modernist literature are torn out of ties with society and history. Narrative becomes purely "subjective", the animal in man is opposed to the social in him, which corresponds to [Heidegger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger "Martin Heidegger")'s denial and condemnation of society as something impersonal. He wrote:

> Literary and art history is a mass graveyard where many artists of talent rest in deserved oblivion because they neither sought nor found any association to the problems of advancing humanity and did not set themselves on the right side in the vital struggle between health and decay.<sup id="cite_ref-69"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-69">[65]</a></sup>

Barbara Stackman maintains that, for Lukács, decadents are decadent not because they depict illness and decay, but because they do not recognize the existence of health, of the social sphere that would reunite the alienated writer to the progressive forces of history. Sickness, then, is a reactionary mode of insertion into the [class struggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_struggle "Class struggle"); sickness, writes Lukács, "produces a complete overturning of values." Though "sick art" may have its dialectical moment in the sun (Lukács cites only _[Antigone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigone_(Sophocles_play) "Antigone (Sophocles play)")_ as an example where that which is declining may even appear as human greatness and purity), it is destined for the dust heap of history, while "healthy art" is a "reflection of the lasting truth of human relationships."<sup id="cite_ref-70"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-70">[66]</a></sup>

On the other hand, [socialist realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_realism "Socialist realism") is recognized as the highest stage in the development of literature:

> The prospect of socialist realism is, of course, the struggle for socialism. Socialist realism differs from critical realism not only in that it is based on a specific socialist perspective, but also in that it uses this perspective to describe from within the forces that work in favor of [socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism "Socialism"). Critical realists have more than once described the political struggle of our time and depicted heroes – socialists and communists. But only socialist realists describe such heroes from the inside, thus identifying them with the forces of progress. The greatness of socialist realism lies in the fact that the historical totality, directed towards communism, becomes clear as daylight in any fragment of a given work.<sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-71">[67]</a></sup>

In 1938, in his work [Realism in the Balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_in_the_Balance "Realism in the Balance"), a [polemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polemic "Polemic") against [Ernst Bloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Bloch "Ernst Bloch"), [Walter Benjamin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin "Walter Benjamin"), [Bertolt Brecht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertolt_Brecht "Bertolt Brecht") and [Theodor Adorno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Adorno "Theodor Adorno"), Lukács explained the lack of modernism in the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") in this way:

> The more the domination of the proletariat strengthened, the more deeply and comprehensively socialism penetrated the economy of the Soviet Union, the wider and deeper the cultural revolution embraced the working masses, the stronger and more hopelessly "avant-garde" art was pushed out by an ever more conscious realism. The decline of expressionism is ultimately a consequence of the maturity of the revolutionary masses.<sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-72">[68]</a></sup>

No less typical is his article "Propaganda or Partisanship?", in which he polemicizes against the definition of socialist art as "tendentious." Literature, in his opinion, should not be biased, but only "party-spirited" in the essence of taking the side of the class that is objectively progressive in the given historical moment. Tendentious literature eclectically connects "pure art" with politically alien elements brought in from outside. But such a program, which [Franz Mehring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Mehring "Franz Mehring") once defended, means "the primacy of form over content" and contrasts the aesthetic and political elements of the work. This understanding of art, Lukács says, is [Trotskyist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trotskyism "Trotskyism").<sup id="cite_ref-73"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-73">[69]</a></sup>

Lukács' defense of socialist realism contained a critique of [Stalinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalinism "Stalinism") and a condemnation of most of the party-propagandistic Soviet literature of the 1930s and 1940s (which was based on [Andrei Zhdanov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Zhdanov "Andrei Zhdanov")'s doctrine of "conflictless art" and which Lukács dismissively called "illustrative" literature) as a distortion of true socialist realism. He acknowledged that Stalinism suffered from a lack of "mediation" in the field of cultural policy. Instead of describing the real conflicts of the life of socialist society, Stalinist literature turned into bare schemes and abstractions, describing the general truths of theory and in no way "mediating" them with images taken from reality. The specificity of art was forgotten, and it turned into an instrument of agitation. Schematic optimism has spread in place of the historical. The heroes did not represent any of the typical qualities of the new society. [Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin")'s article "Party Organization and Party Literature", which, as [Nadezhda Krupskaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadezhda_Krupskaya "Nadezhda Krupskaya") said, dealt only with political literature, turned into a rule of artistic activity and its evaluation.

Despite all this criticism, Lukács never changed his basic conviction: socialist realism represents a "fundamentally" and "historically" higher stage in the development of art than all its predecessors.

The most surprising product of Lukács' discourse on socialist realism is his articles on [Alexander Solzhenitsyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Solzhenitsyn "Alexander Solzhenitsyn"), whom he considered to be the greatest "[plebeian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plebeians "Plebeians") realist" writer of the twentieth century. Lukács welcomed the appearance of the writer's short stories and novellas as the first sign of the renaissance of socialist realism, since Solzhenitsyn, in describing camp life in _[A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Day_in_the_Life_of_Ivan_Denisovich "A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich")_, depicts everyday events as a symbol of an entire era. Nor is Solzhenitsyn a naturalist, since he refers the events described to the socio-historical totality and does not seek to restore capitalism in Russia. According to Lukács, Solzhenitsyn criticizes Stalinism from a plebeian, and not from a communist point of view. And if he does not overcome this weakness, then his artistic talent will decrease.<sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-74">[70]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-75"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs#cite_note-75">[71]</a></sup>
