## There’s a quarter of the general population with a dominant structural thinking preference who are almost constantly in a minor state of neurological discomfort in work environments.

Structural thinkers require high-level sequence and order and it’s actually quite rare that that they’re spoken to in a way that works for their brain. 

For those of us who don’t have a structural thinking preference, we need to learn to organize our thinking and maintain sequence when we speak. It’s not easy to do but the outcome is absolutely worth it. A quarter of our audience will be in a state of neurological comfort, receptive to our input and ideas.

"Structural thinking.
This is another rational thinking preference.
And the idea behind this is this is people
who are very good at organizing information
into a sequence and order.
What does that mean?
We need to give them sequence and order.
So it sounds so obvious in hindsight,
but for a lot of us who don't have a structural thinking
preference, this is actually quite illuminating
to recognize that we need to provide explicit sequence
when we speak.
So if you say you're gonna talk about three things,
you need to talk about three things.
If you say you're gonna be talking for 20 minutes,
you need to talk for 20 minutes, not 22, not 21, 20.
Now you can go less, you just can't go more.
So the idea is time and sequence and order
are incredibly important.
If you provide sequence and order to structural thinkers,
their brains can relax.
When someone is neurologically comfortable,
they're much more open to influence and input.
This is where it gets very exciting to realize
that we can create environments
that work for people's brains."
