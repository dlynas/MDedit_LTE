From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

**The purpose of a system is what it does** (**POSIWID**) is a [systems thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking "Systems thinking") [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic "Heuristic") coined by [Stafford Beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer "Stafford Beer"),<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup> who observed that there is "no point in claiming that the purpose of a system is to do what it constantly fails to do."<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> The term is widely used by [systems theorists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory "Systems theory"), and is generally invoked to counter the notion that the purpose of a system can be read from the intentions of those who [design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_design "Systems design"), operate, or promote it. When a system's [side effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect "Side effect") or [unintended consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences "Unintended consequences") reveal that its behavior is poorly understood, then the POSIWID perspective can balance political understandings of system behavior with a more straightforwardly [descriptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive "Descriptive") view.

## Origins of the term\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Origins of the term")\]

[Stafford Beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer "Stafford Beer") coined the term POSIWID and used it many times in public addresses. In his address to the [University of Valladolid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Valladolid "University of Valladolid"), Spain, in October 2001, he said:<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup>

> According to the [cybernetician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetician "Cybernetician"), the purpose of a system is what it does. This is a basic [dictum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictum "Dictum"). It stands for bald fact, which makes a better starting point in seeking understanding than the familiar attributions of good intention, prejudices about expectations, [moral judgment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_judgment "Moral judgment"), or sheer ignorance of circumstances.

## Uses\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Uses")\]

From a [cybernetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics "Cybernetics") perspective, [complex systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_systems "Complex systems") are not controllable by simple notions of management, and interventions in a system can best be understood by looking at how they affect observed system behavior. The term is used in many other fields as well, including biology<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> and [management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management "Management").<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Whereas a cybernetician may apply the principle to the results inexorably produced by the mechanical dynamics of an activity system, a management scientist may apply it to the results produced by the self-interest of actors who play roles in a business or other institution.
