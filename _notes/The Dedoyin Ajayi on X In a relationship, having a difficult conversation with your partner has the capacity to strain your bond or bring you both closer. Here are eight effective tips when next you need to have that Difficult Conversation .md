In a relationship, having a difficult conversation with your partner has the capacity to strain your bond or bring you both closer. Here are eight effective tips when next you need to have that Difficult Conversation 



1\. ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT THE CONVERSATION IS DIFFICULT e.g: “I know this is hard for you to express, but please continue” or “I understand your reluctance about addressing this issue, but we can walk through this together. Tell me how you feel”

2\. VALIDATE THEIR OPINION WHEN THEY EVENTUALLY SPEAK Don’t jump into defense mode!! They’ll trust you less with their feelings if you do that. Start with “I see how that hurt you and I get your point. Here’s what I actually meant though…”

3\. DO NOT INTERRUPT EACH OTHER I honestly wish I could emphasize this one over and over again. Your lack of capacity to let your partner finish what they’re saying is coming from a place of selfishness. Tame your response reflexes and let them land!!

4\. DO NOT TALK FOR TOO LONG Your partner would never look forward to resolving issues or facing difficult conversations with you if you have the habit of turning it into a lecture. Learn to be precise in your delivery so they don’t lose interest altogether.

5\. ALWAYS GO FOR ACTION POINTS Ask them what they would love you to have done differently or viceversa. Never leave a difficult conversation without talking about what you’re both going to be doing differently or more effectively.

6\. LEARN TO ADJOURN WHEN THINGS GET TOO HEATED It’s okay to leave a conversation mudflow and adjourn till you both are calmer. One of you should always be able to say “this is getting heated and we’re here to address this issue, not start a fight. Can we continue later?”

7\. APOLOGIZE IF YOU HAVE TO “I’m sorry you felt that way” “I’m sorry I made you feel that way” Never finish your apology with a “BUT”!!! You neutralize the sincerity and effect of your apology. Give them the closure without ruining it with a counter accusation.

8\. THANK EACH OTHER FOR HAVING THE CONVERSATION E.g “ thank you for sharing your feelings/needs /thoughts. I’m glad we were able to address this” Rinse and Repeat, till you both get better and better and say bye to the drama in your relationship. ‘Dedoyin

Quote

Some people aren’t good at asking for help because they’re so used to being “the helper”. Their favorite sentence is “I’ll figure it out on my own. I don’t wanna bother anyone”. It’s called self reliance. Unfortunately, self reliance is equivalent to self abandonment.

Parents, do not make your first-born children overly responsible for their younger siblings. They grow up too fast and their childhood is compromised. The impact on their cognitive process is not healthy. A lot of first-borns grow up not knowing how to ask for help. It's sad.
