## What would be the most empirically grounded way to rehabilitate racists? I am not asking about violent, far-right extremists.

> Oftentimes I hear that well, bigotry is a result of a person's environment, and that you have to change their material conditions, etc.. but, that takes decades and requires you to rely on the government to do it, which feels a bit hopeless. If someone were to create a strategy to make faster change, what would be the most pragmatic and evidence-based approach to this topic?

Most of the stuff I've seen seems to be: "they have to go on a personal journey of transformation and growth" or "They need to spend time in an environment with people who're different" - which is fine, but still seems reliant on luck and your environment. is there anything more rigorous than this on this topic? My impression from researching psychology at least is that there isn't and that it's all up in the air, is that correct?

	Exposure to the group they're racist against. Racism is often rooted in ignorance and false notions about the race. Getting to actually know people of that race and having that first hand experience will show them that they were wrong. People figuring out that they were wrong themselves is generally going to be more effective than just telling them that they're wrong. 

	The best way to do this on a large scale is to promote multiculturalism, diversity, and inclusion. Working to fix economic disparities will also help increase the likelihood of different groups living, working, and going to school together. This takes time and there will be people who are unfortunately left out and get stuck in a bubble that lacks diversity.

		some of the most racist people I've met got that way by living amongst the people they hate.. they could articulate with impressive precision all the things that piss them off about the day to day experiences with certain cultures and how those things directly affect their quality of life. and if you believe the ones who werent born into it they say they werent racist until being immersed (just my own anecdotal experiences arguing with racist people from my own admittedly privileged position)

			I don't think exposure is 100% effective. Just because it doesn't work on all people doesn't mean it doesn't work. For those it doesn't work with, there may be other methods we could try such as education about the lack of biological differences between races, the history of racism, how culture develops, etc.

			* 🟦 **[ghu79421](https://www.reddit.com/user/ghu79421)** ⬆️ 22 _(2024-03-17 10:58:30)_

				From what I've read, exposure is much more effective if it happens in a context like a positive work environment in which people work towards common goals, they feel they're respected, and they feel that other people will take their concerns seriously. It also helps if there is relative economic equality and people feel like they can make progress toward financial goals. I think some studies show that explicitly teaching mindfulness skills can reduce prejudice if the person wants to reduce his or her feelings of prejudice or negative associations.
				
				I think probably explicitly teaching people how culture and cultural differences develop and how racism develops + reasons why biological anthropologists reject the biological existence of race would help.
				
				Demeaning, oppressive, or discriminatory behavior is often based on subconscious associations and ideology. Explicitly teaching people how to approach a situation in a different way often works, I think, like if you can clearly define sexual harassment as a behavior rather than arguing with people about their intentions or making additional assumptions about why a specific person might be predisposed to engage in a behavior. It's more effective if you can demonstrate that there's a different way to behave and approach a situation rather than just saying you think something is bad (EDIT: Obviously, I'm not arguing that people shouldn't be punished for egregious behavior, I'm talking more about something like behavior that's relatively minor or bystander attitudes, and more on the level of attitudes/beliefs and well-meaning misguided behavior than "those people" who are being assholes on purpose).

			That makes some sense - though in my experience what I see is more, they have annoying experiences but utilize subconscious beliefs or uninformed/ignorant ideas to make sense of their experiences. Where I am from there is a /ton/ of casual bigotry, and everyone can spend ages moaning about other groups and so on, but the actual logic and the conclusions drawn are always coming from a place of ignorance and total irrationality.

				>There's a lot of similarities between inner city culture and trailer park culture. Yet most of the time inner city culture gets labeled and trailer park doesn't.
				
				I dont know if that's fair, trailer parks are famously judged as hotbeds for domestic violence, crime, animal abuse, drugs, etc.. I find it hard to imagine anyone who understands the prejudices of inner city communities wouldnt also understand the same about trailer parks and apply the labels appropriately if not unevenly.

					I was going to say, my immediate thought reading ‘inner city’ was of a nice neighborhood whereas ‘trailer park’ did not evoke such positive feelings. 
					
					On a completely irrelevant sidenote, I discovered a trailer park in the city I live in the other day. Absolutely insane. Like 60 trailers tucked behind a bunch of houses and apartment buildings. I drive past it at least fifteen if not sixteen times a week.

			* 🟦 **[Chr3356](https://www.reddit.com/user/Chr3356)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-03-21 04:35:50)_

				They both get labeled the same the main difference is the trailer parks are often relatively rural compared to the inner city so their crimes generally don't extend past the park because there isn't anything close by and thus don't gain much outside attention

			* 🟦 **[Dry_Communication188](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dry_Communication188)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-03-21 19:32:25)_

				Having had my taste of both urban culture and trailer park adjacent, I'd say it's the opposite. Trailer park trash is a phrase for a reason -- because poor trailer park families are looked at with disgust. The city will always look down on the country and vice versa.
				
				Just like you can see the trailer park at a glance, you can see skin color, and skin color was/has been associated for thousands of years of monke-brain-survival games with different culture. Humans have always been tribal. We're fighting that.
				
				Tribalism didn't evolve out of nothing. It used to be adaptive, because we didn't have countries, laws, or police to defend us if those different people were assholes. It was fight or flee. And if we had to live together, that too presented problems. Who was in, who was out.
				
				People like to fit in. They fear people who are different, because they might ostracize them. If psychology has taught us anything, it's that ostracism is a pain much like death.
				
				The only way you're going to un-racist someone is if they have to live with, work with, and rely on people who are different. If you can limit the amount of ostracism that person experiences for themselves being different, that will also tamp down on the need to defend themselves against the other.
				
				And it goes both ways. If you're going to teach one to tolerate the other successfully, they also have to experience tolerance. Otherwise, they're going to kick at the goads.

			I wonder if we were to separate race and culture. There are things that different cultures do that does seem to warrant criticism, but to do so it is immediately racists. There are bad ideas in every culture, but I do think if we let bad ideas be criticized it might help separate the race from different specific cultures. It is a sticky thing though for sure. As a white person that started seasoning my food only a few years ago…I gotta admit there is a trend and better tasting food is better-to end on a more lighthearted note

			The army was what got me realizing  the class struggle I shared with African Americans. And how their upbringing was so similar to mine. But before I saw them as the enemy. And many people back in my hood do too. These are the problems with diversity.  You throw in two groups together and they will compete and clash. 
			
			I would argue the opposite of multiculturalism , we have to push a singular culture everyone can fall under. That is what the Army did to somehow hold together such a diverse population. Civic American nationalism.

		During the first few years of living in NC I met a couple of guys who were best friends. They both grew up in the same general area of the state. The white guy grew up with a pretty racist dad, confederate flags around the house, being told to not have black friends, seeing his sisters be told that if they dated non-white guys they'd be disowned...What actually brought these two together and made them friends? Food. Turns out that grew up eating the same foods down to the names of the dishes. In comparing their grandmother's biscuit recipes everything was mostly the same. They also both enjoyed fishing, hunting  and weren't strangers to eating squirrels.

		I wonder about this. Simply having integration on a national level does not guarantee association on a personal level, and that personal association is what erodes negative stereotypes. Having intermittent, non-personal, occasionally adversarial contact on the other hand can create animosity. 
		
		I think the best method is not to force anyone to do anything except to act lawfully. The rest must be driven on a personal level. Forced personal association will be resented, and for good reason. People need to desire association with each other.

		How does banning people from various communities factor into that? 
		
		E.g. if you have someone saying something, say minorly racist but not overtly disruptive in an online community, is it better to ban them/push them out to make the community more comfortable, or keep them and be patient with their views and engage with them to change their mind?

		* 🟧 **[spiral_out13](https://www.reddit.com/user/spiral_out13)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-03-17 11:28:42)_

			Generally people have no way of knowing other's races in an online community (even in the uncommon event that people state their race, they can lie). If you're being exposed to people of other races but completely unaware of it, how would it possibly change your racist views?
			
			
			You could be exposed to new ideas and arguments online but that's not what I was referring to above. I think it's up to each individual online community to decide what type of place they want to be.

			* 🟦 **[venuswasaflytrap](https://www.reddit.com/user/venuswasaflytrap)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-03-17 12:04:53)_

				Well, there's a different question between normatively speaking is it better for a community to have a right to exclude people with bigoted views vs having the responsibility to help change those views vs would it even actually change those views.
				
				I'm not asking about the normative question of whether any given community *should* responsibility, but the latter question of whether it works or not.
				
				I've heard arguments that pushing people with bigoted views out of communities (online or otherwise) actually reduces bigotry as a whole, i.e. it sort of shames people into changing their views in a sense (I think?).
				
				But it strikes me as possible that a person banned or pushed out from a community is just as likely to become entrenched in those views rather than changing their minds out of shame, and possibly even find other people with the same views.
				
				The paper you link, while not directly addressing limitations of the medium of discussion (e.g. you and I don't know each other's race, gender sexual identity etc.), it still seems to imply that a person is more likely to change their views through integration rather than expulsion.
				
				Again I'm specifically asking which is more likely to work empirically. I totally understand the argument that it's not anyone's job to rehabilitate racists and that they shouldn't have to. But if the goal was to do that, empirically speaking, what is the best evidence for it?

					This is a super good question. Basically does cancel culture work? And I wish I had the answer but unfortunately, I don't think much research has been done to figure that out. I did find some interesting articles.

					https://onourmoon.com/cancel-culture-the-good-the-bad-its-impact-on-social-change/
					
					
					But they don't provide a complete picture. I think cancel culture or shaming works when it's in a smaller in-person setting but I don't think it works online (at least for issues like racism.) You can pretty much always find some community online that does agree with you. You may get ostracized from the ones that don't agree but that just gives you more time to find ones that do. And those communities often come with even worse stuff to radicalize people further.

						I guess the root of my question, is me seeing the political climate as it is now, in many countries, and wondering how so many people support such radical candidates. 
						
						My fear is that what’s happening is that people are being either explicitly forced out, or socially pressured out of communities, and then going to form their own communities, and the result is not a reduction in bigotry, but just a separation and possibly increase even.
						
						But I don’t have any empirical or scientific/statistical evidence to know whether this is or isn’t happening.

		Though the irony is that supposed anti-racists rarely possess any concrete understanding of racism, and hilariously demonstrate a complete ignorance of the contexts and specific confines under which it was discussed post WW2. The first step is for you to learn what racism actually means, instead of it being a generalized term applied incorrectly to culture. Perhaps the most common ignominy however is the ignorance of "correlation does not imply causation". Common accusations of racism fail in discerning whether the accused is attributing the race as the causative condition producing a certain denoted characteristic or quality.

It's quite dark unfortunately. There are definitely young idiots just parroting the idea who are well-meaning, but the people deep into the theory that spend their time militantly spreading and enforcing it are not good people unfortunately I've found.

	David McRaney, in his book *How Minds Change* https://www.davidmcraney.com/howmindschangehome looks at a several state-of-the-art persuasion methods that are showing strong empirical evidence for significant attitude change on such topics. Many of them suggest that a key is making people feel safe and comfortable that you are not attacking them in a debate format where you are trying to "win" but rather cooperating with them to explore their reasons. There are tips there for encouraging more metacognition, offering social support, and stimulating helpful motivating emotion through story-telling.  It's about enabling their brain to activate a deep processing learning mode, where it becomes possible to update our basic assumptions, rather than falling into a defensive superficial thinking mode where we automatically disregard evidence from our opponent.

This has been more or less what I've learnt as well from talking to and engaging with people that are problematic - it seems like establishing a sense of rapport and comfort/safety is critical, especially considering how many bigoted people seem to have some personals shit going on, and without it nothing seems to get done. Seems like an important ingredient for sure.

		I can confirm this can work. Not always of course, but yeah making a person feel judged and condemned is the fastest way to get them to retrench. I tried this on an anonymous troll last year. He came at me with insults and slurs (I'm LGBTQ not a PoC but same principle) and I just engaged him by asking questions, and at the end of our exchange I said "so you enjoy wandering the internet trying to see who you can hurt and degrade?" And he said "yep!" And I said "Well I can't stop you, but are you sure spending your time doing that is constructive and makes you happy?" He didn't respond for ten hours. The next day I woke up to a reply. He apologized for being cruel, talked about how his life sucks and he's really struggling right now and he thought being mean to people online would help, but it's just making him miserable.
		
		We have got to stop with the "one strike and you're a forever bigot" stuff. All it does is make them go "huh well I guess I'm a forever bigot, guess I'll join up." We need restorative practice, not punitive. As the number one truth you learn in therapy says, "Just because you did or said a bad thing doesn't mean you are bad."

			Great example, thanks for sharing!  It's not always easy to respond thoughtfully like you did when we feel attacked, instead of lashing back out, but it is way more effective and I think we get better at it the more we practice.

	With regard to immersion in other cultures affecting racism:

	I lived in Taiwan for many years. I remember a woman from Belarus complaining about Taiwanese culture - everything was pissing her off: the food, the drivers, the way they will fib in order to not upset you with the truth...

	My friend (her boyfriend) listened to her for a bit and said, "Don't you think that's kind of racist?"

	"Racist? What do you mean? I don't want to kill them."

	I'm not sure how you change racist attitudes when the racist believes they have shit all figured out.

	“While Brendan's experience is outside the norm, it's not without precedent. In the 1980s, for example, an acquaintance of early MDMA-assisted therapy practitioner Requa Greer administered the drug to a pilot who had grown up in a racist home and had inherited those views. The pilot had always accepted his bigoted way of thinking as being a normal, accurate reflection of the way things were. MDMA, however, "gave him a clear vision that unexamined racism was both wrong and mean," Greer says.

	Rare as they might be, stories such as these are worth examining for the implications they give about MDMA's potential ability to "influence a person's values and priorities", as de Wit and several co-authors wrote in a case study they published about Brendan in 2021 in the journal Biological Psychiatry. If "extremist views [are] fueled by fear, anger and cognitive biases", the researchers posed, "might these be targets of pharmacological intervention"?”

	This story arose from this study:

	There is an organization called Life After Hate that specializes in exactly that.  As all rehabilitation programs go, the individual first has to decide to seek treatment on their own.  Then it involves finding the root, processing misconceptions, etc.  It's basically a 12-step program, but for racism instead of substance abuse.

	I think you first need to define the racism you are trying to rehabilitate. You specify not "violent, far-right extremists" which suggests that you would be willing to rehabilitate violent far-left extremists, which I find interesting.  

	Anyway, what type of racism are we talking about? Is it someone who says "I won't date a black woman because I do not want mixed race kids." Which while bigoted, seems like a perfectly reasonable opinion to have about the type of person you decide to have children with. Are we talking about someone who goes and burns crosses on the lawns of certain races for intimidation?   

	The term racism has been so diluted with common use that it can mean anything from "Person I don't like" to "Orchestrator of Genocide"  

	If we are talking about someone with bigoted personal values, who otherwise does not visit harm on others, who are you to forcibly modify their beliefs? If someone chooses to date outside their race, they are not evil or hurting anyone, it is a choice they made about their own life.  

	If someone is intimidating others, causing property damage or violence, etc. Those are all already crimes and justice should be appropriately dispensed. Criminals of all forms should be dissuaded and punished, provided the laws that make them criminals are fair and just. This should be the model for any society

	Don't have much to add here since I agree with the top comment, however what will add is talking with racists is much easier when you talk in a way that assumes they are in good faith. 

	 For example, "the black people in this neighborhood are so loud" your response could be something like "Yes! We could use more loud in this world, don't you think?"

	This does nothing for explicitly racist people, as they hold distinguished hate. This is something that helps when talking to implicitly racist people who are afraid to say they are racist. When you make a true statement against racism, they agree with you without the fear that you are changing their mind or calling them a bad person.

	Common bonding activities. I grew up a racist and everyone I knew was a racist, more or less. We were culturally isolated and the few white kids I knew we mocked.

	What changed? A white kid moved into the neighborhood and challenged me to a game of basketball. I laughed... right up until he absolutely beat my ass. I got beat by a skinny ass white kid! Every day after that, we'd play. Before too long, I didn't think of white people like I had before.

	Just accept the.fact that someone somewhere wont like you for some reason. 

	The better question is why you would care so much?

	Changing the thinking or the behavior of individuals is unlikely to be succesful.  Racism is a systemic issue, and requires systemic changes to be reduced.  in this [paper](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C47&amp;q=ROUTES+OF+DAILY+PRACTICES%3A+FOOD%2C+CLOTHING+AND+LINGUISTIC+CHOICES+IN+THE+STUDY+OF+PLURALISM+IN+PRE-MODERN+MEDITERRANEAN+PORT+CITIES&amp;btnG=) ([summary article](https://cordis.europa.e[u/article](https://www.reddit.com/user/article)/id/429022-lessons-from-history-how-to-build-successful-multicultural-societies)), its argued that, where the political system encouraged pluralism and accepted foreigners, that immigrants felt more free to express their identity and eventually be accepted into the society.

	It depends on why they are racist.  If they are racist due to ignorance of other races just being around other people can help.  If they are racist due to an extreme negative event that might require therapy.  Also keep in mind how are you determining if someone is racist?
