After the [death of Muhammad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Muhammad "Death of Muhammad") in 632, a group of Muslims, who would come to be known as the [Sunnis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunnis "Sunnis"), believed that [Muhammad's successor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad%27s_successor "Muhammad's successor") as [caliph](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliph "Caliph") of the [Islamic community](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_community "Islamic community") should be [Abu Bakr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Bakr "Abu Bakr"), whereas a second group of Muslims, who would come to be known as the [Shias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shias "Shias"), believed that his successor should have been [Ali ibn Abi Talib](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali "Ali"). This dispute spread across various parts of the Muslim world, which eventually led to the [Battle of the Camel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Camel "Battle of the Camel") and [Battle of Siffin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Siffin "Battle of Siffin"). [Sectarianism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectarianism "Sectarianism") based on this historic dispute intensified greatly after the [Battle of Karbala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Karbala "Battle of Karbala"), in which [Husayn ibn Ali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husayn_ibn_Ali "Husayn ibn Ali") and some of his close partisans, including members and children of Muhammad's household ([Ahl al-Bayt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahl_al-Bayt "Ahl al-Bayt")), were killed by the ruling Umayyad Caliph [Yazid I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazid_I "Yazid I"), and the outcry for revenge divided the early Islamic community, albeit disproportionately, into two groups, the Sunni and the Shia. This is known today as the _Islamic schism_.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>

The present demographic breakdown between the two denominations is difficult to assess and varies by source, with most approximations stating that roughly 90% of [the world's Muslims](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_by_country "Islam by country") are [Sunni](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni "Sunni") and 10% are [Shia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia "Shia"); with about 85% of Shias belonging to the [Twelver](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelver_Shi%27ism "Twelver Shi'ism") tradition, and the rest divided between other small groups.<sup id="cite_ref-Sunni_2-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Sunni-2">[2]</a></sup> Sunnis are a majority in almost all Muslim communities around the world. Shia make up the majority of the citizen population in [Iran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran"), [Iraq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq "Iraq"), and [Azerbaijan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan "Azerbaijan"), as well as being a minority in [Pakistan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan "Pakistan"), [Lebanon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon "Lebanon"), [Saudi Arabia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia "Saudi Arabia"), [Syria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria "Syria"), [Yemen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen "Yemen"), [Nigeria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria "Nigeria"), [Afghanistan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan "Afghanistan"), [Chad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad "Chad"), [Turkey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey "Turkey"), [Bahrain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain "Bahrain") and [Kuwait](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait "Kuwait").<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Pew2009Web_14-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Pew2009Web-14">[14]</a></sup> Today there are differences in religious practice, traditions, and customs, often related to [jurisprudence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiqh "Fiqh"). Although all Muslim groups consider the [Quran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran "Quran") to be divine, Sunni and Shia have different opinions on _[hadith](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith "Hadith")_.

In recent years, the **Sunni–Shia divide** has been increasingly marked by conflict.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> The aftermath of the [1979 Iranian Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution "Iranian Revolution"), which reconfigured Iran into a theocratic Islamic republic governed by [high-ranking Shia clerics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayatollah "Ayatollah"), had far-reaching consequences across the Muslim world. The [Iraq war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War "Iraq War") further influenced regional power dynamics, solidifying Shi'ites as the predominant force in Iraq. Iran's ascent as a [regional power](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_power "Regional power") in the Middle East, along with shifts in politics and demographics in [Lebanon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon "Lebanon"), heightened concerns among Sunni nations about potential challenges to Sunni–Arab hegemony.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> Recent years have witnessed the [Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Saudi_Arabia_proxy_conflict "Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict"), as well as [sectarian violence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectarian_violence_among_Muslims "Sectarian violence among Muslims") from Pakistan to [Yemen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen "Yemen"), which became a major element of friction throughout the [Middle East](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East "Middle East") and [South Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia "South Asia").<sup id="cite_ref-auto_17-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-auto-17">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-scribd.com_18-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-scribd.com-18">[18]</a></sup> Tensions between communities have intensified during power struggles, such as the [Bahraini uprising](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahraini_uprising_(2011%E2%80%93present) "Bahraini uprising (2011–present)"), the [Iraqi Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_civil_war_(2006%E2%80%932008) "Iraqi civil war (2006–2008)"), the [Syrian Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War "Syrian Civil War"),<sup id="cite_ref-Nasr,_Vali_2006,_p.106_19-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Nasr,_Vali_2006,_p.106-19">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Civil_War_20-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Civil_War-20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> as well as the [War in Iraq (2013–2017)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Iraq_(2013%E2%80%932017) "War in Iraq (2013–2017)"), during which the self-styled [Islamic State of Iraq and Syria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_Syria "Islamic State of Iraq and Syria") launched a [persecution of Shia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Shias_by_the_Islamic_State "Persecution of Shias by the Islamic State").

## Numbers [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Numbers")

[Sunni Muslims](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Muslim "Sunni Muslim") are the vast majority of Muslims in most Muslim communities in [Central Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Central_Asia "Islam in Central Asia") (including [China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_China "Islam in China")), [Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Europe "Islam in Europe") (including [Russia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Russia "Islam in Russia") and the [Balkans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan "Balkan")), [South Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_South_Asia "Islam in South Asia"), [Southeast Asia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia "Southeast Asia"), [Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Africa "Islam in Africa"), the [Arab World](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_World "Arab World"), [Turkey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey "Turkey") and among [Muslims in the United States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims_in_the_United_States "Muslims in the United States").

## Differences in beliefs and practices [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Differences in beliefs and practices")

### Successors of Muhammad [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Successors of Muhammad")

### Mahdi [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Mahdi")

The [Mahdi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahdi "Mahdi") is the prophesied redeemer of Islam. While Shia and Sunnis differ on the nature of the Mahdi, many members of both groups<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> believe that the Mahdi will appear at the end of the world to bring about a perfect and just Islamic society.

In Shia Islam, "the Mahdi symbol has developed into a powerful and central religious idea."<sup id="cite_ref-Muslim_World_2004_p.421_41-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Muslim_World_2004_p.421-41">[41]</a></sup> [Twelvers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelvers "Twelvers") believe the Mahdi will be [Muhammad al-Mahdi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Mahdi "Muhammad al-Mahdi"), [the twelfth Imam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Imams "The Twelve Imams") returned from [the Occultation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Occultation "The Occultation"), where he has been hidden by Allah since 874. Mainstream Sunnis' beliefs are somewhat different: The Mahdi forms an important component of Sunni eschatology, his appearance being considered the last of the minor signs of the Day of Judgment before its major signs. They believe the Mahdi will be a descendant of Muhammad named Muhammad, and will revive the faith.

### Hadith [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Hadith")

The Shia accept some of the same _[hadiths](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith "Hadith")_ of Muhammad used by Sunnis as part of the _[sunnah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunnah "Sunnah")_ and the basis of divine law and religious practice. In addition, they consider the sayings of _[Ahl al-Bayt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahl_al-Bayt "Ahl al-Bayt")_ that are not attributed directly to Muhammad as hadiths. Shia do not accept many Sunni hadiths unless they are also recorded in Shia sources or the methodology of how they were recorded can be proven. Also, some Sunni-accepted hadiths—for example by Aisha or [Abu Hurairah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Hurairah#Shi'a_view "Abu Hurairah")—are less favored by Shia (Aisha's opposed Ali and [Abu Hurairah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Hurairah#Shi'a_view "Abu Hurairah") is considered an enemy of Ali and according to Shia, only a Muslim for four years of his life before Muhammad's death. Although he accompanied Muhammad for only four years, he managed to record ten times as many hadiths as Abu Bakr and [Ali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali "Ali") each).<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup>

### Shiism and Sufism [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Shiism and Sufism")

Shiism and [Sufism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufism "Sufism") are said to share a number of hallmarks: Belief in an inner meaning to the Quran, special status for some mortals (saints for Sufi, Imams for Shia), as well as veneration of [Ali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali "Ali") and Muhammad's family.<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup>

### Pillars of faith [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Pillars of faith")

The [Five Pillars of Islam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Pillars_of_Islam "Five Pillars of Islam") ([Arabic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): أركان الإسلام) is the term given to the five duties incumbent on every Muslim, and are held by both Sunni and Shia. These duties are _[Shahada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahada "Shahada")_ (profession of faith), _[Salat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salat "Salat")_ (prayers), _[Zakāt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak%C4%81t "Zakāt")_ (giving of alms), _[Sawm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawm "Sawm")_ (fasting, specifically during [Ramadan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan_(calendar_month) "Ramadan (calendar month)")) and _[Hajj](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj "Hajj")_ (pilgrimage to [Mecca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca "Mecca")). In addition, [Shia theology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology_of_Twelvers "Theology of Twelvers") has two concepts that define religion as a whole. There are Roots of Religion (_Usūl al-Dīn_) and Branches of Religion (_[Furu al Din](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancillaries_of_the_Faith "Ancillaries of the Faith")_).

### Practices [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Practices")

Many distinctions can be made between Sunnis and Shiaīs through observation alone:

#### Salat [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Salat")

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tehran_Friday_prayer_-_16_March_2018_(13961225000386636568071894544919_84859).jpg)

A Sunni Muslim (left) beside a Shia Muslim (right) showing different ways of holding arms during 16 March 2018 Tehran Friday prayer, [Iran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran").

When prostrating during ritual prayer known as _[Salah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salah "Salah")_ (one of the five pillars of Islam), Shia place their forehead onto a piece of naturally occurring material—most often a clay tablet (_mohr_), soil (_[turbah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbah "Turbah")_) from [Karbala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karbala "Karbala"), the place where Hussein ibn Ali was martyred—instead of directly onto a prayer rug.

There are five salat prayers at different times of the day, but unlike Sunni, some Shia combine two sets of the prayers, (1+2+2, i.e. _[fajr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fajr "Fajr")_ on its own, _[Dhuhr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhuhr "Dhuhr")_ with _[Asr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asr "Asr")_ and _[Maghrib](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghrib "Maghrib")_ with _[Isha'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isha%27 "Isha'")_) praying five times a day but with a very small break in between the prayer, instead of five prayers with some gap between them as required by Sunni [schools of law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madh%27hab "Madh'hab").<sup id="cite_ref-islamfortoday2007_28-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-islamfortoday2007-28">[28]</a></sup>

Shia and the followers of the Sunni [Maliki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maliki "Maliki") school hold their hands at their sides during prayer while Sunnis of other schools cross their arms (right over left) and clasp their hands;<sup id="cite_ref-Nasr,_Vali_2006,_p.43_44-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Nasr,_Vali_2006,_p.43-44">[44]</a></sup> it is commonly held by Sunni scholars (especially of the [Maliki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maliki "Maliki") school) that either is acceptable.<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup>

#### Mut'ah and Misyar [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Mut'ah and Misyar")

The Twelver branch of Shia Islam<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> permits _[Nikah mut‘ah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikah_mut%E2%80%98ah "Nikah mut‘ah")_<sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup>—fixed-term temporary marriage. The practice is not allowed within the Sunni community, nor within the Ismaili Shia or the Zaidi Shia, who consider it planned and agreed fornication rather than marriage. These schools believe that Mutah was permitted until Umar [forbade it](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith_of_Umar%27s_speech_of_forbidding_Mut%27ah "Hadith of Umar's speech of forbidding Mut'ah") during his rule. (Mutah is not the same as _[Misyar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikah_Misyar "Nikah Misyar")_ marriage or _'Arfi_ marriage, which has no date of expiration and is permitted by some Sunnis. A Misyar marriage differs from a conventional [Islamic marriage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_in_Islam "Marriage in Islam") in that the man does not have financial responsibility of the woman by her own free will. The man can divorce the woman whenever he wants to in a Misyar marriage.)<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup>

#### Hijab and dress [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Hijab and dress")

Both Sunni and Shia women wear the _[hijab](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab "Hijab")_. Devout women of the Shia traditionally wear black as do some Sunni women in the [Persian Gulf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf "Persian Gulf"). Some Shia religious leaders also wear a black robe. Mainstream Shia and Sunni women wear the _[hijab](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab "Hijab")_ differently. Some Sunni scholars emphasize covering of all body including the face in public whereas some scholars exclude the face from hijab. Shia believe that the hijab must cover around the perimeter of the face and up to the chin.<sup id="cite_ref-Hijab_55-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Hijab-55">[55]</a></sup> Like Sunnis, some Shia women, such as those in Iran and Iraq, use their hand to hold the black _[chador](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chador "Chador")_, in order to cover their faces when in public.

#### Given names [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Given names")

Muslim are often named after famous early Muslims, so that given names of Shia are often derived from the names of [Ahl al-Bayt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahl_al-Bayt "Ahl al-Bayt"). In particular, the names Fatema, Zaynab, Ali, Abbas, Hassan and Hussain are disproportionately common among Shia;<sup id="cite_ref-Nasr,_Vali_2006,_p.43_44-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Nasr,_Vali_2006,_p.43-44">[44]</a></sup> while Umar, Uthman, Abu Bakr, Aisha are very common among Sunnis, but very rare—if not virtually absent—among Shia.<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup>

#### Pilgrimages [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Pilgrimages")

The pilgrimage to [Mecca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca "Mecca"), known as _[hajj](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj "Hajj")_, is one of the pillars of Islam for both Sunnis and Shi‘ites, but Shia have many other [holy sites](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiest_sites_in_Shia_Islam "Holiest sites in Shia Islam") they make pilgrimages (_[ziyarat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziyarat "Ziyarat")_) to.

## Early and pre-modern history [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Early and pre-modern history")

The [origin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_Shia_Islam "Origin of Shia Islam") of Shia Islam initially arose in response to the [succession to Muhammad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_to_Muhammad "Succession to Muhammad"), and whether [Ali ibn Abi Talib](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_ibn_Abi_Talib "Ali ibn Abi Talib") or a more experienced member of the [Quraysh tribe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quraysh_tribe "Quraysh tribe") should succeed. The concept of Shi'ism further crystallized around events at the [Battle of Karbala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Karbala "Battle of Karbala") (680 CE), where [Husayn ibn Ali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husayn_ibn_Ali "Husayn ibn Ali"), the son of Ali and grandson of Muhammad, was killed alongside many of his supporters. Thus a political split became a far more personal one, marked by [blood feud](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_feud "Blood feud"), and a cause for further divergence.

Even so, by the thirteenth to fourtheenth century, Sunni and Shiite practices remained highly intertwined and figures today commonly associated with Shia Islam, such as Ali and [Jafar al-Sadiq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jafar_al-Sadiq "Jafar al-Sadiq"), played an almost universal role for Muslim believers to understand [the unseen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ghaib "Al-Ghaib") (_Al-Ghaib_).<sup id="cite_ref-Peacock_60-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Peacock-60">[60]</a></sup>

### Abbasid era [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Abbasid era")

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Destruction_of_the_Tomb_of_Husain_at_Kerbela.jpg)

Destruction of the Tomb of [Husayn ibn Ali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husayn_ibn_Ali "Husayn ibn Ali") at [Karbala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karbala "Karbala"), condemned in a [Mughal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire "Mughal Empire") era manuscript.

The [Umayyads](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_Caliphate "Umayyad Caliphate") were overthrown in 750 by a new dynasty, the [Abbasids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate "Abbasid Caliphate"). The first Abbasid caliph, [As-Saffah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/As-Saffah "As-Saffah"), recruited Shia support in his campaign against the Umayyads by emphasising his blood relationship to Muhammad's household through descent from his uncle, [‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%80%98Abbas_ibn_%E2%80%98Abd_al-Muttalib "‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib").<sup id="cite_ref-61"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup> The Shia also believe that he promised them that the Caliphate, or at least religious authority, would be vested in the Shia Imam. As-Saffah assumed both the temporal and religious mantle of Caliph himself. He continued the Umayyad dynastic practice of succession, and his brother [al-Mansur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Mansur "Al-Mansur") succeeded him in 754.

[Ja'far al-Sadiq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ja%27far_al-Sadiq "Ja'far al-Sadiq"), the sixth Shia Imam, died during al-Mansur's reign, and there were claims that he was murdered on the orders of the caliph.<sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup> (However, Abbasid persecution of Islamic scholars was not restricted to the Shia. [Abū Ḥanīfa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab%C5%AB_%E1%B8%A4an%C4%ABfa "Abū Ḥanīfa"), for example, was imprisoned by al-Mansur and tortured.)

Shia sources further claim that by the orders of the tenth Abbasid caliph, [al-Mutawakkil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Mutawakkil "Al-Mutawakkil"), the tomb of the third Imam, Hussein ibn Ali in Karbala, was completely demolished,<sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup> and Shia were sometimes beheaded in groups, buried alive, or even placed alive within the walls of government buildings still under construction.<sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup>

The Shia believe that their community continued to live for the most part in hiding and followed their religious life secretly without external manifestations.<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup>

### Iraq [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Iraq")

Many Shia Iranians migrated to what is now Iraq in the 16th century. "It is said that when modern Iraq was formed, some of the population of Karbala was Iranian". In time, these immigrants adopted the Arabic language and Arab identity, but their origin has been used to "unfairly cast them as lackeys of Iran".<sup id="cite_ref-66"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> However many of these Shia come from Sayyid families with origins in tribes from Iraq, Lebanon and Bahrain, one of said tribes being al-Musawi, and two prevalent families that are descended from it and lived in Iran for some time before settling in Iraq are the al-Qazwini and al-Shahristani families. Other Iraqi Shia are ethnic Arabs with roots in Iraq as deep as those of their Sunni counterparts.<sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup>

### Persia [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Persia")

[Shafi'i](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafi%27i "Shafi'i") Sunnism was the dominant form of Islam in most of Iran until rise of the [Safavid Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safavid_dynasty "Safavid dynasty") although a significant undercurrent of [Ismailism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismailism "Ismailism") and a very large minority of Twelvers were present all over Persia.

The Sunni hegemony did not undercut the Shia presence in Iran. The writers of [the Shia Four Books](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Books "The Four Books") were Iranian, as were many other scholars. According to [Morteza Motahhari](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morteza_Motahhari "Morteza Motahhari"):<sup id="cite_ref-Motahhari_68-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Motahhari-68">[68]</a></sup>

> The majority of Iranians turned to Shi'ism from the Safawid period onwards. Of course, it cannot be denied that Iran's environment was more favourable to the flourishing of the Shi'ism as compared to all other parts of the Muslim world. Shi'ism did not penetrate any land to the extent that it gradually could in Iran. With the passage of time, Iranians' readiness to practise Shi'ism grew day by day. Had Shi\`ism not been deeply rooted in the Iranian spirit, the Safawids (907–1145/1501–1732) would not have succeeded in converting Iranians to the Shi'i creed [Ahl al-Bayt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahl_al-Bayt "Ahl al-Bayt") sheerly by capturing political power.

#### Pre-Safavid [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Pre-Safavid")

The domination of the Sunni creed during the first nine Islamic centuries characterizes the religious history of Iran during this period. There were some exceptions to this general domination which emerged in the form of the Zaidis of [Tabaristan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabaristan "Tabaristan"), the [Buwayhid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buyid_dynasty "Buyid dynasty"), the rule of the [Sultan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan "Sultan") [Muhammad Khudabandah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96ljait%C3%BC "Öljaitü") (r. 1304–1316) and the [Sarbedaran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbadars "Sarbadars"). Nevertheless, apart from this domination there existed, firstly, throughout these nine centuries, Shia inclinations among many Sunnis of this land and, secondly, Twelver and Zaidi Shiism had prevalence in some parts of Iran. During this period, the Shia in Iran were nourished from [Kufa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kufa "Kufa"), [Baghdad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad "Baghdad") and later from [Najaf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najaf "Najaf") and [Al Hillah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hillah "Al Hillah").<sup id="cite_ref-69"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> Shia were dominant in Tabaristan, [Qom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qom "Qom"), [Kashan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashan "Kashan"), [Avaj](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avaj "Avaj") and [Sabzevar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabzevar "Sabzevar"). In many other areas the population of Shia and Sunni was mixed.

The first Zaidi state was established in [Daylaman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dailamites "Dailamites") and Tabaristan (northern Iran) in 864 by the [Alavids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alavids "Alavids");<sup id="cite_ref-70"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup> it lasted until the death of its leader at the hand of the [Samanids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samanids "Samanids") in 928. Roughly forty years later the state was revived in [Gilan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilan_Province "Gilan Province") (north-western Iran) and survived under Hasanid leaders until 1126. After which from the 12th–13th centuries, the Zaidis of Daylaman, Gilan and Tabaristan then acknowledge the Zaidi [Imams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imam "Imam") of Yemen or rival Zaidi Imams within Iran.<sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup>

The Buyids, who were Zaidi and had a significant influence not only in the provinces of Persia but also in the capital of the caliphate in Baghdad, and even upon the caliph himself, provided a unique opportunity for the spread and diffusion of Shia thought. This spread of Shiism to the inner circles of the government enabled the Shia to withstand those who opposed them by relying upon the power of the caliphate.

Twelvers came to Iran from Arab regions in the course of four stages. First, through the Asharis<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="The text near this tag may need clarification or removal of jargon. (August 2013)">clarification needed</span></a></i>]</sup> at the end of the 7th and during the 8th century. Second through the pupils of Sabzevar, and especially those of [Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Shaykh_Al-Mufid "Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid"), who were from [Rey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rey,_Iran "Rey, Iran") and [Sabzawar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabzawar "Sabzawar") and resided in those cities. Third, through the school of Hillah under the leadership of [Al-Hilli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allamah_Al-Hilli "Allamah Al-Hilli") and his son Fakhr al-Muhaqqiqin. Fourth, through the scholars of [Jabal Amel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabal_Amel "Jabal Amel") residing in that region, or in Iraq, during the 16th and 17th centuries who later migrated to Iran.<sup id="cite_ref-Jafarian2_72-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Jafarian2-72">[72]</a></sup>

On the other hand, the Ismaili [da‘wah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawah "Dawah") ("missionary institution") sent missionaries (_du‘āt_, sg. _dā‘ī_) during the [Fatimid Caliphate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatimid_Caliphate "Fatimid Caliphate") to Persia. When the Ismailis divided into two sects, [Nizaris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizari "Nizari") established their base in northern Persia. [Hassan-i Sabbah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan-i_Sabbah "Hassan-i Sabbah") conquered fortresses and captured [Alamut](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alamut "Alamut") in 1090. Nizaris used this fortress until the [Mongols](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongols "Mongols") finally seized and destroyed it in 1256.

After the Mongols and the fall of the Abbasids, the Sunni [Ulama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulama "Ulama") suffered greatly. In addition to the destruction of the caliphate there was no official Sunni school of law. Many libraries and madrasahs were destroyed and Sunni scholars migrated to other Islamic areas such as [Anatolia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia "Anatolia") and Egypt. In contrast, most Shia were largely unaffected as their center was not in Iran at this time. For the first time, the Shia could openly convert other Muslims to their movement.

Several local Shia dynasties like the [Marashi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marashi "Marashi") and Sarbadars were established during this time. The kings of the [Kara Koyunlu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara_Koyunlu "Kara Koyunlu") dynasty ruled in [Tabriz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabriz "Tabriz") with a domain extending to [Fars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fars_Province "Fars Province") and [Kerman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerman "Kerman"). In Egypt the Fatimid government ruled.<sup id="cite_ref-athir_73-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-athir-73">[73]</a></sup>

Muhammad Khudabandah, the famous builder of [Soltaniyeh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soltaniyeh "Soltaniyeh"), was among the first of the Mongols to convert to Shiaism, and his descendants ruled for many years in Persia and were instrumental in spreading Shī‘ī thought.<sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup> Sufism played a major role in spread of Shiism in this time.

> After the Mongol invasion Shiims and Sufism once again formed a close association in many ways. Some of the Ismailis whose power had been broken by the Mongols, went underground and appeared later within Sufi orders or as new branches of already existing orders. In Twelve-Imam Shiism, from the 13th to the 16th century, Sufism began to grow within official Shiite circles.<sup id="cite_ref-75"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup> The [extremist sects](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghulat "Ghulat") of the [Hurufis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurufism "Hurufism") and [Shasha'a](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shasha%27a&action=edit&redlink=1 "Shasha'a (page does not exist)") grew directly out of a background that is both [Shiite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam "Shia Islam") and Sufi. More important in the long run than these sects were the Sufi orders which spread in Persia at this time and aided in the preparing the ground for the Shiite movement of Safavids. Two of these orders are of particular significance in this question of the relation of Shiism and Sufism: The [Nimatullahi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni%27matull%C4%81h%C4%AB "Ni'matullāhī") order and [Nurbakhshi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurbakhshi "Nurbakhshi") order.

#### Post-Safavid [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Post-Safavid")

[Ismail I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_I "Ismail I") initiated a religious policy to recognize Shiism as the official religion of the Safavid Empire, and the fact that modern Iran and Azerbaijan remain majority-Shia states is a direct result of Ismail's actions.

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Shah_esmaeil01.jpg)

[Shah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah "Shah") [Ismail I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_I "Ismail I") of [Safavid dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safavid_dynasty "Safavid dynasty") destroyed the tombs of [Abū Ḥanīfa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab%C5%AB_%E1%B8%A4an%C4%ABfa "Abū Ḥanīfa") and the [Sufi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufi "Sufi") [Abdul Qadir Gilani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Qadir_Gilani "Abdul Qadir Gilani") in 1508.<sup id="cite_ref-77"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup> In 1533, [Ottomans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") reconquered [Iraq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq "Iraq") and rebuilt Sunni shrines.<sup id="cite_ref-78"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup>

However, most of Ismail's subjects were Sunni. As a result, he [enforced official Shiism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safavid_conversion_of_Iran_from_Sunnism_to_Shiism "Safavid conversion of Iran from Sunnism to Shiism") violently, putting to death those who opposed him. Under this pressure, Safavid subjects either converted or pretended to convert. However, it is speculated that the majority of the population was genuinely Shia by the end of the Safavid period in the 18th century, and most Iranians today are Shia, although there is still a Sunni minority.<sup id="cite_ref-79"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup>

> Immediately following the establishment of Safavid power the migration of scholars began and they were invited to Iran ... By the side of the immigration of scholars, Shi'i works and writings were also brought to Iran from Arabic-speaking lands, and they performed an important role in the religious development of Iran ... In fact, since the time of the leadership of Shaykh Mufid and Shaykh Tusi, Iraq had a central academic position for Shi'ism. This central position was transferred to Iran during the Safavid era for two-and-a-half centuries, after which it partly returned to Najaf. ... Before the Safavid era Shi'i manuscripts were mainly written in Iraq, with the establishment of the Safavid rule these manuscripts were transferred to Iran.<sup id="cite_ref-Jafarian2_72-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Jafarian2-72">[72]</a></sup>

This led to a wide gap between Iran and its Sunni neighbors, particularly its rival, the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire"), in the wake of the [Battle of Chaldiran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Chaldiran "Battle of Chaldiran"). This gap continued until the 20th century.

### Hejaz [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Hejaz")

In the holy cities of [Mecca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca "Mecca") and [Medina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina "Medina"), where Muslims, including Shia, perform [Hajj](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj "Hajj") (one of the pillars of Islam), tensions between Shia and Sunni have waxed and waned. Historian [Martin Kramer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Kramer "Martin Kramer") writes that both Sunni and Shia spread "farfetched" libelous rumours about the other sect — Sunnis that Shia defiled the [Ka‘bah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ka%E2%80%98bah "Ka‘bah") with excrement, and Shia that Sunni considered the lives of Shi‘ite pilgrims to be "forfeit" in a holy shrine where in fact "all forms of strife and bloodshed are forbidden".<sup id="cite_ref-Kramer-ME_57-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Kramer-ME-57">[57]</a></sup> According to English explorer [Richard Francis Burton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Francis_Burton "Richard Francis Burton"), a non-Muslim who journeyed to Mecca in disguise in 1853, when a Shi‘ite performs hajj,

> “that man is happy who gets over it without a beating, \[for\] in no part of Al-Hijaz are they for a moment safe from abuse and blows.”<sup id="cite_ref-80"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup>

But in "the late Ottoman years" toleration had reached a level were Shi‘ites observed [Muharram](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mourning_of_Muharram "Mourning of Muharram") in [Jidda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jidda "Jidda") (65 km from Mecca) openly.<sup id="cite_ref-Kramer-ME_57-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Kramer-ME-57">[57]</a></sup> An Iranian Shi‘ite on hajj in 1885 reported:

> Previously, in Mecca the populace greatly persecuted the Iranian pilgrims who were Shi‘ites, so they had to practice complete dissimulation. These days, because of the weakness of the Ottoman government and the European style civil law which is practiced there, and the strength of the Iranian government, this practice is completely abandoned. There is no harm done to the Iranians. No one would molest them, even if they did not practice dissimulation.<sup id="cite_ref-81"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup>

### Levant [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Levant")

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Masyaf6.jpg)

[Rashid ad-Din Sinan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashid_ad-Din_Sinan "Rashid ad-Din Sinan") the Grand Master of the Ismaili Shia at [Masyaf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masyaf "Masyaf") successfully deterred [Saladin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saladin "Saladin"), not to assault the minor territories under the control of their sect.

The Shia faith in the Levant started spreading during the [Hamdanid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamdanid_dynasty "Hamdanid dynasty") rule, which commenced in the start of the 10th century. It was followed by the [Mirdasid Shi'ite emirate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirdasid_dynasty "Mirdasid dynasty") in the 11th century, with both the emirates centered at [Aleppo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo "Aleppo").

The general observations recorded by Muslim travellers passing through the Levant during the tenth and eleventh centuries, notably al-Maqdisi in his geographical works, “The best divisions in the knowledge of the regions”, as well as [Ibn Jubayr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Jubayr "Ibn Jubayr"), indicate that Shia Muslims made up the majority of the populations of the regions of the Levant during this era, notably in the cities of Damascus, Tiberias, Nablus, Tyre, Homs and Jabal Amel. In addition to the account of [Nasir Khusraw](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasir_Khusraw "Nasir Khusraw") who visited [Jerusalem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem "Jerusalem") in the year 1045 AD and reported: "The population of Jerusalem is about 20,000, the populace being mostly Shi'a Muslims". However, with the advent of the [Zengids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zengids "Zengids") and [Ayyubids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayyubids "Ayyubids"), the population of Shia dwindled greatly due to conversion and migrations.

In 1305, the Sunni [Mamelukes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamelukes "Mamelukes") carried out a [grand campaign to erase the Shiite dominance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keserwan_campaigns_(1292%E2%80%931305) "Keserwan campaigns (1292–1305)") in the coastal mountains of Lebanon. This campaign forced most of the Shiites to disperse, with some fleeing south to Jabal Amel and some to the [Bekaa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bekaa "Bekaa"), while a very small portion of them took on the practice of [Taqiyya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taqiya "Taqiya") until the Ottomans came in 1517. Many Shia in the Levant were killed for their faith. One of these was [Muhammad Ibn Makki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Jamaluddin_al-Makki_al-Amili "Muhammad Jamaluddin al-Makki al-Amili"), called _Shahid-i Awwal (the First Martyr)_, one of the great figures in Shia jurisprudence, who was killed in [Damascus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus "Damascus") in 1384.<sup id="cite_ref-athir_73-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-athir-73">[73]</a></sup>

[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahab_al-Din_Suhrawardi "Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi") was another eminent scholar, killed in [Aleppo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo "Aleppo") on charges of cultivating [Batini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batiniyya "Batiniyya") teachings and philosophy.<sup id="cite_ref-athir_73-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-athir-73">[73]</a></sup>

On 21 April 1802, about 12,000 Wahhabi Sunnis under the command of [Abdul-Aziz bin Muhammad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul-Aziz_bin_Muhammad "Abdul-Aziz bin Muhammad"), the second ruler of the First Saudi State attacked and [sacked Karbala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabi_sack_of_Karbala "Wahhabi sack of Karbala"), killed between 2,000 and 5,000 inhabitants and plundered the tomb of [Husayn ibn Ali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husayn_ibn_Ali "Husayn ibn Ali"), grandson of Muhammad and son of [Ali ibn Abi Talib](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_ibn_Abi_Talib "Ali ibn Abi Talib"),<sup id="cite_ref-Seyyed_82-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Seyyed-82">[82]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 74">: 74 </span></sup>  and destroyed its dome, seizing a large quantity of spoils, including gold, Persian carpets, money, pearls, and guns that had accumulated in the tomb, most of them donations. The attack lasted for eight hours, after which the Wahhabis left the city with more than 4,000 camels carrying their plunder.<sup id="cite_ref-Alexei_83-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Alexei-83">[83]</a></sup>

#### Kashmir [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Kashmir")

Sunni razzias (raids) which came to be known as _Taarajs_, virtually devastated the Shi'i community. History records 10 such Taarajs, or _Taraj-e-Shia_, between the 15th and 19th centuries in 1548, 1585, 1635, 1686, 1719, 1741, 1762, 1801, 1830, 1872. During these raids, the Shia habitations of the Kashmir region of India were slaughtered and their libraries burnt, their sacred sites desecrated and plundered.<sup id="cite_ref-Kashmir_Observer_87-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Kashmir_Observer-87">[87]</a></sup>

#### Mughal Empire [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Mughal Empire")

Shia in India faced persecution by some Sunni rulers and [Mughal Emperors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire "Mughal Empire") which resulted in the killings of Shia scholars like [Qazi Nurullah Shustari](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qazi_Nurullah_Shustari "Qazi Nurullah Shustari")<sup id="cite_ref-88"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-88">[88]</a></sup> (also known as _Shaheed-e-Thaalis_, the third Martyr) and [Mirza Muhammad Kamil Dehlavi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirza_Muhammad_Kamil_Dehlavi "Mirza Muhammad Kamil Dehlavi")<sup id="cite_ref-89"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup> (also known as _Shaheed-e- Rabay_, the fourth Martyr) who are two of the [five martyrs of Shia Islam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Martyrs_of_Shia_Islam "Five Martyrs of Shia Islam"). Shia in [Kashmir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir "Kashmir") in subsequent years had to pass through the most atrocious period of their history.

#### 20th century [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: 20th century")

Sunni–Shia clashes also occurred occasionally in the 20th century in India, particularly between 1904 and 1908. These clashes revolved around the public cursing of the first three caliphs by Shia and the praising of them by Sunnis. To put a stop to the violence, public demonstrations were banned in 1909 on the three most sensitive days: [Ashura](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_Ashura "Day of Ashura"), [Chehlum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arba%27een "Arba'een") and Ali's death on 21 Ramadan. Intercommunal violence resurfaced in 1935–36 and again in 1939 when many thousands of Sunni and Shia defied the ban on public demonstrations and took to the streets.<sup id="cite_ref-90"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup> Shia are estimated to be 10–15% of the Muslim population in [India](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_India "Islam in India") and [Pakistan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Pakistan "Islam in Pakistan") and less than 1% of Muslim population in [Bangladesh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Bangladesh "Islam in Bangladesh"), although the total number is difficult to estimate due to the intermingling between the two groups and practice of _[taqiyya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taqiyya "Taqiyya")_ by Shia.<sup id="cite_ref-91"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-91">[91]</a></sup>

### 1919–1979 [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: 1919–1979")

At least one scholar sees the period from the collapse of the Ottoman Empire through the decline of [Arab nationalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_nationalism "Arab nationalism") as a time of relative unity and harmony between traditionalist Sunni and Shia Muslims. A unity brought on by a feeling of being under siege from a common threat, i.e. [secularism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism "Secularism")—first of the European colonial variety and then Arab nationalist.<sup id="cite_ref-Nasr,_Vali_2006,_p.106_19-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Nasr,_Vali_2006,_p.106-19">[19]</a></sup>

An example of Sunni–Shia cooperation was the [Khilafat Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khilafat_Movement "Khilafat Movement") which swept South Asia following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, the seat of the Caliphate, in [World War I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"). Shia scholars "came to the caliphate's defence" by attending the 1931 Caliphate Conference in [Jerusalem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem "Jerusalem"). This was despite the fact that theologically Shia held that Imams, not caliphs, were the successors to Muhammad, and that the caliphate was "the flagship institution" of Sunni, not Shia, authority. This has been described as unity of traditionalists in the face of the twin threats of "secularism and colonialism."<sup id="cite_ref-Nasr,_Vali_2006,_p.106_19-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Nasr,_Vali_2006,_p.106-19">[19]</a></sup>

In 1938, [Allama Muhammad Taqi Qummi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allama_Muhammad_Taqi_Qummi&action=edit&redlink=1 "Allama Muhammad Taqi Qummi (page does not exist)") travelled to [Cairo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo "Cairo") for the purpose of rebuilding/strengthening Islamic unity at [Al-Azhar University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Azhar_University "Al-Azhar University"). His efforts, including connecting with scholars such as [Mahmud Shaltut](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_Shaltut "Mahmud Shaltut") and [Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seyyed_Hossein_Borujerdi "Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi"), led to the founding of [Dar-al-Taghrib](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dar-al-Taghrib&action=edit&redlink=1 "Dar-al-Taghrib (page does not exist)") (community for reforming unity between Sunni and Shia Muslims).<sup id="cite_ref-Qummi_92-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Qummi-92">[92]</a></sup>

Another example of unity was a [fatwā](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatw%C4%81 "Fatwā") issued by the [rector](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rector_(academia) "Rector (academia)") of [Al-Azhar University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Azhar_University "Al-Azhar University"), [Mahmud Shaltut](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_Shaltut "Mahmud Shaltut"), recognizing [Shia Islamic law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ja%27fari_jurisprudence "Ja'fari jurisprudence") as the fifth school of Islamic law. In 1959, al-Azhar University in Cairo, the most influential center of Sunni learning, authorized the teaching of courses of Shia jurisprudence as part of its curriculum.<sup id="cite_ref-93"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-93">[93]</a></sup>

The leader of the [Islamic revolution in Iran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution "Iranian Revolution"), Ayatollah [Ruhollah Khomeini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhollah_Khomeini "Ruhollah Khomeini") saw the revolution as an Islamic, not a Shi'i Islamic revolution.<sup id="cite_ref-Nasr,_''Shia_Revival'',_2006,_137_94-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Nasr,_''Shia_Revival'',_2006,_137-94">[94]</a></sup> His revolution was (he hoped) just the first and would spread throughout the Muslim world, with Iran serving as "the base for a global Islamic movement", and himself as the leader, just as Lenin and Trotsky had hoped the Bolshevik Revolution would be only the first communist revolution.<sup id="cite_ref-Nasr,_''Shia_Revival'',_2006,_137_94-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Nasr,_''Shia_Revival'',_2006,_137-94">[94]</a></sup> The year of the Revolution was "one of great ecumenical discourse",<sup id="cite_ref-roy-123_95-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-roy-123-95">[95]</a></sup> and shared enthusiasm by both Shia and Sunni [Islamists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism "Islamism"). Khomeini endeavored to bridge the gap between Shiites and Sunnis by declaring it permissible for Twelvers to pray behind Sunni imams and by forbidding criticizing the Caliphs who preceded Ali—an issue that had caused much animosity between the two groups.<sup id="cite_ref-96"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup> He focused on issues that united Muslims — anti-Imperialism, anti-Zionism, anti-Americanism, and "the battle against outsiders" — rather than "religious questions that were likely to divide them".<sup id="cite_ref-Nasr,_''Shia_Revival'',_2006,_137_94-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Nasr,_''Shia_Revival'',_2006,_137-94">[94]</a></sup> In addition, Khomeini designated the period of Muhammad's Birthday celebrations from 12th to the 17th of Rabi Al-Awwal as the _Islamic Unity Week_, (there being a gap in the dates of when Shiites and Sunnis celebrate Muhammad's birthday).<sup id="cite_ref-97"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup>

Sunni–Shia unity did not last long after the [Iranian Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution "Iranian Revolution"), and strife between the two sects took a major upturn, the "Shia awakening and its instrumentalisation by Iran" as leading to a "very violent Sunni reaction", starting first in Pakistan before spreading to "the rest of the Muslim world, without necessarily being as violent."<sup id="cite_ref-Roy,_Chaos,_2008,_105_98-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Roy,_Chaos,_2008,_105-98">[98]</a></sup> As of 2008, "[Azerbaijan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan "Azerbaijan") is probably the only country where there are still mixed mosques and Shia and Sunnis pray together."<sup id="cite_ref-Roy,_Chaos,_2008,_105_98-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Roy,_Chaos,_2008,_105-98">[98]</a></sup>

### Islamic revival [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=34 "Edit section: Islamic revival")

Others ([Martin Seth Kramer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Kramer "Martin Kramer"), [Vali Nasr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vali_Nasr "Vali Nasr")) lay the blame for the strife at a very different source, the unintended effects of the [Islamic revival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_revival "Islamic revival").

Historian [Martin Seth Kramer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Kramer "Martin Kramer") (writing circa mid-1990s), argues that the focus on alleging "plots" by outsiders and/or claims by one side that the issue is only with an extremist group on the other side (for example [Wahhabism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabism "Wahhabism") or [Khomeinism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khomeinism "Khomeinism")), distracts from the seriousness of the problem:

> For most Muslims, it is no longer considered politic to dwell openly on the differences between Sunni and Shi‘ite Islam. Indeed, merely to cite these differences is regarded by many as part of an imperialist plot to foment division in Islam. The new sectarianism takes a subtler form: Shi‘ites profess their unity of purpose with Sunnis, but then declare that a major expression of Sunnism (in this case, Saudi Wahhabism) is a deviation from ecumenical Islam. Sunnis declare their acceptance of Shi‘ites as Muslims, but then declare that a major expression of Shi‘ism (in this case, Iran’s revolutionary activism) constitutes a deviation from ecumenical Islam. In this manner, sectarian prejudice is insinuated, even as the unity of Islam is openly professed.<sup id="cite_ref-Kramer-ME_57-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Kramer-ME-57">[57]</a></sup>

According to scholar [Vali Nasr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vali_Nasr "Vali Nasr"), as the Muslim world was decolonialised and [Arab nationalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_nationalism "Arab nationalism") lost its appeal, religion filled its place. As religion became more important, so did a return to its fundamentals and a following of its finer points; differences once overlooked became deviations to be denouncing and fought, and there were many differences between Sunni and Shia. Fundamentalism blossomed and conflicts reasserted, in particular when Sunni followed the strict teachings of Sunni scholar [Ibn Taymiyyah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Taymiyyah#Shi'a_Islam "Ibn Taymiyyah"),<sup id="cite_ref-nasr-2006-106_111-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-nasr-2006-106-111">[111]</a></sup> who considered Shia [apostates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostacy_in_Islam "Apostacy in Islam")<sup id="cite_ref-120"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-120">[119]</a></sup> and who is held in high regard by Sunni [Salafi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salafi "Salafi").

#### Iranian Islamic revolution [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=35 "Edit section: Iranian Islamic revolution")

An indirect way the Islamic revival led to discord between the two major schools of Islam was through the [Iranian Islamic revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_revolution "Iranian revolution"). The revolution was a direct result of the Islamic revival, led by an [Islamist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamist "Islamist"), Ayatollah [Ruhollah Khomeini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhollah_Khomeini "Ruhollah Khomeini"), who was very much in favor of Islamic unity, and "the leadership position that went with it".<sup id="cite_ref-121"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-121">[120]</a></sup> At first the revolution inspired and energized [Islamist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamist "Islamist") Muslims (both Shia and Sunni) everywhere, but it was a revolution in a predominantly Shi'i Muslim country, led by Shi'i Muslims, and serious rifts with Sunni Muslims soon developed.

The revolution changed the Shia–Sunni power equation in Muslim countries "from Lebanon to India". It aroused the traditionally subservient Shia, to the alarm of traditionally dominant and very non-revolutionary Sunni.<sup id="cite_ref-nasr-2006-148_112-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-nasr-2006-148-112">[112]</a></sup> "Where Iranian revolutionaries saw Islamic revolutionary stirrings, Sunnis saw mostly Shia mischief and a threat to Sunni predominance."<sup id="cite_ref-122"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-122">[121]</a></sup>

Notwithstanding the desire of Iran's leader, Khomeini, for Shia–Sunni unity, as an Islamist revolutionary flush with success that had surprised Iranians as well as the rest of the world, Khomeini now sought the overthrow of unworthy governments in Muslim-majority countries (which were all Sunni regimes except for [Ibadi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibadi_Islam "Ibadi Islam")\-led [Oman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman "Oman"), Khomeini's government being the only Shi'i-led country at the time). Pro-American monarchies in particular were high on that list, and at the very top was the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, not only a Wahhabi state with a long tradition of anti-Shi'ism, but an "American lackey" and "unpopular and corrupt dictatorship" (in his view, especially after seeing the 1979 [Grand Mosque seizure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Mosque_seizure "Grand Mosque seizure")), ripe for revolution, like "a ripe apple ready to fall into" their hands.<sup id="cite_ref-Nasr,_Vali_2006_p.150_123-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Nasr,_Vali_2006_p.150-123">[122]</a></sup> But Saudi Arabia was also spending billions of dollars every year [funding](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_propagation_of_Salafism_and_Wahhabism "International propagation of Salafism and Wahhabism") Islamic schools, scholarships, and fellowships, mosques around the Sunni world. "Thousands of aspiring preachers, Islamic scholars, and activists from Nigeria to Indonesia went to Saudi Arabia to study, and many more joined Saudi-funded think tanks and research institutions." They "then spread throughout the Muslim world to teach" what they had learned and "work at Saudi-funded universities, schools, mosques, and research institutions."<sup id="cite_ref-Nasr,_Vali_2006_p.155_124-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Nasr,_Vali_2006_p.155-124">[123]</a></sup> Khomeini's attack was opposed not only by the Saudi royal family but by its many (Sunni) fundamentalist allies and benefactors throughout the Arab world. For them the House of Saud was very popular, a leader of Islamic revival.<sup id="cite_ref-Nasr,_Vali_2006_p.143-4_125-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Nasr,_Vali_2006_p.143-4-125">[124]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Nasr,_Vali_2006_p.155_124-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Nasr,_Vali_2006_p.155-124">[123]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-126"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-126">[note 2]</a></sup> Saudi propaganda efforts proceeded to go after both Khomeini's Shia identity,<sup id="cite_ref-Nasr,_Vali_2006_p.150_123-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Nasr,_Vali_2006_p.150-123">[122]</a></sup> and to "drive all possible wedges between Sunnism and Shiism".<sup id="cite_ref-Nasr,_''Shia_Revival'',_2006,_p.157_127-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Nasr,_''Shia_Revival'',_2006,_p.157-127">[125]</a></sup>

Another indirect effect (noted by political scientist [Gilles Kepel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Kepel "Gilles Kepel")), was that however religious the Saudi regime was already, in the immediate wake of Iran's Revolution it was motivated to further shore up its "religious legitimacy" with more strictness in religion (and with jihad in Afghanistan) to compete with the grassroots enthusiasm for Iran's Islamism.<sup id="cite_ref-GKJTPI2002:137_128-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-GKJTPI2002:137-128">[126]</a></sup> But this also meant moving in a more anti-Shia religious direction because (as mentioned above) Saudi's own native Sunni school of Islam ([Wahhabism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabism "Wahhabism"), like that of [Ibn Taymiyyah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Taymiyyah#Shi'a_Islam "Ibn Taymiyyah")), did not consider Shiism part of the diversity of Islam, but a heresy to be fought. This new strictness was spread among the thousands of students in Saudi funded schools and more importantly among the international Islamist volunteers who came to training camps in Peshawar Pakistan in the 1980s to learn to fight jihad against Marxist secularists in Afghanistan and went home to fight jihad in the 1990s. Both groups (especially in Iraq and Pakistan) saw Shia as the enemy.<sup id="cite_ref-GKJTPI2002:142-3_129-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-GKJTPI2002:142-3-129">[127]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Gonzalez-2009-78_130-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Gonzalez-2009-78-130">[128]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Murphy-2013-97_131-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Murphy-2013-97-131">[129]</a></sup>

### US invasion of Iraq [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=36 "Edit section: US invasion of Iraq")

Among those blaming the US invasion of Iraq for the growth in sectarianism are Fawaz Gerges, who writes in his book _ISIS: A History_,

> By destroying state institutions and establishing a sectarian-based political system, the 2003 US-led invasion polarized the country along Sunni-Shia lines and set the stage for a fierce, prolonged struggle driven by identity politics. Anger against the United States was also fueled by the humiliating disbandment of the Iraqi army and the de-Baathification law, which was first introduced as a provision and then turned into a permanent article of the constitution.<sup id="cite_ref-NYRB-Ruthven_113-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-NYRB-Ruthven-113">[113]</a></sup>

Malise Ruthven writes that the post invasion [de-Ba'athification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-Ba%27athification "De-Ba'athification") by the US occupiers deprived Iraq of "the officer class and administrative cadres that had ruled under Saddam Hussein, leaving the field to sectarian-based militias".<sup id="cite_ref-NYRB-Ruthven_113-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-NYRB-Ruthven-113">[113]</a></sup> Many of officers joined the anti-Shia [takfiri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takfiri "Takfiri") [ISIL](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISIL "ISIL") group.

The US-led invasion also “tilted the regional balance of power decisively" in favor of Shia Iran, alarming Sunni and leading to talk of a “Shia Crescent”.<sup id="cite_ref-NYRB-Ruthven_113-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-NYRB-Ruthven-113">[113]</a></sup>

### Iraq [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=39 "Edit section: Iraq")

Shia–Sunni discord in Iraq starts with disagreement over the relative population of the two groups. The governing regimes of Iraq were composed mainly of Sunnis for nearly a century until the 2003 Iraq War, but according to most sources, the majority of the population is Shia. The CIA's _[World Factbook](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Factbook "The World Factbook")_, estimates Shia [Arab Muslims](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Muslims "Arab Muslims") as making up 60% of Iraqis, and Sunni [muslims](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims "Muslims") 37%.<sup id="cite_ref-136"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-136">[134]</a></sup> However, Sunni are split ethnically among [Arabs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_people "Arab people"), [Kurds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_people "Kurdish people") and [Turkmen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Turkmens "Iraqi Turkmens"). Many Sunnis hotly dispute their minority status, (including ex-Iraqi Ambassador Faruq Ziada),<sup id="cite_ref-Ziada-2006_137-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Ziada-2006-137">[135]</a></sup> and many believe Shia majority is "a myth spread by America".<sup id="cite_ref-138"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-138">[136]</a></sup> One Sunni belief shared by Jordan's [King Abdullah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_II_of_Jordan "Abdullah II of Jordan") as well as his then Defense Minister Shaalan is that Shia numbers in Iraq were inflated by Iranian Shia crossing the border.<sup id="cite_ref-139"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-139">[137]</a></sup> Shia scholar Vali Nasr believes the election turnout in summer and December 2005 confirmed a strong Shia majority in Iraq.<sup id="cite_ref-140"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-140">[138]</a></sup>

The British, having put down a Shia rebellion against their rule in the 1920s, "confirmed their reliance on a corps of Sunni ex-officers of the collapsed Ottoman empire". The British [colonial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism "Colonialism") rule ended after the Sunni and Shia united against it.<sup id="cite_ref-141"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-141">[139]</a></sup>

The Shia suffered indirect and direct [persecution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Shia_Muslims "Persecution of Shia Muslims") under post-colonial Iraqi governments since 1932, erupting into [full-scale rebellions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Shia_revolts_1935%E2%80%931936 "Iraqi Shia revolts 1935–1936") in 1935 and 1936. Shia were also persecuted during the [Ba'ath Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba%27ath_Party "Ba'ath Party") rule, especially under [Saddam Hussein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein "Saddam Hussein"). It is said that every Shia clerical family of note in Iraq had tales of torture and murder to recount.<sup id="cite_ref-142"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-142">[140]</a></sup> In 1969 the son of Iraq's highest Shia Ayatollah [Muhsin al-Hakim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhsin_al-Hakim "Muhsin al-Hakim") was arrested and allegedly tortured. From 1979 to 1983 Saddam's regime executed 48 major Shia clerics in Iraq.<sup id="cite_ref-143"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-143">[141]</a></sup> They included Shia leader [Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Baqir_al-Sadr "Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr") and his sister. Tens of thousands of Iranians and Arabs of Iranian origin were expelled in 1979 and 1980 and a further 75,000 in 1989.<sup id="cite_ref-144"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-144">[142]</a></sup>

The Shia openly [revolted against Saddam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_uprisings_in_Iraq "1991 uprisings in Iraq") following the [Gulf War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War "Gulf War") in 1991 and were encouraged by Saddam's defeat in Kuwait and by simultaneous Kurdish uprising in the north. However, Shia opposition to the government was brutally suppressed, resulting in some 50,000 to 100,000 casualties and successive repression by Saddam's forces.<sup id="cite_ref-145"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-145">[143]</a></sup>

#### Iraq War [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=40 "Edit section: Iraq War")

Some of the worst [sectarian strife](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectarian_violence "Sectarian violence") has occurred following the start of the Iraq War,<sup id="cite_ref-Civil_War_20-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Civil_War-20">[20]</a></sup> and continues at least as of 2016.<sup id="cite_ref-Fisher-2016_99-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Fisher-2016-99">[99]</a></sup> The war has featured a cycle of Sunni–Shia revenge killing—Sunni often used car bombs, while Shia favored [death squads](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_squad "Death squad").<sup id="cite_ref-146"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-146">[144]</a></sup> As part of its rivalry with Iran, Saudi Arabia spent "tens of billions of dollars" helping Saddam Hussein's war effort.<sup id="cite_ref-147"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-147">[145]</a></sup>

According to one estimate, as of early 2008, 1121 suicide bombers have blown themselves up in Iraq.<sup id="cite_ref-148"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-148">[146]</a></sup> Sunni [suicide bombers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_attack "Suicide attack") have targeted not only thousands of civilians,<sup id="cite_ref-149"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-149">[147]</a></sup> but [mosques](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_al-Askari_Mosque_bombing "2006 al-Askari Mosque bombing"), shrines,<sup id="cite_ref-150"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-150">[148]</a></sup> wedding and funeral processions,<sup id="cite_ref-151"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-151">[149]</a></sup> markets, hospitals, offices, and streets.<sup id="cite_ref-152"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-152">[150]</a></sup> Sunni insurgent organizations include [Ansar al-Islam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansar_al-Islam_in_Kurdistan "Ansar al-Islam in Kurdistan").<sup id="cite_ref-153"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-153">[151]</a></sup> Radical groups include [Al-Tawhid Wal-Jihad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda_in_Iraq "Al-Qaeda in Iraq"), [Jeish Muhammad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeish_Muhammad "Jeish Muhammad"), and [Black Banner Organization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Banner_Organization "Black Banner Organization").<sup id="cite_ref-154"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-154">[152]</a></sup>

_[Takfir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takfir "Takfir")_ motivation for many of these killings may come from Sunni insurgent leader [Abu Musab al-Zarqawi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Musab_al-Zarqawi "Abu Musab al-Zarqawi"). Before his death Zarqawi was one to quote [Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Abd_al-Wahhab "Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab"), especially his infamous statement urging followers to kill the Shia of Iraq,<sup id="cite_ref-155"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-155">[153]</a></sup> and calling the Shia "snakes".<sup id="cite_ref-156"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-156">[154]</a></sup>

Another explanation found in his February 2004 open letter to supporters is that by attack Shia he would provoke them to attack Sunnis and thus "awaken" Sunnis who previously had not wanted a sectarian war to join his side. The "cunning" Shia planned to build a state "stretching from Iran through Iraq, Syria and Lebanon" to the Gulf kingdoms, but by attacking Shia in their "religious, political, and military depth" his jihadis would "drag" the Shia "into the arena of sectarian war", and leading them to "bare the teeth of the hidden rancor working in their breasts" and so "awaken the inattentive Sunnis as they feel imminent danger and annihilating death at the hands of theses Sabeans", i.e. Shia.<sup id="cite_ref-Zarqawi_Letter-2004_157-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Zarqawi_Letter-2004-157">[155]</a></sup>

An [al-Qaeda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda "Al-Qaeda")\-affiliated website posted a call for "a full-scale war on Shiites all over Iraq, whenever and wherever they are found."<sup id="cite_ref-158"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-158">[156]</a></sup> Suicide bombers continue to attack Iraqi Shia civilians,<sup id="cite_ref-159"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-159">[157]</a></sup> and the Shia ulama have in response declared suicide bombing as _[haraam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haraam "Haraam")_ (against God, or "forbidden"):

> حتی كسانی كه با انتحار میآيند و میزنند عدهای را میكشند، آن هم به عنوان عملیات انتحاری، اینها در قعر جهنم هستند  
> Even those who kill people with suicide bombing, these shall meet the flames of hell.

Some believe the war has strengthened the [takfir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takfir "Takfir") thinking and may spread Sunni–Shia strife elsewhere.<sup id="cite_ref-161"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-161">[159]</a></sup>

On the Shia side, in early February 2006 militia-dominated government death squads were reportedly "tortur\[ing\] to death or summarily" executing "hundreds" of Sunnis "every month in Baghdad alone," many arrested at random.<sup id="cite_ref-162"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-162">[160]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-163"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-163">[161]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-164"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-164">[162]</a></sup> According to the British television [Channel 4](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4 "Channel 4"), from 2005 through early 2006, commandos of the Ministry of the Interior which is controlled by the [Badr Organization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badr_Organization "Badr Organization"), and

The violence shows little sign of getting opposite sides to back down.

In addition to Iran, Iraq has emerged as a major Shia government when the Twelvers achieved political dominance in 2005 under American occupation.

### Iran [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=41 "Edit section: Iran")

Iran is unique in the Muslim world because its population is overwhelmingly more Shia than Sunni (Shia constitute 95% of the population) and because its constitution is [theocratic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theocracy "Theocracy") republic based on rule by a Shia jurist.

The founder of the [Islamic Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_republic "Islamic republic"), Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, supported good Sunni–Shia relations. However tension developed between Sunnis and Shia as a result of clashes over Iranian pilgrims and Saudi police at the [hajj](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj "Hajj").<sup id="cite_ref-IRIvKSA_170-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-IRIvKSA-170">[168]</a></sup> Millions of Saudi adhere to the school of [Salafism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salafism "Salafism") which is a branch of [Sunni Islam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam "Sunni Islam").<sup id="cite_ref-171"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-171">[169]</a></sup>

Inside Iran there have been complaints by Sunni of discrimination, particularly in important government positions.<sup id="cite_ref-iran.org_172-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-iran.org-172">[170]</a></sup> In a joint appearance with former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani calling for Shia-Sunni unity, Sunni Shiekh Yusuf al-Qaradawi complained that no ministers in Iran have been Sunni for a long time, that Sunni officials are scarce even in the regions with majority of Sunni population (such as [Kurdistan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Kurdistan "Iranian Kurdistan"), or [Balochistan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistan_and_Baluchestan_Province "Sistan and Baluchestan Province"))<sup id="cite_ref-173"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-173">[171]</a></sup> and despite the presence of [Christian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity") churches, as a prominent example of this discrimination. Although reformist President [Mohammad Khatami](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Khatami "Mohammad Khatami") promised during his election campaign to build a Sunni mosque in Tehran, none was built during his eight years in office. The president explained the situation by saying Supreme Leader Ayatollah [Ali Khamenei](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei "Ali Khamenei") would not agree to the proposal.<sup id="cite_ref-174"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-174">[172]</a></sup> As in other parts of the Muslim world, other issues may play a part in the conflict, since most Sunnis in Iran are also ethnic minorities.<sup id="cite_ref-state.gov_175-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-state.gov-175">[173]</a></sup>

Soon after the 1979 revolution, Sunni leaders from Kurdistan, Balouchistan, and [Khorassan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khorasan_Province "Khorasan Province"), set up a new party known as _Shams_, which is short for Shora-ye Markaz-e al Sunaat, to unite Sunnis and lobby for their rights. But six months after that they were closed down, bank accounts suspended and had their leaders arrested by the government on charges that they were backed by Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.<sup id="cite_ref-iran.org_172-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-iran.org-172">[170]</a></sup>

A [UN](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") [human rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights "Human rights") report states that:

> ...information indicates Sunnis, along with other religious minorities, are denied by law or practice access to such government positions as cabinet minister, ambassador, provincial governor, mayor and the like, Sunni schools and mosques have been destroyed, and Sunni leaders have been imprisoned, executed and assassinated. The report notes that while some of the information received may be difficult to corroborate there is a clear impression that the right of freedom of religion is not being respected with regard to the Sunni minority.<sup id="cite_ref-176"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-176">[174]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-177"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-177">[175]</a></sup>

Members of the 'Balochistan Peoples Front' claim that Sunnis are systematically discriminated against educationally by denial of places at universities, politically by not allowing Sunnis to be army generals, ambassadors, ministers, prime minister, or president, religiously insulting Sunnis in the media, economic discrimination by not giving import or export licenses for Sunni businesses while the majority of Sunnis are left unemployed.<sup id="cite_ref-178"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-178">[176]</a></sup>

There has been a low level resistance in mainly Sunni Iranian Balouchistan against the regime for several years. Official media refers to the fighting as armed clashes between the police and "bandits," "drug-smugglers," and "thugs," to disguise what many believe is essentially a political-religious conflict. [Revolutionary Guards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps "Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps") have stationed several brigades in Balouchi cities, and have allegedly tracked down and assassinated Sunni leaders both inside Iran and in neighboring Pakistan.

### Syria [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=42 "Edit section: Syria")

Syria is approximately three quarters Sunni,<sup id="cite_ref-189"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-189">[187]</a></sup> but its government is predominantly [Alawite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alawite "Alawite"), a Shia sect that makes up less than 13% of the population. Under [Hafez al-Assad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafez_al-Assad "Hafez al-Assad"), Alawites dominated the [Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Socialist_Ba%27ath_Party_%E2%80%93_Syria_Region "Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region"), a secular Arab nationalist party which had ruled Syria under a state of emergency from 1963 to 2011. Alawites are often considered a form of Shia Islam, that differs somewhat from the larger Twelver Shia sect.<sup id="cite_ref-190"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-190">[188]</a></sup>

During the 20th century, an [Islamic uprising in Syria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_uprising_in_Syria "Islamic uprising in Syria") occurred with sectarian religious overtones between the Alawite-dominated Assad government and the [Islamist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism "Islamism") Sunni [Muslim Brotherhood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Brotherhood "Muslim Brotherhood"), culminating with the 1982 [Hama massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_Hama_massacre "1982 Hama massacre"). An estimated 10,000 to 40,000 Syrians, mostly civilians, were killed by [Syrian military](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Armed_Forces "Syrian Armed Forces") in the city. During the uprising, the Sunni Muslim Brotherhood [attacked military cadets](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo_Artillery_School_massacre "Aleppo Artillery School massacre") at an artillery school in [Aleppo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo "Aleppo"), performed car bomb attacks in Damascus, as well as bomb attacks against the government and its officials, including Hafez al-Assad himself, and had killed several hundred.

How much of the conflict was sparked by Sunni versus Shia divisions and how much by Islamism versus secular-Arab-nationalism, is in question, but according to scholar Vali Nasr the failure of the Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic of Iran to support the Muslim Brotherhood against the Baathists "earned \[Khomeini\] the Brotherhood's lasting contempt." It proved to the satisfaction of the Brotherhood that sectarian loyalty trumped Islamist solidarity for Khomeini and eliminated whatever appeal Khomeini might have had to the MB movement as a pan-Islamic leader.<sup id="cite_ref-191"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-191">[189]</a></sup>

#### Syria Civil War [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=43 "Edit section: Syria Civil War")

The [Syrian Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War "Syrian Civil War"), though it started as a political conflict, developed into a struggle between the Alawite-dominated Army and government on the one hand, and the mainly Sunni rebels and former members of the regular army on the other. The casualty toll of the war's first three years has exceeded that of Iraq's decade-long conflict, and the fight has "amplified sectarian tensions to unprecedented levels".<sup id="cite_ref-CFR-SSD_105-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-CFR-SSD-105">[105]</a></sup> Rebel groups with 10,000s of Sunni Syrian fighters such as [Ahrar ash-Sham](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahrar_ash-Sham "Ahrar ash-Sham"), the Islamic Front, and al-Qaeda's [al-Nusra Front](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Nusra_Front "Al-Nusra Front"), employ anti-Shia rhetoric and foreign Arab and Western Sunni fighters have joined the rebels. On the other side Shia from Hezbollah in Lebanon and from Asaib Ahl al-Haq and Kata'ib Hezbollah militias from Iraq have backed the Syrian government.<sup id="cite_ref-CFR-SSD_105-8"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-CFR-SSD-105">[105]</a></sup> "Even Afghan Shia refugees in Iran", driven from Afghanistan by Sunni extremism, have "reportedly been recruited by Tehran for the war in Syria".<sup id="cite_ref-CFR-SSD_105-9"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-CFR-SSD-105">[105]</a></sup>

According to some reports, as of mid-2013, the [Syrian Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War "Syrian Civil War") has become "overtly sectarian" with the "sectarian lines fall most sharply" between Alawites and Sunnis.<sup id="cite_ref-192"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-192">[190]</a></sup> With the involvement of Lebanese Shia paramilitary group [Hezbollah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah "Hezbollah"), the fighting in Syria has reignited "long-simmering tensions between Sunnis and Shi’ites" spilling over into Lebanon and Iraq.<sup id="cite_ref-193"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-193">[191]</a></sup> Bulgaria's ex-Ambassador [Dimitar Mihaylov](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dimitar_Mihaylov&action=edit&redlink=1 "Dimitar Mihaylov (page does not exist)") further claims that the current post-Arab Spring situation (encompassing ISIS, the Syrian civil war, Yemen, Iraq and others) represents a "qualitatively new" development in the history of Shi'a-Sunni dynamics. Historically, the inner rifts within Islamic ideology were to be hidden from the public sphere, while the new violent outbreaks highlight said rift in an obvious manner and is nourished by the two extremes of their mutual rivalry which will strongly affect both globally and regionally.<sup id="cite_ref-test_194-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-test-194">[192]</a></sup>

### Saudi Arabia [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=44 "Edit section: Saudi Arabia")

While Shia make up roughly 10% of Saudi Arabia's population,<sup id="cite_ref-195"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-195">[193]</a></sup> they form a large portion of the residents of the [Eastern Province](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Province,_Saudi_Arabia "Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia")—by some estimates a majority<sup id="cite_ref-196"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-196">[194]</a></sup>—where much of the petroleum industry is based. Between 500,000 and a million Shia live there,<sup id="cite_ref-Nasr,_Vali_2006_p.236_197-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Nasr,_Vali_2006_p.236-197">[195]</a></sup> concentrated especially around the oases of [Qatif](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatif "Qatif") and [al-Hasa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ahsa_Oasis "Al-Ahsa Oasis"). The Majority of Saudi Shia belong to the sect of the Twelvers.<sup id="cite_ref-lcweb2.loc.gov_198-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-lcweb2.loc.gov-198">[196]</a></sup>

The Saudi conflict of Shia and Sunni extends beyond the borders of the kingdom because of international Saudi "[Petro-Islam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petro-Islam "Petro-Islam")" influence. Saudi Arabia backed Iraq in the 1980–1988 war with Iran and sponsored militants in Pakistan and Afghanistan who—though primarily targeting the Soviet Union, which had invaded Afghanistan in 1979—also fought to suppress Shia movements.<sup id="cite_ref-sunni-shia-cfr_199-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-sunni-shia-cfr-199">[197]</a></sup>

Relations between the Shia and the Wahhabis are inherently strained because the Wahhabis consider the rituals of the Shia to be the epitome of _shirk_, or [polytheism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytheism "Polytheism"). In the late 1920s, the [Ikhwan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikhwan "Ikhwan") ([Ibn Saud's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Saud_of_Saudi_Arabia "Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia") fighting force of converted Wahhabi [Bedouin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin "Bedouin") Muslims) were particularly hostile to the Shia and demanded that Abd al Aziz forcibly convert them. In response, Abd al Aziz sent Wahhabi missionaries to the [Eastern Province](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Province,_Saudi_Arabia "Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia"), but he did not carry through with attempts at forced conversion. In recent decades the late leading Saudi cleric, [Abd al-Aziz ibn Abd Allah ibn Baaz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd_al-Aziz_ibn_Abd_Allah_ibn_Baaz "Abd al-Aziz ibn Abd Allah ibn Baaz"), issued fatwa denouncing Shia as apostates, and according to Shia scholar Vali Nasr "Abdul-Rahman al-Jibrin, a member of the Higher Council of Ulama, even sanctioned the killing of Shia,<sup id="cite_ref-Nasr,_Vali_2006_p.236_197-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Nasr,_Vali_2006_p.236-197">[195]</a></sup> a call that was reiterated by Wahhabi religious literature as late as 2002."<sup id="cite_ref-200"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-200">[198]</a></sup>

Government policy has been to allow Shia their own mosques and to exempt Shia from [Hanbali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanbali "Hanbali") inheritance practices.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2016)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Nevertheless, Shia have been forbidden all but the most modest displays on their principal festivals, which are often occasions of sectarian strife in the Persian Gulf region, with its mixed Sunni–Shia populations.<sup id="cite_ref-lcweb2.loc.gov_198-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-lcweb2.loc.gov-198">[196]</a></sup>

According to a report by the [Human Rights Watch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch "Human Rights Watch"):

> Shia Muslims, who constitute about eight percent of the Saudi population, faced discrimination in employment as well as limitations on religious practices. Shia jurisprudence books were banned, the traditional annual Shia mourning procession of Ashura was discouraged, and operating independent Islamic religious establishments remained illegal. At least seven Shi'a religious leaders-Abd al-Latif Muhammad Ali, Habib al-Hamid, Abd al-Latif al-Samin, Abdallah Ramadan, Sa'id al-Bahaar, Muhammad Abd al-Khidair, and Habib Hamdah Sayid Hashim al-Sadah-reportedly remained in prison for violating these restrictions."<sup id="cite_ref-201"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-201">[199]</a></sup>

And [Amnesty International](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International "Amnesty International") adds:

> Members of the Shi‘a Muslim community (estimated at between 7 and 10 per cent of Saudi Arabia’s population of about 19 million) suffer systematic political, social, cultural as well as religious discrimination.<sup id="cite_ref-202"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-202">[200]</a></sup>

As of 2006 four of the 150 members of Saudi Arabia's "handpicked" parliament were Shia, but no city had a Shia mayor or police chief, and none of the 300 girls schools for Shia in the Eastern Province had a Shia principal. According to scholar Vali Nasr, Saudi textbooks "characterize Shiism as a form of heresy ... worse than [Christianity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity") and [Judaism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism "Judaism")."<sup id="cite_ref-203"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-203">[201]</a></sup>

Forced into exile in the 1970s, Saudi Shia leader [Hassan al-Saffar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_al-Saffar "Hassan al-Saffar") is said to have been "powerfully influenced" by the works of Sunni Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood and [Jamaat-e-Islami](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaat-e-Islami_Pakistan "Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan") and by their call for Islamic revolution and an Islamic state.<sup id="cite_ref-204"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-204">[202]</a></sup>

Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Shia in Hasa ignored the ban on mourning ceremonies commemorating Ashura. When police broke them up three days of rampage ensued—burned cars, attacked banks, looted shops—centered around Qatif. At least 17 Shia were killed. In February 1980 disturbances were "less spontaneous" and even bloodier.<sup id="cite_ref-205"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-205">[203]</a></sup> Meanwhile, broadcasts from Iran in the name of the Islamic Revolutionary Organization attacked the monarchy, telling listeners, "Kings despoil a country when they enter it and make the noblest of its people its meanest ... This is the nature of monarchy, which is rejected by Islam."<sup id="cite_ref-206"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-206">[204]</a></sup>

By 1993, Saudi Shia had abandoned uncompromising demands and some of al-Saffar's followers met with [King Fahd](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahd_of_Saudi_Arabia "Fahd of Saudi Arabia") with promises made for reform. In 2005 the new [King Abdullah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_of_Saudi_Arabia "Abdullah of Saudi Arabia") also relaxed some restrictions on the Shia.<sup id="cite_ref-207"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-207">[205]</a></sup> However, Shia continue to be arrested for commemorating Ashura as of 2006.<sup id="cite_ref-208"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-208">[206]</a></sup> In December 2006, amidst escalating tensions in Iraq, 38 high ranking Saudi clerics called on Sunni Muslims around the world to "mobilise against Shiites".<sup id="cite_ref-209"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-209">[207]</a></sup> A year later, Shia Grand Ayatollah [Naser Makarem Shirazi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naser_Makarem_Shirazi "Naser Makarem Shirazi") is reported to have responded:

> The Wahhabis ignore the occupation of Islam's first [Qiblah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qibla "Qibla") by Israel, and instead focus on declaring [Takfiring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takfir "Takfir") fatwas against Shia.<sup id="cite_ref-210"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-210">[208]</a></sup>

Another reflection of grassroots Wahhabi or Saudi antipathy to Shia was a statement by Saudi cleric Nasir al-Umar, who accused Iraqi Shia of close ties to the United States and argued that both were enemies of Muslims everywhere.<sup id="cite_ref-211"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-211">[209]</a></sup>

#### Al-Qaeda [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=45 "Edit section: Al-Qaeda")

Some Wahabi groups, often labeled as _[takfiri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takfiri "Takfiri")_ and sometimes linked to Al-Qaeda, have even advocated the persecution of the Shia as heretics.<sup id="cite_ref-212"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-212">[210]</a></sup> Such groups have been allegedly responsible for violent attacks and suicide bombings at Shi'a gatherings at mosques and shrines, most notably in Iraq during the Ashura mourning ceremonies where hundreds of Shia were killed in coordinated suicide bombings,<sup id="cite_ref-213"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-213">[211]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-214"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-214">[212]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-215"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-215">[213]</a></sup> but also in Pakistan and Afghanistan. However, in a video message, Al-Qaeda deputy Dr [Ayman al-Zawahiri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayman_al-Zawahiri "Ayman al-Zawahiri") directed Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, not to attack civilian targets but to focus on the occupation troops. His call seems to have been ignored, or swept away in the increasing tensions of Iraq under occupation.

#### Hajj [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=46 "Edit section: Hajj")

Every year, Muslims from all over the world attend the hajj pilgrimage in Mecca in Western Saudi Arabia. Shia had complained off and on of mistreatment by the Sunnis who ran Mecca and the hajj ceremonies. Following the advent of Saudi-Wahhabi rule over Mecca in 1924 tensions between Shia and Sunni increased. To the fury of Shia Muslims, the Wahhabi Sunnis demolished domes in the [cemetery of Al-Baqi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Baqi_Cemetery "Al-Baqi Cemetery"), near the Medina, "the reputed resting place of the Prophet Muhammad’s daughter Fatima and four of the Twelve Imams".<sup id="cite_ref-Kramer-ME_57-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Kramer-ME-57">[57]</a></sup> In 1943, a Saudi religious judge ordered the beheading of an Iranian pilgrim "for allegedly defiling the Great Mosque with excrement" smuggled into "the mosque in his pilgrim’s garment". Saudi public opinion considered the crime unsurprising and the punishment just, Iranian were furious and demanded payment of an indemnity. Tensions lowered again during the 1960s, when pious/tradionalist Muslims set aside differences in the face of the rising popularity of Nasser's leftist Arab nationalism. Pilgrims from Iran (mostly Shia) rose in number from 12,000 in 1961 to 57,000 in 1972.<sup id="cite_ref-Kramer-ME_57-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Kramer-ME-57">[57]</a></sup>

In 1987, about seven years after the [Iranian Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution "Iranian Revolution"), Mecca became a site "[of unprecedented carnage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987_Mecca_incident "1987 Mecca incident")" when demonstrating Shia Iranian pilgrims clashed with Saudi security forces and over four hundred were killed. The Saudis and their supporters claimed violent Iranian demonstrators crushed themselves to death in a stampede of their own making. The Iranians and their sympathizers claimed the Saudis had conspired to provoke and then shoot Iranian pilgrims. The pilgrimage to Mecca, where violence is forbidden, had itself become a point of confrontation between rival visions of Islam.<sup id="cite_ref-Kramer-ME_57-6"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-Kramer-ME-57">[57]</a></sup>

### Lebanon [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=47 "Edit section: Lebanon")

Though sectarian tensions in Lebanon were at their height during the [Lebanese Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Civil_War "Lebanese Civil War"), the Shia–Sunni relations were not the main conflict of the war. The Shia party/militia of [Hezbollah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah "Hezbollah") emerged in Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War as one of the strongest forces following the Israeli withdrawal in the year 2000, and the collapse of the [South Lebanese Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lebanese_Army "South Lebanese Army") in the South. The tensions blew into a [limited warfare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_conflict_in_Lebanon "2008 conflict in Lebanon") between Shia dominated and Sunni dominated political alliances in 2008.

With the eruption of the Syrian Civil War, [tensions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bab_al-Tibbaneh,_Jabal_Mohsen_clashes "Bab al-Tibbaneh, Jabal Mohsen clashes") increased between the Shia-affiliated Alawites and Sunnis of Tripoli, erupting twice into deadly violence—in June 2011, and the [second time in February 2012](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_sectarian_clashes_in_Lebanon "2012 sectarian clashes in Lebanon"). The Syrian war has affected Hezbollah, which was once lauded by both Sunnis and Shi'ites for its battles against Israel, but now has lost support from many Sunnis for its military assistance to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

### Jordan [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=48 "Edit section: Jordan")

Although the country of Jordan is 95% Sunni and has not seen any Shia–Sunni fighting within, it has played a part in the recent Shia-Sunni strife. It is the home country of anti-Shia insurgent [Raed Mansour al-Banna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Raed_Mansour_al-Banna&action=edit&redlink=1 "Raed Mansour al-Banna (page does not exist)"), who died perpetrating one of Iraq's worst suicide bombings in the city of Al-Hillah. Al-Banna killed 125 Shia and wounded another 150 in the [2005 Al Hillah bombing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Al_Hillah_bombing "2005 Al Hillah bombing") of a police recruiting station and adjacent open air market. In March 2005 [Salt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt,_Jordan "Salt, Jordan"), al-Banna's home town, saw a three-day wake for al-Banna who Jordanian newspapers and celebrants proclaimed a [martyr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid "Shahid") to Islam, which by definition made the Shia victims "infidels whose murder was justified." Following the wake Shia mobs in Iraq attacked the Jordanian embassy on 20 March 2005.

### Yemen [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=50 "Edit section: Yemen")

Muslims in Yemen include the majority Shafi'i (Sunni) and the minority Zaidi (Shia). Zaidi are sometimes called "Fiver Shia" instead of Twelver Shia because they recognize the first four of the Twelve Imams but accept [Zayd ibn Ali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zayd_ibn_Ali "Zayd ibn Ali") as their "Fifth Imām" rather than his brother [Muhammad al-Baqir](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Baqir "Muhammad al-Baqir"). Shia–Sunni conflict in Yemen involves the [Shia insurgency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_insurgency_in_Yemen "Shia insurgency in Yemen") in northern Yemen.<sup id="cite_ref-scribd.com_18-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-scribd.com-18">[18]</a></sup>

Both Shia and Sunni dissidents in Yemen have similar complaints about the government—cooperation with the American government and an alleged failure to following Sharia law<sup id="cite_ref-228"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-228">[226]</a></sup>—but it's the Shia who have allegedly been singled out for government crackdown.

During and after the US-led invasion of Iraq, members of the Zaidi-Shia community protested after Friday prayers every week outside mosques, particularly the [Grand Mosque](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Mosque_of_Sana%27a "Great Mosque of Sana'a") in [Sana'a](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sana%27a "Sana'a"), during which they shouted anti-US and anti-Israeli slogans, and criticised the government's close ties to America.<sup id="cite_ref-229"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-229">[227]</a></sup> These protests were led by ex-parliament member and Imam, Bader Eddine al-Houthi.<sup id="cite_ref-230"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-230">[228]</a></sup> In response the Yemeni government has implemented a campaign to crush to the Zaidi-Shia rebellion"<sup id="cite_ref-231"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-231">[229]</a></sup> and harass journalists.<sup id="cite_ref-232"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-232">[230]</a></sup>

These latest measures come as the government faces a Sunni rebellion with a similar motivation to the Zaidi discontent.<sup id="cite_ref-233"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-233">[231]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-234"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-234">[232]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-235"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-235">[233]</a></sup>

A March 2015 suicide bombing of two mosques (used mainly by supporters of the [Zaidi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaidiyyah "Zaidiyyah") Shia-led [Houthi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi "Houthi") rebel movement), in the Yemeni capital of [Sanaa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sana%27a "Sana'a"), killed at least 137 people and wounded 300. The Sunni [Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant "Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant") movement claimed responsibility, issuing a statement saying: "Let the polytheist Houthis know that the soldiers of the Islamic State will not rest until we have uprooted them." Both the Sunni [al-Qaeda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda "Al-Qaeda") and "Islamic State" consider Shia Muslims to be heretics.<sup id="cite_ref-BBC-yemen_236-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-BBC-yemen-236">[234]</a></sup>

### Pakistan [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=52 "Edit section: Pakistan")

Pakistan's citizens have had serious Shia-Sunni discord. Almost 90% of Pakistan's Muslim population is Sunni, with 10% being Shia, but this Shia minority forms the second largest Shia population of any country,<sup id="cite_ref-240"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-240">[238]</a></sup> larger than the Shia majority in Iraq.

Until recently Shia–Sunni relations have been cordial, and a majority of people of both sects participated in the creation the state of Pakistan in the 1940s.<sup id="cite_ref-auto_17-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-auto-17">[17]</a></sup> Despite the fact that Pakistan is a Sunni majority country, Shia have been elected to top offices and played an important part in the country's politics. Several top Pakistani military and political figures such as General [Muhammad Musa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Musa "Muhammad Musa"), and [Pakistan's President](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Pakistan "President of Pakistan") [Yahya Khan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Khan "Yahya Khan")<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

There are many intermarriages between Shia and Sunnis in Pakistan.

Unfortunately, from 1987 to 2007, "as many as 4,000 people are estimated to have died" in Shia-Sunni sectarian fighting in Pakistan",<sup id="cite_ref-csmonitor.com_241-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-csmonitor.com-241">[239]</a></sup> another estimate is nearly 4,000 people have been killed and 6,800 injured from the beginning of 2000 to 2013.<sup id="cite_ref-FAIR-2014_242-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-FAIR-2014-242">[240]</a></sup>

#### Background [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=53 "Edit section: Background")

Some see a precursor of Pakistani Shia–Sunni strife in the April 1979 execution of deposed President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto on questionable charges by [Islamic fundamentalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_fundamentalism "Islamic fundamentalism") General [Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Zia-ul-Haq "Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq"). Ali Bhutto was Shia, Zia ul-Haq a Sunni.<sup id="cite_ref-247"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-247">[245]</a></sup>

[Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zia-ul-Haq%27s_Islamization "Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization") that followed was resisted by Shia who saw it as "Sunnification" as the laws and regulations were based on Sunni _[fiqh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiqh "Fiqh")_. In July 1980, 25,000 Shia protested the [Islamization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamization "Islamization") laws in the capital [Islamabad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad "Islamabad"). Further exacerbating the situation was the dislike between Shia leader Imam Khomeini and General Zia ul-Haq.<sup id="cite_ref-248"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-248">[246]</a></sup>

Shia formed student associations and a Shia party, Sunni began to form sectarian militias recruited from Deobandi and [Ahl al-Hadith](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahl_al-Hadith "Ahl al-Hadith") madrasahs. Preaching against the Shia in Pakistan was cleric [Israr Ahmed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israr_Ahmed "Israr Ahmed"). [Manzoor Nomani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manzoor_Nomani "Manzoor Nomani"), a senior Indian cleric with close ties to Saudi Arabia published a book entitled _Iranian Revolution: Imam Khomeini and Shiism_. The book, which "became the gospel of Deobandi militants" in the 1980s, attacked Khomeini and argued the excesses of the Islamic revolution were proof that Shiism was not the doctrine of misguided brothers, but beyond the Islamic pale.<sup id="cite_ref-249"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-249">[247]</a></sup>

### Afghanistan [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=54 "Edit section: Afghanistan")

Shia–Sunni strife in Pakistan is strongly intertwined with that in Afghanistan. The anti-Shia Afghan [Taliban](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban "Taliban") regime helped anti-Shia Pakistani groups and vice versa. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan, have sent thousands of volunteers to fight with the Taliban regime and "in return the Taliban gave sanctuary to their leaders in the Afghan capital of Kabul."<sup id="cite_ref-255"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-255">[253]</a></sup>

Shia–Sunni strife inside of Afghanistan has been between the Sunni Taliban and Shia Afghans, primarily the [Hazara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazara_people "Hazara people") ethnic group—a function of the puritanical religious character of the Taliban and their "traditional [Pashtun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtuns "Pashtuns") biases against Shias".<sup id="cite_ref-256"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-256">[254]</a></sup>

### Saudi–Iran summit [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations&action=edit&section=63 "Edit section: Saudi–Iran summit")

In a milestone for the two countries' relations, on 3 March 2007 King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad held an extraordinary [summit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting) "Summit (meeting)") meeting. They displayed mutual warmth with hugs and smiles for cameras and promised "a thaw in relations between the two regional powers but stopped short of agreeing on any concrete plans to tackle the escalating sectarian and political crises throughout the Middle East."<sup id="cite_ref-nytimes.com_310-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-nytimes.com-310">[308]</a></sup>

On his return to Tehran, Ahmadinejad declared that:

> Both Iran and Saudi Arabia are aware of the enemies' conspiracies. We decided to take measures to confront such plots. Hopefully, this will strengthen Muslim countries against oppressive pressure by the imperialist front.<sup id="cite_ref-nytimes.com_310-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-nytimes.com-310">[308]</a></sup>

Saudi officials had no comment about Ahmadinejad's statements, but the Saudi official government news agency did say:

> The two leaders affirmed that the greatest danger presently threatening the Islamic nation is the attempt to fuel the fire of strife between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, and that efforts must concentrate on countering these attempts and closing ranks.<sup id="cite_ref-311"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-311">[309]</a></sup>

Saudi Foreign Minister Prince [Saud bin Faisal bin Abdul-Aziz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saud_bin_Faisal_bin_Abdul-Aziz "Saud bin Faisal bin Abdul-Aziz") said:

> The two parties have agreed to stop any attempt aimed at spreading sectarian strife in the region.<sup id="cite_ref-312"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations#cite_note-312">[310]</a></sup>

It was Khomeini's direct challenge to Saudi Arabia that galvanized Sunni opposition to the Iranian revolution and the Shia awakening. Khomeini saw the Saudi monarchy as an American lackey, an unpopular and corrupt dictatorship that could be easily overthrown. ... More important, Khomeini underrated the degree and intensity of Sunni religious support for the Saudi regime ... on several occasions used the annual hajj to stage protests with the aim of fomenting trouble in the kingdom as well as spreading revolutionary messages among the faithful from around the world. On one such occasion, in July 1987, things got so out of hand that clashes between Iranian pilgrims and Saudi police left 402 dead.
