## Money in Politics: the History and Data

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/comments/1bjeljp/money_in_politics_the_history_and_data/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/comments/1bjeljp/money_in_politics_the_history_and_data/)

> Polls show that most Americans are concerned about money in politics, and yet over the past eight years, the issue seems to have been shunted to the back burner of progressive politics. Ever since 2016, when Donald Trump won despite being dramatically out-fundraised, political reformers have grown quieter on this issue. There is a perception that Trump’s upset victory, and a handful of other high-profile cases in which campaign cash didn’t translate into winning, have taken some of the wind out of the sails of this issue. This piece aims to correct that perception. It covers the history of campaign finance policy in the US, and dives into the data to show that money in politics not only remains very predictive, but that it correlates with a number of troubling trends.

	The corruption goes deeper than just campaign donations. Money has always corrupted politicians and it always will. Once in office, its a feeding frenzy.
