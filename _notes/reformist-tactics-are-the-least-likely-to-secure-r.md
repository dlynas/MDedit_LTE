## "Reformist tactics are the least likely to secure real reforms. The most effective way to secure real reforms is to pursue the tactics of the revolutionary class struggle. Actually, reforms are won as a result of the revolutionary class struggle, as a result of its independence mass force & steadfastness. Reforms are always false, and ambiguous...they are real only in proportion to the intensity of the class struggle. By merging our slogans with those of the reformist bourgeoisie, we weaken the cause of revolution and consequently the cause of reform as well, because we thereby diminish the independence, fortitude and strength of the revolutionary classes."
-V.I. Lenin, "Once Again About the Duma Cabinet" 1906

	"Without a car system you can't have economic growth. So that's why this idea of
	changing the culture and fighting for equality and tweaking the system, that
	everybody thinks that we can still have prosperity and equality at the same time
	you can't in a growth based economic system. For that you need all the
	garks at the top and you need surfs dying at the bottom. You need that. And look
	the mechanics of that are quite simple. You can't price anything unless it's
	limitable and excludable. That's how you calculate that price. It's
	limitability and excludability. So you have to be able to limit the amount of
	that thing and you need to be able to exclude people from access to that.
	Make it difficult for them to access that. You can only do it with a cast
	system so the people at the top half have access to people at the bottom half
	don't. You can listen to our full conversation with Tyson Youngcoporta at
	upstreampodcast.org or wherever you listen to your favorite podcasts."

	"It's class contradiction that moves history forward and this is a class that no
	longer wants to move history forward. It might have nearly part of the 20th
	century but right now the status quo suits it very well and there's a lot of
	popular rage that's unorganized that it does not want to deal with it does not
	want to speak to because if we're going to have massive redistribution of good
	it is going to suffer. I want the capitalist to suffer but the PMC is going to
	suffer. My class is going to have to suffer if there's a major redistribution
	that must happen if we are going to work towards a universal emancipation of
	human capacity in this country and in this world. Listen to our full conversation
	with Catherine Liu at upstreampodcast.org or wherever you listen to your
	favorite podcasts."
