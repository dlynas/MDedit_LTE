## The "legitimacy" of self-immolation/suicide as protest

That isn't classified as mental illness, but sacrificing yourself to make a statement against the empire is. Is this just because one is seen as an explicit act of "suicide"? Why would that distinction matter, though?

That all this does is highlight the inability of the left to get our shit together, so we just resort to individualist acts of spectacle in the hopes that will somehow inspire change. (I've seen this in comments denigrating the "New Left" as if protests like this are a product of it).

	*Starve and Immolate: The Politics of Human Weapons* by Banu Bargu is a really good resource for trying to understand political practices like this one. She discusses self-immolation along with hunger striking, self-mutilation, and suicide bombing as a form of necroresistance to the state's control over life and death, executed on the protester's own body because that is the only "territory" they can control. (I'm afraid I don't remember all the details now, but there's an element of invoking or manipulating the state of exception and *homo sacer* as well.) This makes a lot of sense in carceral situations, whether literal prisons or conditions like the Gaza blockade. 

	Where I think things diverge a bit is when you look at someone who theoretically does have political terrain available to them beyond their own body, like this man. I would want to revisit Bargu before I said anything about whether her theory can account for this, but if not then it provides a basis for some interesting questions.

	Edit: Lots happening under this comment! I think it might help to clarify that for Bargu, necroresistance happens after the subject has already been rendered *homo sacer* (an exception to the biopolitical system of life-production, a type of social death). They have been reduced to a body, and so control over what happens to that body becomes an essential and powerful struggle. But it's a struggle for the power of *death* (hence, necroresistance), rather than, e.g., affirming or asserting alternative modes of life and embodiment, which we see in many forms in all kinds of struggles. This is one way of understanding why Guantanamo authorities will order hunger-striking prisoners to be force-fed: the inmates are not to be allowed the power of killing or harming their bodies, even if the outcome would be in line with the institution's goals.

	Obviously this is connected to broader structures of biopolitics. But I think it does many parties a disservice to insist that Aaron Bushnell's membership in the military or existence in a highly biopoliticized society equates to the situation described above. Is it related? Certainly. And that relation, and how *he* understood that relation, would probably be a good place to start in thinking through how to read his act. But to conflate his situation with that of the Turkish death fasters Bargu focuses on, or the man who self-immolated in an Australian offshore detention center in 2016 (IIRC), is myopic at best. I think acknowledging that difference and exploring it is where there could be a lot to learn.

		I think the more interesting part here is that Bushnell’s choice to self-immolate demonstrates that he did not at least feel that he had the ability to affect the genocide or the US’s role in it. Let’s be honest, it’s not likely that the current administration or whoever gets elected in the fall is going to stop supporting the Zionist government’s campaign of slaughter. I think Bushnell’s political suicide can be understood as an attempt to “say the unsaid” that he saw as impossible through “legitimate” politcal structures (e.g. voting, civil organizing) or even potential revolutionary ones.

		What do you mean by him having “political terrain available”? The option of organizing fellow air force pilots? Speaking out as an active duty military officer? What effect overall would this have had on the greater political bodies that are funding and committing these atrocities?
		
		I understand that he had more political agency than the average person, and that he could have used his military background to try and build pressure within the system, but this often does not lead to change. This is pretty tangential, but I’m reminded of Chris Dorner, who attempted to call out instances of excessive force within the LAPD, did everything by the book, and was ultimately fired. He carried out his own form of justice which people may or may not agree with, but the point being that revolting against a system while remaining within that system does not usually lead to a fruitful outcome.

			I meant he was not in a carceral situation except in the broadest structural sense. He was not a prisoner or under blockade. This is not a value judgment on his choices. I am acknowledging that his situation is different from that of the people Bargu wrote about and that that would potentially affect how we understand his actions.

			* 🟦 **[HumanistPeach](https://www.reddit.com/user/HumanistPeach)** ⬆️ 12 _(2024-02-27 09:24:17)_

				He may not have been under blockade, but active duty military members are a type of prisoner. They don’t get to decide where they live or work, or what work they do. They are required to follow orders, or be literally imprisoned, where his options would have been even further reduced to an invisible hunger strike. I can see why he felt this was the only option he had which could still be visible to and possibly make an impact on the public.

						You can join the military and swear the oath while assuming it will never mean you have to be an active participant in genocide. Circumstances change, and now he felt he was being forced into something he didn’t sign up for and could have never foreseen when he did. It doesn’t disgrace my step brother, uncles, cousins or grandfathers’ service to also frame what is now happening as so outside the realm of what was foreseeable in service as to make service members feel trapped and like prisoners with no other options. It’s just the facts on the ground.

								But effectively you *were* a prisoner in a way. You had severely reduced freedom of movement, had no choice or say in what your work was, or where/how the fruits of your labor were used, you weren’t even allowed to opt out if you found the use of your labor to be for morally reprehensible purposes unless you were prepared to go AWOL and then to actual prison. Just because you consented to join the military doesn’t mean you’re forced to consent to every further action you’re ordered to take or how the military as a whole is being used. But you’re forced to continue your labor regardless of your lack of consent, and forced labor in the US is only allowed in prisons and the military. 
								
								You may not *like* that that is the way it is, and you may not *like* the fact you signed away a great many of your rights for the duration of your military contract or what that says about you, but those *are* the facts. You didn’t have a choice, and that is a type of prison.

									In spirit, I agree with you. But what I really think you are saying is that the military is not protecting the idea of America, or maybe justice itself. But this is arbitrary and impossible to defend.
									
									If the military were blatantly violating the constitution, it would be much easier to fix. It's simply not the case though.
									
									Everyone has free access to read the constitution and can also read the history of the war crimes of the United States before they swear that oath. One can determine what they could potentially be exposed to under the confines of what is permitted by the constitution, and unfortunately for your argument and for humanity, I do believe verything that has occurred is permitted.
									
									If they don't figure this out and at a later point disagree with what the United States does while in service, I don't think they get to claim prisoner-hood or moral superiority of any kind. That's the only point I'm making here. I do not agree with many of the actions of the United States military or government.

										As for the constitution, does it matter very much?
										
										It just seems like you're taking extremely conventional ideas and holding them up like anyone is supposed to care.

					It sounds to me like you’re flattening out what was more than a decade of Jones’ history. I think it’s almost entirely inaccurate to refer to what happened at Jonestown as “suicide.” When you learn about the whole White Nights practice, when you see trapped people were, when you hear the *screaming* on the recording — that wasn’t suicide. 
					
					So I don’t see what we can learn from bringing Jones into a conversation about what Bushnell did. Not only is it an insult to those people who died on that day, it is also an insult to those who do die by their own hand for a cause.

		I don’t think this would fit into either category, Newton’s definition of revolutionary suicide is working toward revolution with the understanding of the risk to one’s life “to die for the people” as a process, rather than a single act. 
		
		Self-immolation is done with the understanding of death, and can be taken on with a revolutionary purpose but Newton emphasises living as an essential part of revolutionary suicide, living to revolutionise rather than reject life in reactionary suicide by succumbing to the conditions that people who chose each form of suicide understand to be untenable. 
		
		Forms of protest and resistance like self-immolation, the hunger strike, and strategic non-violence in the face of repressive violence are all contingent on publicity and a sympathetic audience. Self-immolation in particular seeks to galvanise that audience and shock the other side, rather than revolutionise, so I would say it isn’t revolutionary suicide, but as a negation of life in protest rather than an escape from it, it isn’t reactionary suicide either.

I think of him whenever I read anything about climate change and his death still haunts me, if for no other reason than how quickly it was forgotten.

	Legitimacy is a tough concept or line to nail down. Illegitimate, to me, seems to be a concept that is disproportionate to or way outside the accepted norm. Self-immolation, while abnormal, is enough within historical norms that there is scholarship about it. It is in the Bible, practiced cross-culturally and makes an ecumenical point. 

	It speaks loudly and memorably. The only protest that is mentioned in the Fog of War by Robert Macmamera is n immolation outside his office at the pentagon. (It could a similar Errol morris made about Rumsfeld). Regardless of which one of them it was these dudes were central to Americas role in Vietnam-they’re pretty protest proof. But this action gave them pause. 

	I’m not endorsing it, but it is semi-normative.

	Sometimes, self-harm is the only means we have available to revolt. Consider the hunger strikes inside of prisons and jails that have been used for over a century now to protest inhumane conditions. Historian Dan Berger and philosopher Angela Davis talk about these methods and how they resist carcerality.

	Or, we can draw a direct line from Bushnell's act of protest to the antiwar movement of the 60s and 70s. The spectacle is meant to rupture the social fabric, to force the injustice into the public imaginary. Like all protest tactics it carries risks, but the fact that it didn't \*have\* to go viral like it has does not make it less worth doing. There was actually an earlier case of self-immolation in protest of the genocide going on in Gaza and the woman's sacrifice there is no less noble than Bushnell just because it received less attention IMO.

		Another example, that hasn't been mentioned, is the spate of self-immolations in Tibet since 2011, where at least 160 Tibetans have set themselves on fire to protest the Chinese occupation. They're acts of desperation, but also clearly meant to draw international attention. That these many incidents aren't widely known or reported suggests that their mere shock factor is not enough for people to pay attention, though.

		That really only works if the thing that's being protested is highly controversial and extremely unpopular, such as when Thich Quang Duc, a Vietnamese monk, immolated himself in 1963 in protest against the persecution of Buddhists by the South Vietnamese government or with the Irish hunger strikes in 1981 in Northern Ireland during The Troubles. Those two instances of self sacrifice as a protest led to real change. But in most instances, immolation or starvation by someone who is protesting something goes vastly unnoticed or is ignored by the masse. That does not, however, take away anything from the nobility of those kinds of sacrifices.

								You are more than welcome to like, dislike, or ignore my post. I've watched the news of the world for close to sixty years and while the issues that Israel has faced since its creation has merited lots of news coverage, it's never been a full on nightly news item. Far more things have received nightly news coverage over the past fifty years than Israel and it's ongoing issues with the Middle East and Palestine. For example, the Cold War, the Vietnam War, the various little military entanglements the U.S. has foolishly gotten involved with, the Iranian Revolution and the issues that have resulted from that. And lets not forget all the numerous issues this country has faced at home, such as the various market crashes, the AIDS epidemic, the Iran-Contra scandal, and all the political intrigue that goes on daily and gets worse by the minute. In all that, Israel has been on the news but definitely not nightly. It comes and it goes depending on the news cycle and whether the people of this country are more interested in what's going on there or at home. Usually it's the later.

		I read an orwell essay written during ww2 that was his thoughts on Gandhi, and he stated that Gandhi had said that the best thing the Jewish people in concentration camps could do is participate in a similar form of self - harm. die en masse to shed some light on it because, essentially, they’re going to die anyway
		
		Here it is, didn’t re read and it’s been a while so hopefully my memory of the synopsis is correct https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/reflections-on-gandhi/
		
		Edit: yeah, here’s the quote 
		
		> In relation to the late war, one question that every pacifist had a clear obligation to answer was: "What about the Jews? Are you prepared to see them exterminated? If not, how do you propose to save them without resorting to war?" I must say that I have never heard, from any Western pacifist, an honest answer to this question, though I have heard plenty of evasions, usually of the "you're another" type. But it so happens that Gandhi was asked a somewhat similar question in 1938 and that his answer is on record in Mr. Louis Fischer's GANDHI AND STALIN. According to Mr. Fischer, Gandhi's view was that the German Jews ought to commit collective suicide, which "would have aroused the world and the people of Germany to Hitler's violence." After the war he justified himself: the Jews had been killed anyway, and might as well have died significantly. One has the impression that this attitude staggered even so warm an admirer as Mr. Fischer, but Gandhi was merely being honest. If you are not prepared to take life, you must often be prepared for lives to be lost in some other way. When, in 1942, he urged non-violent resistance against a Japanese invasion, he was ready to admit that it might cost several million deaths.

			I think just about every Jew on the planet, including me, would take massive offense to that. The mass deaths of Jews by any method have essentially never been seen to affect world opinion of us in any positive way—with the most frequent reaction being "they had it coming"—let alone spurred any action to stop it. To suggest that the outcome of the Shoah would have been any different if we had simply complied with the Nazis' desire to exterminate us is patently ridiculous.

				It’s always a relief to read a tweet cancelling some famous author who has been dead for 80 years, *phew* “he was *problematic*, now I don’t have to spend the strenuous time engaging with his material. And since he did shitty things in his life, unlike me or anyone else I know, his writing and the direct reformation that resulted from it is meaningless. It doesn’t matter if he risked it to fight in (the Spanish civil) war for ideological reasons - against totalitarianism. It doesn’t matter that he acted like Siddhartha and lived among the indigent so he could document their horrible quality of life to educate the middle and upper class population; nor that it ushered in legislative reform for the benefit of the homeless/justice system/child laborers etc. Who cares that he died at only 40 as a direct result of TB, a disease which he no doubt caught in a homeless shelter or on the front lines of a war defending the people of a foreign country. Why? He was hypocritical and antisemitic early in his career, hypocritical and homophobic later in his career. His wife worked for the censoring department of the UK government. And also he went to Eaton as a child, so he was just *cosplaying* poverty.” 
				
				I see it all the time for these long-dead authors.  A very popular one to dismiss is  Thoreau: 
				
				“Did you know he didn’t even live *in the wild* his **mom** did his laundry!! He lived in his **friend’s** backyard. I’m not going to read a phony like that!”
				
				They never seem to know much beyond that (well, maybe they play fallout and know where Walden pond is). But definitely nothing about his actual work - like that he stopped paying his taxes and went to jail to protest slavery, and he advocated every single person do the same until things change. Nor his well-known admiration and advocation for John Brown and the slave rebellion, a man who even people who were self-described white abolitionists tsk-tsked  
				
				“digging into their material may be time consuming, but that is not why I haven’t read them of course. I am making a stand; I am boycotting their work - unlike *some people* - I have a strong moral backbone and unflappable principles.”

	It's a strange framing to talk of protest - any protest - in terms of legitimacy or illigitimacy. One of the aims of protest is surely to challenge both what is considered legitimate and who is allowed to make such designations. Protest that does not, in some way, spill into 'illegitimate' is less protest than simply appeal. Why should "legitimacy" be one of the criteria for protest?

	Does self-immolation as spectacle speak to a weakness of the left? And so what if it does? That's a problem for the left to deal with. As for Aaron Bushnell, he died screaming "free Palestine" until he could no longer scream. Of course that attests to failure - of the left, of humanity. And so one acts from a position of failure. What is the critique here? That we can only act once we are in a position of victory? As if describing facts of a situation amounts to a critique.

			Yeah, it's good to try and process this. I think it's useful to recognize that any act like this that crosses the boundaries of 'acceptable' action is always going to elicit a pretty standard set of responses which are effectively ready-made 'templates' of reaction. A helpful step is not to take for granted the legitimacy (ha) of the questions posed ("is this legitimate?"; "is this a failure of the left?") and to try and think through if those questions are appropriate ones at all to begin with, and if not, why not. We gotta get comfortable with not giving in to the pressure of answering certain questions if the terms in which those questions are posed are not equal to what they ask about.

	By removing death, the master removes the slave from the circulation of symbolic goods. This is the violence the master does to the slave, condemn- ing him to labour power. There lies the secret of power (in the dialectic of the master and the slave, Hegel also derives the domination of the master from the deferred threat of death hanging over the slave). Labour, produc- tion and exploitation would only be one of the possible avatars of this power structure, which is a structure of death.

	This changes every revolutionary perspective on the abolition of power. If power is death deferred, it will not be removed insofar as the suspension of this death will not be removed. And if power, of which this is always and everywhere the definition, resides in the act of giving without being given, it is clear that the power the master has to unilaterally grant life will only be abolished if this life can be given to him – in a non-deferred death. There is no other alternative; you will never abolish this power by staying alive, since there will have been no reversal of what has been given. Only the surrender of this life, retaliating against a deferred death with an immediate death, constitutes a radical response, and the only possibility of abolishing power. No revolutionary strategy can begin without the slave putting his own death back at stake, since this is what the master puts off in the différance from which he profits by securing his power. Refuse to be put to death, refuse to live in the mortal reprieve of power, refuse the duty of this life and never be quits with living, in effect be under obligation to settle this long-term credit through the slow death of labour, since this slow death does not alter the future of this abject dimension, in the fatality of power. Violent death changes everything, slow death changes nothing, for there is a rhythm, a scansion necessary to symbolic exchange: something has to be given in the same movement and following the same rhythm, otherwise there is no reciprocity and it is quite simply not given. The strategy of the system of power is to displace the time of the exchange, substituting conti- nuity and mortal linearity for the immediate retaliation of death. It is thus futile for the slave (the worker) to give little by little, in infinitesimal doses, to the rope of labour on which he is hung to death, to give his life to the master or to capital, for this ‘sacrifice’ in small doses is no longer a sacrifice – it doesn’t touch the most important thing, the différance of death, and merely distils a process whose structure remains the same.

	The fact that Bushnell was a member of the US army should be factored into an assessment of his act of protest. It was a powerful statement from someone who would otherwise be blindly complicit in the state's repressive apparatus and aiding Israel's genocide. As an act of protest and self-sacrifice, it is a powerful message that cannot be ignored. If for example the public are able to put pressure on Biden to at least enable a ceasefire (a guy who has previously advocated the mass slaughter of Palestinian women and children civilians to such an extent that at the time Israel distanced itself from Biden...), this is a powerful message that may contribute to that pressure or at least highlight that one cannot be complacent in the face of the atrocity and genocide the Palestinians are being subjected to. The repressive state apparatus is very powerful, as is the ideological state apparatuses, but it is hard to repress or obscure the image of Bushnell's self-immolation and what it represents.

	Anyone wanting to belittle Bushnell's act of protest, with his dying words being 'free Palestine!', would, I suspect, be a heartless ghoul with a very specific agenda (one that is willing to support the ethno-nationalist, neo-colonial, apartheid, fascist state of Israel and its genocide at all costs). I'm sure Mr. Shmuley will figure out a way to condemn Bushnell as an anti-Semite and his self-immolation some kind of anti-Semitic act, though.

			Oh piss off, there is nothing whatsoever to indicate he was not of sound mind. His statements are clear. 
			
			Plenty of people have committed acts of suicide as a form of protest as far back as you can care to go historically, in basically any culture you care to name. The idea that they - all these people - were not of sound mind simply because you personally cannot fathom the act being anything other than a sign of mental disturbance is insulting to them all and their deep commitment to their causes.
			
			No one is recommending everyone commit suicide as a general form of protest in regards to Palestine. There is no risk that at the next mass demonstration, the entire attendence is going to commit mass suicide. 
			
			The fact that this is how you want to frame the discourse around this is very telling.

	Your question reminds me of the article in *La révolution surréaliste,* 1925, in which the surrealists published responses to a question they had circulated in a previous issue, "Is suicide a solution?" There are some very interesting responses here, including an affirmative response by René Crevel, a communist and surrealist who witnessed his own father's suicide and would, in 1935, take his own life. 

	The surrealists are idealists, ultimately, but they take very seriously the subjective side (as opposed to the objective side, which your question highlights) of suicide. 

	[Here's a link to the article.](https://www.marxists.org/history/france/surrealists/1925/suicide.htm) CW: as you can imagine, there is direct and frank talk of suicide throughout the article, including several responses in support of suicide.

	'This ridiculous respect is, of course, the fitting basis for the bourgeois public responding to reports of dramatic suicides with a pleasurable shudder, and liking to be culturally entertained by the lie that such a “voluntary death” really gives the audience rather a lot to “think about.” The sympathetic observer feels very close to the “question of the meaning of life” — and quite rightly, since someone has just paid his last tribute to this idiocy; only this is not at all what a morally indoctrinated intellect sees in the suicide’s “sacrifice.” Philosophers and clergymen, both pros and amateurs in fact, have not the slightest difficulty sponging ideologically off every act of bourgeois madness, so also and all the more off suicide, by blowing it up into an unsuccessful or — more rarely — even successful object lesson on the “existential emergency,” thus turning the ultimate gloominess of bourgeois self-assertion by self-destruction into an opportunity for enjoying their boring “ultimate questions.” And while the Christian churches condemn suicide because they see in it, of all things, an extreme lack of moral willingness to bear life patiently, and, in the name of their pious servitude to God, interpret self-destruction as a last radical rearing up of materialism and man’s hubristic lack of restraint; on the other side, the critical leftist takes the liberty — not only since “Mother Krause’s Journey to Happiness”[1] — of discovering in all bourgeois crap, so also in young proletarian or other “fringe-group” suicide, a misguided, but “basically” revolutionary protest against the callousness of capitalism.'

	Legitimacy, as a Marxist, means nothing to me.  I suspect you feel similar to me because of the airquotes.  Legitimacy is tool of the ruling class and their racial hierarchy to crush dissent politely.  It has no place in Marxism, Critical Theory, or Post Leftism in my opinion.  How you choose to resist the ruling class is tactical.  Not a value judgement.

	On a tactical level, self-immolation has lost most of it's shock value that it used to have.  Spectacle is sort of ineffectual against governments that don't care.  But we, weirdly enough, have never seen a US serviceman do this in all of US history.  Which was enough that it made me watch the video.  Which, critically speaking, shouldn't have shocked me as much as it did.  More than any video of all of the crimes going on in Palestine.  Enough to convince me that I should subject myself to the experience of hearing a man burn to death to hear what he had to say.  I opened up a tab and started looking at if there was a way I could help in a productive, useful way.

	That last part kind of shows how even as a leftist PoC in America, I'm still conditioned to find authority in symbols of "Big Others".  But that was kind of the point.  To take the biggest symbol of America's authority, it's true flag of digitally patterned camo, and burn it with a person that represented its authority.  I'll never forgot Aaron Bushnell.  His clarity and his conviction.  I don't think this will ever work again, and I'm ashamed to admit this about myself and probably most Americans because I can think of two self-immolations in the last two years.  This was different and is likely unrecreatable.

	I’ve thought about self-immolation often since it is not such a rare act of protest in Korea. What struck me was that rather than a buddhist monk or desperate laborer, Bushnell was a white imperial troop as well as an anarchist organizer. It’s rare to see this kind of display of political conviction and self sacrifice in the imperial core. I think that speaks to the depth of his solidarity and heart with the colonized. It also speaks to a moment where imperial contradictions are sharpening and being made more and more visible here. The goal of anti-imperialist organizing is to disrupt the social fabric of the imperial core and bring attention and sympathy to the struggle abroad. Bushnell’s sacrifice accomplished that.

That’s what I’m seeing unfold online today, though who knows about tomorrow. I can say though that back in Ireland during the troubles, the death of Bobby Sands following his hunger strike had an enormous impact on the country and had a true effect on how things proceeded from there. And a hunger strike is like watching a slow motion suicide, though maybe in that case it was the prolonged process that led to the great impact, I’m not sure.

	i’m not addressing the question of legitimacy whatsoever, because I find it to be unhelpful. Self immolation has always been a valid form of protest and has been used in multiple movements. the Arab spring started because of self immolation. The idea that it cannot revolutionize is historically inaccurate.

	I think the better question is whether or not it’s useful. I also don’t like the framework of referring to it as suicide without nuance or descriptive language, differentiating it from any act of self harm resulting in death. 

	The concept of self immolation has to do with a depravity of the national or international soul. I reject the idea that this has anything to do with mental health, because frankly many people use the excuse of mental health in several context, in order to deflect from the societal problem at hand. Whether it’s treating a school shooter as a mental health victim, a lone wolf archetype. whether we acknowledge the fact that the rise in a depression and anxiety have more to do with the circumstances of your economic state and access to various educational and medical resources like reproductive health, sex education, public school funding, etc. 

	Self immolation has less to do with the person and more to do with society. The conditions of society. And the extent that society fails the people. 

	“Our resistance is not predicated on how likely it will be to alter the conscience of the oppressor. We resist to retain our own conscience. And to awaken all others who are still in possession of their own souls.”

	—Cole Arthur Riley

	it seems kind of weird to put self immolation in the same category as hunger strikes, because hunger strikes don’t actually end til you die. they end when you appeal to the conscience of your oppressor. with self immolation, you’re already dead. your oppressor does not have to do anything at all.

		I don’t think we can “reject the idea” that it has to do with mental health. There’s a lot of commentary that it’s an extreme form of protest and not mental health related, both of those things can co-exist and be true at the same time. I think the problem is people think “mental health” can be used to discredit or downplay something, which I don’t believe is always the case. The issue is when people pull the mental health card, and don’t look at what the root cause is. I truly believe it’s because we use the term mental health in such a blanket and shallow way. 
		
		Genocides and war have vast implications on mental health, not just for civilians but also for people in military roles. I think self-immolation is an extreme act of protest, but also a result of mental health that is caused by such conflict (the root cause). That, in my eyes, doesn’t downplay what this is. It’s the reality that when Governments engage in these “battles”, they have little regard for the military personnel or civilians. It shows a ripple effect of the damage and destruction.

			ok but we are saying the same thing. I’m just saying that mental health is not the cause and we should not individualize and act like self immolation. The way we use mental health in society has always been to individualize a trauma that happens collectively. 
			
			yes, I agree that mental health can coexist, and i’m not implying that it cannot. but multiple comments and media outlets have given his death the label as suicide caused BY mental health and not BY the US aiding and abetting genocide. 
			
			you are saying [self immolation] ⬅️ [mental health] ⬅️ [societal issue].
			
			i’m saying that the mental health implications distract from the societal problem. it’s very easy to diagnose and claim that people are depressed, and they could be, but that still tells us absolutely nothing. i’m saying this mainly to combat language that I’ve seen from other people here and irl, who don’t see self immolation as a product of capitalism and imperialism, but rather the mental health problems of individual people. this is specific to the context of rejecting the legitimacy argument and individualization of the act.

	Legitimacy is an opinion.  It's what they wanted to do.

	But when I look at protest I look at efficacy and I've NEVER seen self-immolation do anything, so I beg the question "if it doesn't accomplish your goals or any step in those goals, why do it?"

	Society generally treats it like a crisis situation that went wrong and keeps on moving.

	As I keep on saying from Frederick Douglass "Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will."

	Sure, he has a demand, and he's addressing the power.  So often people miss either or both of them.  But, what he did is no means to force the hand to concede.

	So, it'll never work.

	They don't care. Thousands of people are dead already. What's one more to them?

	Returning to Frederick Douglass, without (A) the specific demand (B) addressing the exact power to change it and having (C) a means to make it concede, it will never work.

	You need all three pillars. Always.

	People need to know this.

	I know people will intellectualize this and debate this like it's in some college course, but the fundamentals to action is having it actually work.  If there's no means via any method, I don't see the point.  Better to be alive and find one that can work and force the hand to achieve one's goals than just erase yourself from existence.

	I laud Aaron for going to such extremes, but this is working on 20th century strategy which largely has been circumvented by those in power in 2024. 

	Other ways need to be determined.

	I would submit that it’s all flash and no sizzle, a virtue signaling way of protest in this particular instance. Suicide has victims. This man’s family and friends. While I do not know for certain they wanted him to live I think it’s a fair assumption some at least did. To the point of the cause I would submit his act was no more jarring that what is happening in the Gaza war itself and that reduces the shock impact self immolation needs to really spur change traditionally. Further I believe that made a lack of response a predictable outcome and makes his decision to kill himself more selfish. The loss of a “true believer” willing to commit serious acts in a cause is very damaging and instead of doing the long hard work of grass roots campaigning, fund raising, and educating (the very core fundamentals of democratic governance) he gave in to frustration for immediate action and self immolated in an emotional response to his anger and grief. But what about the anger and grief of his family and loved ones. The people that lost him forever shockingly and must face day after day of questions about him from strangers and to relive his gruesome death over and over often by accident scrolling on the internet or randomly watching tv? 

	Suicide or self harm as an agent of change is not without use, however some of the examples above where it better fits are like the monk and prisoners where they themselves are at the mercy of oppression and lack the agency to do much else. This man had plenty of agency to act and do some consistently over time which would have had much more lasting impact.

	I’m not going to comment on the legitimacy side of things, but I have a few comments. Self immolation doesn’t exist just in left or “new left” arenas. There was a self immolation not too long ago in Australia in relation to COVID-19 related mandates (vaccine specific I believe).

	I think there is predominant argument and discourse online at the moment that what Aaron did “wasn’t mental health related” or that “it’s not important”. I reject both of those things. 

	Protest and mental health can co-exist and be a result of one another. Many people protest because some world event is implicating their physical or mental health (or those around them). I do believe this was an extreme act of protest, but I also believe it is mental health related. 

	I could ramble on about this, but to keep it short. Does this not speak to how wars, genocide and violence mentally impact people? Civilians? Military personnel? Witnesses? Does it not speak to how these impacts are not just a result of using weapons? But it actually extends past that? It’s almost like mental illness is spoken about as something random or at fault of the individual. Mental illness can be caused by something. I think that is what we are seeing here.

	Thich Nhat Hnah had an interesting take on being a political action based on the historic immolations in Vietnam as protest. It’s very easy to see the parallels to today 

	On the otherhand it has been pointed out by both Thich Nhat Hnah and Russell McCutcheon that by contextualizing the event in 1963 Vietnam, the self-immolation can be seen as a "political act" aimed at calling attention to the injustices being perpetrated against the South Vietnamese people by a puppet government of Euro-American imperialism. In this context, Thich Nhat Hnah describes the act of self-immolation as follows:

	"The press spoke then of suicide, but in the essence, it is not. It is not even a protest. What the monks said in the letters they left before burning themselves aimed only at alarming, at moving the hearts of the oppressors, and at calling the attention of the world to the suffering endured then by the Vietnamese. To burn oneself by fire is to prove that what one is saying is of the utmost importance…. The Vietnamese monk, by burning himself, says with all his strength and determination that he can endure the greatest of sufferings to protect his people…. To express will by burning oneself, therefore, is not to commit an act of destruction but to perform an act of construction, that is, to suffer and to die for the sake of one’s people. This is not suicide."

	Thich Nhat Hanh goes on to explaing why Thich Quang Duc’s self-immolation was not a suicide, which is contrary to Buddhist teachings:

	"Suicide is an act of self-destruction, having as causes the following: (1) lack of courage to live and to cope with difficulties; (2) defeat by life and loss of all hope; (3) desire for nonexistence….. The monk who burns himself has lost neither courage nor hope; nor does he desire nonexistence. On the contrary, he is very courageous and hopeful and aspires for something good in the future. He does not think that he is destroying himself; he believes in the good fruition of his act of self-sacrifice for the sake of others…. I believe with all my heart that the monks who burned themselves did not aim at the death of their oppressors but only at a change in their policy. Their enemies are not man. They are intolerance, fanaticism, dictatorship, cupidity, hatred, and discrimination which lie within the heart of man."

		Protest isn’t necessarily about “materially giving” anything. The stuff about exploitation you’ve written is largely incoherent to me but seems to strip any dignity or agency from someone who would do something like a self-immolation.

		My own, personal reaction to his suicide and my desire to understand it in the context of a longer history of self-immolation and suicide protest are not mutually exclusive. It's important to know what these things mean. I also think it's a bit chauvinistic to assume that Bushnell's death for the Palestinian cause is somehow more dignified than the thousands of Palestinian journalists, children etc. who didn't even have the option to choose whether or not they died...

		The callousness with which people like you are treating this tragic waste of human life is truly disturbing to me. He supported a cause you (and I btw) also support. He killed himself while voicing his support for that cause. But that does not make him a hero or a martyr, it makes him a victim of suicide.

	Legitimate? Depends on how you view legitimacy.

	There's historical evidence of self-immolation happening, but I would have to agree with others that in the end it's just a spectacle at most, and a pure product of mental illness pre-packaged as a "political statement) in the least.

	The impact of self-immolation is near non-existent historically, and in most cases only has the smallest appearance of an effect if the issue that the "protestor' is trying to self-immolate against is universally agreed upon as an evil or is blatantly near without debate, which in this case with the Israel-Palestine conflict is NOT the case.

	To say that the popularization of self-immolation with this recent incident is significant is just a product of social media creating the appearance that this has really been a significant event, the majority of the public are not going to see this and say "HELL YEAH" or will March on Washington. The "new left" does typically use shock and spectacle to get attention, but to say that this was a product of the New Left is silly, as at the end of the day the New Left focuses on social media points rather than practical demonstrations and achievements (this is coming from a "leftist").

	Now why are the honorable deaths of soldiers in war, or the universally mourned deaths of people at the hands of dictators and opposing forces (which I'll call "villains" for the sake of simplification) celebrated or seen more normalized and reasonable to support than acts of Self-immolation? 

	I believe this comes down to having a boogie man to point fingers at. We all want to justify or place blame on someone or some thing to explain the conditions and action that led to tragedies. A "villain" is what allows for actions of meaningful self-sacrifice in war and the deaths of helpless victims to become true martyrs that galvanize people. America was easy to hop on the train that Osama Bin Laden and terrorism was an evil that needed to be destroyed in 01, proving this theory. Self sacrifice in war creates the need to "avenge" or prove the purposefulness in the soldier's death to help cope with the loss of the individual that sacrificed. I could go on with examples, but when someone is doing the evil to the victim that we can relate to its much easier to take a stand against the villain.

	Now let's take the Aaron Bushnell self-immolation, who's the villain? Who harmed our sacrifice? Himself, so who do we blame? You can't say Israel because they aren't the ones that killed him or play any responsibility in it. Hamas? Same situation, they didn't play a role. The U.S government? Again, they didn't do anything to cause this, it was Aaron himself who made the decision. 

	"Okay, but what about the shock and the attention to this controversial conflict!", yes a human being killing himself is jarringly scary, anyone that witnesses death will be shocked, but who are we supposed to blame for his death, there was only himself who decided to go about this decision, he was not a victim, just another person who supposedly cared deeply for another cause. 

	The reason other forms of sacrifice are objectively more beneficial is because they lead to a change or a greater push towards a clear concise goal, however with this situation with Aaron all it does is continue to speak to the same echo chamber that was already saying the same stuff prior to his suicide.

	What about his selfish suicide helped anyone? No Israeli, no Palestinian, and no rational person can see his death directly helped anyone.

	the us airman that just killed himself outside of israel’s embassy died for absolutely no reason, it’s not going to change the war nor has his death been trending it was a quick news report that didn’t even turn into a catalyst. His death ment nothing, it was for nothing and now he is nothing

	I am not convinced that Gaza is a genocide, but Bushnell thought so. And he was losing a genocide in his mind.

	Louis Ck has that bit about abortion protestors. That if they really thought babies were being murdered by the thousands, holding up a sign seems pretty milquetoast. 

	And this is different because thousands of actual kids have been killed. 

	I don't know if it's brave to light ourselves on fire. I think there are hundreds of better ways to enact change. I don't know if he tried to join an org that would physically help Palestinians or just posted on social media.

	But this is what the man chose, and in his conviction, this is the path he chose. We must reckon with it now.

	Another human being dead. War is a racket, it's true.

	I take issue with people saying 'now were talking about it's, like it hasn't dominated front page news since day 1.

	I also resent the fact that the news is about this guy, instead of hearing what Palestinians and Israelis have to say. This conflict has been especially dominated by foreign (I mean foreign to Israel Palestine) voices and it is unbelievably frustrating. 

	I just want to hear what they say. We live in an age of direct reporting. If you have a phone, and everybody does, you can upload your voice directly to the internet and have it be heard. In the first few weeks I heard from hundreds of Israelis and Palestinians about their situations. But slowly, we and the news took over.

	I don't care what some 17 year old living in Cincinnati thinks at this moment. But that is who we are listening to.

	And I fear that it will inspire copycats, especially in the young. The poetry of the Palestinian cause really connects to hopeless youth (that is a sizable Palestinian demographic after all), and I can see some kid attempting to self immolate to vaguely protest some sort of issue.

	That essay by that leftist org is well articulated and written but that is rare. There are hundreds of thousands of TikTok and Twitter hyperboleans that are screaming 'martyr' at this man. I don't know if that is good. 

	Rather than becoming a symbol, he is in danger of becoming a meme.

	Framing any of this as one way or the other has always been disingenuous. Life is full of paradoxes and contradictions. 

	Is he a martyr or a fool? Did he have mental issues or was he clear of vision? Will this act help or hurt?

	The answer is yes.

	I was 10 yrs old on September 11th 2001.

	I am sure many of the people who did the attacks that day, lost their lives intentionally.

	There were many copycat incidents which followed. All had a similar pattern of people willing to >blank&lt; themselves as a form of protest.

	Anyone who is not praising these acts by the army man, has a very short memory, or is too young to remember that.

	Ultimately it is dangerous to glorify such acts. No exception. It shouldn't matter if the victim/perpetrator is your political rival or if they agree with your politics 100%.

	The fact that he was an IT person is interesting. I’ve seen a few IT and science people in academia bite on hyper-left ideology whole hog with nary a bit of criticism. The Israel-Gaza war is complicated, not least because it began with a medieval atrocity incorporating rape, murder, and genital mutilation. I’d be interested in knowing what or who influenced him to do this. If he self-radicalized, it’s especially telling. To me this has been a waste of a life because it won’t accomplish anything. This war needs to be wound down, yes, but the eradication of Hamas does seem to be key. Hamas isn’t a left movement. Instead, it’s fascist.

		It turns out he was raised in a ridged Christian community with extremely rigid rules. The extreme black and white thinking is likely a reflex of that.

	To me, right now, killing yourself to protest is a poorly studied move. No shock factor on both sides, in fact, it didn't go as planned. He clearly imagined a different outcome, something more powerful. Aaron's death made me notice how divided the left actually is, though. I've seen so much left vs left hate, so many prejudices and labels thrown into the mix without rational thinking.

	And it got me questioning if people confuse dying and getting a memorial with actual change. I am pretty sure those who died would try differently if they could.

						When did I say anything about cruel or ignorant people in the past? 
						
						Your ideas here amount to: don't protest disruptively, because it doesn't change anything (studies show this perspective to be false). Also, don't have opinions on things if you can't change them, because that makes you obsessive and weird.
						
						How can we know if "the conditions are right"? How do you quantify that before taking action? This sort of complacency just serves the status quo.
