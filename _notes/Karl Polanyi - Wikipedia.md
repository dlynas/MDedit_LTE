**Karl Paul Polanyi** (; [Hungarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_language "Hungarian language"): _Polányi Károly_ [\[ˈpolaːɲi ˈkaːroj\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Hungarian "Help:IPA/Hungarian"); 25 October 1886 – 23 April 1964),<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Polanyi#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup> was an Austro-Hungarian [economic anthropologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_anthropologist "Economic anthropologist"), [economic sociologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sociologist "Economic sociologist"), and politician,<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Polanyi#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> best known for his book _[The Great Transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book) "The Great Transformation (book)"),_ which questions the conceptual validity of self-regulating markets.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Polanyi#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

In his writings, Polanyi advances the concept of the [Double Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Movement "Double Movement"), which refers to the [dialectical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical "Dialectical") process of [marketization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketization "Marketization") and push for [social protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_protection "Social protection") against that marketization. He argues that market-based societies in modern Europe were not inevitable but historically contingent. Polanyi is remembered best as the originator of [substantivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantivism "Substantivism"), a cultural version of economics, which emphasizes the way economies are embedded in society and culture. This opinion is counter to [mainstream economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_economics "Mainstream economics") but is popular in [anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology "Anthropology"), [economic history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history "Economic history"), [economic sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sociology "Economic sociology") and [political science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science "Political science").

Polanyi's approach to the ancient economies has been applied to a variety of cases, such as [Pre-Columbian America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_America "Pre-Columbian America") and ancient [Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia "Mesopotamia"), although its utility to the study of ancient societies in general has been questioned.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESilver2007_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Polanyi#cite_note-FOOTNOTESilver2007-4">[4]</a></sup> Polanyi's _The Great Transformation_ became a model for [historical sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_sociology "Historical sociology"). His theories eventually became the foundation for the [economic democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_democracy "Economic democracy") movement.

Polanyi was active in politics, and helped found the National Citizens' Radical Party in 1914, serving as its secretary.

## Early life\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Karl_Polanyi&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Early life")\]

Polanyi was born into [a Jewish family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol%C3%A1nyi "Polányi"). His younger brother was [Michael Polanyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Polanyi "Michael Polanyi"), a [philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher "Philosopher"), and his niece was [Eva Zeisel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Zeisel "Eva Zeisel"), a world-renowned [ceramist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramist "Ceramist").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHarrod2012_5-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Polanyi#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHarrod2012-5">[5]</a></sup> He was born in [Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna "Vienna"), at the time the capital of the [Austro-Hungarian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary "Austria-Hungary").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDale2016_6-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Polanyi#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDale2016-6">[6]</a></sup> His father, [Mihály Pollacsek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mih%C3%A1ly_Pol%C3%A1nyi "Mihály Polányi"), was a railway entrepreneur. Mihály never changed the name _Pollacsek_, and is buried in the Jewish cemetery in Budapest. Mihály died in January 1905, which was an emotional shock to Karl, and he commemorated the anniversary of Mihály's death throughout his life.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDale201613_7-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Polanyi#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDale201613-7">[7]</a></sup> Karl and Michael Polanyi's mother was [Cecília Wohl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cec%C3%ADlia_Wohl "Cecília Wohl"). The name change to Polanyi was made by Karl and his siblings. Polanyi was well educated despite the ups and downs of his father's fortune, and he immersed himself in [Budapest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest "Budapest")'s active intellectual and artistic scene.

## Early career\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Karl_Polanyi&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Early career")\]

Polanyi founded the radical and influential [Galileo Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Circle "Galileo Circle") while at the [University of Budapest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Budapest "University of Budapest"), a club which would have far reaching effects on Hungarian intellectual thought. During this time, he was actively engaged with other notable thinkers, such as [György Lukács](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs "György Lukács"), [Oszkár Jászi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oszk%C3%A1r_J%C3%A1szi "Oszkár Jászi"), and [Karl Mannheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Mannheim "Karl Mannheim"). Polanyi graduated from Budapest University in 1912 with a doctorate in [Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law "Law"). In 1914, he helped found the National Citizens' Radical Party of Hungary and served as its [secretary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_secretary "Party secretary").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (January 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Polanyi was a [cavalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalry "Cavalry") officer in the [Austro-Hungarian Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_Army "Austro-Hungarian Army") in [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"), in active service at the [Russian Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_I) "Eastern Front (World War I)") and hospitalized in Budapest. Polanyi supported the republican government of [Mihály Károlyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mih%C3%A1ly_K%C3%A1rolyi "Mihály Károlyi") and its [Social Democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_(Hungary) "Social Democratic Party (Hungary)") regime. The republic was short-lived, however, and when [Béla Kun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Kun "Béla Kun") toppled the Karolyi government to create the [Hungarian Soviet Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Soviet_Republic "Hungarian Soviet Republic"), Polanyi left for Vienna.

## In Vienna\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Karl_Polanyi&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: In Vienna")\]

From 1924 to 1933, he was employed as a senior editor of the prestigious _[Der Österreichische Volkswirt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_%C3%96sterreichische_Volkswirt "Der Österreichische Volkswirt")_ (_The Austrian Economist_) magazine. It was at this time that he first began criticizing the [Austrian School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School "Austrian School") of economists, who he felt created abstract models which lost sight of the organic, interrelated reality of economic processes. Polanyi himself was attracted to [Fabianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabianism "Fabianism") and the works of [G. D. H. Cole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._D._H._Cole "G. D. H. Cole"). It was also during this period that Polanyi grew interested in [Christian socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_socialism "Christian socialism").

He married the communist revolutionary [Ilona Duczyńska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilona_Duczy%C5%84ska "Ilona Duczyńska"), of Polish-Hungarian background. Their daughter [Kari Polanyi Levitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kari_Polanyi_Levitt "Kari Polanyi Levitt") carried on the family tradition of economic academic research.

## In London\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Karl_Polanyi&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: In London")\]

Polanyi was asked to resign from _Der Oesterreichische Volkswirt_ because the liberal publisher of the journal could not keep on a prominent socialist after the accession of Hitler to office in January 1933 and the suspension of the Austrian parliament by the rising tide of clerical fascism in Austria. He left for London in 1933, where he earned a living as a journalist and tutor and obtained a position as a lecturer for the [Workers' Educational Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_Educational_Association "Workers' Educational Association") in 1936. His lecture notes contained the research for what later became _[The Great Transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book) "The Great Transformation (book)")_. However, he would not start writing this work until 1940, when he moved to [Vermont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont "Vermont") to take up a position at [Bennington College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennington_College "Bennington College"). The book was published in 1944, to great acclaim. In it, Polanyi described the [enclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure "Enclosure") process in [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England "England") and the creation of the contemporary economic system at the beginning of the 19th century.

## United States and Canada\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Karl_Polanyi&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: United States and Canada")\]

Polanyi joined the staff of [Bennington College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennington_College "Bennington College") in 1940, teaching a series of five timely lectures on the "Present Age of Transformation".<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Polanyi#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Polanyi#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> The lectures "The Passing of the 19th Century",<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Polanyi#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> "The Trend Towards an Integrated Society",<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Polanyi#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> "The Breakdown of the International System",<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Polanyi#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> "Is America an Exception?",<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Polanyi#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> and "Marxism and the Inner History of the Russian Revolution"<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Polanyi#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> took place during the early stages of World War II. Polanyi participated in [Bennington's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennington_College "Bennington College") Humanism Lecture Series (1941)<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Polanyi#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> and [Bennington College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennington_College "Bennington College")'s Lecture Series (1943) where his topic was "[Jean Jacques Rousseau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Jacques_Rousseau "Jean Jacques Rousseau"): Or Is a Free Society Possible?"<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Polanyi#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>

After the war, Polanyi received a teaching position at [Columbia University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University "Columbia University") (1947–1953). However, his wife, [Ilona Duczyńska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilona_Duczy%C5%84ska "Ilona Duczyńska") (1897–1978), had a background as a former [communist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism "Communism"), which made gaining an entrance visa in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") impossible. As a result, they moved to [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada"), and Polanyi commuted to New York City. In the early 1950s, Polanyi received a large grant from the [Ford Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Foundation "Ford Foundation") to study the economic systems of ancient empires.

Having described the emergence of the modern economic system, Polanyi now sought to understand how "the economy" emerged as a distinct sphere in the distant past. His seminar at Columbia drew several famous scholars and influenced a generation of teachers, resulting in the 1957 volume _Trade and Market in the Early Empires_. Polanyi continued to write in his later years and established a new journal entitled _Coexistence_. In Canada he lived in [Pickering, Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickering,_Ontario "Pickering, Ontario"), where he died in 1964.
