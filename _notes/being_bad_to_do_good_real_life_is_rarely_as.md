## Being bad to do good | Real life is rarely as simple as moral codes suggest. In practice, we often must violate moral values to avoid the most morally unacceptable outcomes.

	I didn't watch the entire video (that pesky registration wall, again), so I looked up the "dirty hands" concept, and it seems to mesh quite well with what common day-to-day moral reasoning looks like, i.e., moral values are important until they fail to deliver a highly desirable moral outcome.

	In this sense, dirty hands theory is the very essence of civil disobedience; people can both believe that following the law is important moral value, but when breaking the law leads to a greater moral good, they celebrate the lawbreakers. The problem, it seems, is the idea that now anyone can justify any action by claiming that they needed to dirty their hands, and should be seen as courageous. And in a society where people believe that "morality" = "the right things happen (either now, or in the end) all the time," but social trust is low, a theory that would prevent judgment is seen as suspect.

	[Edited for clarity. Hopefully.]

			*Chaotic*-Good implies an active avoidance of 'law,' and the goodness is a side-factor.
			
			To use Star Wars; I would put Luke Skywalker as Lawful-Good, Leia Organa as Neutral-Good, and Han Solo (or Jyn Erso) as Chaotic-Good.
			
			Luke is all about the end result, but follows 'the Way' to do it (law).  Leia is all about the end result, and will vary between being a shrewd diplomat (law) and a revolutionary spy (chaos) to do it.  Han is all about the end result, but will intentionally choose the shadier aspects, even when the less-shady option are still on the table.

				*pushing up nerd glasses* 
				Actually lawful-chaotic do not have much of anything to do with the law of the land but rather the subjectivity and context sensitiveness of a moral veiwpoint.
				
				Lawful indicates a ridged structure of black and white thinking. Murder, theft, vandalism? They are intrinsically wrong, ignoring context. The means justify the ends.
				
				Chaotic on the other hand treats every situation as subjective and distinct, no action is wrong in a vaccine it is intents and outcomes that determine how correct something is, the ends justify the means.
				
				At least that's the theory,in practice writers have come up with dozens of definitions for that alignment axis since it first appeared

		I disagree with the "following the law"= moral value, laws only have meaning if there is moral value to the law. Anyone with sufficient political power can write laws that are completely heretical to what we consider moral in the modern day; slavery used to be legal alongside abuse, torture, and religious persecution. The law is in no way shape or form inherently representative of morality, it's just the rules a society codified and enforced.   
		
		
		The real basis of morality ought to be in survival value, a social species like humans can't survive without rules of conduction, spoken and unspoken, therefore we created moral systems. If homo sapiens didn't do it then there would have been chaos and anarchy and some other species of primate would have beaten us to the punch and out competed us because their ability to cooperate was better.   
		
		
		In any case morality represents rules of conduct that are beneficial for social cohesion and survival, if there exists superior sets of conduct then pushing for it ought to be desirable even if it means breaking the written law.

			The law recognizes the difference between "**malum in se**", evil in itself, ie, morally wrong, like murder, and "**malum prohibitum**", ie, an arbitrary rule of law, eg: closing hours for shops. 
			
			Civil Disobedience to a "malum prohibitum" law has no moral dimension, though it may still result in civil penalties.
			
			Eg: in my state, the basic rule on vehicle speed is that you should drive safely given the conditions at the time. In addition certain streets may have posted maximum speeds.
			
			Violation of the first rule (driving unsafely) is malum in se, violation of the 2d rule (speeding) is malum prohibitum.

		Moral principles are independent of law. Obeying the law is a utilitarian bargain. He is smudging the space between moral behavior and utilitarian behavior. This guy wants to replace morals with utilitarianism to create an expedient morality. Very appropriate to our age and times to drag morality into politics.

			The problem of dirtying hands doesnt have to do with laws being moral whatsoever. they obviously can and can not be. Theyre just being used as an example. It suggests the idea that anyone can act in what they consider an immoral action if it results in a greater moral result. 
			
			
			Which brings about a whole bunch of interesting questions. What is the extent of immorality that can occur while still accomplishing a moral result? How dirty are you, society, or a political leader willing to get their hands to accomplish a moral result? Whose morality is the basis for the action?. is it what mao or the nazis deemed moral? Is it what eisenhower deemed moral when he decided to drop the bomb? is it what you or i or crazy carl down the street deems moral?which leads to a way that anyone can now subjectively argue justifying any action.
			
			
			Edit: a great example of the problem is given by imagining a politican that is elected based on a campaign of noncombative approaches to other nations/individuals and strict peace. However a civil war breaks out opposing his peaceful ideals by violent minority of the population. A soldier of the violent group is captured and holds information on bombs that are going to explode in 24 hours in all major cities. In order to protect the population that elected him based on his peaceful ideals, to what extent is the politican willing to dirty his hands? Does he peacefully talk and release the soldier, or does he dirty his hands and do whatever it takes, including torture and potentially killing, for information?

			* üü¶ **[deleted]** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1 _(2020-04-30 03:09:50)_

				Scope is central to his assertion and where he inserts his moral expediency. It's wrong to kill, narrow scope. It's write to switch the trolley to kill fewer people. Conflating the objects; you're not killing when you switch the trolley, you're saving lives. This is where he errs in trying to make both about killing while changing scope. He says the morals change with scope. I think enough people find contempt in his reasoning to dismiss him outright and this provides him oxygen where there shouldn't be any. 
				
				As for the law, this is a utilitarian bargain. We collectively consent to obey the law for a prescribed benefit. This becomes moral and logical grounds to challenge law when the bargain between cost and benefit comes up short. We do cry the sky is falling because this is selective to accommodate moral exigency.

			Of course it has something to do with morality. They will not be a perfect reflection of all moral beliefs, which would be impossible anyway. They may even be immoral on some points themselves. But to say the law is divorced form morality is to not understand law at all. The law is an imperfect means for society to function within different moral frameworks, including the framework of absolute greed. It is also a means of denying cetain moral beliefs, such as slavery. The law is essentially rooted in morality.

		Consider the vegan paradox. Timeline impacts moral threshold. Context matters. 200 years ago we ate to survive. We chose what we ate to optimize our survival and that of our children. That was morally correct. Now, we develop a vegan diet to be morally correct, kindness to animals. Is moral choice a matter of convenience in this case? We can afford to choose so we take the high ground. Some are not so advantaged. Are non vegans now, less moral than vegans? Is moral code a construct of the social system you live in? Are morals then different based on these variables. Laws which govern us today are designed for our current society. Changes in variables may outdate a law causing us to break a law to remain moral in the current context. Should we remove statues of heros who owned slaves? Is there such a thing as concrete core values? Or is it all relative. Before you act to be right or moral, validate your context.

			Its weird meat is more expensive but veganism from western male is essentially a change in one's own culture. Not as simple as buying vegan products, whole cloth recipes, taste pallets, reward pay off, unforseen nutritional issues. If someone, particularly handsome someone, tried but for watever reason couldnt continue. I think contemplation of the good, scenario gaming, resulting in new good acts and finally post reflection and feedback.  
			
			
			I like your point about the time and scope. Morality is also prone to flux, neboulous ongoing human project. i.e. Mickail Khordokovsky, if he wasn't locked up by Putin, expelled from Eden and was still a CEO of say another ruthless oil company, i wouldn't see him as 'heroic'. Other CEO's building coal mines today i definitely would push the cart to their track because we are all on the other track.

		(These are my truths and not everyone else's. I don't tell anyone how to live. I try to help and thats all you can do)Reality is often misunderstood. Not only is there the physical reality of law, state of being, where we are as society on earth, but further we tend to forget about our true reality within. If you've explored your mind, you have as much right to the reality you find within your mind as anyone else. You know truth, which is stronger than physical reality. It's more about being mindful. If you strongly believe in good and helping others, those that use their spiritual/meta gifts for good know that they can attempt and in many cases succeed in changing mindsets through mindfulness, using the skills you've been given to navigate the often "bad" realities you face. On the physical reality side, Is killing someone that is about to kill someone else "bad"? Some would argue no. Be mindful. Use your judgement to the best logical move backed by goodness and a little love to break through the barriers you face.

		\>   following the law is important moral value, but when breaking the law leads to a greater moral good, they celebrate the lawbreakers.
		
		These people tend to follow a "higher" law, the "Natural Law" or "God's Moral code written on your heart". Following the law is only moral, so long as it is in sync with the Natural Law. But when it comes to natural law, there is no "dirty hands theory". it falls apart in the face of a  faith based law. You have to believe that willful murder, (meaning not imminent self-defense) always brings about a worse outcome ( a deontological position ), than not murder. (under a natural law code that includes that position). Under this kind of moral code / natural law, the kill one innocent to save a hundred from a death unrelated to you, becomes clear "Thou shalt not kill". It doesn't matter if that means 100 people fall into a spike pit, YOU didn't do that, YOU have to believe that YOU murdering a person will cause a worse outcome in the end (for you and everyone), than murdering them to save 100 people.
		
		This is why day to day moral reasoning lends itself to evil, and corruption. How can you know the consequences of your actions, BEFORE you take the action? You can't. Not in it's entirety. What if killing baby Hitler actually caused something even worse to happen, like Nuclear Annihilation? You can't know before hand. So most people devote themselves to a faith / natural law / moral code.

	In this short talk, Stephen de Wijze examines the concept of ‚Äòdirty hands‚Äô ‚Äì the idea that many of us, especially our politicians, must break moral rules in order to prevent greater evils.

	He explains how dirty hands are a feature of our moral reality. Contrary to many thinkers, including Elizabeth Anscombe, who hold that ‚Äòdirty hands‚Äô it not just wrong but dangerous, de Wijze argues ‚Äòdirty hands‚Äô is unavoidable in moral theory.

	De Wijze grounds his argument in literature, film and real-life examples of painful decisions between bad and worse, and argues these situation occur most often in politics. Politics, he reasons, is about compromise. As such, the nature of politics inevitably involves getting dirty hands. This premise haunts our popular culture ‚Äì from Game of Thrones to Star Trek ‚Äì demonstrating how refusing to get dirty hands can lead to catastrophic consequences.

					People who know more about moral philosophy than me please correct me, but to me hypocrisy has very little to do with morals, and much more to do with perception. I don't see why being hypocritical would be immoral unless you're a strict deontologist (and even then it would depend), or someone who places value on not being a hypocrite for some particular reason
					
					I ask mostly because I believe most people in society place way too much negative connotation on the idea of a hypocrite. I don't think being a hypocrite is bad, I think in many cases it's the proper course of action.

								There's a performative contradiction in a heavy smoker telling you not to smoke, for example, and that contradiction could be characterized as hypocrisy. But unless we're going to embrace something like Socrates' moral intellectualism, the contradiction may be due to the lure of addiction rather than a lack of conviction.

							An honest person can be a hypocrite.
							
							For instance, pretty much all parents are hypocrites with their children. Because parents drink and smoke and argue and have sex even though they tell their kids to do none of those things. I don't think that should be considered immoral, though, because advising your kids not to do those things is the right thing to do, and doing those things is natural for adults (even if they should be moderated)

				I think it can be sort of seen as being about honouring a commitment, the more involved you get in anything at all the more you‚Äôre always going to be compromising your own rules or at least some of the rules you assume yourself to have. Either the responsibility to the commitment and the good you can do when involved supersedes all else or you withdraw from the process as a consequence and in doing that you find you no longer have any active role.  If you break a commitment, even accidentally, through a conflict with your own rule, it‚Äôs very hard to re-invest to the same level and get accepted again.

		> the idea that many of us, especially our politicians, must break moral rules in order to prevent greater evils.
		
		The state organization SOP is breaking moral rules, it is the methodology that allows for their continuance. The argument for this, and remember an argument isn't a conclusion, is that the state is required to manage or decrease harms that would otherwise exist at greater numbers. 
		     
		So which politicians/state employees actions, which are unethical, cause less harm than those their actions are purported to address? What evils are prevented by illegitimate takings? Do law enforcement employees stop rights infringements or perpetrate them at a greater rate? Who actually attempts to quantify this? 
		    
		I'm focusing on this because it seems to me the example he uses implies he hasn't considered this large ongoing ethical issue. How can you apply the dirty hands concept to a group that can't coherently defend their dirty hands- if they consider it at all? 
		     
		>de Wijze argues ‚Äòdirty hands‚Äô is unavoidable in moral theory.
		   
		Each dispute is discrete, having novel variables that must be analyzed. The dirty hands concept describes a more complex dispute situation. But the burden is on the dirty hands arguer, as measurable ongoing or past harms have more weight than possible future harms. These aren't equal harms, one exists one might exist. 
		     
		>Politics, he reasons, is about compromise.
		  
		Politics within a state framework is about conflict for ill-gotten resources and rules for some not others. This isn't compromise, it's actually war where the violence and threats are obfuscated by layers of third parties. 
		   
		Negotiation is about compromise, contract theory is about compromise. 
		    
		>demonstrating how refusing to get dirty hands can lead to catastrophic consequences.

								Dirty hands theorists say: I don't like "doing the math." I really don't want to do the math. And in most situations, the math disgusts me. I am not a utilitarian. I want to follow rules, not math. But I feel compelled to do the math because if I don't, we will face catastrophe. (Think, for example, of torturing a terrorist who planted a bomb, and you want to know where the bomb is).
								
								**Dirty hands theorists further say this:** doing the math is a problem not only because it violates moral rules, but man, it's really hard to do. It's really, really hard to get the math right. In most circumstances, we will get it wrong. That's why we need to only ever really do it when it becomes absolutely, utterly, undeniably necessary.

In story background was that this was based on an incident where a precoginitve was forced to tell what he knew and that led to a terrorist organization setting off a nuclear bomb. If is right that precognitives should have the right to act with impunity, then it must have been right for that first precog to be forced into such a situation that brought about that law...but the law is based on the idea that it was wrong to force that precog to reveal his knowledge. 
				
				It also assumes that precognitives choose the right future. I can see a future where billions die, but I am happy, should I choose that future? Should I choose a future that benefits everyone but me? Your very moral beliefs influence what is the right future, and it need not be shared by others.  Even if one believes the ends justify the means, it is not just the means that can be objectionable.
				
				There are, in the story, even varying degrees of precognitive power. Knowing the outcome in 5 minutes, does not mean that outcome is desirable in 10 minutes.

Aristotle says that we cannot be blamed for involuntary actions (actions that we are forced to do, or actions that we do unknowingly). Would ‚Äúdirty hands‚Äù actions just be considered involuntary, then? We are forced to do a bad action since there are no possible good actions. If so, then we can‚Äôt be blamed for them.

	There is a common law principle of jurisprudence that the law may not require a person to do an impossibility. Therefore a person may not be punished for Failing to do an impossibility.

	If a person is presented with a choice of ONLY 2 evils, and it is impossible for him to do 'good', the only proper course would be to select the lesser of the evils, and the law shouldn't punish him for that.

	I've never ascribed my actions - or otherwise subscribed, myself, - to a moral code. There are definitely things I believe, such as in the value of human life, but these beliefs persist in contention with other beliefs, such as that there is no *real* (read: objective) value to human life, or that a human eating an animal is not *really* justifiable, ethically.

	Particularly in the case of the latter, I have found a lot of discussions with people about the morality of eating animals is incredibly offensive to them. Often, I've found that people can believe that since eating animals is justified in their worldview, suggesting that this might not be the case helps them to associate you with other 'bad' things in their worldview (such as being a 'crazy protester' who steals property and attacks farmers)

	Moral codes, I feel, aren't meant to be a proactive way to live your life virtuously. They are a way to identify enemies and avoid being them, since what is not your enemy is (passably) good.

	And boy oh boy can this lead to some pretty horrifying situations. Practical example: American masses protesting 'tyranny' at the expense of what could easily amount to hundreds of thousands of deaths, and potential millions.

	They don't really believe they're being herded into slavery by being asked to stay at home and make do with regulated services. They just believe that it's 'wrong' and, as such, any action taken to reject this moral trespass is righteous.

	It is difficult to argue against self-righteousness. Even in the face of collateral damage and death.

		Exact moral codes are not helpful in any regard. When these codes become law or constitutions, we practically worship it like it's infallible. In my opinion, all morality is fallible, and moral justice is only a means to cope with a world that doesn't serve our social nature.

				I see what you mean. VR is a very interesting premise: why not make a heaven for yourself, designed to satisfy every every one of your needs? 
				
				But I think we will become dissatisfied with realities we craft too. We are always going to be dissatisfied with what we are given. I think contentment has to be an act that oneself has to take; we have to accept our circumstances instead of running after things that could satisfy us. If we don't, we are uneasy, running from one pleasure to the next. I think VR/augmented reality will just be another tool that will enable that endless loop. 
				
				Also: while VR is promising, I can't ever see myself being fooled to believe that what I'm experiencing is prime reality, since, in the first place, we will choose to live in an illusion. That, I think, would undermine the simulation's purpose, and cause me to be even more discontent.

					Ah, well I play lots of video games, was raised on online roleplays and built intricate relationships between all of my toys and models and slowly built up headcannon that justified revolts, assassinations, the rise of heroes to quash dissent and secret elopings between disenfranchised children of the aristocracy. :P
					
					Handing me a world full of disorder and unexpected turns of events (alongside a couple of trusted friends or areas or respite, naturally) would make it difficult to pry me away.
					
					I think VR would be at its greatest (or possibly most malicious) with the advent of generalised AI. A perpetual dungeonmaster, so to speak, tapped into your emotions and feeding you brand new concepts whenever your attention begins to wane.
					
					But you're right to think that even this could be dissatisfying. I would lean into the line of thought that being handed excitement, chaos and stability as my mood warrants would be enough to sate my *personal* boredom permanently, but 1) I could grow accustomed to this rate of stimulation and began to want even more to the point that it becomes infeasible for me to consume, and 2) Even if it did work on me, there's no guarantee similar concepts would be as effective on others.
					
					That said, if we spent 99% of our lives in these universes, at least some of us would still occasionally come out again - either to fix problems, or just check in with society's progress.
					
					Even at a snail's pace, there is room to make decisions that impact the future of ourselves, our community, our planet and - assuming we reach that point - our entire universe (which will likely end in some capacity, taking us along with it if we were to just ignore it).
					
					So I guess, in conclusion, my entire point has turned out to be that everything I just wrote is non-feasible? :P

		So, if you believe no human life has any real value, how much value do animals have? And if animals have less value than humans, or more, why is an already unvalued creature eating an equally valueless creature justifiable or not?

		* üüß **[MysteryYoghurt](https://www.reddit.com/user/MysteryYoghurt)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1 _(2020-04-29 17:24:36)_

			So clarification: I believe both that human life has value, but recognise that it also does not. The dead homeless guy on the street has no inherent value. The rich man who dies in a hotel in his sleep has no inherent value.
			
			We ascribe value to these people. Commonly, their productivity, their family ties or their likeability. 
			
			Animals become 'more' valuable once we name them, or adopt them. Eating dogs is taboo because they are commonly our family members. Boiling lobsters alive is relatively ignored because they're nothing more than luxury food waiting to be utilised accordingly.
			
			To answer your questions directly, I don't believe animals innately have more value than humans, but there's no justification upon which eating a lion is any more ethical than a lion eating me beyond the subjective value placed upon myself VS the value of the lion (eg: feeding prisoners to lions posits that the lions are more valuable than said prisoners).
			
			In regards to the ethical argument against eating animals, this is based upon the subjective value of life over non-life; and applying it consistently. Meat is a luxury, not a necessity.
			
			I do eat meat, but am a hypocrite. I recognise that it is ethically indefensible (unless you lean your weight on luxury as an argument to perpetuate mass slaughter.)

			That is not a very well fleshed out thought of yours. If you think about it for a second, you will realize that an incongruity exists only because of lax fuzzy use of definitions. The incongruity you proclaim exists only because of the assumption you make in this question that all values of "killing" must have the same moral laws and weights.
			
			"Homicide" and "assisted suicide" may both fall under the colloquial term "killing", but are just fundamentally different acts. "Homicide" or "murder" both require the recipient to be unwilling to end his life and be of sound mind or not suffering, while "assisted suicide" requires the recipients willingness to end his life or be suffering and entirely unable to ever be able to actively consent (such as turning off life support).
			
			So to ask this question only makes sense if you assume that all of these acts, which are fundamentally different even excluding specific circumstance, MUST have the exact same moral value and weight, because only then would prohibiting to bend or circumvent the rules actually force these two things to be equally right or wrong.
			
			Not saying there can't be systems of morality in which they actually have the same value of right or wrong, just that these really really aren't the only sensible ones that can exist.
			
			Also I don't understand how your question has anything to do with what he wrote. This is a complete non sequitur IMO.

		No- a utilitarian assessment of what is "good" is to minimize suffering and death and to maximize happiness and pleasure.
		
		Killing tens of millions of people is virtually impossible to justify with some hypothetical even greater ultimate end. Although it is not literally impossible that such a horrific and serious situation could occur where killing tens of millions is nonetheless optimal compared to any alternative. Such as preventing a catastrophe that would annihilate the entire earth, for example. But a world war, compared to not having a world war, is far, far from a case where that is anywhere approaching reasonable.

			your argument is paper thin.  Even tens of millions of people are a drop in the bucket when we're talking about 10000 years of peace.
			
			The biggest problem with utilitarianism is that it's not objective.  Even if 10000 years of peace did not follow a reality where Hitler took over the world it only matters if Hitler believed he was right.  You can label him a terrible person after the fact, but if he believed he was doing the world a favor in the moment then that's all he needs to justify his own actions.  And if his actions were responsible for 10000 years of peace would you change your mind and think he was justified?
			
			Even if you feel like you're a logical and reasonable person and that you have limitations on what you're capable of doing to accomplish a goal you're underestimating yourself - and worse than that you're underestimating other people.

			People got too hung up on the Hitler thing. I think the point was missed. But it doesn't really matter.
			
			There's no way to know what's good or bad anyway. You need to know the consequence of any action to be able to objectively tie positive morality to it. Intent doesn't matter and it's impossible to know the consequence until it's happened, and even then it's only your best guess unless you're able to see the consequence of an alternate action. Without time travel, I think that's impossible.

			A homogenous culture has less conflict, this is just documented fact. So if Hitler had won, a homogenous culture would have spread.
			
			Let's say it held until the end of humanity itself, however many centuries or millennia that might take. It seems reasonable to conclude from such an argument that at some point, a utilitarian would have to accept that the "benefits" of cultural homogeneity in reducing conflict would have countered the deaths it cost to create.
			
			So consequentialists and utilitarians must allow that, in some circumstances, Hitler  would have been a good guy. Needless to say, this is a tough pill to swallow.

								A philosopher king is more along the lines of an *expert in the subject of civil governance*, who gives up private property and personal ambition in service of the state, rather like a very extreme form of highly trained civil servant. Granted, one vested with extreme amounts of executive power.
								
								That being said, I think modern political theory is pretty clear that the idea of a benevolent dictator is naive- and that even a philosopher-king as a concept presents an unacceptably high risk of corruption and abuse.

									> who maintains power by repression and commits atrocities against their own people.
									
									Neither of these are necessary conditions for authoritarianism *or* fascism (except the repression of the opposition specifically), though I'd prefer to stick with authoritarianism for now anyway. Authoritarianism is *just* about the enhancement of obedience in exchange for the loss of liberties. The philosopher king concept included some authoritarian angles. Namely because of their executive power.
									
									Whether or not it's naive is irrelevant; the purpose of the discussion (this is /r/philosophy, right? Not /r/polisci?) is to pinpoint where that conviction comes from and how to determine that it's philosophically consistent and not simply cherry-picked.
									
									While we may agree that a benevolent dictator is naive, they've definitely had some historical presence in humanity. If we can agree that a benevolent dictator can exist, no matter how unlikely, the point is to determine how we differentiate between the good ones and the bad ones. Or is there, by definition, no such thing as a benevolent dictator? Why?

										I think to answer this question we must graduate from simple utilitarianism to Mill's concept of **rule utilitarianism.**
										
										Specifically, with respect to government and public policy, we are in effect playing an iterated game in the long term rather than a single, isolated instance of one iteration of some game in game theory.
										
										So we are not only concerned with the outcome of a single instance- we are concerned with repetition and concerned with **all** iterations of this game being played.
										
										A benevolent dictator may be an ideal government. But even if we allow that, the problem is, you have invested absolute power into one person in one office, and you must also be worried about successors into that office. Who may not necessarily be as benevolent or as capable. Subsequent iterations of this 'game of governance' may be sufficiently terrible that it outweighs the benefit of the occasional capable, benevolent dictator.
										
										A government of limited powers is a solution to this problem, where the benefits of a benevolent executive are tempered, but also the vicissitudes of a tyrant are also mitigated.
										
										&amp;#x200B;
										
										Briefly stated, society is better served from a utilitarian standpoint by adopting a **rule** of limiting powers, than it is by adopting a rule of unlimited executive power even if in the short-term it were to result in a single benevolent dictator which might be highly advantageous for a short while.
										
										This rule will in some cases actually decrease immediate utility, but the rule has a net effect of increasing utility at scale and in the long run, and this is the metric by which we judge whether a rule is a good rule.
										
										&amp;#x200B;
										
										This is a similar line of logic as to why utilitarianism does not devolve into outrageous hedonism- because short-term pleasures can be harmful to long-term interests; for example the use of pleasurable but addictive drugs. But applied on a level of large groups of people, and applied over a long span of time.

						So are you commiting to the position that if it could be done without violence, a global fascist state would be preferable to the current one? The way I'm reading this is that you think the problem with the nazis were the means they chose to reach their ends, but the ends themseleves werent bad.

								Yes it's conjectured, but you can certainly conjecture based on the fact that fascism didn't make the German people super happy all the time, so it probably wouldn't do so if it were global. But do you have a moral system to suggest that can be proven empirically?
								
								If you're hung up on empiricism (which honestly I don't think is helpful when thinking about ethics), a utilitarian would point out that at least their positions are theoretically falsifiable.

										>Even if the fascism is short-lived, the cultural homogeneity it creates might result in long-term peace
										
										
										Why think this? Has a fascist state ever looked like it was going to be able to do this?
										
										This level of empiricism is just not worth dealing with. Maybe hopping on your right leg exactly 38 times every tuesday at 3:15 will make you a happier person, you won't know until you try it would you?
										
										The whole point of a thought experiment is to be intuitive, why would you choose "maybe the nazi utopia is the best possible system of government"? Can't you at least go with brave new world or something?
										
										Also, did you notice the part of your link that says "Eight Ways of Dealing with the Repugnant Conclusion"? It's like two thirds of the article, I think this definitely counts as at least a little controversial right?

										Your linked paper on "The Repugnant Conclusion" is terribly poor support for your position, I quote:
										
										>If the woman postpones her pregnancy, then the child that is brought into existence will not be identical to the child she would have had, had she decided to become pregnant while she was ill (it will not be the same ovum and sperm that meet). Hence, **the alternative for the child brought into existence during the mother‚Äôs illness is non-existence**, and to claim that it would have been better for this child if the mother had postponed pregnancy is tantamount to claiming that non-existence would have been better for her. Assuming that the child has a life worth living, this seems wrong if not nonsensical
										
										(emphasis added)
										
										You don't seriously believe that we have a moral duty to give birth to every child possible "because existence > nonexistence" do you? There would be no time for anything else (lol). Hypothetical people don't count; they experience neither pleasure nor suffering.
										
										This is not worthy of even being brought up in this discussion.

						>  I'm pointing out the well known fact that consequentialism and utilitarianism don't entirely agree with our moral intuitions, given they both justify fascism, authoritarianism and plenty of other morally abhorrent philosophies, as long as those philosophies happen to optimize the utility function.
						
						I'm not the person you were responding to, but there are versions of utilitarianism that place high/infinite value on things that are incompatible with fascism, authoritarianism, and so forth. Mill's utilitarianism is one such version, with its distinction between higher and lower pleasures.
						
						This comes out most clearly in *Considerations on Representative Government*, in which Mill argues for the claim that liberty/autonomy is one of (or maybe *the*) highest of higher pleasures and that authoritarian rulers‚Äîeven benevolent ones‚Äîcannot provide anything other than lower pleasures.
						
						And since any amount of a higher pleasure outweighs any amount of a lower pleasure in Mill's calculus (which does not negate the fact that we may need to indulge in some lower pleasures to continue living), fascism can never result in a better world according to his analysis.
						
						So while it is trivially easy to problematize any sort of simplistic or purely mathematical form of consequentialism, the more robust versions tend to me more resilient to such objections. Mill is not your average utilitarian, of course, but he may well be the best one.

							> I'm not the person you were responding to, but there are versions of utilitarianism that place high/infinite value on things that are incompatible with fascism, authoritarianism, and so forth.
							
							Agreed! But let's first acknowledge that there are inherent problems with such a calculational approach. Some utilitarian premises were adopted specifically to avoid repugnant conclusions. It's kinda like p-hacking in the sciences. It decreases my confidence in the basic approach.
							
							> So while it is trivially easy to problematize any sort of simplistic or purely mathematical form of consequentialism, the more robust versions tend to me more resilient to such objections.
							
							Absolutely, but they will have their own failings. If we take Mills' liberty/autonomy as the highest good, then humans now face an existential threat from technology: what right does the government have in restricting individuals from creating a biolab with which they might cure diseases, or might create them? What's the calculation of which is more likely, and which is more helpful or devastating?

					I think these people who are making this insane argument just don't have any appreciation for how horrible fascist rule was and would have been. The idea that it results in "less conflict" is **fucking insane**.
					
					If fascists had conquered the whole world under one nation-state then border conflict between nations would obviously disappear, but the internal conflict, internal strife, and violent repression would be **perpetual**. Just because that conflict isn't between different nation-states with different borders does not mean there is "less conflict."
					
					Fascist rule would be so intolerable it would lead to huge revolts all over the world on a regular basis. Internment and death camps the world over. Routine genocide. Violent repression and secret police. Ongoing military crackdowns and state violence against people the world over. Ten thousand years of unending suffering, misery, fear, and death.
					
					This is not a net positive. No utilitarian would ever, ever, argue for it. Ten thousand years of fascist rule would be so unbelievably horrifying it would be worth fighting a war costing tens of millions of lives **just to prevent it from happening**.

				You people are off the fucking deep end.
				
				Fascism would be so repressive, so intolerable, so genocidally insane, that eventually it would have resulted in a successful violent revolution. Possibly after quite a few unsuccessful revolts being violently crushed. Even in the short span Hitler was actually in power there were no less than 22 attempted coups and assassination attempts against him and his government.
				
				There is no scenario where fascist rule results in less death, less suffering, less conflict, or greater total utility.

					While pretty much everyone might agree with this claim, let's be honest and admit that this only conjecture, and so your counterargument that fascism could never be utilitarian is unverifiable.
					
					Edit:
					>I can't believe people are actually saying that war, genocide, and fascist repression are somehow "beneficial" because it results in "less conflict."
					
					No one is saying that. But, consequentialism does take the long view about how much good was balanced against how much bad when looking back retrospectively from the end of time. If war, genocide and fascist repression did somehow result in overall less death, unhappiness, etc. than competing alternatives, then it's considered good in that moral framework.

						This is the difference between sealing the bulkhead with men inside to save the ship from sinking, and a delusional and fervid madness that attempts to justify flagrant atrocities with no basis other than its own self-righteous gratification.
						
						&amp;#x200B;
						
						Is it sometimes necessary to do harmful things in order to help? Absolutely. Surgeons cut the patient to cure them.
						
						Does this mean that atrocities, genocide, war, and repression are justified? Hell the fuck no.
						
						You would make the argument that violent repression results in "peace" simply because the populace is too terrified to oppose you. Or that genocide results in "order" by simply slaughtering anyone that disrupts your control.
						
						&amp;#x200B;
						
						The totality of the situation considered, fascist "peace" is worse than outright war to avoid it. Ten thousand years of fascism? A utilitarian assesses that as *negative*, indeed **so negative it is worth fighting a war costing tens of millions of lives to ensure it never happens**.
