**Participatory democracy**, **participant democracy**, **participative democracy**, or **semi-direct democracy** is a [form of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_of_government "Form of government") in which [citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship "Citizenship") participate individually and directly in political decisions and policies that affect their lives, rather than through [elected representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elected_representatives "Elected representatives").<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> Elements of [direct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy "Direct democracy") and [representative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy "Representative democracy") are combined in this model.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>

## Overview\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Participatory_democracy&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Overview")\]

Participatory democracy is a type of [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy "Democracy"), which is itself a form of [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government "Government"). The term "democracy" is derived from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") expression δημοκρατία (dēmokratia) _(δῆμος/[dēmos](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/demos "wiktionary:demos")_: people, _Κράτος/[kratos](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Kratos "wiktionary:Kratos")_: rule).<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> It has two main subtypes, [direct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy "Direct democracy") and [representative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy "Representative democracy"). In the former, the people have the authority to deliberate and decide [legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislation "Legislation"); in the latter, they choose governing [officials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official "Official") to do so. While direct democracy was the original concept, its representative version is the most widespread today.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

[Public participation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_participation "Public participation"), in this context, is the inclusion of the public in the activities of a [polity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polity "Polity"). It can be any process that directly engages the public in [decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making "Decision-making") and gives consideration to its input.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> The extent to which political participation should be considered necessary or appropriate is under debate in [political philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_philosophy "Political philosophy").<sup id="cite_ref-:2_6-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:2-6">[6]</a></sup>

Joining [political parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party "Political party") allows citizens to participate in democratic systems, but is not considered participatory democracy.

Participatory democracy is primarily concerned with ensuring that citizens have the opportunity to be involved in decision-making on matters that affect their lives.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_6-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:2-6">[6]</a></sup> It is not a new concept and has existed in various forms since the [Athenian democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy "Athenian democracy"). Its modern [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory "Theory") was developed by [Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau "Jean-Jacques Rousseau") in the 18th century and later promoted by [John Stuart Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill "John Stuart Mill") and [G. D. H. Cole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._D._H._Cole "G. D. H. Cole"), who argued that political participation is indispensable for a [just](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice "Justice") society.<sup id="cite_ref-:33_7-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:33-7">[7]</a></sup> In the early 21st century, participatory democracy has been more widely studied and experimented with, leading to various institutional reform ideas such as [participatory budgeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_budgeting "Participatory budgeting").<sup id="cite_ref-:42_8-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:42-8">[8]</a></sup>

## History\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Participatory_democracy&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: History")\]

### Origins in Ancient Greece\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Participatory_democracy&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Origins in Ancient Greece")\]

Democracy in general first appeared in the [city-state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City-state "City-state") of [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens "Athens") during [classical antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity "Classical antiquity").<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Raaflaub_2007_10-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-Raaflaub_2007-10">[10]</a></sup> It was first established under [Cleisthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleisthenes "Cleisthenes") in 508–507 BC.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> This was a direct democracy, in which ordinary citizens were [randomly selected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition "Sortition") to fill government [administrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_(government) "Administration (government)") and [judicial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary "Judiciary") offices, and there was a [legislative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature "Legislature") assembly consisting of all Athenian citizens.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> However, Athenian citizenship excluded women, [slaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery "Slavery"), foreigners (μέτοικοι/_métoikoi_) and youths below the age of military service.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> Athenian democracy was the most direct in history as the people controlled the entire political process through the assembly, the [boule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boule_(ancient_Greece) "Boule (ancient Greece)") and the [courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court "Court"), and a large proportion of citizens were involved constantly in public matters.<sup id="cite_ref-Raaflaub_2007_10-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-Raaflaub_2007-10">[10]</a></sup>

### During the 20th century\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Participatory_democracy&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: During the 20th century")\]

During the 20th century, practical implementations began to take place, mostly on a small scale, attracting considerable academic attention in the 1980s. Experiments in participatory democracy took place in various cities around the world. As one of the earliest examples, [Porto Alegre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre "Porto Alegre"), [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil "Brazil") adapted a system of [participatory budgeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_budgeting "Participatory budgeting") in 1989. A [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank") study found that participatory democracy in these cities seemed to result in considerable improvement in the [quality of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life "Quality of life") for residents.<sup id="cite_ref-Ross_2011_loc=_Chapter_4_15-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-Ross_2011_loc=_Chapter_4-15">[15]</a></sup>

### In the 21st century\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Participatory_democracy&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: In the 21st century")\]

In the early 21st century, experiments in participatory democracy began to spread throughout [South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America "South America") and [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America"), [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China"), and across the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union").<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> In a [US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US "US") example, the plans to rebuild [New Orleans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans "New Orleans") after [Hurricane Katrina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina "Hurricane Katrina") in 2005 were drafted and approved by thousands of ordinary citizens.<sup id="cite_ref-Ross_2011_loc=_Chapter_4_15-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-Ross_2011_loc=_Chapter_4-15">[15]</a></sup>

#### The Citizens' Assembly (2011) in Ireland\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Participatory_democracy&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: The Citizens' Assembly (2011) in Ireland")\]

In 2011, as a response to citizens' growing distrust in the government following the [financial crisis of 2007–2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008 "Financial crisis of 2007–2008"), [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland "Ireland") authorised a citizens' assembly called _"We the Citizens"_. Its task was to pilot the use of a participatory democratic body and test whether it could increase [political legitimacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_(political) "Legitimacy (political)"). There was an increase in both [efficacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy "Efficacy") and interest in governmental functions, as well as significant opinion shifts on contested issues like [taxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax "Tax").<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

#### The Citizens Convention for Climate in France (2019)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Participatory_democracy&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: The Citizens Convention for Climate in France (2019)")\]

The [French government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_France "Government of France") organised _"le grand débat national"_ (the [Great National Debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_National_Debate&action=edit&redlink=1 "Great National Debate (page does not exist)")) in early 2019 as a response to the [Yellow vests movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_vests_protests "Yellow vests protests"). It consisted of 18 regional conventions, each with 100 [randomly selected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics) "Sampling (statistics)") [citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship "Citizenship"), that had to deliberate on issues they valued the most so that they could influence government action.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_18-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:4-18">[18]</a></sup> After the debate, a citizens' convention was created specifically to discuss [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change"), _"la Convention citoyenne pour le climat"_ (the [Citizens Convention for Climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Convention_for_Climate "Citizens Convention for Climate"), CCC), designed to serve as a legislative body to decide how the country could reduce its [greenhouse gas emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions "Greenhouse gas emissions") with [social justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice "Social justice") in mind.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_19-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:1-19">[19]</a></sup> It consisted of 150 citizens selected by [sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition "Sortition") and [stratified sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling "Stratified sampling"), who were sorted into five sub-groups to discuss individual topics. The members were helped by experts on [steering committees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee "Committee"). The proceedings of the CCC garnered international attention. After nine months, the convention outlined 149 measures in a 460-page report, and [President Macron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron "Emmanuel Macron") committed to supporting 146 of them. A bill containing these was submitted to the [parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Parliament "French Parliament") in late 2020.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_18-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:4-18">[18]</a></sup>

#### \[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Participatory_democracy&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Effects of social media")\]

In recent years, [social media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media "Social media") has led to changes in the conduct of participatory democracy. Citizens with differing points of view are able to join conversations, mainly through the use of [hashtags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag "Hashtag").<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> To promote public interest and involvement, [local governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government "Local government") have started using social media to make decisions based on public feedback.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> Users have also organised online [committees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee "Committee") to highlight local needs and appoint budget [delegates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegate_(American_politics) "Delegate (American politics)") who work with the citizens and city agencies.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

##### The Occupy movement\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Participatory_democracy&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: The Occupy movement")\]

Participatory democracy was a notable feature of the [Occupy movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement "Occupy movement") in 2011. "Occupy camps" around the world made decisions based on the outcome of [working groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_group "Working group") where every protester had a say. These decisions were then [aggregated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_data "Aggregate data") by general assemblies. This process combined [equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_before_the_law "Equality before the law"), mass participation, and [deliberation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberation "Deliberation").<sup id="cite_ref-NYtimes_23-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-NYtimes-23">[23]</a></sup>

## Evaluation\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Participatory_democracy&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Evaluation")\]

### Strengths\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Participatory_democracy&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Strengths")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Carole_Pateman_in_Brazil_2015_02.jpg/220px-Carole_Pateman_in_Brazil_2015_02.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carole_Pateman_in_Brazil_2015_02.jpg)

[Carole Pateman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Pateman "Carole Pateman"), an advocate of participatory democracy

The most prominent argument for participatory democracy is its function of greater [democratization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratization "Democratization").

> \[T\]he argument is about changes that will make our own social and political life more democratic, that will provide opportunities for individuals to participate in decision-making in their everyday lives as well as in the wider political system. It is about democratizing democracy.
> 
> — [Carole Pateman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Pateman "Carole Pateman"), Participatory Democracy Revisited, Perspectives on Politics. 10 (1): 7–19, 2012

With participatory democracy, individuals or groups can realistically achieve their interests, "\[providing\] the means to a more [just](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice "Justice") and rewarding society, not a strategy for preserving the [status quo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo "Status quo")."<sup id="cite_ref-:33_7-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:33-7">[7]</a></sup>

Participatory democracy may also have an educational effect. Greater political participation can lead to the public to seeking to also make it higher quality in [efficacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy "Efficacy") and depth: "the more individuals participate the better able they become to do so",<sup id="cite_ref-:33_7-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:33-7">[7]</a></sup> an idea already promoted by [Rousseau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau "Jean-Jacques Rousseau"), [Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill "John Stuart Mill"), and [Cole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._D._H._Cole "G. D. H. Cole").<sup id="cite_ref-:42_8-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:42-8">[8]</a></sup> Pateman emphasises this potential as it counteracts the widespread lack of faith in the capacity and capability of citizens to meaningfully participate, especially in societies with complex organisations.<sup id="cite_ref-:42_8-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:42-8">[8]</a></sup> Joel D. Wolfe asserts his confidence that such models could be implemented even in large organizations, progressively diminishing [state intervention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_interventionism "Economic interventionism").<sup id="cite_ref-:33_7-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:33-7">[7]</a></sup>

### Criticism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Participatory_democracy&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Criticism")\]

Criticisms of participatory democracy generally align with [criticism of democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_democracy "Criticism of democracy").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The main opposition is the disbelief in citizens' capabilities to bear the greater responsibility. Some reject the feasibility of participatory models and refutes its proposed educational benefits.

> First, the self-interested, rational member has little incentive to participate because he lacks the skills and knowledge to be effective, making it cost-effective to rely on officials' expertise.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

Critics conclude that the citizenry is disinterested and leader-dependent, making the mechanism for participatory democracy inherently incompatible with advanced societies.

Other concerns are whether such massive political input can be managed and turned into effective output. David Plotke<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch"><span title="The material near this tag possibly uses too-vague attribution or weasel words. (March 2024)">who?</span></a></i>]</sup> highlights that the institutional adjustments needed to make greater political participation possible would require a representative element. Consequently, both direct and participatory democracy must rely on some type of representation to sustain a stable system. He also states that achieving equal direct participation in large and heavily populated regions is hardly possible, and ultimately argues in favor of representation over participation, calling for a hybrid between participatory and representative models.<sup id="cite_ref-:12_25-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:12-25">[25]</a></sup>

A third category of criticism, primarily advanced by author [Roslyn Fuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roslyn_Fuller "Roslyn Fuller"), rejects equating or even subsuming instruments of [Deliberative Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_Democracy "Deliberative Democracy") (such as citizens’ assemblies) under the term of Participatory Democracy, as such instruments violate the hard-won concept of political equality ([One Man, One Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Man,_One_Vote "One Man, One Vote")), in exchange for a small chance of being randomly selected to participate and are thus not ‘participatory’ in any meaningful sense.<sup id="cite_ref-:38_26-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:38-26">[26]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>

Proponents of [Deliberative Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_Democracy "Deliberative Democracy") in her view misconstrue the role sortition played in the ancient [Athenian democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy "Athenian democracy") (where random selection was limited only to offices and positions with very limited power whereas participation in the main decision-making forum was open to all citizens).<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>

Fuller's most serious criticism is that [Deliberative Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_Democracy "Deliberative Democracy") purposefully limits decisions to small, externally controllable groups while ignoring the plethora of e-democracy tools available which allow for unfiltered mass participation and deliberation.<sup id="cite_ref-:38_26-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:38-26">[26]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>

Business philosopher [Jason Brennan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Brennan "Jason Brennan") advocates in book _[Against Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_Democracy "Against Democracy")_ for a less participatory system because of the [irrationality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrationality "Irrationality") of voters in a [representative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy "Representative democracy"). He proposes several mechanisms to reduce participation, presented with the assumption that a vote-based system of electoral representation is maintained.<sup id="cite_ref-:03_31-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:03-31">[31]</a></sup> Comparing an untested voter to an unlicensed driver, Brennan argues that exams should be administered to all citizens to determine if they are competent to participate in public matters. Under this system, citizens either have one or zero votes, depending on their test performance. Critics of Brennan, including reporter Sean Illing, found parallels between his proposed system and the [literacy tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_test "Literacy test") the [Jim Crow laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws "Jim Crow laws") that prevented [black people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people "Black people") from voting in the United States between.<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> Brennan proposes a second system in which all citizens have [equal rights to vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_suffrage "Universal suffrage") or otherwise participate in government, but decisions made by the elected representatives are scrutinized by an [epistocratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noocracy "Noocracy") council. This council could not make law, only "unmake" it, and would likely be composed of individuals who pass rigorous competency exams.<sup id="cite_ref-:03_31-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:03-31">[31]</a></sup>

## Mechanisms of participatory democracy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Participatory_democracy&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Mechanisms of participatory democracy")\]

Scholars have recently proposed several mechanisms to increase citizen participation in democratic systems. These methods intend to increase the [agenda-setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda-setting_theory "Agenda-setting theory") and [decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making "Decision-making") powers of the people by giving citizens more direct ways to contribute to politics.<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup>

### Citizens' assemblies\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Participatory_democracy&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Citizens' assemblies")\]

Also called [mini-publics](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mini-public&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mini-public (page does not exist)"), citizens' assemblies are [representative samples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics) "Sampling (statistics)") of a population that meet to create [legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislation "Legislation") or advise legislative bodies. When citizens are chosen to participate by [stratified sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling "Stratified sampling"), the assemblies are more representative of the population than elected legislatures.<sup id="cite_ref-:43_34-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:43-34">[34]</a></sup> Assemblies chosen by [sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition "Sortition") provide average citizens with the opportunity to exercise substantive agenda-setting and/or decision-making power. Over the course of the assembly, citizens are helped by experts and discussion [facilitators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facilitator "Facilitator"), and the results are either put to a [referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum "Referendum") or sent in a [report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Report "Report") to the [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government "Government").

Critics of citizens' assemblies have raised concerns about their [perceived legitimacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Perceived_legitimacy&action=edit&redlink=1 "Perceived legitimacy (page does not exist)"). [Political scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science "Political science") Daan Jacobs finds that although the perceived legitimacy of assemblies is higher than that of system with no participation, but not any higher than that of any system involving self-selection.<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> Regardless, the use of citizens' assemblies has grown throughout the early 21st century and they have were often used in constitutional reforms, such as in [British Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia "British Columbia")'s [Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_Assembly_on_Electoral_Reform_(British_Columbia) "Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform (British Columbia)") in 2004 and the [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland "Ireland") [Constitutional Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_(Ireland) "Constitutional Convention (Ireland)") in 2012.<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup>

### Deliberative opinion polls\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Participatory_democracy&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Deliberative opinion polls")\]

[Trademarked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark "Trademark") by [Stanford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University "Stanford University") professor [James S. Fishkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_S._Fishkin "James S. Fishkin"), [deliberative opinion polls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_opinion_poll "Deliberative opinion poll") allow citizens to develop informed opinions before voting through [deliberation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberation "Deliberation"). Deliberative polling begins with surveying a [random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness "Randomness") [representative sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics) "Sampling (statistics)") of citizens to gage their opinion.<sup id="cite_ref-:05_37-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:05-37">[37]</a></sup> The same individuals are then invited to deliberate for a weekend in the presence of political leaders, experts, and moderators. At the end, the group is surveyed again, and the final opinions are taken to be the conclusion the public would have reached if they had the opportunity to engage with the issue more deeply.<sup id="cite_ref-:05_37-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:05-37">[37]</a></sup> Philosopher [Cristina Lafont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristina_Lafont "Cristina Lafont"), a critic of deliberative opinion polling argues that the "filtered" (informed) opinion reached at the end of a poll is too far removed from the opinion of the citizenry, delegitimizing the actions based on them.<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup>

### Public consultation surveys\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Participatory_democracy&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Public consultation surveys")\]

**Public consultation surveys** are surveys on policy proposals or positions that have been put forward by legislators, government officials, or other policy leader. The entirety of the deliberative process takes place within the survey. For each issue, respondents are provided relevant briefing materials, and arguments for and against various proposals.  Respondents then provide their final recommendation.  Public consultation surveys are primarily done with large representative samples, usually several thousand nationally and several hundred in subnational jurisdictions. .    

Public consultation surveys have been used since the 1990s in the US.  The American Talks Issue Foundation led by Alan Kay played a pioneering role.<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup>  The largest such program is the Program for Public Consultation at the [University of Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland "University of Maryland")'s School of Public Policy, directed by [Steven Kull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Kull "Steven Kull"), conducting public consultation surveys on the national level, as well as in states and congressional districts. They have gathered public opinion data on over 300 policy proposals that have been put forward by Members of Congress and the Executive Branch, in a variety of areas.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> Such surveys conducted in particular Congressional districts have also been used as the basis for face-to-face forums in congressional districts, in which survey participants and House Congressional Representative discuss the policy proposals and the results of the survey.<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup>

The questionnaires used in the surveys by the Program for Public Consultation, which they call “policymaking simulations”, have also been made available for public use, as educational and advocacy tools.<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> Members of the public can take the policymaking simulations to better understand the proposal, and are given the option to send their policy recommendations to their elected officials in Congress.

### E-democracy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Participatory_democracy&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: E-democracy")\]

[E-democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-democracy "E-democracy") is an umbrella term describing a variety of proposals to increase participation through technology.<sup id="cite_ref-:6_43-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:6-43">[43]</a></sup> Open discussion forums provide citizens the opportunity to debate [policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy "Policy") online while [facilitators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facilitator "Facilitator") guide discussion. These forums usually serve agenda-setting purposes or are sometimes used to provide legislators with additional [testimony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testimony "Testimony"). Closed forums may be used to discuss more sensitive information: in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom"), one was used to enable [domestic violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence "Domestic violence") survivors to testify to the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Domestic Violence and Abuse while preserving their [anonymity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity "Anonymity").

Another e-democratic mechanism is [online deliberative polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_deliberation "Online deliberation"), a system in which citizens deliberate with [peers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_group "Peer group") virtually before answering a poll. The results of [deliberative opinion polls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_opinion_poll "Deliberative opinion poll") are more likely to reflect the considered judgments of the people and encourage increased citizen awareness of civic issues.<sup id="cite_ref-:6_43-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:6-43">[43]</a></sup>

### Liquid democracy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Participatory_democracy&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Liquid democracy")\]

In a hybrid between [direct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy "Direct democracy") and [representative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy "Representative democracy"), [liquid democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy "Liquid democracy") permits individuals to either vote on issues themselves or to select issue-competent [delegates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegate_(American_politics) "Delegate (American politics)") to vote on their behalf.<sup id="cite_ref-onlinelibrary.wiley.com_44-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-onlinelibrary.wiley.com-44">[44]</a></sup> [Political scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science "Political science") Christian Blum and Christina Isabel Zuber suggest that liquid democracy has the potential to improve a legislature's performance through bringing together delegates with a greater awareness on a specific issue, taking advantage of knowledge within the population. To make liquid democracy more deliberative, a [trustee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trustee "Trustee") model of delegation may be implemented, in which the delegates vote after deliberation with other representatives.

Some concerns have been raised about the implementation of liquid democracy. Blum and Zuber, for example, find that it produces two classes of voters: individuals with one vote and delegates with two or more.<sup id="cite_ref-onlinelibrary.wiley.com_44-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-onlinelibrary.wiley.com-44">[44]</a></sup> They also worry that policies produced in issue-specific legislatures will lack [cohesiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_cohesiveness "Group cohesiveness"). Liquid democracy is utilized by [Pirate Parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party "Pirate Party") for intra-party decision-making.

### Participatory budgeting\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Participatory_democracy&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Participatory budgeting")\]

[Participatory budgeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_budgeting "Participatory budgeting") allows citizens to make decisions on the allocation of a [public budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget "Government budget").<sup id="cite_ref-:52_45-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:52-45">[45]</a></sup> Originating in [Porto Alegre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre "Porto Alegre"), Brazil, the general procedure involves the creation of a concrete [financial plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_plan "Financial plan") that then serves as a recommendation to elected representatives. [Neighbourhoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood "Neighbourhood") are given the authority to design budgets for the greater region and local proposals are brought to elected regional forums. This system lead to a decrease in [clientelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clientelism "Clientelism") and [corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption "Corruption") and an increase in participation, particularly amongst [marginalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion "Social exclusion") and [poorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty "Poverty") residents. Theorist Graham Smith observes that participatory budgeting still has some barriers to entry for the poorest members of the population.<sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup>

### Referendums\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Participatory_democracy&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Referendums")\]

In [binding referendums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum "Referendum"), citizens vote on [laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law "Law") and/or [constitutional amendments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_amendment "Constitutional amendment") proposed by a [legislative body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature "Legislature").<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup> Referendums afford citizens greater [decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making "Decision-making") power by giving them the ultimate decision, and they may also use referendums for [agenda-setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda-setting_theory "Agenda-setting theory") if they are allowed to draft [proposals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_the_United_States_to_purchase_Greenland "Proposals for the United States to purchase Greenland") to be put to referendums in efforts called [popular initiatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_initiative "Popular initiative"). [Compulsory voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_voting "Compulsory voting") can further increase participation. Political theorist [Hélène Landemore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne_Landemore "Hélène Landemore") raises the concern that referendums may fail to be sufficiently deliberative as people are unable to engage in discussions and debates that would enhance their decision-making abilities.<sup id="cite_ref-:43_34-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:43-34">[34]</a></sup>

[Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland") currently uses a rigorous system of referendums, under which all laws the legislature proposes go to referendums. Swiss citizens may also start [popular initiatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_initiative_in_Switzerland "Popular initiative in Switzerland"), a process in which citizens put forward a constitutional amendment or propose the removal of an existing provision. Any proposal must receive the signature of 100,000 citizens to go to a [ballot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot "Ballot").<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup>

### Town meetings\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Participatory_democracy&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Town meetings")\]

In local participatory democracy, [town meetings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_meeting "Town meeting") provide all residents with legislative power.<sup id="cite_ref-:52_45-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-:52-45">[45]</a></sup> Practiced in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), particularly in [New England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England "New England"), since the 17th century, they assure that local policy decisions are made directly by the public. Local democracy is often seen as the first step towards a participatory system.<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup> Theorist Graham Smith, however, notes the limited impact of town meetings that cannot lead to action on national issues. He also suggests that town meetings are not representative as they disproportionately represent individuals with [free time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leisure "Leisure"), including the [elderly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age "Old age") and the [affluent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth "Wealth").
