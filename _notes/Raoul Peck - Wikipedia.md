## Early years and education\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Raoul_Peck&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Early years and education")\]

Peck was born in [Port-au-Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-au-Prince "Port-au-Prince"), [Haiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti "Haiti"). At the age of eight, Peck and his family (he has three brothers including [Hébert Peck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9bert_Peck "Hébert Peck")) fled the [Duvalier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Duvalier "François Duvalier") dictatorship and joined his father in [Kinshasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinshasa "Kinshasa"), [Democratic Republic of the Congo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo "Democratic Republic of the Congo") (DRC). His father Hebert B. Peck, an [agronomist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agronomy "Agronomy"), worked for the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") [FAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization "Food and Agriculture Organization") and [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO "UNESCO") and had taken a job there as professor of agriculture along with many Haitian professionals invited by the government to fill positions recently vacated by Belgians departing after independence. His mother, Giselle, would serve as aide and secretary to mayors of Kinshasa for many years.<sup id="cite_ref-:7_7-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:7-7">[7]</a></sup> The family resided in DRC for the next 24 years.

Peck attended schools in Kinshasa, DRC, in [Brooklyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn "Brooklyn"), New York and in [Orléans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orl%C3%A9ans "Orléans"), France where he earned a [baccalauréat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baccalaur%C3%A9at "Baccalauréat"), before studying [industrial engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_engineering "Industrial engineering") and economics at Berlin's [Humboldt University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_University "Humboldt University").<sup id="cite_ref-:2_1-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:2-1">[1]</a></sup> Peck always had artistic dreams, but these were frowned upon in Haiti, his home country. He then decided to wait until after completing his studies at [Humboldt University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_University "Humboldt University") to return to Haiti and pursue his cinematic career. He said, "It's what saved me. I didn't come to Europe thinking that I was going to stay. I knew that I had to educate myself as much as possible, then return to Haiti secretly if need be."<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Peck later spent a year as a New York City taxi driver and worked (1980–85) as a journalist and photographer before earning a film degree (1988) from the [German Film and Television Academy Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Film-_und_Fernsehakademie_Berlin "Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin") (DFFB) in [West Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Berlin "West Berlin").<sup id="cite_ref-:2_1-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:2-1">[1]</a></sup>

Peck served as [Minister of Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_minister "Culture minister") in the Haitian government of Prime Minister [Rosny Smarth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosny_Smarth "Rosny Smarth") (1996–97), ultimately resigning his post along with the Prime Minister and five other ministers in protest of Presidents [Préval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Pr%C3%A9val "René Préval") and [Aristide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Aristide "President Aristide").<sup id="cite_ref-:0_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:0-9">[9]</a></sup> He detailed his experiences in this position in a book, _Monsieur le Ministre… jusqu'au bout de la patience_. Prime Minister Smarth wrote an afterword for the book, and [Russell Banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Banks "Russell Banks") wrote the preface to the first edition.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> On the book's re-release in 2015, [Radio Metropole Haïti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Metropole_Ha%C3%AFti "Radio Metropole Haïti") reviewed it as a portrait of "a formidable democratic movement that profoundly changed the country."<sup id="cite_ref-:0_9-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:0-9">[9]</a></sup>

## Filmmaking career\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Raoul_Peck&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Filmmaking career")\]

Peck initially developed short experimental works and socio-political documentaries, before moving on to feature films. In 1982, he directed his first short film, _De Cuba traigo un cantar_, which described the visit of "[Carlos Puebla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Puebla "Carlos Puebla") y Los Tradicionales," a Cuban group that played traditional [Cuban music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Cuba "Music of Cuba"), to [West Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Berlin "West Berlin") and their concert for peace.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> He also directed _Leugt_ (1983), another short, whose topic was [Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan "Ronald Reagan")'s visit to Berlin and the violent protests that arose. Then, in 1983, he continued with _Exzerpt_, where he took on a critical and playful point of view on [Grüne Woche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_International_Green_Week "Berlin International Green Week") (Green Week), the biggest dietary and agricultural fair in Germany. In 1984, he directed _Merry Christmas Deutschland_, a report about the history lessons of Christmas day in [Helmut Kohl's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Kohl "Helmut Kohl") [1984 Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_in_Germany "1984 in Germany").<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>

In 1986 Peck created the film production company [Velvet Film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Film "Velvet Film") in Germany, which then produced or co-produced all his documentaries, feature films and TV dramas.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

While still at the [German Film and Television Academy Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Film-_und_Fernsehakademie_Berlin "Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin") (DFFB), Peck shot his first feature film, _Haitian Corner_ (1987), produced by his newly founded company, Velvet Film. The film portrays a Haitian man exiled in New York trying to forget being tortured by [François Duvalier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Duvalier "François Duvalier")'s secret police. When he accidentally runs into a man he recognizes as a former torturer, part of the "[Tontons Macoutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonton_Macoute "Tonton Macoute")," he must choose between vengeance and forgiveness.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

A few years after Peck directed _Haitian Corner_, a producer asked him to write a screenplay about a Swiss doctor's "downward spiral" in Africa before returning to his native country as a "liberated" man. However, Peck made a counteroffer and attempted to launch a fiction project around [Patrice Lumumba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba "Patrice Lumumba") for the first time. This project questioned the point of view of the "black" hero, which was contrary to the usual approach where a "European" character told this genre, which investors accepted more readily (example: Steve Biko in _[Cry Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cry_Freedom "Cry Freedom")_).<sup id="cite_ref-:52_15-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:52-15">[15]</a></sup> Because of these challenges, Peck decided to produce a creative documentary instead. In 1991, this turned into _[Lumumba, Death of a Prophet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumumba,_la_mort_d%27un_proph%C3%A8te "Lumumba, la mort d'un prophète")_, a film about the death of [Patrice Lumumba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba "Patrice Lumumba") in 1961; the 'father of Congo's independence.' Peck wanted to emphasize Lumumba's place in the continent's history.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>

Two years later in 1993, Peck returned to a more Haitian- specific theme with a feature, _[The Man by The Shore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_by_the_Shore "The Man by the Shore")_, a fictional story about the beginning of "[Duvalierism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Duvalier "François Duvalier")" and the implementation of the process of terror through the eyes of an eight-year-old girl.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> The story of "Sarah, a girl who accepts her past demons and decides to live with them," got him a nomination for a [Palme d’Or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palme_d%27Or "Palme d'Or") at the [1993 Cannes Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Cannes_Film_Festival "1993 Cannes Film Festival").<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> _The Man by the Shore_ was the first Haitian film to be released in theatres in the United States.<sup id="cite_ref-festival-cannes.com_20-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-festival-cannes.com-20">[20]</a></sup>

One year after _The Man by The Shore_ premiered, Peck directed the documentary _Desounen, Dialogue with Death_ (1994). The documentary, which contains a fictitious narrator and real interviews with Haitians, focuses on the tragedies caused by the economic collapse of [Haiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti "Haiti"), and explores how different people cope.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>

That same year (1994), Peck wrote and directed _Haiti, Silence of the Dogs_, which documented the confrontation between the democratically-elected Haitian President, [Jean-Bertrand Aristide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Bertrand_Aristide "Jean-Bertrand Aristide") (who was in exile in the [U.S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States").) and his prime minister, [Robert Malval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Malval "Robert Malval") (who stayed in Haiti trying to establish democracy and opposing the military-appointed president, [Emile Jonassaint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Jonassaint "Émile Jonassaint")).<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

Raoul Peck also received the _[Nestor Almendros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%A9stor_Almendros "Néstor Almendros") Prize of Human Rights Watch_ in 1994. Six years later in 2000, the same organization gave him the _[Irene Diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_Diamond "Irene Diamond") award_ for his work in favor of human rights.<sup id="cite_ref-:02_23-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:02-23">[23]</a></sup>

In 1998, Peck was commissioned by the museum curator, [Catherine David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_David "Catherine David"), to create a video essay about [documenta X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documenta_X "Documenta X"), a contemporary art exhibition, in Kassel, Germany: **Chère Catherine**.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

Later that year (1998), Peck directed _It's Not About Love_, commissioned by the French television channel _[Arte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arte "Arte")_. This mystery about exile and memory centers around a woman born in Haiti and living in New York City, and was the start of his collaborations with the producer Jacques Bidou.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup>

Peck received international attention for _[Lumumba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumumba_(film) "Lumumba (film)")_, his 2000 fiction feature film about Prime Minister [Patrice Lumumba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba "Patrice Lumumba") and the period around the independence of the [Belgian Congo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Congo "Belgian Congo") in June 1960.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>

Raoul Peck has also made his film debut on television. In 2005, he teamed up with American TV network [HBO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO "HBO") to release his film _[Sometimes in April](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sometimes_in_April "Sometimes in April")_, about the [Rwandan genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide "Rwandan genocide"). The film starred [Idris Elba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_Elba "Idris Elba").<sup id="cite_ref-:12_28-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:12-28">[28]</a></sup>

Five years later, Peck was elected Chairman of [La Fémis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_F%C3%A9mis "La Fémis"), the French state film school, on 10 January 2010. He has since been replaced with [Michel Hazanavicius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Hazanavicius "Michel Hazanavicius").<sup id="cite_ref-:2_1-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:2-1">[1]</a></sup>

Then, a book of screenplays and images from four of Peck's major features and documentary films, called _Stolen Images_, was published in February 2012 by [Seven Stories Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Stories_Press "Seven Stories Press").<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>

Peck continued his journey in the film industry when he was named as a member of the Jury for the Main Competition at the [2012 Cannes Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Cannes_Film_Festival "2012 Cannes Film Festival").<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> He won the Best Documentary prize at the [Trinidad & Tobago Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_%26_Tobago_Film_Festival "Trinidad & Tobago Film Festival") in 2013 for _[Fatal Assistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fatal_Assistance&action=edit&redlink=1 "Fatal Assistance (page does not exist)")_.<sup id="cite_ref-Hollywood_31-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-Hollywood-31">[31]</a></sup>

More recently in 2021, Raoul Peck continued his partnership with [HBO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO "HBO") by directing a four part docu-series, _[Exterminate All the Brutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterminate_All_the_Brutes_(miniseries) "Exterminate All the Brutes (miniseries)")_ (April 2021). In this series about the genocidal aspects of European colonialism, Peck uses [Sven Lindqvist's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sven_Lindqvist "Sven Lindqvist") book _[Exterminate All the Brutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterminate_All_the_Brutes_(book) "Exterminate All the Brutes (book)")_, [Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxanne_Dunbar-Ortiz "Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz")'s _[An Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Indigenous_Peoples%27_History_of_the_United_States "An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States")_, and [Michel-Rolph Trouillot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel-Rolph_Trouillot "Michel-Rolph Trouillot")'s _Silencing the Past_ to expose the realities of the past and recount the "story of survival and violence." Peck himself narrates the series using both old and new footage and animation to propose white supremacy has been at the historic center of nations and has led to "exterminations" of people around the world. Peck sets a suspenseful tone to the trailer by ending with the words, "Neutrality is not an option... Over the centuries we lost all bearings because the past has a future we never expect.”<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> The series already has a score of 82% on [Rotten Tomatoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes "Rotten Tomatoes") and has been described as a "fresh, current and revelatory documentary."<sup id="cite_ref-:8_35-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:8-35">[35]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup>

### _Lumumba_ (2000)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Raoul_Peck&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Lumumba (2000)")\]

Raoul Peck decided to go back and take on the character of [Patrice Lumumba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba "Patrice Lumumba") with a feature film that was accessible to the public. _[Lumumba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumumba_(film) "Lumumba (film)")_ was released in 2000 and followed the pivotal story of Congolese leader, [Patrice Lumumba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba "Patrice Lumumba"). Peck used real images to unveil the "unwritten controversial history" of how Lumumba led the Republic of Congo towards its independence in 1960.<sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup> This was Peck's second film on Lumumba, the first was the documentary film, _[Lumumba, Death of a Prophet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumumba,_la_mort_d%27un_proph%C3%A8te "Lumumba, la mort d'un prophète")_ (1990).

When asked why he chose to direct a second film on [Lumumba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba "Patrice Lumumba"), Peck said, "... when I started research for the feature, I was writing pages and pages and I realized that I was writing for another film. I was creating a film about discovering my own family in Congo and my own memories in Congo. And I rediscovered pictures my mother took and 8mm films my father shot. So all of this brought up a lot for me and the documentary is an expression of my personal relationship to Congo. For me the documentary and the feature film are two different stories. And when I came back to the feature film it was a very direct confrontation with the man Lumumba himself."<sup id="cite_ref-:52_15-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:52-15">[15]</a></sup>

_Lumumba_ received eight nominations and won three awards. It was also chosen to be in the [Cannes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival "Cannes Film Festival") [Directors Fortnight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directors%27_Fortnight "Directors' Fortnight"). The film won Best Feature Film at the [Acapulco Black Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Black_Film_Festival "American Black Film Festival") (2001) and the [Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panafrican_Film_and_Television_Festival_of_Ouagadougou "Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou") (2001), and was the winning film in the United States’ ‘Peace’ category at the [Political Film Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_Film_Society_Award_for_Peace "Political Film Society Award for Peace") (2002).<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup> Lumumba has a score of 81% on Rotten Tomatoes.<sup id="cite_ref-:8_35-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:8-35">[35]</a></sup>

### _Sometimes In April_ (2005)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Raoul_Peck&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Sometimes In April (2005)")\]

This [HBO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO "HBO") English-language TV movie came out in 2005. In this war drama based on actual events, Raoul Peck describes [Rwanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda "Rwanda")'s 1994 massacre. A [Hutu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutu "Hutu") soldier ([Idris Elba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_Elba "Idris Elba")) fights for his family as they try to save themselves from being a part of the "almost 800,000 people" killed during the "uprising."<sup id="cite_ref-:12_28-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:12-28">[28]</a></sup>

After the success of _[Lumumba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumumba_(film) "Lumumba (film)")_ in the United States, TV channel [HBO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO "HBO"), who bought and broadcast the film (the first English dubbed airing in American television), offered Raoul Peck a project that would later become [Hotel Rwanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Rwanda "Hotel Rwanda") (United Artists, produced by [Terry George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_George "Terry George")). Raoul Peck posed a certain number of generally "unacceptable" conditions in the United States. He hesitated to make the film because of "the lack of film infrastructure."<sup id="cite_ref-:22_48-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:22-48">[48]</a></sup> He wanted to be able to tell the story from the point of view of the Rwandan people and be able to shoot in Rwanda. Unexpectedly, Collin Collender, the President of [HBO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO "HBO") films, accepted all of his demands and the project began production.<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup>

In 2001, while in Rwanda, Peck became overwhelmed and convinced of the need to react to the [Rwandan Genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide "Rwandan genocide"). Peck then immersed himself in the story of Rwanda and studied multiple reports, books, documents and collected various testimonies to try to understand the Rwanda of today.<sup id="cite_ref-:22_48-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:22-48">[48]</a></sup>

_[Lumumba's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumumba_(film) "Lumumba (film)")_ success in Africa opened many doors for Raoul Peck, and he was able to shoot in Rwanda despite the initial difficulties (logistics, insurance, human resources). Peck said, "I felt we could make a film in which the Rwandan people can recognize themselves and participate at every level ... that it make sense to the people here first and then to the rest of the world…After many months here, we are convinced filming in Rwanda was the right thing to do…. every single line of this film, of the screenplay, is authentic and based on facts."<sup id="cite_ref-:22_48-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:22-48">[48]</a></sup>

The Rwandan people were the first to see the film because of the moral agreement that Raoul Peck concluded with them. An American studio even allowed the world premiere of _Sometimes In April_ in African territory. Thousands of people watched two projections on a giant screen in the [Kigali arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kigali_Arena "Kigali Arena"). "I could only imagine making this film if the Rwandans were the first to see it. Whatever the critics say does not matter to me. The only people whose judgment I would accept are the Rwandan people."<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup>

In competition in Berlin, _Sometimes in April_, aired in the United States with huge success and was even broadcast by the national public chain, [PBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS "PBS"), for free. This unique airing was made available to the public and followed by a panel discussion.<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup>

_Sometimes in April_ won "TV Program of the Year" at the [AFI Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute_Awards "American Film Institute Awards") (2006) and took home the award for 'Best Film' at the [Durban International Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durban_International_Film_Festival "Durban International Film Festival") (2005) in South Africa.<sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup>

### _I Am Not Your Negro (2016)_\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Raoul_Peck&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: I Am Not Your Negro (2016)")\]

In 2016, Peck directed a documentary film, _[I Am Not Your Negro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Not_Your_Negro "I Am Not Your Negro"),_ which follows author [James Baldwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Baldwin "James Baldwin"), as he used his "unfinished novel, <u>Remember This House</u>" to highlight the history of society's poor treatment of African Americans in the United States. In the film, [Samuel L. Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson "Samuel L. Jackson") narrates the story of African American struggles and constant oppression throughout time. The book and film highlight real letters and footage of [civil rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement "Civil rights movement") leaders like [Martin Luther King Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr. "Martin Luther King Jr."), [Malcolm X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X "Malcolm X"), and [Medgar Evers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medgar_Evers "Medgar Evers") to put into perspective the evolution of racism in the United States.<sup id="cite_ref-:10_53-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:10-53">[53]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup> Raoul Peck took about ten years to attain the rights to the film.<sup id="cite_ref-:10_53-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:10-53">[53]</a></sup>

The film premiered at the [2016 Toronto International Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Toronto_International_Film_Festival "2016 Toronto International Film Festival"), where it won the People's Choice Award in the documentary category.<sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> Shortly after, [Magnolia Pictures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnolia_Pictures "Magnolia Pictures") and [Amazon Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Studios "Amazon Studios") acquired distribution rights to the film.<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup> It was released in the U.S. for an Oscar-qualifying theatrical run on 9 December 2016, before re-opening on 3 February 2017.<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> It received an [Oscar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards "Academy Awards") nomination for [Best Documentary Feature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Documentary_Feature "Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature") for the [89th Academy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/89th_Academy_Awards "89th Academy Awards") but the award ultimately went to director [Ezra Edelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Edelman "Ezra Edelman") for _[O.J.: Made in America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.J.:_Made_in_America "O.J.: Made in America")_.<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup> However, the successful film did win a [César](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Awards "César Awards") in France for Best Documentary Film in 2018.<sup id="cite_ref-:9_5-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:9-5">[5]</a></sup> Additionally, _I Am Not Your Negro_ won an [Emmy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Award "Emmy Award") award in the "Outstanding Arts and Culture Documentary" category in 2019.<sup id="cite_ref-:9_5-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:9-5">[5]</a></sup>

The site's critical consensus reads, "I Am Not Your Negro offers an incendiary snapshot of James Baldwin's crucial observations on American race relations -- and a sobering reminder of how far we've yet to go."<sup id="cite_ref-61"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup> On [Metacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic "Metacritic"), the film has a score of 96 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".<sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup>

### _The Young Karl Marx_ (2017)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Raoul_Peck&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: The Young Karl Marx (2017)")\]

_The Young Karl Marx_ was released on 2 March 2017, in Germany. The film is about the friendship between [Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx "Karl Marx") and [Friedrich Engels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Engels "Friedrich Engels"), authors of the [Communist Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Manifesto "Communist Manifesto"), during their youth.<sup id="cite_ref-:6_33-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:6-33">[33]</a></sup> While the film follows Marx and Engels, women also play a part in the story. [Jenny Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_von_Westphalen "Jenny von Westphalen"), Karl Marx's wife, assisted with the final draft of the Manifesto. At the same time, [Mary Burns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Burns "Mary Burns"), Engels' partner, played the role of mediator between the two philosophers in the film.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_63-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:3-63">[63]</a></sup>

During an interview with _[The Hollywood Reporter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter "The Hollywood Reporter")_ in 2017, Raoul Peck highlighted Marx's influence throughout his education while growing up; "All I am today is because of the structure that I got when I was studying the work of Marx...At that time, in the 1970s and 1980s, you needed to confront yourself with those books because it is your past, it is your present."<sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup> When the interviewer asked Peck what research he used for the film, Peck mentioned that the letters between the characters in the film assisted in the creation of the film. "When you read the letters between Marx, Engels, \[Marx's wife\] Jenny and their friends, they're incredible. It's lively, it's funny, it's ironic. They were jokers with sharp tongues."<sup id="cite_ref-:3_63-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:3-63">[63]</a></sup>

_The Young Karl Marx_ took home the Founders Grand Prize for 'best script' at the [Traverse City Film Fest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traverse_City_Film_Festival "Traverse City Film Festival") in 2017. Furthermore, it won "Best Movie" at the 2017 _International Festival of Historical Film_.<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup> On [Rotten Tomatoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes "Rotten Tomatoes"), it has a score of 62% based on 50 reviews.<sup id="cite_ref-:8_35-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:8-35">[35]</a></sup>

## Style and influences\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Raoul_Peck&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Style and influences")\]

Since the beginning of his career, Raoul Peck's filmography reflects an ensemble of films with a particular writing style. His subjects are historical, political, and personal characters. His work considers his fragmented biography (with the intellectual and economic conflicted perspective). It also structurally exploits the effectiveness of American cinema. In this way, he uses more complex approaches like collages, time overlay of the story, flash-forward, or flashback, the recurrent use of voice-over, the author, character, and the object point of view according to the needs of the project. These multiple approaches, both formal and structurally aesthetic, allow for the organic mix of politics, history, poetry, and the personal.<sup id="cite_ref-:42_2-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-:42-2">[2]</a></sup>

### On his writing process\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Raoul_Peck&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: On his writing process")\]

Raoul Peck would go abroad a lot. He said that when he goes abroad he can find a sort of peace. It was hard being a black writer in America. In other parts of the world he was way more accepted. Being away from all of the racism helped him focus on his work.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="Claimed source was only the word &quot;NPR&quot; (April 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Finding a writing partner (this task is difficult as is) with a biographical, philosophical, or a political profile that permits a common or complementary approach has always been a difficult process for Raoul Peck. Nonetheless, Peck found a match in screenwriter [Pascal Bonitzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Bonitzer "Pascal Bonitzer") when writing _[The Young Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Young_Karl_Marx "The Young Karl Marx")_. He said, "The artistic challenge — and it took me ten years with Pascal to write this story — was the writing. That was the most difficult part. We were making a film about the evolution of an idea, which is impossible. To be able to have political discourse in a scene, and you can follow it, and it's not simplified, and it's historically true. This is the accomplishment."<sup id="cite_ref-66"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup>

Raoul Peck had the opportunity to renew this type of collaboration in the United States with writer [Russel Banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Banks "Russell Banks") (with two ongoing projects).<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (July 2022)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

### \[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Raoul_Peck&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: On his interest in social issues")\]

The documentary approach is similar to that of the fiction for Peck (voice-over, a mix of politics, history, memory, poetry). For that matter, whether it be _Haitian Corner_, _[Lumumba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumumba_(film) "Lumumba (film)")_, _[Sometimes in April](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sometimes_in_April "Sometimes in April")_, or _L'Affaire Villemin_, the uses of reality, documents, and truthful and lived details, is constant. Simultaneously, his films' political and personal factors are affected by his interest in politics and social issues. He says, "I came into the film industry because of politics, because of content—not because I wanted to make Hollywood films." Peck wants to change the way people view history; he would like to make audiences feel and cause a reaction within them. During an interview with Professor Meryem Belkaïd at [Bowdoin College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowdoin_College "Bowdoin College") in Maine, Peck stated, "Especially in America, cinema is an industry that claims that its purpose is entertainment … The tendency is to please the audience, it is not so much to provoke." With this in mind, Peck's goal is to create films that are meaningful.<sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup>

## Personal life\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Raoul_Peck&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Personal life")\]

Peck divides his time between [Voorhees Township, New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voorhees_Township,_New_Jersey "Voorhees Township, New Jersey"), U.S.; [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris "Paris"), France; and [Port-à-Piment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-%C3%A0-Piment "Port-à-Piment"), Haiti.<sup id="cite_ref-68"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Peck#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup>
