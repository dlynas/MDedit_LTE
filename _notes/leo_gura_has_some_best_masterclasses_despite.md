	I like Angelo dilulo and the various people he interviews. They generally speak plainly since I got sick of poetic paintings.

	Anything that involves a map, levels, stages, types whatever just sound like convulted garbage that's going to distract most people

	Adyashanti is pretty neat. 

	Here is a free book of his: https://adyashanti.opengatesangha.org/store/publications/books/the-way-of-liberation-533

	Daniel Ingrams "Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha" is pretty neat. 

	Here a free pdf. 

	https://www.mctb.org/

	Ramana Maharshi is pretty neat. 

	Here books: https://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/resource_centre/publications/

	Just typing nonduality into youtube gives some neat results. 

	The diamond sutra is on the web. 

	There are like a million zen pdfs on some hungarian website. 

	I don't really know Leo Gura beyond his reputation.

		Wonderful!  Awesome stuff!

	Yep, it is so tempting to get all that knowledge from his years of reading many good books. It is so tempting to keep searching &amp; searching for more resources, more videos, more teachings. I have listened to probably 98% of his videos, &amp; read most of his book list, I love the dude, but just keep this in mind:

	You have the greatest resource of all time right here, the guidance of your own emotions, &amp; the deepening of how you express yourself creatively. This can be hindered through the chasing of ‘better’ knowledge, &amp; the only way to deepen wisdom is to create it yourself, by holding space for your emotions, your creative process, &amp; letting go of knowledge.

		Yeah, I kinda just hit back into it as occasional refreshers or when I'm really curious about something. 
		
		I havent watched near that many! I find it interesting how just seeing the thumbnails reminds me of the content , though can only imagine how much richness you sense that way. 
		
		Definitely agree, it's like 80% practice 20% studying is about my rule. 
		
		Personally ive found Wim Hof stuff to be amazing for getting a better sense of shifting from Thinking to Being... His breathing exercise is really next-level!

	Peter Brown’s work is incredible and there’s a vast treasure trove of both audio and writing: www.theOpenDoorway.org

	I also appreciate Leo — he went pretty far out with the whole “I became an insane alien consciousness and this was a greater awakening than any human has ever had”-type shtick

	But that’ll happen when you are trailblazing new frontiers of extreme psychedelic exploration I guess 

	He has many valuable insights

	Just be aware that he has plenty of shadows and blindspots 

	“You will know them by their fruits” and such… some of his most avid followers on his forum often seem quite lost

* 🟩 **[Language_Games](https://www.reddit.com/user/Language_Games)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-04-18 17:03:21)_

	All awakening practices (and the entire endeavor itself) are a storyline. In that game or story, Leo has some good stuff.

	There is an abundance of videos on his channel  , everything seems to be covered.

	Ken Wilber has had a huge impact on my thinking in profound ways. In terms of realization though, listening to the moment is the only way for me.

* 🟩 **[Potential-Wait-7206](https://www.reddit.com/user/Potential-Wait-7206)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-04-18 20:02:05)_

	Leo is well informed,  highly intelligent, and he has an incredible number of very well structured videos dealing with all kinds of subjects.   I love listening to him.
