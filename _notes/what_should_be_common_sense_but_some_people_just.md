	It's better to drive in a predictable manner rather than be courteous.  

	For example, don't stop unexpectedly in traffic because someone wants to pull out of a parking lot onto the road in front of you.  They can wait.  

	Pretty simple stuff, but people seem to value courtesy over safety which doesn't make any sense.

		I think it's because people literally only see what's right in front of them. It doesn't occur to them that being nice to the guy in front of them trying to pull out of a parking lot often means being rude to twenty people behind them.
		
		If you want to be nice to someone, be nice to the twenty people stacked up behind you by getting traffic flowing again.

Tourists blocking subway entrances, trying to get in the subway car before I can get out and slow-moving groups taking up the entire sidewalk are near-daily occurrences on my commute.

		Know why traffic can't flow properly? Because you're not giving it room to flow!
		
		I hate when I'm in stop-and-go traffic and we hit spurts where we're actually driving at 45mph, then we come to a complete stop for like a minute. Don't these people realize that if we drove maybe a bit slower than 45mph in this situation, but left room for people to change lanes as needed, we'd get through this problem in like 5 minutes instead of 15?

		Thing is, it doesn't work.  Zipper merge fails because people maintain an appropriate following distance.  The only time that it can work is if the traffic is sparse enough that both lanes 
		
		What do you do immediately after a zipper merge?  Obvious answer: you slow down, because the car in front of you is now WAY TOO CLOSE.  But now the car behind you needs to slow down, because not only were you too close just after the merge, but now you've gone and slowed down as well.  As a result, everybody slows down in the entire line.
		
		End result: You spend just as much time waiting as if there were a complete stop.  Roughly two seconds per car.

	First pay your bills, loan payments, and taxes. Then allocate some money for food, any medicine you use and general household supplies (especially important when you live in a country where you get paid once a month). For that you should keep tabs on how much you actually spend each week. Then put some (not much, but some) money into an emergency fund. Your dishwasher isn't going to give you a 30 days notice before leaking all over your kitchen floor.

	And THEN go clubbing, buy new shoes or purchase a new game. Only then. Not before. 

	Sadly many people have no idea how to manage their funds and they end up broke, up to their necks in debt. Should be common sense, but it's not.

		I've greatly benefited from Dave Ramsey's approach. So I agree with the general description of a budget you have provided, but I think the order is Food, Shelter, Lights/Utilities, Transportation, Everything else. 
		
		Completely agree about the saving fund (the starter emergency fun DR recommends is $1000) which is to just cover any issues that happen. After you have reached your required spending and your saving goals then you get to do what you want with your money.

		* 🟧 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 14 _(2014-09-01 18:17:35)_

		* 🟧 **[invisible39](https://www.reddit.com/user/invisible39)** ⬆️ 24 _(2014-09-01 11:51:15)_

			Yeah, generally it's best to prioritize from highest priority to lowest priority. My order is roughly something like this:
			
			1) Your rent should come first. Without it you're completely fucked and could end up homeless. You never want to piss off your landlord.
			
			2) My credit card comes second. If I know it's going to be a tight month, it's the minimum payment. If it's not quite so tight I make sure I pay more than the minimum payment + the interest charge for the month. I want this card to be always going down towards 0.
			
			3) Bills you know you can't skip, either you've had problems with the supplier before or you just know you can't get a "relief period" from the bill issuer. Power/Water/Heating etc. Getting cut off from these usually gets you extra charges/penalties and you really don't want to pay these.
			
			4) Medical expenses. Fairly self explanatory, these aren't really a choice - but it's good to get as much of the first 3 paid as possible. If you're running out of money before this point you need to re-evaluate your rent cost and utility usage. You're not going to be able to survive if your rent and your "I have to pay this" expenses are taking up so much that you can't afford things at this tier.
			
			5) Food. Set out a food budget for the month. I personally like to withdraw this as cash and physically make little piles of money that I give myself at the beginning of each week. If it's food it comes from this pot. Eating in, eating out, delivery - whatever. It all comes from the little pile. Try and get a feel for what you are spending a week, count out the weeks until your next payday and multiply the two together. That's usually how I work this figure out.
			
			5) "Optional" bills. These are either bills you know you've got a bit more time on, or things like Netflix that you can cancel at any time with no penalties. If you can afford these, awesome. For the case of formal bills you have some time on you better pay them next month if you're skipping them now. Always be sure that you won't incur a charge for skipping a bill. It's not worth skipping a £33 bill to get a £50 charge to deal with next month, on top of the bill amount.
			
			6) "Emergency" fund money. This for me is a smaller contribution each month than it probably should be, but I'm focusing more on my credit card payments than on my emergency preparations. This is a personal choice. The ideal amount of money you should have in your Emergency fund should be 2-3 months worth of expenses, just in case you lose your job or a big financial expense comes at you out of nowhere.
			
			7) Look at what you have left. This is your "fun" money. Totally do something fun with it, or working day in and day out will drive you insane.

				Regarding your food point there – paying in cash is *definitely* a good idea. If you say "ok I have $20 to spend on food today" and you walk into the store with a credit card pay, it's so easy to say "well... maybe I'll make it $25 because I want this snack." There's disassociation with your credit card because swiping a card doesn't feel like spending money. You don't have to see and realize how much you're actually spending now until you have to pay the bill later on. 
				
				If you have cash, that's different. You know exactly how much you're giving up, and you're giving it up right now! For most people, at least, they'll be more frugal if they can actually see a pile of grocery money dwindle.

				It's completely possible, you just need to get an agreed upon standard for the Silence Signal first.
				
				Worst case scenario, Google comes up with one for Android and requires its adoption in all new phones that want to be able to use Google Play services (meaning basically all of them), that gets adopted by most (not all) basic phones because it's a good standard, Apple puts out a crappier, incompatible version that gets just as popular while only working on iThings, and operators need to buy two signal transmitters.

	That parenting takes work.   You will be frustrated.  Training of any kind takes patience and a time investment.    If you want your kid to go to bed at a certain time, set the time and reinforce it.   They will stall, cry, whine, and manipulate to see if it works...and then you reinforce consequences.     Once you have it down, you are set.  It's just maintenance after that point.

		If your 5 year old feels perfectly comfortable running around a store knocking items to the floor and screaming at the top of their lungs because you don't want to get them a toy, what do you suppose they will behave like at 15?
		
		If they throw a tantrum at 9 to punish you for not doing what they want, what do you suppose they'll do at 16 for not giving them what they want?

	If a tree falls in the middle of the forest, and nobody is there to hear it, did it make a noise?

	Of course it freaking made a noise. Noise is created when the air around the thing that caused the noise vibrates and creates sound waves. Did that happen? Yes. Nobody heard it but it produced a noise. IT MADE A NOISE GODDAMMIT

	I have to deal with this question all the time: How do you stay so skinny; or any of it's variations or side comments like "I wish I could be skinny like you, being big runs in the family". There's no big secret diet, there's no genetic tricks.

	>Eat less, weigh less. 

	>Walk somewhere once in a while.

	That's the big secret to being thin.

	Don't kill someone. Don't steal. Don't fuck your friend's wife. These things should be common sense but people don't get it. Hence they had to write them down...

	If an act doesn't harm anyone in any way then you don't have the "right" to oppose it. I'm looking at you "don't force gay marriage on me" people.

	Just because you *can* dress a certain way, doesn't mean you *should* dress a certain way, and people *do* judge you based on your clothing decisions. 

	* 🟨 **[MetalManiac619](https://www.reddit.com/user/MetalManiac619)** ⬆️ 93 _(2014-09-01 09:22:44)_

		People *know* that others judge them. Just some are smart enough *not* to give a *fuck*. Seriously, if you have a problem with how somebody else is dressed, it's your problem, not theirs.

			No. Incorrect. How you are judged by people is *your problem.* "I don't give a fuck how people think of me" is bullshit. Of course you do, because it's something that actually matters in your day to day life. How people you don't know immediately judge you has an effect on every interaction you have during your day. 
			
			I have 5 seconds to get an opinion of you. I can tell something about you based on the clothing you decided to put on yourself and the way you've done your hair. If anything, I can tell that you're a person that "*doesn't* give a *fuck*", and I can extrapolate from there that you don't give a fuck about much of anything. And those kinds of people, most others find, are very aggravating to deal with. 

			* 🟦 **[ThisHand](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThisHand)** ⬆️ 15 _(2014-09-01 11:21:12)_

				The funnier thing is: people who *say* they don't give a fuck are literally broadcasting the way that they desire to be judged by others. Although, they want to project that they don't give a fuck when they really give a fuck that people think they don't give a fuck. It is and always has been the dilemma of the hipster credo. 
				
				Although, when you extrapolate that they don't give a fuck about anything you're being a bit of an ass. There was a guy with shitty hair and bad sweaters that gave a lot of fucks about physics at the very least. That man's name? Albert Einstein. 

			* 🟦 **[hydrogen_wv](https://www.reddit.com/user/hydrogen_wv)** ⬆️ 30 _(2014-09-01 11:04:14)_

				Most people I know that always say they don't care what others think just use it as an excuse to be worthless (rude, selfish, mooching, racist, alcoholic). Its like a defense mechanism almost.

		* 🟧 **[SayAllenthing](https://www.reddit.com/user/SayAllenthing)** ⬆️ 9 _(2014-09-01 11:58:37)_

			Most of the people who claim to not care about what others think of them don't usually come off as smart.
			
			There is dressing "quirky" and saying you don't care, but the people who truly do not give a fuck are the ones we all complain about. The people who don't care if you can hear their music on the subway, remorse for being rude is caring what people think of you.
			
			Those people are not smart in my opinion. Caring about what people think is normal and some people are too stupid to notice how other people feel about them.

	When a certain website cheers one thing, then later cheers the opposite thing, those cheers are from different people. The website is not being "inconsistent", "schizophrenic", or anything else like that.

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 8 _(2014-09-01 11:09:40)_

	Alright listen you fucking shit. Aren't you aware that there are other people walking as well!? Why must you stop to check your phone or to walk extremely slow when people are trying to walk. Or when someone is trying to walk past you without bothering you, you seem to go directly where they're are going. And for the love of god if your walking in a group and someone is trying to walk past you don't block the way or give him evils when he is trying to push past as you couldn't be considerate enough to move your fucking body out the way by even a few centimetres.

	Okay rant over. But seriously be aware of other people when walking. The world in no way revolves solely around you.
