## I understand that racial categories like "black" or "white" emerged in the 1600-1800s. Before this, how did people describe or categorize the obvious physical differences between people from different regions?

> By the 1800s, at least in "The West" (Europe and USA), we had pretty solid defined categories used by the various governments to describe people and group them based on skin color and other features. In the USA, there were whites and blacks, just as there was in British India, although in India I understand a "black" person wasn't an African, but rather, a native Indian. So, for the British Empire, it seems like "black" just meant "non-white". I also understand the labels varied from one nation to the next, and I even understand a bit about how these labels arose during the 1600s with the rise of colonialism in the Americas, Africa and Asia. I also get that white Europeans during this time often saw themselves as superior or divinely favored, or, at least, the descendants of non-cursed people (like how Ham, son of Noah was cursed). So I sorta get how these labels came to be, why they emerged and so on.

> Let's take the Greeks or Romans or the Byzantines or the Gauls. These groups all knew of, let's say, sub-Saharan Africans. They knew of these very dark skinned, curly hair, dark featured people from present day Nigeria or Zimbabwe. They traded with these people, from Mali or the Kanem Empire. Columbus himself, an Genoan saling under hire by the Spanish, wrote about "Cathay", which is what he called China and East Asia, so it wasn't news to him that the Chinese existed, or the Africans, or the Indians.

> See what I mean? Later generations would've called them "blacks" or "Negroes". What did a Roman diplomat call them? Or a Spanish trader? They must've noticed the significant physical differences and felt the need to categorize them in some way, even if they had no use for governance (since they hadn't colonized yet).

	Just to add to the previous answers already linked by /[u/katzceratops](https://www.reddit.com/user/katzceratops): 

	Likely of interest also are [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/j41lvn/if_there_was_an_african_population_ethiopians_in/) by /[u/sunagainstgold](https://www.reddit.com/user/sunagainstgold), under which I provide a relevant followup on the role of 'black' and 'white' vocabulary in the Middle Ages; this [classic answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/otknk2/is_white_europe_a_myth/) by /[u/kelpie](https://www.reddit.com/user/kelpie)-cat, which among other things addresses the use of 'blue' as a way of describing dark skin tones; finally, two other answers of mine [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/mnpokc/i_am_a_regular_english_person_not_a_noble_or/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/17qkdkj/who_were_the_very_first_muslims_in_england/) are also relevant to this question. 

	While I don't have a full answers worth of material to add to what I have written previously on the subject, I will note one further point about the valuation of colour (and by extension skin colour) in the Middle Ages. The opposition of white and black in general provided a significant metaphor in the Christian world for the opposition of good and evil. In particular it was a total commonplace in Patristic exegesis that blackness represented sin. Thus, for example, Augustine compares the skillful use of black pigment by painters, which enhances the beautry of the whole, to the way that sin, though ugly and defored in itself, nevertheless serves to enhance the whole:

	>>quoniam sicut pictura cum colore nigro loco suo posito, ita uniuersitas rerum, si quis possit intueri, etiam cum peccatoribus pulchra est, quamuis per se ipsos consideratos sua deformitas turpet. 

	>>>For just as a picture is enhanced by the proper placing within it of dark colours, so, to those able to discern it, the beautry of the universe is enhanced even by sinners, though, considered in themselves, theirs is a sorry deformity. 

	>>> Augustine, *City of God* 11.23 (trans. Dyson, 479)

	While this, as we see here, needn't have the least bit to do with skin tone, by this same logic, dark-skinned people likewise became a metaphor for sin. Thus it was likewise a common patristic strategy to interpret the Ethiopian as a figure of the sinful person. Thus again, picking the first example I found from a basic wordsearch of patristic texts, Ambrose of Milan explains, in his discussion of the rivers of Paradise, that the Geon (i.e. the Nile) is said to flow around the land of Ethiopia:

	>> bene ergo Geon, in quo figura est castitatis, circumire terram Aethiopiam dicitur, ut abluat corpus abiectum et carnis uilissimae restinguat incendium; Aethiopia enim abiecta et uilis Latina interpretatione signatur. quid autem abiectius nostro corpore, quid tam Aethiopiae simile, quod etiam nigrum est quibusdam tenebris peccatorum? 

	>>> Well indeed the Geon, in which is the image of chastity, is said to circle the land of Ethiopia, so as to wash clean the squalid(/abject) body and extinguish the flame of floulest(/basest) flesh, for indeed Ethiopia means squalid(/abject) and foul(/base) in Latin. But what is more squalid, what is more similar to the Ethiopian than our body, which is black by the darkness of sin?

	>>>Ambrose, *De paradiso* 16 (CSEL 32/1, 276; my trans.):

	Now, this sort of hermeneutic blackness isn't inherently linked to black people in the way the Curse of Ham was in the Early Modern period, but it is a recurrent theme across the Middle Ages. We can see potential influnces of this in the depiction of Jews with dark skin tones sometimes or the representation of the executioners of John the Bapitst and Christ as Ethiopians. This is likewise especially clear in romance narratives, where the conversion of Muslims to Christianity could be accompanied by a literal change of skin colour from black to white (as discussed by Sunagainstgold in the thread I linked at the start).

	Finally, this could also function the other way around, as we see in Bede's famous story about St Gregory's comments on the Angles, where in part the whiteness of their bodies promps Gregory to associate their :

	>>Dicunt, quia die quadam cum, aduenientibus nuper mercatoribus, multa uenalia in forum fuissent conlata, multi ad emendum confluxissent, et ipsum Gregorium inter alios aduenisse, ac uidisse inter alia **pueros** uenales positos **candidi corporis, ac uenusti uultus, capillorum quoque forma egregia**. Quos cum aspiceret, interrogauit, ut aiunt, de qua regione uel terra essent adlati. Dictumque est, quia de Brittania insula, cuius incolae talis essent aspectus. Rursus interrogauit, utrum idem insulani Christiani, an paganis adhuc erroribus essent inplicati. Dictum est, quod essent pagani. At ille, intimo ex corde longa trahens suspiria: ‘Heu, pro dolor!’ inquit, ‘quod tam lucidi uultus homines tenebrarum auctor possidet, tantaque gratia frontispicii mentem ab interna gratia uacuam gestat!’ Rursus ergo interrogauit, quod esset uocabulum gentis illius. Responsum est, quod Angli uocarentur. At ille: ‘Bene,’ inquit; ‘**nam et angelicam habent faciem**, et tales angelorum in caelis decet esse coheredes. Quod habet nomen ipsa prouincia, de qua isti sunt adlati?’

	>>>It is reported, that some merchants, having just arrived at Rome on a certain day, exposed many things for sale in the marketplace, and abundance of people resorted thither to buy: Gregory himself went with the rest, and, among other things, **some boys** were set to sale, **their bodies white, their countenances beautiful, and their hair very fine**. Having viewed them, he asked, as is said, from what country or nation they were brought? and was told, from the island of Britain, whose inhabitants were of such personal appearance. He again inquired whether those islanders were Christians, or still involved in the errors of paganism? and was informed that they were pagans. Then fetching a deep sigh from the bottom of his heart, "Alas! what pity," said he, "that the author of darkness is possessed of men of such fair countenances; and that being remarkable for such graceful aspects, their minds should be void of inward grace." He therefore again asked, what was the name of that nation? and was answered, that they were called Angles. "Right," said he, "**for they have an Angelic face**, and it becomes such to be co-heirs with the Angels in heaven. What is the name," proceeded he, "of the province from which they are brought?" (Bede, Ecclesiastical History 2.1; trans. Stevens)

	Anyways, this has wandered somewhat off the topic at the root of your question, but it shows in part how the ideas that began to calcify in the early modern period didn't emerge from a vacuum.
