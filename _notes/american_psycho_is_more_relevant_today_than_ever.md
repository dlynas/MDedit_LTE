	American Psycho has remained consistently relevant since the book. Though I don't personally agree with your reasons why. For me, it's because the Bateman character type entered the culture during the 80s. Not the yuppie nor the Wall St trader, but the young, aspirational male increasingly confused and detached about what it means to be male in a post-manufacturing, western capitalist environment.

	He obsesses over brands, clothes, skin care, list making, gym culture, business cards as ontology, restaurant reservations (not eating), his appearance. He's utterly lost about what it is to me male in a culture that was evolving beyond classical ideas of masculinity. And this morphs into a kind of hyper-misogyny and fantasy existence based around sex and violence. 

	Easton-Ellis, as a fairly straight-coded homosexual man, was perfectly placed to witness how the culture of middle-class straight men was adopting the tropes of gay male lifestyles by osmosis.

	In a way, Bateman is the evolution of Richard Gere's character in Schrader's much-underrated American Gigolo: a man who believes himself to be the apex of masculinity and in control of who he is and his environment, but is in actual fact deeply confused and delusional about his place in the world. 

	It presciently predicts how lost men were about to become in a culture that increasingly had no use for the masculine traits of old. He's a proto Andrew Tate.

		Well there‚Äôs a bigger thing than just Bateman. The world Bateman lives in is Reagan‚Äôs trickle down economics. A world where the rich are richer and the poor are poorer. The whole time Bateman thinks he‚Äôs slick but in a twilight zone level twist he realizes that the people he‚Äôs surrounded by, generationally rich reptilian blue bloods- don‚Äôt actually *care* if he‚Äôs killing people. It doesn‚Äôt matter if Bateman is killing people because the people in his circle have no empathy.

			Yeah, that's in there too.
			Another milleu Easton-Ellis was well placed to observe. 
			
			Most of his books operate in that sphere to a degree. He was also pretty prescient again in the late 90s by eviscerating the Prada-Meinhoff set that inhabits fashion, media and the arts in Glamorama. 
			
			They're all still with us in numbers today too. Posturing social causes to keep the wheels of capitalism turning. That book is probably even more relevant now than American Psycho. Someone should take a crack at adapting it. But it's unlikely to get greenlit as it perhaps hits too close to home for the entertainment industry...

		While masculinity is a motif in American Psycho, I think that's a reductionist and retrofitted way to interpret the film. The film is much more broadly about superficial consumerism and conformity, I'm not sure they could be any clearer about that.
		
		The main character's pathologic obsession with fitting is an attempt to relieve his chronic emptiness and resentment, as are his killings. Again, the film practically breaks the fourth wall to get this point across in an almost essay-like fashion. Reducing Bateman to a 'sigma male that hates women' really doesn't capture his motivation to kill. He does hate women, but really he just hates people--above all himself--and the modern society that produced them. I mean he spends about half the movie killing men.
		
		As a final thought experiment, try to remake American Psycho where the protagonist is a similarly miserable 1980s rich white woman who secretly kills people with poison or something. How about if the protagonist is a 1980s black guy secretly axing people to death. I reckon one of those choices would be inherently easier to capture the themes of the original film.

			In both your hypotheticals, you're taking someone subjugated to some extent, and replacing a protagonist who embodies what the struggle near the top of a patriarchal hierarchy is supposed to look like, who looks and sounds the way someone at the top of the hierarchy is supposed to.

		What dovetails this sentiment is Bateman's core want to "just fit in" and how he talks about his social mask slipping all the time. To me this was never about his being a serial killer which is either imagined or real, but unremarked by the world around him so to him not really a concern socially, but his want to fit in as a young businessman in modern capitalist NY culture is core to all his interactions and the undercurrent of his monologue. He can spend pages and pages of the book waxing lyrical about shampoo brands and Genesis, but despite knowing all the 'right' things and meeting all those social responsibilities with his yuppie mates, he never fits in with his friends, he never fits in with his girlfriend, he never fits in at his job. He's in perpetual anxiety and insecurity, which the movie doesn't quite portray to the level of the book where his inner monologue is farcical. That idea of a man unable to know his identity or place in the world is very very real nowadays, and certainly is prime picking for grifters like Andrew Tate, ready to tell these confused men and boys what their identity is -- all their worst insecurities and impulses, a Patrick Bateman.
		
		We need to rebuild man's identity because it's become clear the old ideas of masculinity and "being a man" are all bound up in hurtful toxic bullshit. But as yet we haven't been able to articulate any clear replacement for men to strive to be and model themselves around. And any time we do undoubtedly people come out to either deflate any ideas or offer counter-arguments to any new identity for men in society. Bateman really was the personification of that concept -- a man with no identity, lost and passively experiencing the world around him, unable to connect or feel anything.

		* üüß **[_dondi](https://www.reddit.com/user/_dondi)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1 _(2024-03-08 06:40:33)_

			I agree with you wholeheartedly.
			
			It was absolutely necessary for us to deconstruct the tenets of masculinity and examine the problems that lay within. However, there's been no real attempt, or apparent desire, to reconstruct it into a definable model or fully-functioning state after the comprehensive demolition. The result has been a vacuum filled by bad faith actors and grifters selling shoddy philosophies and placebo palliatives. This is a very sorry state of affairs.
			
			For those of us who never really bought into the manufactured constructs of traditional masculinity in the first place, this isn't too much of a problem - our sense of self remains intact and we operate seamlessly within evolving cultural environments whilst still retaining a sense of what it means to be male. But for others, and especially those coming of age in this environment, it's much more complex.
			
			Personally, I've always been in agreement with Beth Gibbon's lyrics in Portishead's Glory Box: Don't you stop being a man, just take a little look, from outside, when you can.

			Re-watching Malcom in the Middle and Hal has a lot of crazy inspirational and aspirational qualities. He has a big heart and the craziest confidence. He's more about ensuring himself and the people around him are having fun and feel comfortable. He's not the smartest but he's not insecure about it and he respects and admires those who are. He's not inherently violent or abusive but he's willing to be in the name of what's right (although this is arguably his worst trait since he could probably be a little less quick to react). When he has arguments with his partner it's always resolved fairly quickly and amicably and with a lot of self awareness and he isn't afraid to admit when he is wrong.
			
			In season 1 he has a conversation with a bathroom attendant who thanks Hal for "making eye contact with him". Hal's response is to invite him to come and have a lobster dinner with him at his table.
			
			He's not perfect. Like all of us he is flawed. But God damn if he doesn't try his best. Men should try and be like Hal. I'm sure someone has a better rebuttal for my half cooked theory but right now I'm sticking by it.

				The issue with Hal is he married a controlling narcissist wife and so he and the entire family is permanently in her grip. Hal tries but unfortunately he cannot see that the woman he married tears him and his kids down on the regular, so he will never be able to properly stand up for himself or be happy. A remarkably common dynamic in real life dysfunctional households, an otherwise kind and warm parent marries a cold calculating narcissist and through being legally wedded and not having insight is sort of locked in their own mental prison there. Then they pretty much lose their own sense of self in giving over to the narcissist.

					That's the mentality you're supposed to have towards Lois when you're a child and in that sense I understand but as an adult you could not be more wrong. She couldn't be further from narcissistic because if she was she would have left the family to live out her life as Consuela. Lois is the only one keeping the family together and looked after. Without her there would be no show because all the children would literally be dead from starvation. I would suggest watching the show as an adult because Lois is the one doing more than anyone else in the show and she clearly loves her family so much. Her being the villain is the child mentality.

		No, narcissists and psychopaths have existed as long as people have (and a disproportionate amount of people on Wall Street and in the financial industry, including CEOs, stock traders, sales &amp; marketing, etc, are psychopaths who cannot feel empathy or guilt or remorse). Corporations behave like parasitic psychopaths because in the 70s, conservative economist Milton Friedman said ‚ÄúThere is one and only one social responsibility of business‚Äîto use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits.‚Äù Putting profits over people comes instinctively to psychopaths, because psychopaths cannot care about people, so they view other people as marks to be exploited and taken advantage of.
		
		Although the 80s certainly popularized making quick money in the stock market. The fictional character Gordon Gekko in the film Wall Street (1987) said ‚Äúgreed is good‚Äù (although before that, Ayn Rand said [selfishness](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Virtue_of_Selfishness) is the greatest virtue.)
		
		[This](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/attraction-evolved/201910/are-psychopaths-sexy) says ‚Äúmen who scored higher on the psychopathy questionnaire were rated more desirable by women‚Äù, and the conclusion of many studies is typically that psychopaths may make better hunters or warriors. It could be because low empathy due to psychopathy exhibits similarly to low empathy due to high testosterone.¬†
		
		>He obsesses over brands, clothes, skin care, list making, gym culture, business cards as ontology, restaurant reservations (not eating), his appearance.
		
		Because Patrick Bateman is a narcissistic psychopath, and narcissists crave attention and status.
		
		>He's utterly lost about what it is to me male in a culture that was evolving beyond classical ideas of masculinity. And this morphs into a kind of hyper-misogyny and fantasy existence based around sex and violence.
		
		Psychopaths don‚Äôt care ‚Äúwhat it is to be male‚Äù, because they don‚Äôt even know what it feels like to be human, and they are ‚Äúlost‚Äù because they are empty and hollow, with a moral void or moral vacuum, so psychopaths don‚Äôt think anything is morally wrong, and psychopaths cannot feel guilt for inflicting violence. Narcissistic rage doesn‚Äôt turn people into misogynists, it means everyone is a potential victim, and psychopaths see people as objects or obstacles or tools to be used and discarded.
		
		Testosterone suppresses the empathy hormone oxytocin, competition also decreases empathy (which explains why so many online gamers are insufferable assholes), and [psychopathy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24059750/) and [autism](https://www.nature.com/articles/mp201477) can both be caused by different mutations to the [oxytocin receptor gene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin_receptor) (OXTR) on chromosome 3, and oxytocin is the empathy hormone, love hormone, the trust hormone, the bonding hormone. So it‚Äôs common for people with ASPD (anti-social personality disorder) or ASD (autism spectrum disorder) to have empathy deficits (which is not to say that all people with autism have zero empathy).¬†
		
		>Easton-Ellis, as a fairly straight-coded homosexual man, was perfectly placed to witness how the culture of middle-class straight men was adopting the tropes of gay male lifestyles by osmosis.
		
		Freud said homosexuality in males is rooted in narcissism, and I can‚Äôt say he‚Äôs wrong, and [studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20063233/) have supported his hypothesis, since ‚Äúhomosexual students score higher in both measures of narcissism and lower on the self-esteem measure, compared to their heterosexual counterparts.‚Äù Autism is also frequently marked by empathy deficits, and [Autistic People Are More Likely to Identify as LGBTQ](https://sparkforautism.org/discover_article/autism-lgbtq-identity/).
		
		>It presciently predicts how lost men were about to become in a culture that increasingly had no use for the masculine traits of old. He's a proto Andrew Tate.
		
		Andrew Tate operates under the assumption that women prefer ‚Äúbad boys.‚Äù Which isn‚Äôt a false assumption, since [this](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/attraction-evolved/201910/are-psychopaths-sexy) says ‚Äúmen who scored higher on the psychopathy questionnaire were rated more desirable by women.‚Äù If violence turned women off then no soldier or boxer or MMA fighter or gangster would ever get laid by a woman, and no woman would ever listen to Chris Brown. Meanwhile, socially awkward losers who become mass shooters, like the Parkland shooter or Aurora shooter, receive fanmail in prison from women.
		
		Donald Trump is also a narcissistic psychopath, who tens of millions of women voted for (despite being a rapist), and he is the ‚Äúbad boy of American politics‚Äù (as disgusting as that is to say).
		
		It‚Äôs quite a stretch to say we live in a ‚Äúculture that increasingly had no use for the masculine traits of old‚Äù, when ‚Äústrongman‚Äù leaders and authoritarians like Putin are seeing a recent revival, and Trump‚Äôs entire schtick is his bullshit macho act ‚Äî acting like the alpha male of the group in every situation ‚Äî and he‚Äôs still getting away with it. And Trump voters will not abandon him unless someone stronger topples him ‚Äî until Furiosa kills Immortan Joe, like in Mad Max: Fury Road (2015).

			This is exactly why I'm so uncomfortable with interpreting American Psycho as a gender film. He *tells* you while the opening credits are practically running that he's not a man that we can relate to in any meaningful way because he's not a *human being*. How people can expect anyone to watch Bateman chainsaw a woman to death and have us leaving the theatre saying "oh man, I need to treat women better" is a little astounding.
			
			American Psycho is a film about male issues inasmuch as Silence of the Lambs is a film about transgender issues; they are plot elements but focusing on them kind of loses what drives the characters.
			
			Otherwise, would we ever be able to recognize the evil inside Patrick Bateman if it inhabited a different human vessel? Or are we as oblivious as the doorman or dry cleaner and everyone else staring evil right in the face? I fear that we are.

			A well-written and comprehensive rebuttal which addresses the continued popularity of the "psychopathic personality type" within certain sectors of society. I'm frankly quite honoured that you have gone to such great lengths, citations included, in reply. Thank you. And much of what you say is not untrue.
			
			However, for me, much of this can be attributed to a reaction by a subsection of society - often of a more conservative or traditional bent - to what they perceive as the "feminising" of the American male and the culture at large. 
			
			Parallel to the emergence and adoption of more liberal and socially enlightened ideas in popular culture over the last decade or so, a counter movement has emerged - not entirely organically and predominantly in the political sphere for obvious reasons - that is under the impression that their "way of life" is threatened by progressives. This is continually stoked by those with a vested interest to do so.
			
			These are the American Psychos of today. These are the Batemans of our time. Not the stokers of fear - they're an entirely different breed who's sense of self never waivers - but the ones that feel lost, threatened and confused. They lionize ridiculous demigogues like Trump or Tate in the vain hope they will strongarm the culture back to where they want it to be - a return to a mythical time of picket fences, American hegemonic dominance and domestic security.
			
			We've witnessed this kind of political revanchism countless times before however and we know where it leads. 
			
			Bateman is not actually a psychopath. He wants to be a psychopath. Because he thinks it makes him more interesting, admired and in control. It's all empty posturing though. He's a phoney. This is what he shares with many today: posturing in the face of confusion about who they are and their place in society.
			
			Online has been the perfect incubator and amplifier for this exact kind of low-self-esteem-powered narcissism. There are now legions of Batemans living out their psychopathic fantasies online. And sometimes it births a genuine one. More or less than before? Who knows. But most remain secluded within their adolescent Fantasyland of macho braggadocio.
			
			I honestly enjoy that you disagreed with me and took the time to construct your measured response. This is an interesting conversation, even if we don't especially see eye to eye. In fact, it's all the more interesting to me because of that.

	I think American Psycho is more about alienation and madness. Bret Easton Ellis came right out and said it's about his own feelings of alienation.

	"**It initiated because of my own isolation and alienation at a point in my life**. I was living like Patrick Bateman. I was slipping into a consumerist kind of void that was supposed to give me confidence and make me feel good about myself but just made me feel worse and worse and worse about myself."

	It's similar to Taxi Driver and Travis Bickle. That script/film is about alienation, and inability to connect in the modern world and the offshooting madness/violence resulting from it.

	I think this theme holds up and is more relevant today with people living on devices and not physically connecting with other people.

		Concur, but Harron and Turner's treatment turns Patrick into a character of infinitely more ridicule than his portrayal in the book. Personally, I think it's one of the best page-to-screen adaptations of all time - they really got it - but Easton-Ellis loathes it. Probably because they nailed it and him.
		
		Taxi Driver, in its updating of The Searchers, functions in a slightly different way regarding societal alienation for me. 
		
		Both Travis and Ethan believe they are operating within the confines of morality for the greater good of society and utilise the toolset they've been societally trained in - violence towards perceived threats to civilisation - to ingratiate themselves back into said society. Travis terrifyingly succeeds in a way, whereas Ethan realises it's probably best if he just leaves as his time has passed and "civilised" society may no longer benefit from his methods and particular "skillset". 
		
		Bateman is merely an ineffectual fantasist who's never had any discernable use or skillset to aid society. He's a double-blank within the Blank Generation. He has no moral code, no matter how warped, whatsoever. And society has none to provide him with.
		
		He's basically pointless in a society that doesn't really have a point anyway. Bummer.

	I'm not going to totally reject the notion that any readings of American Psycho are increasingly relevant today, but I don't really agree with any of the points you make to back up that statement. 

	"TikTokers" are inherently unfathomably more diverse than the yuppie hegemony that American Psycho is parodying, both because of the huge population you're generalising and the fact that the general public in western cultures is becoming increasingly disinterested in engaging in monoculture. 

	That some people follow fashion trends or go to the gym is hardly a parallel in my opinion. Comparing one case (of many) where a perpetrator is treated well due to their looks is also not really in line with Patrick Bateman getting away with murder, and is more in line with the sort of privilege that comes with being conventionally attractive (which has existed since time immemorial). 

	The point about "putting on a persona so that others will like you" is the closest I get to agreeing with you, but I really don't see what TikTok content creators - or even social media personalities in general - specifically have in common with how this topic is approached in American Psycho.

	I also fundamentally disagree that American Psycho is a "wake-up call".

	*Bonfire of the Vanities* was a book written in the 80s contemporary to Yuppie culture that satirised it.

	*American Psycho* was a novel that added elements of stream.of consciousness horror to the satire.

	What‚Äôs crazy to me about American Psycho is that people effectively miss the point with it. I see all these people idolizing Patrick Bateman making it clear they didn‚Äôt read the book they just watched the movie. Patrick Bateman is not supposed to be idolized. He‚Äôs a satire of men in corporate jobs who are rich but do nothing. Bateman is a sadistic abusive rapist murderer and it shocks me how many people miss the point when it comes to this. 

	Not to mention the fact that the book and movie are also a message about how men tending to be creatures of routine will fall into a trend where they imagine themselves doing outrageous things just to do something different. It doesn‚Äôt exactly mean that they will do the things that Bateman does but they will imagine themselves doing other things or push themselves into a midlife crisis after realizing that their lives have been doing the same thing over and over

		Reading the book minus Christian Bale‚Äôs charisma is an eye opener. The director managed to round off the book‚Äôs sharpest edges to make it semi-palatable to mainstream audiences. It‚Äôs a good movie but even with its awful murders it still avoids the true, abysmal evil of the novel Patrick Bateman.

			I beleive a major part of it is the medium. Like the passage about there being an idea of a Patrick Bateman hits harder on the written page than seeing Christian Bale give the character a form to exist in. Sure, the removal of scenes that push the limits of the MPAA's R-rating on violence can be brought into the equation, but seeing the results of what such a routine as Bateman's can result in, strictly from an appearance standpoint, makes people ignore everything other than, "wow I'm just a few good habits away from being as sexy and suave as Christian Bale!" The book forces you to be stuck in the headspace of Patrick Bateman, which is not a great place to be. The thoughts dominate the story, from the vapid idea of what's important in life to the constant feeling of a void within. Unless you made the film POV or like *Blue*, you just can recreate the same effect in my opinion.

	I would argue that consumerism has in fact evolved beyond the reality of American Psycho, since it's no longer enough to have a socially attractive fa√ßade by simply having the money to buy objects: a well designed business card, a shredded body and an expensive suit; what was once only required of politicians and movie stars by media consultants is now applied to us, "the simple folk", who are expected and required to cultivate and project to others a sense of an original, authentic self. Essentially, to create a version that makes us worthy of consumption. The criticism and scrutiny expressed against social media as a platform and the legal requirement to mark something as #ad for clarification is as superficial of a solution as it was to enforce a no Photoshop rule on fashion magazines in the early 00's. It fails to create a meaningful, critical discussion or even a philosophical one, whether we are even capable as a modern society to value something when it isn't tangible or that partaking in it doesn't reward us.

	The connection you‚Äôve made between people wanting to get a guy out because he looks dashing with a sk blending into society serves your point of the movie‚Äôs relevancy, but I‚Äôd argue these two examples  are unrelated. My point is, you could link any societal screw up with a story about a screwed up society. 

	I have watched a couple of yt videos of the movie, and they‚Äôve made apt descriptions of the movie. To summarise, American Psycho is a movie about men(applies to any person but case in point) trying to find their identity, also why Fight Club is getting mentioned. 

	American Psycho is a story of many dichotomies. Bateman is a hygiene freak but indulges in gore, he is meticulous and yet lashes out of control etc. The card scene is an excellent example of one of the dichotomies: individuality. Bateman flashed his state of the art card to his colleagues, an attempt to cement his individualism; the person he is, is how he signatures his possessions(as with the music records). When he watches everyone else present identical cards, our flabbergasted protagonist is left ashamed and exposed like a child crying over the first time they lost their childhood. This is the part where the movie is about men. We modify our keyboards to our liking, organise wires on our desks to sync them with our personality, follow routines to estabilish space in the world and find people with similar interests. It gets daunting when the same people‚Äôs identity mimics yours. This is the stuff of 1984. Bateman‚Äôs individuality is invaded in a similar way. He goes from a self-control maniac to feeling like just another cog in an automated machine. 

	Internet invaded our identity In a similar way: we get people like us right in front of our screens, shown the very memes they upvote. Recommendations are programmed this way. This is why the movie is more relevant now: the central theme is about owning molecular real estate in a communist universe.

	I believe the word for that is prescience, and absolutely. There are large swathes of people who don't even see a problem with the Patrick Bateman approach. In fact, I would expect most people don't even get to the level of awareness of others or their impact on them, to even know who they are killing everyday by how they live, even themselves.

	Everyone becomes more and more desperate to survive, and self-interested in equal measures. Success allows you to focus more on non-base-level areas, but it can make you more detached from the majority, and that callousness can be really bad.  It's a catch-22 without accountability upward or downward. Rich are ruthless, and the poor more often than not write themselves off as victims or are actually powerless in their own lives. We are positioned to work against ourselves and against others, and both inwardly and outwardly. We must look for something beyond human, beyond fundamental flaws.

	So I love this film. The book is intentionally boring so I never read it. 

	He is a dude obsessed with labels and reputation and self image, and people look up to him despite him being a villain. One of the actual messages is to not be so caught up in materialism. 

	This replaced the default "sigma male" film where people worship the villain, fight club. 

	That is a dude who is an anarchist, steals all his clothes, rejects self image, and people look up to him despite him being a villain. One of the actual messages is to not reject society, and to give a shit about things, at least to a healthy level.

	One million percent. [If you want a whole literary analysis of the movie that has that in mind.](https://filmcolossus.com/american-psycho-explained)

	One thing that I‚Äôd like to note that people don‚Äôt really like to hear is that this is [what Saltburn is about](https://filmcolossus.com/saltburn-2023-explained). It‚Äôs in the vein of American Psycho in being about a zeitgeist. It‚Äôs not a class movie. It‚Äôs about power dynamics and how easily a grifter can worm their way in. Faking a personality so people like them. 

	It‚Äôs a more intimate film but similar to American Psycho in that it‚Äôs trying to show us a kind of monstrous persona and what its existence says about society. 

	American Psycho and Fight Club are such a brutal one-two punch about our relationship with consumerism and appearance.

		What rankles with Saltburn though is the presumptuous position Fennel takes from her exalted position as someone from generational wealth. Her potshots at the middle-class obsession with the money, privilege and culture of her upper class echelon moaningly comes across as: these interminable oiks with their tawdry avarice and obsession with us is grubby and pernicious and if we're not careful they'll supplant us and take what's ours. 
		
		It's a frankly tone deaf take from a derivative director. No matter how much she tries to dress it up in her expensively acquired, yet lightly worn, classical-literature semiotics.
		
		She's the one lost in Daedalus's maze.

			That‚Äôs a completely wrong reading of the movie. And it‚Äôs a shame because it‚Äôs been a popular one. 
			
			Oliver does not represent the middle class. He‚Äôs not an Everyman. And the movie isn‚Äôt about class. Not like Parasite. Saltburn also doesn‚Äôt defend the Cattons. It has them vapid, empty, and ripe for plucking from the vine. Rather than some group Fennell admires and wants to defend from the riff-raff.
			
			Like I said in my original comment, Saltburn is about the kind of person who has power. And how the old guard is giving way to this a new kind of grifter. And how we‚Äôre in a time where someone like Oliver can thrive. Just look at social media and politics and how many charlatans gain huge followings and influence based on who they present themselves to be rather than who they are.
			
			That‚Äôs what Saltburn is about. It has a lot more complexity to it. But people misread it and take the worst interpretation.
			
			It‚Äôs like when people said Fight Club is just an action movie. Or that Starship Troopers is pro-fascism.

				No, it's not a "completely wrong reading". It's a reading that you happen to disagree with. 
				
				And you're absolutely entitled to interpret it in the way that you do. This may also be what Fennel was trying to communicate, but, for me - and perhaps others - it doesn't come over. Notwithstanding that this reading is pretty much the same thing anyway: the Grifters are coming and if we establishment types fall for it, we're toast.
				
				The establishment generational wealth families are going nowhere. It's not the War of the Roses. It's late stage capitalism and the pieces are nailed to the board. Fennel is a prime example.
				
				Also, invoking two of the most obviously misread films of all time to imply that anyone who disagrees with you is an idiot, is far from the checkmate you think it is.
				
				Let's maybe agree to disagree, perhaps?
