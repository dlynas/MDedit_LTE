### _Democracy Now!_\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amy_Goodman&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Democracy Now!")\]

Goodman had been news director of [Pacifica Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacifica_Radio "Pacifica Radio") station [WBAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBAI "WBAI") in New York City for more than a decade when she co-founded _Democracy Now! The War and Peace Report_ in 1996. Since then, _Democracy Now!_ has been described as "probably the most significant progressive news institution that has come around in some time" by professor and media critic [Robert McChesney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_W._McChesney "Robert W. McChesney").<sup id="cite_ref-thenation.com_20-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Goodman#cite_note-thenation.com-20">[20]</a></sup>

In 2001, the show was temporarily pulled off the air, as a result of a conflict between some Pacifica Radio board members and staff members and listeners over the direction of the station. During that time, it moved to a converted firehouse, from which it broadcast from January 2002 for nearly eight years, until November 13, 2009.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Goodman#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> _Democracy Now!_ subsequently moved to a studio located in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Goodman#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

### British Columbia border crossing incident\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amy_Goodman&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: British Columbia border crossing incident")\]

On November 25, 2009, Goodman and her two colleagues, Denis Moynihan and Chuck Scurich, were detained for approximately 90 minutes by Canadian agents at the [Douglas, British Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas,_British_Columbia "Douglas, British Columbia") [border crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_control "Border control") into Canada while en route to a scheduled meeting at the [Vancouver Public Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Public_Library "Vancouver Public Library"). Immigration officials asked questions pertaining to the intended topics of discussion at the meeting. They wanted to know whether she would be speaking about the [2010 Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Olympic_Games "2010 Olympic Games") to be held in Canada.<sup id="cite_ref-cbcee_34-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Goodman#cite_note-cbcee-34">[34]</a></sup>

She and her colleagues were eventually permitted to enter Canada after the customs authorities took four photographs of her, inspected Scurich's computer, and stapled a "[control document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_(document) "Visa (document)")" into her passport; it required that she leave Canada within 48 hours.<sup id="cite_ref-cbcee_34-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Goodman#cite_note-cbcee-34">[34]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-cbc_35-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Goodman#cite_note-cbc-35">[35]</a></sup>

Goodman's Dakota Access Pipeline video report

In September 2016, Goodman covered the [Dakota Access Pipeline protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Access_Pipeline_protests "Dakota Access Pipeline protests") in [Morton County, North Dakota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton_County,_North_Dakota "Morton County, North Dakota"); footage from her reporting "showed security personnel pepper-spraying and siccing attack dogs on demonstrators."<sup id="cite_ref-CNNMoney_36-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Goodman#cite_note-CNNMoney-36">[36]</a></sup> After _Democracy Now!_ aired the footage, she was charged by state prosecutor Ladd Erickson with criminal trespass. After the court dismissed that charge, Erickson charged her with [riot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot "Riot"),<sup id="cite_ref-CNNMoney_36-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Goodman#cite_note-CNNMoney-36">[36]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ratnerthenationisfacingprison_37-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Goodman#cite_note-ratnerthenationisfacingprison-37">[37]</a></sup> gaining a [warrant for her arrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant "Arrest warrant").<sup id="cite_ref-CNNMoney_36-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Goodman#cite_note-CNNMoney-36">[36]</a></sup> Erickson said that Goodman acted as "a protester" rather than a journalist, because "Everything she reported on was from the position of justifying the protest actions."<sup id="cite_ref-ratnerthenationisfacingprison_37-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Goodman#cite_note-ratnerthenationisfacingprison-37">[37]</a></sup>

Goodman turned herself in to the Morton County sheriff on October 17, saying that she would be fighting the charges against her as a "clear violation" of the [First Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment "First Amendment"), which guarantees [freedom of the press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press_in_the_United_States "Freedom of the press in the United States").<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Goodman#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup> She was supported by the [Committee to Protect Journalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_to_Protect_Journalists "Committee to Protect Journalists"), which issued a statement saying: "This arrest warrant is a transparent attempt to intimidate reporters from covering protests of significant public interest. \[...\] Authorities in North Dakota should stop embarrassing themselves, drop the charges against Amy Goodman, and ensure that all reporters are free to do their jobs."<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Goodman#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> Steve Andrist, executive director of the North Dakota Newspaper Association, also expressed concern that a journalist was one of only two people covered by an arrest warrant from the day in question. Authorities said that Goodman was charged because she was identified from the video footage.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Goodman#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup>

On October 17, 2016, the case was dismissed by District Judge John Grinsteiner, of the South Central Judicial District, who found no [probable cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause "Probable cause") to support a riot charge.<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Goodman#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Goodman#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Goodman#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> The charges against Goodman reportedly increased the public awareness of the Dakota Access Pipeline protests.<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Goodman#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup> Goodman had presented that day's _Democracy Now!_ broadcast from in front of the Morton County Courthouse.<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Goodman#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> Reporter [Deia Schlosberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deia_Schlosberg "Deia Schlosberg") was arrested in similar circumstances while reporting on pipeline-related protests.<sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Goodman#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup>
