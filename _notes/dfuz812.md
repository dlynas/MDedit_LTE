	Washing your hands. Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis noticed people dying of infections and finally realized "Hey, maybe after touching cadavers, we should wash our hands because something is spreading to patients".

	Unfortunately, doctors were offended because they didn't like being blamed for spreading infection, and Semmelweis publicly berated people for not washing their hands. He ended up losing his job, and doctors refused to wash their hands. The poor doctor ended up dying in a mental institution, and now we realize that he was totally right.

		He was considered correct in preventing newborn deaths, however his lack of publishing (students and second hand people published his work, creating confusion) on top of his asshole stance (basically calling people murderers for being confused with little  accurate information) pushed his credibility into the void. Had he pushed his own agenda (washing hands constantly, regardless) and published his own findings instead of relying on others he would have been taken seriously and could have revolutionized medicine.

		Europe's vanguard of scientific progress everybody. Meanwhile Arabs and Asians were hand washing before "the west" figured out it was cool.

			Recall hearing good hygiene practices by Jewish community saved a lot of people from the plague. However instead of others realizing this is why they had fewer plague victims in their community other people instead turned to blaming the local Jewish groups for the plague.

				Actually I think this a myth. I think Jews died just as frequently but were blamed anyway and the whole religious sanitation thing is a reverse explanation of a false premise.

					Given anti-semitic nature if the past this could also be true

			The romans and greeks were washing hands ling before that. The middle ages and the rise of the catholic church pretty much destroyed all knowledge that these two civilisations had left behind.

					The Arabs pretty much only had the Greek stuff. They only got more for adventuring or some shit.
					
					EDIT: They also made some of their own but they were believers of the Four Humours.

		I have said this so many times, they DID wash their hands. What he proposed was to use a solution of chlorinated lime. There was reason to believe him and he was a dick.

	* 🟨 **[scarletnightingale](https://www.reddit.com/user/scarletnightingale)** ⬆️ 2 _(2017-04-05 18:22:14)_

		I believe it was because the doctors considered themselves as gentlemen and "a gentleman's hands are always clean".  So they saw their status as meaning that they couldn't possibly be dirty or spreading contagions.

		And there has been academic speculation that he ended up in a mental institution because he held himself responsible for the deaths he wasn't able to prevent.  In other words, his failure to convince others literally drove him crazy.
