#### The Briefing

-   A person’s carbon footprint is substantial, with activities such as food consumption creating as much as 4,500 g of CO₂ emissions daily.
-   By purchasing carbon credits from Carbon Streaming Corporation, you can offset your own emissions and fund positive climate action.

## Your Everyday Carbon Footprint

While many large businesses and countries have committed to net-zero goals, it is essential to acknowledge that your everyday activities also contribute to global emissions.

In this graphic, sponsored by [Carbon Streaming Corporation](https://www.carbonstreaming.com/?utm_source=vc-companygraphic), we will explore how the choices we make and the products we use have a profound impact on our carbon footprint.

## Carbon Emissions by Activity

Here are some of the daily activities and products of the average person and their carbon footprint, according to [Clever Carbon](https://clevercarbon.io/carbon-footprint-of-common-items/).

| Household Activities & Products | CO2 Emissions (g) |
| --- | --- |
| ![💡](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f4a1.svg) Standard Light Bulb (100 watts, four hours) | 172 g |
| ![📱](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f4f1.svg) Mobile Phone Use (195 minutes per day)\* | 189 g |
| ![👕](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f455.svg) Washing Machine (0.63 kWh) | 275 g |

| ![♨️](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/2668.svg) Tumble Dryer (2.5 kWh) | 1,000 g |

| ![🚙](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f699.svg) Daily Commute (one hour, by car) | 3,360 g |
| ![🍽️](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f37d.svg) Average Daily Food Consumption (three meals of 600 calories) | 4,500 g |

Your choice of transportation plays a crucial role in determining your carbon footprint. For instance, a 15 km daily commute to work on public transport generates an average of 1,464 g of [CO₂ emissions](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/mapped-carbon-dioxide-emissions-around-the-world/). Compared to 3,360 g—**twice** the volume for a journey the same length by car.

By opting for more sustainable modes of transport, such as cycling, walking, or public transportation, you can significantly reduce your carbon footprint.

## Addressing Your Carbon Footprint

One way to compensate for your emissions is by purchasing high-quality carbon credits. 

Carbon credits are used to help fund projects that avoid, reduce or remove CO₂ emissions. This includes [nature-based solutions](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/sp/closing-eleven-trillion-climate-gap/) such as reforestation and improved forest management, or technology-based solutions such as the production of biochar and carbon capture and storage (CCS).

While carbon credits offer a potential solution for individuals to help reduce global emissions, public awareness remains a significant challenge. A [BCG-Patch survey](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/sp/closing-eleven-trillion-climate-gap/) revealed that only **34%** of U.S. consumers are familiar with carbon credits, and only **3%** have purchased them in the past.

## About Carbon Streaming
