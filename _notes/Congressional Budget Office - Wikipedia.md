The **Congressional Budget Office** (**CBO**) is a [federal agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_federal_agencies "List of United States federal agencies") within the [legislative branch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress") of the [United States government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_government "United States government") that provides budget and economic information to Congress.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> Inspired by California's [Legislative Analyst's Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Legislative_Analyst%27s_Office "California Legislative Analyst's Office") that manages the state budget in a strictly nonpartisan fashion, the CBO was created as a nonpartisan agency by the [Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_and_Impoundment_Control_Act_of_1974 "Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974").<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>

## History\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Congressional_Budget_Office&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")\]

The Congressional Budget Office was created by Title II of the [Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_and_Impoundment_Control_Act_of_1974 "Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974") (Pub. L. 93-344), which was signed into law by President [Richard Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon "Richard Nixon") on July 12, 1974.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> Official operations began on February 24, 1975, with [Alice Rivlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Rivlin "Alice Rivlin") as director.<sup id="cite_ref-Joyce_7-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office#cite_note-Joyce-7">[7]</a></sup>

The CBO's creation stems from a fight between President [Richard Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon "Richard Nixon") and a [Democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States) "Democratic Party (United States)")\-controlled [Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress"). Congress wanted to protect its [power of the purse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_the_purse "Power of the purse") from the executive.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_4-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office#cite_note-:0-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> The CBO was created "within the legislative branch to bolster Congress's budgetary understanding and ability to act. Lawmakers' aim was both technical and political: Generate a source of budgetary expertise to aid in writing annual budgets and lessen the legislature's reliance on the president's [Office of Management and Budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Management_and_Budget "Office of Management and Budget")."<sup id="cite_ref-:0_4-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office#cite_note-:0-4">[4]</a></sup> In 2015, the Brookings Institution reported that since its creation, the CBO has since supplanted the OMB "as the authoritative source of information on the economy and the budget in the eyes of Congress, the press, and the public."<sup id="cite_ref-Joyce_7-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office#cite_note-Joyce-7">[7]</a></sup>

## Mission\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Congressional_Budget_Office&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Mission")\]

[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Introduction_to_the_Congressional_Budget_Office.webm "Play video")[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Introduction_to_the_Congressional_Budget_Office.webm)

_Introduction to the Congressional Budget Office_

The Congressional Budget Office is [nonpartisan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpartisanism "Nonpartisanism"), and produces "independent analyses of budgetary and economic issues to support the Congressional budget process."<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> Each year, the agency releases reports and cost estimates for proposed legislation, without issuing any policy recommendations.

With respect to estimating spending for Congress, the Congressional Budget Office serves a purpose parallel to that of the [Joint Committee on Taxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Congress_Joint_Committee_on_Taxation "U.S. Congress Joint Committee on Taxation") for estimating revenue for Congress, the [Department of the Treasury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury "United States Department of the Treasury") for estimating revenues for the [Executive branch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government) "Executive (government)"). This includes projections on the effect on [national debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt "National debt") and cost estimates for legislation.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

## Operations\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Congressional_Budget_Office&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Operations")\]

Section 202(e) of the Budget Act requires the CBO to submit periodic reports about fiscal policy to the [House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Budget "United States House Committee on the Budget") and [Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Budget "United States Senate Committee on the Budget") budget committees to provide baseline projections of the federal budget. This is currently done by preparation of an annual _Economic and Budget Outlook_ plus a mid-year update. The agency also each year issues _An Analysis of the President's Budgetary Proposals_ for the upcoming fiscal year per a standing request of the [Senate Committee on Appropriations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Committee_on_Appropriations "Senate Committee on Appropriations"). These three series are designated essential titles distributed to [Federal Depository Libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_depository_library "Federal depository library") and are available for purchase from the [Government Publishing Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Government_Publishing_Office "United States Government Publishing Office"). The CBO often provides testimony in response to requests from various Congressional committees and issues letters responding to queries made by members of Congress.

## Divisions\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Congressional_Budget_Office&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Divisions")\]

The Congressional Budget Office is divided into nine divisions.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

[Ford House Office Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_House_Office_Building "Ford House Office Building"), headquarters for the CBO

The [Speaker of the House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives") and the [President pro tempore of the Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_pro_tempore_of_the_United_States_Senate "President pro tempore of the United States Senate") jointly appoint the CBO Director after considering recommendations from the two budget committees. The term of office is four years, with no limit on the number of terms a director may serve. Either house of Congress, however, may remove the director by resolution. At the expiration of a term of office, the person serving as Director may continue in the position until his or her successor is appointed.

## Reception\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Congressional_Budget_Office&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Reception")\]

Whereas politicians on both sides of the aisle have criticized the CBO when its estimates have been politically inconvenient,<sup id="cite_ref-:2_3-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office#cite_note-:2-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:0_4-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office#cite_note-:0-4">[4]</a></sup> economists and other academics overwhelmingly reject that the CBO is partisan or that it fails to produce credible forecasts.

A March 2017 survey of leading economists shows a consensus behind the notion that "adjusting for legal restrictions on what the CBO can assume about future legislation and events, the CBO has historically issued credible forecasts of the effects of both Democratic and Republican legislative proposals."<sup id="cite_ref-:1_5-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office#cite_note-:1-5">[5]</a></sup> According to MIT economist [David Autor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Autor "David Autor"), the "CBO has a good track record with a very difficult assignment. It errs, but not systematically or with partisan intent."<sup id="cite_ref-:1_5-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office#cite_note-:1-5">[5]</a></sup> According to Yale economist [Christopher Udry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Udry "Christopher Udry"), "There is no credible evidence of partisan bias."<sup id="cite_ref-:1_5-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office#cite_note-:1-5">[5]</a></sup> Economist [Walter E. Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_E._Williams "Walter E. Williams"), a [classical liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberal "Classical liberal"), wrote in 1998 that the CBO was well-regarded for its "honest numbers" on fiscal and economic matters.<sup id="cite_ref-Joyce_7-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office#cite_note-Joyce-7">[7]</a></sup> According to the _[Los Angeles Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times "Los Angeles Times")_, "the CBO's analyses and forecasting are regarded as good or better than others doing similar work... economists say that the CBO's economic projections generally compare favorably against other outfits, and its long-term budget estimates have been fairly accurate."<sup id="cite_ref-:2_3-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office#cite_note-:2-3">[3]</a></sup>

According to George Washington University political scientist Sarah Binder, the CBO "has emerged over its history as a neutral analyst of congressional budgets and cost estimates for proposed legislation."<sup id="cite_ref-:0_4-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office#cite_note-:0-4">[4]</a></sup> The agency has "a nonpartisan staff culture".<sup id="cite_ref-:0_4-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office#cite_note-:0-4">[4]</a></sup>

Historically, the [House Budget Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Budget_Committee "House Budget Committee") and [Senate Budget Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Budget_Committee "Senate Budget Committee") have insulated the CBO from external pressures and attempts to politicize or weaken the office.<sup id="cite_ref-Joyce_7-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office#cite_note-Joyce-7">[7]</a></sup> Professor Philip Joyce of the [University of Maryland School of Public Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland_School_of_Public_Policy "University of Maryland School of Public Policy") writes:

> This is quite surprising, in a sense, given the partisan nature of the Congress. It is not necessarily that these partisans have embraced nonpartisanship as a positive end in itself, however. Rather, the Budget Committees (and especially their leadership and staff) have recognized that a weak CBO (one that does not have a reputation for objective analysis, and whose conclusions are viewed as partisan) is not in their interest. A weak CBO weakens the Budget Committees, and indeed weakens Congress as a whole in its inevitable battles with the executive over budget and economic policy.<sup id="cite_ref-Joyce_7-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office#cite_note-Joyce-7">[7]</a></sup>
