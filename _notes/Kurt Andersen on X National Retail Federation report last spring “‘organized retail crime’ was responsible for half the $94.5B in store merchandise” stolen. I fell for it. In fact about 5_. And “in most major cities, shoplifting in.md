National Retail Federation report last spring: “‘organized retail crime’ was responsible for half the $94.5B in store merchandise” stolen. I fell for it. In fact: about 5%. And “in most major cities, shoplifting incidents have fallen 7% since 2019.” Hugely important retraction.

“There are three kinds of lies in the world: lies, damn lies, and statistics”

And those claims have fueled racism & it is now clear they aren’t accepting a retraction.

Shoplifting has decreased? Many would be puzzled by that conclusion given their anecdotal experience from the past few years. One confounding issue is whether stores have slowed reporting shoplifting due to degraded police response.

Chris Hayes-MSNBC. Kudos for yanking the rug out from underneath Fox, Brett Baier, and yellow journalism.

Probably they realized it was counterproductive when prosecutors shifted all their efforts against “retail theft” toward a nonexistent problem

Great example of how not to get fooled by the statistics

A Bay Ridge Duane Reade’s back exit is now permanently closed. The store, whose length is from one side street to the other. Hopefully, nothing stupid happens where people have to exit quickly, all at once.

In my major city, all items that could be easily ransoms are now behind locked cabinets, and weren’t in 2019.

I read the report and they retracted nothing. They just didn’t publish the stats the report wanted. There are two possible reasons for the reported drop in shoplifting. 1, That is exactly what happens when shops close due to shoplifting. 2. Why are shops reporting shoplifting

The crime still happened, it just was by an organized group.

With all the dozens (if not hundreds) of instancdes where black folks are doing organized smash-n-grabs and looting entire blocks of stores at once down to the hangers you really believe it's only 5%???!! Come on...

... but why'd you fall for it in the first place?

They buried the lede: most of the losses aren’t from “external” theft at all …. so presumably it’s mostly accidental damage and theft by -employees-:

You and you colleagues need to do some soul-searching about why you accept, uncritically and without fact-checking, the claims of self-interested groups like lobbyists and police

What did you learn Tell us what you learned

I’ve seen employees at grocery stores loading up cars with a large amount of food at closing time, and McDonald’s employees leaving with large bags of food. There’s a huge amount of shrinkage due to employee theft, especially in the grocery business since food is so expensive.

theres always more money for cops
