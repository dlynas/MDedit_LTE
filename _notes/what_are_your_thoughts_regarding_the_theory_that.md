## What are your thoughts regarding the theory that recent culture wars are an intentional distraction from paying attention to more pressing problems?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ezraklein/comments/18t8r71/what_are_your_thoughts_regarding_the_theory_that/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ezraklein/comments/18t8r71/what_are_your_thoughts_regarding_the_theory_that/)

> So this [X post](https://x.com/PBDsPodcast/status/1738630197317087542?s=20) appeared in the "for you" feed on my X account.  The clip is from comedian/podcaster Dave Smith on the PBD podcast. Smith is claiming that the culture wars that take up so much bandwidth since 2012 were a response to grass root movements like the Tea Party, and Occupy Wall Street, etc... It sounds like a wild conspiracy theory, but then I listened to Smith's recent [podcast episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a-funny-thing-happened-in-2012/id833706616?i=1000639952079) discussing this viral clip, and I think he is making some good points. Namely that there are a handful of really salient issues that both the left and right would agree on... such as unnecessary foreign wars, big bank bailouts, massive wealth inequality, etc... So getting these vocal political factions to fight over transgender bathrooms is much better for executives at Goldman Sachs, Lockheed, etc... For example, if you are the owner of the New York times, would you rather hire a young political activist who wants to write about the problem with the patriarchy in America, or an old blue collar beat writer who wants to expose how the US tax code benefits the top 1%?
> 
> Edit.... [Here](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/media-great-racial-awakening) is an article that points out that the spike in words like racism and phrases like "white privilidge" happened around the same time across different media outlets.
> 
> Edit number 2.... could a show like [The Mclaughlin Group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaG0744mI_s) be popular today? A show that gets in the weeds and has guests with very independent views on matters.

	It's not a conspiracy, people just eat that shit up. The media talks about it incessantly because, contrary to what people say, they want to hear about it all the time. Consumers could find other content with just a click if they actually cared to do so, but instead they stick with the culture wars rage-bait.

	Thoughtful debate about tax policy or even something "sexier" like foreign policy just doesn't get eyeballs and ad dollars.

	It's pretty much nonsense.

	Culture has always, always, always... always, always... *always* swamped socioeconomics in terms of its salience with voters. I would defy you to find any time where this *wasn't* the case.

	I mean seriously -

	> Smith is claiming that the culture wars that take up so much bandwidth since 2012

	*Since* 2012? Does Smith not remember the gay marriage debate that dominated the national discourse for much of the prior decade? Bush ran on and can largely attribute much of his re-election in 2004 to that issue.

	Or the myriad of other culture war issues that were recurrent themes throughout that decade. Or the 90's, or the 80's, or the 70's...

	Or like

	> Tea Party

	He and I must remember that *very* differently, because I remember it as a right-wing freak out that we had a black President, masquerading as something to do with tax policy. It was pure distilled culture war stuff if you bothered to barely scratch the surface of it.

		Yes, this!
		
		Just going back a few decades:
		
		 In the 80s, the culture wars were focused on song lyrics and the Satanic Panic, not to mention AIDS/gay rights activism, women entering the corporate world
		
		In the 90s there were massive culture wars over society becoming 'over-sexed,' rap music, homophobia (remember GLAAD picketing Eminem concerts?), beauty standards for women
		
		In the aughts, teaching evolution in schools vs intelligent design was in the headlines for YEARS!
		
		These are just a small sample of past culture wars. The idea that 'culture wars' are new is beyond absurd.

			> In the 80s, the culture wars were focused on song lyrics and the Satanic Panic, not to mention AIDS/gay rights activism, women entering the corporate world
			
			OK, but attitudes around women in the workforce affected had direct effects on the majority of Americans and represented stark differences over laws and policies between the political parties.  Likewise for gay rights, where being gay was literally illegal in many states, and so this "culture war" represented differences over laws and policies that directly affected a relatively large group of people (most estimates suggest about 5% of Americans).   
			
			What's the "culture war" about now?   There's differences over policing, but the actual culture war outbursts tend to be about appropriate protests because the actual policy differences between the parties are relatively small.  Trans issues blow up headlines, but seem to be mostly (not always, to be sure) around fringe issues like participation in school sports or regulation around pre-teen puberty blockers.   These issues just don't directly affect all that many people.     Republican culture war issues like "woke education" or "CRT" are clearly theater, and many lefty issues like white supremacy are more about twitter wars than legislation.  
			
			Walk into a workplace in any major US city today and it will be immediately obvious who "won" the 80s culture wars, just as it's obvious who "won" the 60s culture wars of Jim Crow and civil rights.    Apart from abortion, which was around 40 years ago also, which "culture war" issue of today actually has a direct effect on the lives of a significant percentage of the population?   Which culture war issue will have immediately obvious consequences in 40 years?
			
			PS.  Not relevant to my point, but song lyrics was a bipartisan issue, remember the PMRC was led by Tipper Gore.  And "Satanic Panic" was much more bipartisan than people like to remember, being deeply connected to "restored memory" radical feminists talking about rape culture.  These were cultural phenomenon, but not political culture war issues.

		This could be due to my family being overly political, but when I was a kid in the 80's and our family would get in big arguments about politics during thanksgiving, christmas, etc... it was almost always about deficits, taxes, foreign policy (I remember the bombing in Beirut being a huge deal, along with the shooting of Regan). I don't remember much talk about abortion or gay marriage. Maybe this was because those subjects were taboo, but my family is secular and we had gay people in our lives quite a bit.

			I was also a kid in the 80s, so I was mostly preoccupied with cartoons (mostly pretty terrible in retrospect) and kid-aimed movies (mostly pretty great in retrospect) - but I also remember it as being dominated by the "just say no" campaign as part of the "war on drugs" which was thinly veiled racism, "tough on crime" which was *also* thinly veiled racism, Reagan's "welfare queen" which was not-even-trying-to-hide-it racism as a justification for gutting social support programs, the rise of the religious right as a political force and fixating on abortion as an issue (and also racism),  Reagan twiddling his thumbs when it came to the AIDS epidemic because it mostly affected gay people (at least that one is homophobia rather than racism).
			
			Reagan also did a bunch of union busting and and championed plutocracy by way of "trickle down" economics and there was the whole end of the cold war stuff, so it wasn't *entirely* social issues... but almost his entire appeal to his base was grounded in them.

		So I think what you are saying is right, and half of what OP IS saying is right. Culture wars have always been a massive issue but ... It's also historically accurate to say rich and powerful Americans have been turning the less fortunate against each other for hundreds of years as a useful tool to avoid it being a rich vs. poor division.

	If you got a bunch of Trump and Bernie voters in a room, many of them would agree on vague softball stuff like “corporations have too much power,” “war is bad” and things like that. But if you made them talk about transgender rights, the Israel-Hamas war, immigration, law and order, abortion, feminism, affirmative action, and single payer healthcare, some of those people would start to actively dislike each other. 

	Whoever they vote for will have to make decisions related to all of those issues. There won’t be a presidential term where Republicans and Democrats take a moratorium on addressing abortion or immigration. 

	Dave Smith has a point about the way that cultural issues can divide people, but he mostly thinks of abortion as a cultural war issue because he doesn’t care about it as much as tens of millions of pro-choice and pro-life Americans do. If a crazy politician tried to pass a “Ban Dave Smith’s podcast” law, some Americans would be outraged while others would ask why we aren’t we talking about lowering housing costs.

			Since the 80s, they had controlled the culture of the US and had power for basically the entire time. Clinton was pretty conservative and neo-Liberal. It wasn't until Obama was elected that the culture started to change and move away from the conservative culture of Reagan &amp; Bush. 
			
			The great recession largely happened due to 30 years of conservative policies coming to fruition, people were fed up of the endless wars that they were lied about, &amp; religion had become increasingly politicized to the point young people were actively moving away from it.
			
			Once the culture started slipping from their hands &amp; the newest generations started rejecting conservativism, those conservatives started to lash out and fight every battle. It had always been a thing, but it was now being turned up to 11. It motivated the base, increased engagement, and was good for ratings, so Fox/GOP kept running with it. Plus with the increase usage of the internet, it was easier than ever to spread half-truths, BS stories, and culture war propaganda.

					The trick is real understanding is hard and life is complicated and it feels like most people like doing homework for an assignment they are not required to do. The people like you and me that are obsessed with policy and learning the details of how governance works are weirdos that are outliers in populations. 
					
					In contrast, certain cultural issues like whether it’s improper to say “lock her up” or whether to “back the blue” is a very simple issue that requires no homework or understanding. It just requires you to have certain values and for you to restate your values.

			I would argue similarly that the “culture war” type issues are pretty much always present in history. The biggest change occurring at around the same time this ‘conspiracy’ starts is also that everyone- including minorities- get access to broadcast themselves online to everyone in a new way. Minority groups (I’m talking more queer folks here) tend to congregate online as it’s a safer way to find solidarity when the physical world was still quite toxic. Having safe spaces online makes them less afraid to be themselves and be open about it online -> social media pushes people towards each other, so queer communities become far more mainstream incredibly fast. Too fast, for a large portion of the country. 
			
			This isn’t exactly the first time this sort of thing has happened either. See the 1960s/1970s for an incredible boom of culture war issues as well (that look much more like a war!), which coincided somewhat and relied upon the use of landline telephones and TV.

					That doesn’t exactly disprove my point though. Besides, I would say individual buzzwords (even long lasting ones) aren’t a good measure of this issue. For example, how often do you hear the right crowing about ‘cultural Marxism’ anymore? In just the decade timeframe you provided they shifted the buzzword from ‘cultural Marxism’ to ‘political correctness’ to ‘wokeness’. None of those words were new when they began to use them, none of them exactly meant what they said they did, and they’re all the exact same thing in right ideology.
					
					While ‘racism’ doesn’t really qualify as this, I’d go out on a limb and say white privilege might. Tracking individual words might not be the best data proof here, is all. This could very much just be media also following trends of social media, which I think we could all agree happens on a wide scale.

					I’d hate to see how the economy would’ve bounced back from the recession if Ron Paul was in charge. I went through a phase in college when I liked him and there are things here and there I agreed with him on.

		Abortion is a culture war issue, at least the way that it is framed. The vast majority of Americans actually agree on abortion, and on a state by state basis you could probably get nearly 2/3 of the population in each state to reach a consensus on abortion law that would satisfy them. 
		
		However, this is because most Americans actually favor some sort of middle ground on abortion, in line with what most European countries have.
		
		What makes abortion a culture war issue is its dominance by the furthest wings. The people who want outright bans, and the people who want completely de stigmatized access to elective abortions in all three trimesters. neither group represents the majority, and yet our national political identities on this issue have been shaped by which one of them you side with.

	The simplest explanation is always that there are people who do not share my preferences for how to prioritize issues, specific stances on issues, or how to articulate the issues.

	Then what is layered on top of this is the selection bias of algorithms, influencers, and elites who put a thumb on the scale in the war for attention but crucially you can lead a horse to a think piece on intersectional feminism or why everything went wrong when they took prayer out of schools, but you cannot make the horse click if it doesn't want to.

	The elites and influencers are themselves people who are equally capable of authentic but substantively different ways of expressing their desires than what I might think is prudent while also being quite capable of cynical gamesmanship.

	If there is an "intentional" effort to play up the culture war, I think it stems from two phenomenon: one is that culture war stories are almost always easier to story tell about. They lend themselves well to cartoonish villains and sympathetic heroes.

	At the most basic level when you're not making broad, testable claims from the arena of political or social science or historiography: they also require very little in the way of specialist expertise to "get right" because you can always hide behind the mantra that "you're just sharing someone else's subjective experience, a thing that cannot be easily fact checked nor is there often a lot of point in doing so."

	Up to a point you can also get away with a lot of making hash out of what hard evidence there is in history, social science, psychology etc. by just regurgitating pop history and pop science in the form of cheesy analogies that obfuscate any unfamiliarity or misreading of the primary sources.

	The second phenomenon is something hard wired into people: if wonky stories about tinkering with mortgage rates or how to get the carbon footprint of EV production to net zero got clicks, they'd get clicks. Whether or not the extremely visible and very loud "woke" or "anti-woke" camps are actually representative of broader public sentiment, these screeds for and against diversity, broad interpretations of human rights, disconnecting the social and biological ways of understanding gender etc. etc. are what get attention.

	Smithsonian, Scientific American etc. are right there. People could go read those in huge waves if they want instead of continuing to feed the "identity obsessed" beasts. They're not doing that.

	Which leads us back to the inevitable conclusion: this all may read as fake to class reductionists, "enlightened centrists", and "classical liberals" but the Trad/Pluralistic war for the soul of society seems extremely real to news consumers and extremely consequential and no amount of lecturing them about how they should care about central bank reform or decarbonizing EV manufacturing is going to make them change their media diets. Nor is it going to change the media diets of the overwhelming majority of people who are just on here for sports and cat videos.

	> For example, if you are the owner of the New York times, would you rather hire a young political activist who wants to write about the problem with the patriarchy in America, or an old blue collar beat writer who wants to expose how the US tax code benefits the top 1%?

	The New York Times runs a lot of stories on taxes. They ran a multi-part investigation on the Trump family taxes, which was a crash course in tax sheltering. If you read the actual website or print edition you see lots of stories like that.

	Contrary to the elite conspiracy angle, the place that is most inundated with culture war fluff pieces is the decentralized world of social media. I would like to believe that the masses want to learn about serious topics that are more relevant to their pocketbook, and many do, but overall they're reposting stories about drag queens and abortions.

	I mean it depends on what you want

	I think if you’re an actual pro-labor leftist then the answer is yes. A lot of culture war stuff is politically harmful to them

	If you’re a centristy, pro-institution type like me, a lot of these culture war clashes only happen because politics for many people really is social/cultural issues. That is what people care about, and while media always has a role and responsibility, at some level this has to have some high baseline salience to people broadly

	People want culture war issue alignment from their representatives, etc. 

	And if you’re a MAGA conservative, culture war is everything. Winning it means ultimate victory in society. It’s not a sideshow. It’s the main dance. And to do this they must either gain control over institutions or weaken the ones they can’t take control of.

	As far as the edit question about whether a neo-McLaughlin Group could be popular, I would submit that yes, yes it would for a given definition of popular.

	Joe Rogan, by volume of media consumed, is the mainstream media. Full stop. In a per episode comparison, he straight up kicks the ass of any single legacy media figure in terms of listens/views. Tucker Carlson wasn't doing Rogan's numbers.

	Much as I detest a lot of the people Rogan has on his show, if you want to endure two or three hours of this or that media figure yammering in an unpolished, unfiltered way such that perhaps you can get a sense of who they are, what they *really* stand for, and whether there's any light in their eyes once their well rehearsed talking points are exhausted, there is a show for that and there is clearly an appetite for understanding people at this depth. And it used to be pretty topically and ideologically mixed.

	Unfortunately its been poisoned by Rogan making himself more and more of a main character rather than the empty vessel asking layman's questions and as such we can pretty much scratch off any hope of getting a representative sample of the political spectrum going forward, give or take a few contrarians who will shamelessly go anywhere because they 1. sincerely believe in at least making the effort and 2. probably have a book to sell.

	I would wager though that if someone could for instance marry pre-2020 Rogan's everyman charm and curiosity with the willingness to do the assigned reading in order to ask better questions of an Ezra Klein, you could perhaps produce a media figure that a wide range of people trust to chat with good faith participants across the political spectrum.

	However, the "good faith" is itself a bit of a problem. The incentives right now are to prefer soft hitting venues because going beyond the talking points in an unsafe space might expose oneself to a whole new audience that will brigade and terrorize one's social media and even professional inboxes. 

	Being vulnerable and talking about one's own areas of unorthodoxy with an ideologically mismatched host or group also takes on a more insidious tone than when someone is talking among friends. Among friends, and that includes the audience, the nuances and safety rails don't need to be constantly explained, clarified, and restated. You can treat the audience as if they're not a bunch of semi-literate barbarians who are incapable of handling anything beyond the simplest of slogans.

	When someone goes into neutral territory or behind enemy lines to have these conversations, whether through social conditioning or instinct, suddenly there's no more room for nuance. There are no safe assumptions. Anything that is not clearly stated invites fevered speculation about secret Nazi / Communist sympathies and how since they didn't say I wouldn't be the first one up against the wall when the revolution comes, clearly they intend for me to be the first one up against the wall when the revolution comes.

	The fragmentation of social media though might make it such that there's no single, one stop shop to police the ideology of public intellectuals we like who err and to tell the ones we don't like in no uncertain terms what we think. In which case, it might be that there could be more ideologically mixed spaces because we'll become re-acclimated to assuming, by default, that wherever we are having a conversation, its among reasonable people, rather than feeling like we have to perform for a crowd that might come for us if we stumble.

* 🟩 **[so64](https://www.reddit.com/user/so64)** ⬆️ 5 _(2023-12-29 00:06:24)_

	I think the theory is somewhat unfounded. While there are political actors that benefit from the dysfunctions of the culture war and a divided public, I feel that a lot of the regular populace readily engages in that type of culture war framing because it often revolve around issues that threatens their idea of self and how they understand the world around them. Thus, it kinda evokes an existential threat in them. I also think the reason why social justice is mentioned is more due to technological changes, such as the rise of the internet, which allows for more niche discussions to reach the mainstream and thus the media is responding to the shift in audience rather than the media causing the shift in audience in and of itself.

	 I also think the theory is naive to an extent. While true that there is more that unites the left and right than one would think from a cursory glance at social media or regular media, there are still differences between the groups and even within the groups.  And even with issues that have nothing to do with social justice, those differences come up. Like take the response to the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008. There were many different alternatives to the bank bailouts proposed all across the political spectrum. Not to mention differing opinions about what should be the long term solutions in order to prevent something like that from happening again. Or take the universal healthcare debate in the US with many differing ideas about how to implement it or if it should be implemented at all.

	In short, I feel like the theory is too simplistic. I feel that the theory ignores that these social justice issues are complicated and not easily solvable. I also think the theory implies that economic issues do not get discussion, which is also false.

	There's a kernel of truth to what Dave is saying, and he's pretty close to getting it. He goes wrong in that he's either blaming the left or cynically "both siding" the issue. When he says, "chicks with dicks" it's pretty revealing.

	The biggest issue with his framing is that Joe Biden and the left actually have a successful and substantive legislative record:

	1. Chips and Science Act - Investment in domestic manufacturing, jobs, and re-shoring critical parts of the supply chain for our economy and national security. Aimed at competition with China. (Bipartisan)

	2. Safer communities Act - Most significant gun legislation in two decades. Extends background checks on gun purchases for those under 21, funds state red flag laws, expands mental health services in schools, closes boyfriend loophole, etc. (Bipartisan)

	3. PACT Act - healthcare for Veterans affected by burn pits and other toxic substances.(Bipartisan)

	4. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act - Investment in roads, bridges, ports, rail, clean water, waste water, energy grid, broadband, etc. (Bipartisan)

	5. IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) - Makes necessary climate and healthcare investments while aiming to lower inflation by reducing the deficit. Key provisions are that it allows medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices for the first time ever and caps insulin for medicare recipients at $35. It also more than funds itself by saving money on prescriptions thanks to negotiating lower prices, a 1% tax on corporate stock buybacks, a 15% minimum tax on corporations earning over 1B, and properly funding the IRS to catch tax cheats. Both the CBO (nopartisan Congressional Budget Office) and Penn Wharton estimates it will cut the deficit by over 200B. This is a major piece of legislation so more can be read here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation\_Reduction\_Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act) and here [https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/the-inflation-reduction-act-heres-whats-in-it](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/the-inflation-reduction-act-heres-whats-in-it)

	When you look at less tangible things, Biden has also reunited western democracy, the free world, NATO allies. He's supported unions and the working class. He has worked at lowering education costs and without legislative help has tried to eliminate student loan debt for regular Americans who are just trying to better themselves. He has kept unemployment low and lowered inflation in a bad economic environment not of his making.

	Democrats also tried to pass other good legislation and couldn't get it done like HR1: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For\_the\_People\_Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_the_People_Act)

	"The For the People Act,\[1\] introduced as H.R. 1,\[2\] is a bill in the United States Congress\[3\] intended to expand voting rights, change campaign finance laws to reduce the influence of money in politics, ban partisan gerrymandering, and create new ethics rules for federal officeholders.\[4\]\[5\]\[6\]\[7\]The act was originally introduced by John Sarbanes in 2019, on behalf of the newly elected Democratic majority in the United States House of Representatives as the first official legislation of the 116th United States Congress.\[6\]\[8\] The House passed the bill on March 8, by a party-line vote of 234–193.\[9\]\[10\] The bill was viewed as a "signature piece of legislation" from the Democratic House majority.\[11\] After the House passed the bill, it was blocked from receiving a vote by the then Republican-controlled Senate, under Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\[12\]\[13\]"

	Not to mention Universal Pre K, investments in childcare, investments in housing, etc that democrats tried to pass with the BBB: [https://www.whitehouse.gov/build-back-better/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/build-back-better/)

	Then compare this to the recent House majority for Republicans which couldn't even pick a speaker and was by all measures completely unproductive: [https://www.axios.com/2023/12/19/118-congress-bills-least-unproductive-chart](https://www.axios.com/2023/12/19/118-congress-bills-least-unproductive-chart)

	This video actually summarizes the current state of politics better than anything else I've seen: [https://youtu.be/RNineSEoxjQ?si=iYcZKFo8FoG-FMjz](https://youtu.be/RNineSEoxjQ?si=iYcZKFo8FoG-FMjz)

	Democrats are actually passing substantive legislation. They're sometimes failing because they don't have the votes (whether that's through gerrymandering, an Electoral College system that benefits the GOP, geographical issues that give the GOP huge advantages in the Senate, etc). Consider that it's been more than 20 years since a Republican has won the popular vote. Democrats have won the popular vote in 7 of the last 8 elections. It's common for Democrats in the Senate to represent 30-40M more Americans yet hold less seats because States like California (pop 40M) has the same number of Senators as Wyoming (pop 600K).

	The bottom line is that Democrats don't have near the incentive to distract because they are mostly trying to pass legislation that their constituents want whereas Republicans mostly need to distract from the fact that they're agenda is tax breaks for corporations.

	I think there are obviously issues of political discourse, but the narrative you're presenting is ya know, full of shit. 

	Like I lived in NYC during Occupy and was interested in Occupy, but everyone I knew who was on that side was also for queer rights and LGBTQIA+ rights. The rhetoric you're hearing isn't new. There were guys talking about how gay marriage was a distraction when that was more of a hot button topic. Inversely, most queer people I know are also huge lefties.

	But the whole "culture war" stuff is often a really bad faith description of things in many ways because it, as your post kind of does, paints sides as mutually aggressive. Like trans rights was just quietly growing for about a decade and a half until North Carolina tried to go with the bathroom bill which failed and then involved them digging up NCAA gender inclusion things that had been around for years to make a controversy there. And like what do you think is the answer there, that people don't advocate for themselves? 

	But also you're listening to an idiot who endangered his child's health and linked to a video with straight-up slurs, so maybe stop doing that stuff too.

	Have not thought about the McLaughlin group in a minute, but it brings back nice memories of watching with my grandparents, so thanks for that.   Of course culture war issues change over time, but (as others have said) they tend to be more animating because they’re pretty easy to understand in black and white terms and they hit at the core of a person’s identity/moral reflexes. “White privilege” might not have been a thing in my millennial childhood, but we had “family values” as a highly politicized buzzword, abstinence sex-ed debates, and George Bush advocating “intelligent design” in public schools. And the culture war packaging of the war on terror.

	And so that folks don’t think I’m exclusively bagging on the tribal tendencies of meat-and-potatoes ‘muricans, I’ll tell you about something I didn’t know was happening at the time. The podcast Sold a Story describes a war between a new (in the 90s) progressive-coded reading education method and the more traditional-seeming phonics method. The bush administration embraced phonics (Karl Rove called the other method fancy psychobabble, which sounds a lot like the “woke schools” complaints of today). So largely liberal educators pushed back for a long time…but today most schools teach phonics, because I guess Shrub (remember when calling him that was original?) was right about that one. 

	So I don’t think the culture war is a coordinated conspiracy to distract us. Just a reflection of the fact that all of us have a tendency to identify with a tribe and to want that identity validated. We’re distractible.

	>Namely that there are a handful of really salient issues that both the left and right would agree on... such as unnecessary foreign wars, big bank bailouts, massive wealth inequality, etc...

	I think this vastly over-estimates how much the average American thinks about or agrees about all of this stuff and this whole theory reeks of wishful thinking by people who want their personal interests to be more widely held and popular than they are.  

	Looking at these individually: the "unnecessary foreign wars" were already essentially slowly winding down by 2012, the "big bank bailouts" were very old news at that point, and "massive wealth inequality" is one of those issues everyone might agree is bad while having wildly divergent solutions for it depending on what side of the partisan divide they are sitting on.

	Rather than concocting some wild conspiracy theory that numerous actors (coordinated by the Illuminati?) are enacting some vast conspiracy theory, I'd go with the much more straightforward explanation that these "culture wars issues" are simply more relatable and personal issues to people than complicated economic/international relations quagmires and have been since at least the 1960s.

Many groups like Project Veritas deliberately create baseless controvesy to benefit far right political movements. However I think for a lot of "anti-sjw" media critics their culture wars are grounded in the fact that many people in ametica have no real sense of politics outside of media consumption. The complex real world issues surroubding state power, police violence, feminism, imperialism and so many other things can only be discussed through long diatribes about marvel movies and video game companies.

Like when george costanza started eating during sex and foubd that his sense of hunger and lust had congealed into a single malformed hideous urge, many people can't meaningfully separate their opinions on hiw anime characters are dressed from the actual historical causes and movements related to feminism. In short, for many people miniscule culture war issues have become the only way they can think about any kind of politics.

		I disagree that "people only pay attention to politics in entertainment" or that someone is "childish" for being politically activated by a piece of media. It's only natural for headlines to be the starting point for political discussion. Something that irks you in a recent work of entertainment is one kind of "headline" or "event," but most people with an interest in "politics" are just as attuned to headlines concerning (major) events in foreign affairs, policymaking, the economy, and technology.

	i think there is some truth to this.  I also think Russian intelligence works non-stop to stoke division in the West.   GD I sound like a tin foil hat.

		They definitely do. It's debatable how effective they are or what the real impact actually is, but they're definitely working hard at undermining Western democracies.

		A lot of that has been shown to be of highly dubious efficacy. First is that Russian malign activity, while real, represents a rounding error on all social media activity. The bot networks, while very large in concrete terms, are swamped by authentic human activity.
		
		Second, this stuff isn't rocket surgery. If I wanted to spend time A/B testing rumors and agitprop in r/conservative to see what would get traction, QAnon style, a person could just sort of immerse themselves in the culture of any particular targeted group, and start trying to push.
		
		Its basically just us for all intents and purposes. The Russia stuff, again while real up to a point, is primarily rooted in the desire to reclaim a sense of ourselves as being "better than this." When any study of the history of media shows we've always been prone to panics, conspiracy mongering, and even death threats. These things just used to take place and evolve at a speed dictated by the communication technology of the day whether it was a handful of enormously complex and rare printing presses for the circulation of pamphlets, telegraph, radio, TV, telephone, and now social media.
		
		Now we watch unhinged speculation and narrative construction take place in real time and even have entire media ecosystems dedicated to documenting this happening in specific areas of interest.

			Have you ever visited Fox News?  It is Russian bot city.  On a certain type of hot news stories a sizable portion, maybe even majority of the posts over 3 lines are bots.  Maybe it isn't effective, but it's freaky.

	I never thought I’d agree with Dave Smith but he has a point here. Ever since the recession and the populist movements in response to it, the culture war has been pushed by the MSM.

	As hard as it is to believe, people really love the culture war.  It gets clicks.

	Economic solidarity was a lot easier when your kids had to work in the coal mines with you just to have enough to eat.  Living standards have risen *a lot* and so we are kind of entering post-material politics in a big way.

	Nowadays even relatively poor people have their basic needs met most of the time—indeed they have a serious obesity problem.  It’s not pretty and we can and should do more for the poor, but it ain’t dying of black lung.  Your kid goes to school, he has food.  Your shitty retail job sucks but you have all your fingers, you have Netflix and an internet connection and an air conditioned apartment.  It makes total sense that economic stuff is likely to continue taking a back seat to culture warring.

	It's true but it doesn't require anyone to conspire. 20 years ago, corporations were in constant battle with the Left who opposed their fundamental interests. It only takes one CEO to realise the escape tactic of identity politics, before they all pick up on it. The decade of establishment power amplifying one kind of left wing while filtering out the older kind is going to have an effect.

	This is the standard evergreen lefty script. Every  non-economic issue is viewed as a distraction from Wall Street and the military-industrial complex. This line of thinking usually obscures as much as it illuminates, but there are enough grains of truth to validate people’s priors. (Maybe I’m feeling extra cynical today 🤷‍♂️)

	It's just like, pre-Obama era populism talking when one says "wow, if not for the culture war, we'd all agree to raise taxes on corporations." People actually do care about this stuff, and people actually disagree a lot on the stuff you're saying they agree on. 

	There's not like, a weird trick that'll circumvent the necessity of politics (that is, coalition building on one hand and persistence in the face of real opposition on the other).

	This is nonsense. People actually exist beyond white straight men in the U.S. The concerns of black people regarding the impacts systemic racism regarding their livelihoods is not a distraction. The fear from LGBTQ people that their literal existence is being criminalized and violence encouraged against them is not a distraction and I could go on and on.

	PBD is an absolute clown so I’m not surprised if he agreed with this perspective
