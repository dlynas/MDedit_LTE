**Carl Gustav Jung** ( [_YUUNG_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key");<sup id="cite_ref-:2_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-:2-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> German: [\[kaʁl ˈjʊŋ\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German "Help:IPA/Standard German"); 26 July 1875 – 6 June 1961) was a Swiss [psychiatrist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist "Psychiatrist") and [psychoanalyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalyst "Psychoanalyst") who founded [analytical psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_psychology "Analytical psychology"). He was a prolific author, illustrator, and correspondent, and a complex and controversial character, perhaps best known through his "autobiography" _[Memories, Dreams, Reflections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memories,_Dreams,_Reflections "Memories, Dreams, Reflections")._<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

Jung's work has been influential in the fields of [psychiatry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry "Psychiatry"), [anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology "Anthropology"), [archaeology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology "Archaeology"), [literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature "Literature"), [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology"),<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> and [religious studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_studies "Religious studies"). He worked as a research scientist at the [Burghölzli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgh%C3%B6lzli "Burghölzli") psychiatric hospital, in [Zurich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich "Zürich"), under [Eugen Bleuler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugen_Bleuler "Eugen Bleuler"). Jung established himself as an influential mind, developing a friendship with [Sigmund Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud "Sigmund Freud"), founder of [psychoanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis "Psychoanalysis"), conducting a [lengthy correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Freud/Jung_Letters "The Freud/Jung Letters") paramount to their joint vision of human psychology. Jung is widely regarded as one of the most influential psychologists in history.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

Freud saw the younger Jung not only as the heir he had been seeking to take forward his "new science" of psychoanalysis, but as a means to legitimize his own work: Freud and other contemporary psychoanalysts were Jews facing rising antisemitism in Europe, and Jung was [Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians "Christians").<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> Freud secured Jung's appointment as president of Freud's newly founded [International Psychoanalytical Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Psychoanalytical_Association "International Psychoanalytical Association"). Jung's research and personal vision, however, made it difficult to follow his older colleague's doctrine and they parted ways. This division was painful for Jung and resulted in the establishment of Jung's analytical psychology, as a comprehensive system separate from psychoanalysis. Scholar [Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Hayim_Yerushalmi "Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi") believed Jung's later antisemitic remarks may be a clue to the schism.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

Among the central concepts of analytical psychology is [individuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuation#Carl_Jung "Individuation")—the lifelong psychological process of differentiation of the self out of each individual's conscious and unconscious elements. Jung considered it to be the main task of human development. He created some of the best known psychological concepts, including [synchronicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity "Synchronicity"), [archetypal phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes "Jungian archetypes"), the [collective unconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious "Collective unconscious"), the [psychological complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_(psychology) "Complex (psychology)"), and [extraversion and introversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion "Extraversion and introversion"). Jung was also an [artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artist "Artist"), [craftsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artisan "Artisan"), builder, and prolific writer. Many of his works were not published until after his death and some remain unpublished.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

## Biography\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Biography")\]

#### Childhood\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Childhood")\]

Carl Gustav Jung<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-10">[a]</a></sup> was born 26 July 1875 in [Kesswil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesswil "Kesswil"), in the [Swiss canton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantons_of_Switzerland "Cantons of Switzerland") of [Thurgau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurgau "Thurgau"), as the first surviving son of Paul Achilles Jung (1842–1896) and Emilie Preiswerk (1848–1923).<sup id="cite_ref-birth_whoami_11-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-birth_whoami-11">[10]</a></sup> His birth was preceded by two stillbirths and that of a son named Paul, born in 1873, who survived only a few days.<sup id="cite_ref-Wehr_12-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-Wehr-12">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-13">[12]</a></sup>

Paul Jung, Carl's father, was the youngest son of noted German-Swiss professor of medicine at [Basel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel "Basel"), [Karl Gustav Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Gustav_Jung "Karl Gustav Jung") (1794–1864).<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-14">[13]</a></sup> Paul's hopes of achieving a fortune never materialised, and he did not progress beyond the status of an impoverished rural pastor in the [Swiss Reformed Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Reformed_Church "Swiss Reformed Church"). Emilie Preiswerk, Carl's mother, had also grown up in a large family, whose Swiss roots went back five centuries. Emilie was the youngest child of a distinguished Basel churchman and academic, [Samuel Preiswerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Preiswerk "Samuel Preiswerk") (1799–1871), and his second wife. Samuel Preiswerk was an _[Antistes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antistes "Antistes")_, the title given to the head of the Reformed clergy in the city, as well as a [Hebraist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebraist "Hebraist"), author, and editor, who taught Paul Jung as his professor of [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language") at [Basel University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_University "Basel University").<sup id="cite_ref-Wehr_12-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-Wehr-12">[11]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 17–19">: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://archive.org/details/jungbiography0000wehr/page/17">17–19</a> </span></sup>

The clergy house in Kleinhüningen, Basel, where Jung grew up

Jung's father was appointed to a more prosperous parish in [Laufen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laufen-Uhwiesen "Laufen-Uhwiesen") when Jung was six months old. Tensions between father and mother had developed. Jung's mother was an eccentric and depressed woman; she spent considerable time in her bedroom, where she said spirits visited her at night.<sup id="cite_ref-Memories,_Dreams,_Reflections_15-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-Memories,_Dreams,_Reflections-15">[14]</a></sup> Though she was normal during the day, Jung recalled that at night his mother became strange and mysterious. He said that one night he saw a faintly luminous and indefinite figure coming from her room, with a head detached from the neck and floating in the air in front of the body. Jung had a better relationship with his father.<sup id="cite_ref-Memories,_Dreams,_Reflections_15-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-Memories,_Dreams,_Reflections-15">[14]</a></sup>

Jung's mother left Laufen for several months of hospitalization near Basel, for an unknown physical ailment. His father took Carl to be cared for by Emilie Jung's unmarried sister in Basel, but he was later brought back to his father's residence. Emilie Jung's continuing bouts of absence and depression deeply troubled her son and caused him to associate women with "innate unreliability", whereas "father" meant for him reliability, but also powerlessness.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-16">[15]</a></sup> In his memoir, Jung would remark that this parental influence was the "handicap I started off with". Later, these early impressions were revised: "I have trusted men friends and been disappointed by them, and I have mistrusted women and was not disappointed."<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-17">[16]</a></sup> After three years of living in Laufen, Paul Jung requested a transfer. In 1879 he was called to Kleinhüningen, next to Basel, where his family lived in a parsonage of the church.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHoerniFischerKaufmann2019233_18-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoerniFischerKaufmann2019233-18">[17]</a></sup> The relocation brought Emilie Jung closer into contact with her family and lifted her melancholy.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-19">[18]</a></sup> When he was 9, Jung's sister Johanna Gertrud (1884–1935) was born. Known in the family as "Trudi", she became a secretary to her brother.<sup id="cite_ref-Wehr_12-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-Wehr-12">[11]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 349">: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://archive.org/details/jungbiography0000wehr/page/349">349</a> </span></sup> 

#### Memories of childhood\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Memories of childhood")\]

Jung was a solitary and introverted child. From childhood, he believed that, like his mother,<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-20">[19]</a></sup> he had two personalities—a modern Swiss citizen and a personality more suited to the 18th century.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-21">[20]</a></sup> "Personality Number 1", as he termed it, was a typical schoolboy living in the era of the time. "Personality Number 2" was a dignified, authoritative, and influential man from the past. Though Jung was close to both parents, he was disappointed by his father's academic approach to faith.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-22">[21]</a></sup>

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Jung_piccolo.jpg/170px-Jung_piccolo.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jung_piccolo.jpg)

Young Jung, early 1880s

Some childhood memories made lifelong impressions on him. As a boy, he carved a tiny [mannequin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannequin "Mannequin") into the end of the wooden ruler from his pencil case and placed it inside the case. He added a stone, which he had painted into upper and lower halves, and hid the case in the attic. Periodically, he would return to the mannequin, often bringing tiny sheets of paper with messages inscribed on them in his own secret language.<sup id="cite_ref-art-therapy_23-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-art-therapy-23">[22]</a></sup> He later reflected that this ceremonial act brought him a feeling of inner peace and security. Years later, he discovered similarities between his personal experience and the practices associated with [totems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totem "Totem") in [indigenous cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_cultures "Indigenous cultures"), such as the collection of soul-stones near [Arlesheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlesheim "Arlesheim") or the _[tjurungas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tjurunga "Tjurunga")_ of Australia. He concluded that his intuitive ceremonial act was an unconscious ritual, which he had practiced in a way that was strikingly similar to those in distant locations which he, as a young boy, knew nothing about.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-24">[23]</a></sup> His observations about symbols, [archetypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes "Jungian archetypes"), and the [collective unconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious "Collective unconscious") were inspired, in part, by these early experiences combined with his later research.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-25">[24]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-26">[25]</a></sup>

At the age of 12, shortly before the end of his first year at the _Humanistisches [Gymnasium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(school) "Gymnasium (school)")_ in Basel, Jung was pushed to the ground by another boy so hard he momentarily lost consciousness. (Jung later recognized the incident was indirectly his fault.) A thought then came to him—"now you won't have to go to school anymore".<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-27">[26]</a></sup> From then on, whenever he walked to school or began homework, he fainted. He remained at home for the next six months until he overheard his father speaking hurriedly to a visitor, about the boy's future ability to support himself. They suspected he had [epilepsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy "Epilepsy"). Confronted with the reality of his family's poverty, he realized the need for academic excellence. He went into his father's study and began poring over [Latin grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_grammar "Latin grammar"). He fainted three more times, but eventually overcame the urge and did not faint again. This event, Jung later recalled, "was when I learned what a [neurosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosis "Neurosis") is".<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-28">[27]</a></sup>

#### University studies and early career\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: University studies and early career")\]

The [University of Basel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Basel "University of Basel"), where Jung studied between 1895 and 1900

Initially, Jung had aspirations of becoming a preacher or minister. There was a strong moral sense in his household and several of his family were clergymen. Jung had wanted to study archaeology, but his family could not afford to send him further than the University of Basel, which did not teach it. After studying philosophy in his teens, Jung decided against the path of religious traditionalism and decided to pursue psychiatry and medicine.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-29">[28]</a></sup> His interest was captured—it combined the biological and spiritual, exactly what he was searching for.<sup id="cite_ref-jungbio1_30-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-jungbio1-30">[29]</a></sup> In 1895 Jung began to study medicine at the University of Basel. Barely a year later, his father Paul died and left the family near destitute. They were helped by relatives who also contributed to Jung's studies.<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-31">[30]</a></sup> During his student days, he entertained his contemporaries with the family legend that his paternal grandfather was the illegitimate son of [Goethe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goethe "Goethe") and his German great-grandmother, [Sophie Ziegler](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sophie_Ziegler&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sophie Ziegler (page does not exist)"). In later life, he pulled back from this tale, saying only that Sophie was a friend of Goethe's niece.<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-32">[31]</a></sup>

In 1900, Jung moved to Zürich and began working at the [Burghölzli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgh%C3%B6lzli "Burghölzli") psychiatric hospital under [Eugen Bleuler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugen_Bleuler "Eugen Bleuler").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHoerniFischerKaufmann2019234,_259_33-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoerniFischerKaufmann2019234,_259-33">[32]</a></sup> Bleuler was already in communication with the Austrian neurologist [Sigmund Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud "Sigmund Freud"). Jung's [dissertation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissertation "Dissertation"), published in 1903, was titled _On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena_. It was based on the analysis of the supposed [mediumship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediumship "Mediumship") of Jung's cousin Hélène Preiswerk, under the influence of Freud's contemporary [Théodore Flournoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9odore_Flournoy "Théodore Flournoy").<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-34">[33]</a></sup> Jung studied with [Pierre Janet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Janet "Pierre Janet") in Paris in 1902<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-35">[34]</a></sup> and later equated his view of the [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_(psychology) "Complex (psychology)") with Janet's _idée fixe subconsciente_.<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-36">[35]</a></sup> In 1905, Jung was appointed as a permanent 'senior' doctor at the hospital and became a lecturer _[Privatdozent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatdozent "Privatdozent")_ in the medical faculty of Zurich University.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-37">[36]</a></sup> In 1904, he published with [Franz Riklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Riklin "Franz Riklin") their _Diagnostic Association Studies_, of which Freud obtained a copy.<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-38">[37]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-diagnostic_39-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-diagnostic-39">[38]</a></sup> In 1909, Jung left the psychiatric hospital and began a private practice in his home in [Küsnacht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCsnacht "Küsnacht").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHoerniFischerKaufmann2019259_40-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoerniFischerKaufmann2019259-40">[39]</a></sup>

Eventually, a close friendship and strong professional association developed between the elder [Freud and Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#Relationship_with_Freud), which left a sizeable [correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freud-Jung_Letters "Freud-Jung Letters"). For six years they cooperated in their work. In 1912, however, Jung published _[Psychology of the Unconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology_of_the_Unconscious "Psychology of the Unconscious")_, which made manifest the developing theoretical divergence between the two. Consequently, their personal and professional relationship fractured—each stating the other was unable to admit he could be wrong. After the culminating break in 1913, Jung went through a difficult and pivotal psychological transformation, exacerbated by the outbreak of the First World War. [Henri Ellenberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Ellenberger "Henri Ellenberger") called Jung's intense experience a "creative illness" and compared it favorably to Freud's own period of what he called [neurasthenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurasthenia "Neurasthenia") and [hysteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteria "Hysteria").<sup id="cite_ref-hayman2001_41-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-hayman2001-41">[40]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 173">: 173 </span></sup> 

### Marriage\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Marriage")\]

[Emma Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Jung "Emma Jung") in 1911. She assisted her husband in his early research before becoming a psychoanalyst and author.

In 1903, Jung married [Emma Rauschenbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Jung "Emma Jung") (1882-1955), seven years his junior and the elder daughter of a wealthy industrialist in eastern Switzerland, Johannes Rauschenbach-Schenck.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHoerniFischerKaufmann2019234_42-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoerniFischerKaufmann2019234-42">[41]</a></sup> Rauschenbach was the owner, among other concerns, of [IWC Schaffhausen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IWC_Schaffhausen "IWC Schaffhausen")—the International Watch Company, manufacturer of luxury time-pieces. Upon his death in 1905, his two daughters and their husbands became owners of the business. Jung's brother-in-law—[Ernst Homberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Homberger "Ernst Homberger")—became the principal proprietor, but the Jungs remained shareholders in a thriving business that ensured the family's financial security for decades.<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-43">[42]</a></sup> Emma Jung, whose education had been limited, evinced considerable ability and interest in her husband's research and threw herself into studies and acted as his assistant at Burghölzli. She eventually became a noted psychoanalyst in her own right. The marriage lasted until Emma died in 1955.<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-44">[43]</a></sup> They had five children:

Jung and Freud influenced each other during the intellectually formative years of Jung's life. Jung had become interested in psychiatry as a student by reading _[Psychopathia Sexualis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathia_Sexualis "Psychopathia Sexualis")_ by [Richard von Krafft-Ebing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_von_Krafft-Ebing "Richard von Krafft-Ebing"). In 1900, Jung completed his degree and started work as an intern (voluntary doctor) under the psychiatrist [Eugen Bleuler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugen_Bleuler "Eugen Bleuler") at Burghölzli Hospital.<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-51">[50]</a></sup> It was Bleuler who introduced him to the writings of Freud by asking him to write a review of _[The Interpretation of Dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Interpretation_of_Dreams "The Interpretation of Dreams")_ (1899). In the early 1900s [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology") as a science was still in its early stages, but Jung became a qualified proponent of Freud's new "psycho-analysis". Freud needed collaborators and pupils to validate and spread his ideas. Burghölzli was a renowned psychiatric clinic in Zurich and Jung's research had already gained him international recognition. Jung sent Freud a copy of his _Studies in Word Association_ in 1906.<sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-52">[51]</a></sup> The same year, he published _Diagnostic Association Studies_, a copy of which he later sent to Freud—who had already purchased a copy.<sup id="cite_ref-diagnostic_39-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-diagnostic-39">[38]</a></sup> Preceded by a lively correspondence, Jung met Freud for the first time in Vienna on 3 March 1907.<sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-53">[52]</a></sup> Jung recalled the discussion between himself and Freud as interminable, unceasing for 13 hours.<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-54">[53]</a></sup> Six months later, the then 50-year-old Freud sent a collection of his latest published essays to Jung in Zurich. This marked the beginning of an intense correspondence and collaboration that lasted six years.<sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-55">[54]</a></sup> In 1908, Jung became an editor of the newly founded _Yearbook for Psychoanalytical and Psychopathological Research_.

In 1909, Jung travelled with Freud and Hungarian psychoanalyst [Sándor Ferenczi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1ndor_Ferenczi "Sándor Ferenczi") to the United States; in September they took part in a conference at [Clark University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_University "Clark University") in [Worcester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester,_Massachusetts "Worcester, Massachusetts"), Massachusetts. The conference at Clark University was planned by the psychologist [G. Stanley Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._Stanley_Hall "G. Stanley Hall") and included 27 distinguished psychiatrists, neurologists, and psychologists. It represented a watershed in the acceptance of psychoanalysis in North America. This forged welcome links between Jung and influential Americans.<sup id="cite_ref-king_56-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-king-56">[55]</a></sup> Jung returned to the United States the next year for a brief visit.

In 1910 Freud proposed Jung, "his adopted eldest son, his crown prince and successor", for the position of lifetime President of the newly formed [International Psychoanalytical Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Psychoanalytical_Association "International Psychoanalytical Association"). However, after forceful objections from his Viennese colleagues, it was agreed Jung would be elected to serve a two-year term of office.<sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-57">[56]</a></sup>

#### Divergence and break\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Divergence and break")\]

Jung outside Burghölzli in 1910

While Jung worked on his _Psychology of the Unconscious: a study of the transformations and symbolisms of the libido_, tensions manifested between him and Freud because of various disagreements, including those concerning the nature of [libido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libido "Libido").<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-58">[57]</a></sup> Jung de-emphasized the importance of sexual development and focused on the collective unconscious: the part of the unconscious that contains memories and ideas that Jung believed were inherited from ancestors. While he did think that libido was an important source for personal growth, unlike Freud, Jung did not believe that libido alone was responsible for the formation of the core personality.<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-59">[58]</a></sup>

In 1912 these tensions came to a peak because Jung felt severely slighted after Freud visited his colleague [Ludwig Binswanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Binswanger "Ludwig Binswanger") in [Kreuzlingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kreuzlingen "Kreuzlingen") without paying him a visit in nearby Zurich, an incident Jung referred to as "the Kreuzlingen gesture". Shortly thereafter, Jung again traveled to the US and gave the [Fordham University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordham_University "Fordham University") lectures, a six-week series, which were published later in the year as _Psychology of the Unconscious_, subsequently republished as _[Symbols of Transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbols_of_Transformation "Symbols of Transformation")_. While they contain remarks on Jung's dissenting view on the libido, they represent largely a "psychoanalytical Jung" and not the theory of analytical psychology, for which he became famous in the following decades. Nonetheless, it was their publication which, Jung declared, "cost me my friendship with Freud".<sup id="cite_ref-Gay_2006_225_60-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-Gay_2006_225-60">[59]</a></sup>

Another disagreement with Freud stemmed from their differing concepts of the unconscious.<sup id="cite_ref-61"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-61">[60]</a></sup> Jung saw Freud's theory of the unconscious as incomplete and unnecessarily negative and inelastic. According to Jung, Freud conceived the unconscious solely as a repository of repressed emotions and desires.<sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-62">[61]</a></sup> Jung's observations overlap to an extent with Freud's model of the unconscious, what Jung called the "[personal unconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_unconscious "Personal unconscious")", but his hypothesis is more about a process than a static model and he also proposed the existence of a second, overarching form of the unconscious beyond the personal, that he named the psychoid—a term borrowed from neo-vitalist philosopher and embryologist [Hans Driesch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Driesch "Hans Driesch") (1867–1941)—but with a somewhat altered meaning.<sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-63">[62]</a></sup> The [collective unconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious "Collective unconscious") is not so much a 'geographical location', but a deduction from the alleged ubiquity of [archetypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes "Jungian archetypes") over space and time.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="The text near this tag may need clarification or removal of jargon.

In November 1912, Jung and Freud met in [Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich "Munich") for a meeting among prominent colleagues to discuss psychoanalytical journals.<sup id="cite_ref-jones1963_64-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-jones1963-64">[63]</a></sup> At a talk about a new psychoanalytic essay on [Amenhotep IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenhotep_IV "Amenhotep IV"), Jung expressed his views on how it related to actual conflicts in the psychoanalytic movement. While Jung spoke, Freud suddenly fainted and Jung carried him to a couch.<sup id="cite_ref-theguardian_65-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-theguardian-65">[64]</a></sup>

Jung and Freud personally met for the last time in September 1913 for the Fourth International Psychoanalytical Congress in Munich. Jung gave a talk on psychological types, the [introverted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introvert "Introvert") and [extraverted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravert "Extravert") type in [analytical psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_psychology "Analytical psychology").

### Midlife isolation\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Midlife isolation")\]

It was the publication of Jung's book _The Psychology of the Unconscious_ in 1912 that led to the final break with Freud. The letters they exchanged show Freud's refusal to consider Jung's ideas. This rejection caused what Jung described in his posthumously-published autobiography, _Memories, Dreams, Reflections_ (1962) as a "resounding censure". Everyone he knew dropped away from him, except two of his colleagues. After the Munich congress he was on the verge of a suicidal psychosis that precipitated his writing of his _Red Book,_ his seven-volume personal diaries that were only published partially and posthumously in 2009. Eleven years later, in 2020, they were published in their entirety as his _Black Books._ Jung described his 1912 book as "an attempt, only partially successful, to create a wider setting for medical psychology and to bring the whole of the psychic phenomena within its purview". The book was later revised and retitled _Symbols of Transformation_ in 1952.<sup id="cite_ref-66"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-66">[65]</a></sup>

#### London 1913–14\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: London 1913–14")\]

Jung spoke at meetings of the Psycho-Medical Society in London in 1913 and 1914. His travels were soon interrupted by the war, but his ideas continued to receive attention in England primarily through the efforts of [Constance Long](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Constance_Long&action=edit&redlink=1 "Constance Long (page does not exist)") who translated and published the first English volume of his collected writings.<sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-67">[66]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-68"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-68">[67]</a></sup>

The Red Book resting on Jung's desk

In 1913, at the age of 38, Jung experienced a horrible "confrontation with the unconscious". He saw visions and heard voices. He worried at times that he was "menaced by a psychosis" or was "doing a schizophrenia". He decided that it was valuable experience and, in private, he induced hallucinations or, in his words, a process of "[active imagination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_imagination "Active imagination")". He recorded everything he experienced in small journals, which Jung referred to in the singular as his _[Black Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Books_(Jung) "Black Books (Jung)")_,<sup id="cite_ref-blackbooks_69-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-blackbooks-69">[68]</a></sup> considering it a "single integral whole"; and while among these original journals, some have a brown cover.<sup id="cite_ref-blackbooks_69-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-blackbooks-69">[68]</a></sup> The material Jung wrote was subjected to several edits, hand-written and typed, including another, "second layer" of text, his continual psychological interpretations during the process of editing.<sup id="cite_ref-70"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-70">[69]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-71">[70]</a></sup> Around 1915, Jung commissioned a large red leather-bound book,<sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-72">[71]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-73"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-73">[72]</a></sup> and began to transcribe his notes, along with painting, working intermittently for sixteen years.<sup id="cite_ref-Corbett_74-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-Corbett-74">[73]</a></sup>

Jung left no posthumous instructions about the final disposition of what he called the _Liber Novus_ or _Red Book_. [Sonu Shamdasani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonu_Shamdasani "Sonu Shamdasani"), a historian of psychology from London, tried for three years to persuade Jung's resistant heirs to have it published. Ulrich Hoerni, Jung's grandson who manages the Jung archives, decided to publish it when the necessary additional funds needed were raised through the [Philemon Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philemon_Foundation "Philemon Foundation").<sup id="cite_ref-Corbett_74-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-Corbett-74">[73]</a></sup> Up to September 2008, fewer than about two dozen people had ever seen it.

In 2007, two technicians for DigitalFusion, working with New York City publishers [W. W. Norton & Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._W._Norton_%26_Company "W. W. Norton & Company"), scanned the manuscript with a 10,200-pixel scanner. It was published on 7 October 2009, in German with a "separate English translation along with Shamdasani's introduction and footnotes" at the back of the book. According to Sara Corbett, reviewing the text for _[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")_, "The book is bombastic, baroque and like so much else about Carl Jung, a willful oddity, synched with an [antediluvian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antediluvian "Antediluvian") and mystical reality."<sup id="cite_ref-Corbett_74-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-Corbett-74">[73]</a></sup>

The [Rubin Museum of Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_Museum_of_Art "Rubin Museum of Art") in New York City displayed Jung's _Red Book_ leather folio, as well as some of his original "Black Book" journals, from 7 October 2009 to 15 February 2010.<sup id="cite_ref-Rubin_75-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-Rubin-75">[74]</a></sup> According to them, "During the period in which he worked on this book Jung developed his principal theories of archetypes, collective unconscious, and the process of individuation." Two-thirds of the pages bear Jung's [illuminations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminated_manuscript "Illuminated manuscript") and illustrations to the text.<sup id="cite_ref-Rubin_75-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-Rubin-75">[74]</a></sup>

### Wartime army service\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Wartime army service")\]

During World War I, Jung was drafted as an army doctor and soon made commandant of an internment camp for British officers and soldiers. The Swiss were neutral and obliged to intern personnel from either side of the conflict, who crossed their frontier to evade capture. Jung worked to improve the conditions of soldiers stranded in Switzerland and encouraged them to attend university courses.<sup id="cite_ref-76"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-76">[75]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHoerniFischerKaufmann2019260_77-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoerniFischerKaufmann2019260-77">[76]</a></sup>

### Travels\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Travels")\]

Jung emerged from his period of isolation in the late nineteen-tens with the publication of several journal articles, followed in 1921 with _[Psychological Types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Types "Psychological Types")_, one of his most influential books. There followed a decade of active publication, interspersed with overseas travels.

#### England (1920, 1923, 1925, 1935, 1938, 1946)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: England (1920, 1923, 1925, 1935, 1938, 1946)")\]

Constance Long arranged for Jung to deliver a seminar in [Cornwall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornwall "Cornwall") in 1920. Another seminar was held in 1923, this one organized by Jung's British protégé [Helton Godwin Baynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helton_Godwin_Baynes "Helton Godwin Baynes") (known as "Peter") (1882-1943), and another in 1925.<sup id="cite_ref-McGuire_78-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-McGuire-78">[77]</a></sup>

In 1935, at the invitation of his close British friends and colleagues, [H. G. Baynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helton_Godwin_Baynes "Helton Godwin Baynes"), [E. A. Bennet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Armstrong_Bennet "Edward Armstrong Bennet") and [Hugh Crichton-Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Crichton-Miller "Hugh Crichton-Miller"), Jung gave a series of lectures at the [Tavistock Clinic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavistock_and_Portman_NHS_Foundation_Trust "Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust") in London, later published as part of the _Collected Works_.<sup id="cite_ref-79"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-79">[78]</a></sup>

In 1946, Jung agreed to become the first Honorary President of the newly formed [Society of Analytical Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Analytical_Psychology "Society of Analytical Psychology") in London, having previously approved its training programme devised by [Michael Fordham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fordham "Michael Fordham").<sup id="cite_ref-82"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-82">[81]</a></sup>

During the period of Jung's [collaboration with Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#Relationship_with_Freud), both visited the US in 1909 to lecture at Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts<sup id="cite_ref-king_56-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-king-56">[55]</a></sup> where both were awarded honorary degrees. In 1912 Jung gave a series of lectures at Fordham University, New York which were published later in the year as _[Psychology of the Unconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology_of_the_Unconscious "Psychology of the Unconscious")_.<sup id="cite_ref-Gay_2006_225_60-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-Gay_2006_225-60">[59]</a></sup> Jung made a more extensive trip westward in the winter of 1924–5, financed and organized by Fowler McCormick and George Porter. Of particular value to Jung was a visit with [Chief Mountain Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochwiay_Biano "Ochwiay Biano") of the [Taos Pueblo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taos_Pueblo "Taos Pueblo") near [Taos, New Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taos,_New_Mexico "Taos, New Mexico").<sup id="cite_ref-McGuire_78-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-McGuire-78">[77]</a></sup> Jung made another trip to America in 1936, receiving an honorary degree at Harvard<sup id="cite_ref-83"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-83">[82]</a></sup> and giving lectures in New York and New England for his growing group of American followers.

#### East Africa\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: East Africa")\]

In October 1925, Jung embarked on his most ambitious expedition, the "Bugishu Psychological Expedition" to East Africa. He was accompanied by his English friend, ["Peter" Baynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helton_Godwin_Baynes "Helton Godwin Baynes") and an American associate, [George Beckwith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Beckwith_(Carl_Jung_associate) "George Beckwith (Carl Jung associate)"). On the voyage to Africa, they became acquainted with an English woman named Ruth Bailey, who joined their safari a few weeks later. The group traveled through Kenya and Uganda to the slopes of [Mount Elgon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Elgon "Mount Elgon"), where Jung hoped to increase his understanding of "primitive psychology" through conversations with the culturally isolated residents of that area. Later he concluded that the major insights he had gleaned had to do with himself and the European psychology in which he had been raised.<sup id="cite_ref-85"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-85">[84]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-86"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-86">[85]</a></sup> One of Jung's most famous proposed constructs is kinship libido. Jung defined this as an instinctive feeling of belonging to a particular group or family and Jung believed it was vital to the human experience and used this as an endogamous aspect of the libido and what lies amongst the family. This is similar to a Bantu term called [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy "Ubuntu philosophy") that emphasizes humanity and almost the same meaning as kinship libido, which is, "I am because you are."<sup id="cite_ref-87"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-87">[86]</a></sup>

In December 1937, Jung left Zurich again for an extensive tour of India with Fowler McCormick. In India, he felt himself "under the direct influence of a foreign culture" for the first time. In Africa, his conversations had been strictly limited by the language barrier, but in India, he was able to converse extensively. [Hindu philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_philosophy "Hindu philosophy") became an important element in his understanding of the role of symbolism and the life of the unconscious, though he avoided a meeting with [Ramana Maharshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramana_Maharshi "Ramana Maharshi"). He described Ramana as being absorbed in "the self". During these travels he visited the [Vedagiriswarar Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedagiriswarar_Temple "Vedagiriswarar Temple") where he had a conversation with a local expert about the symbols and sculptures on the [gopuram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopuram "Gopuram") of this temple. He later wrote about this conversation<sup id="cite_ref-88"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-88">[87]</a></sup> in his book [Aion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Collected_Works_of_C._G._Jung#Aion "The Collected Works of C. G. Jung").<sup id="cite_ref-89"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-89">[88]</a></sup> Jung became seriously ill on this trip and endured two weeks of [delirium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delirium "Delirium") in a Calcutta hospital. After 1938, his travels were confined to Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-90"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-90">[89]</a></sup>

Jung in a 1955 interview

Jung became a full professor of medical psychology at the University of Basel in 1943, but resigned after a heart attack the next year to lead a more private life. In 1945, he began corresponding with an English [Roman Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") priest, Father [Victor White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_White_(priest) "Victor White (priest)"), who became a close friend, regularly visiting the Jungs at the Bollingen estate.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_1-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-:2-1">[1]</a></sup> Jung became ill again in 1952.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHoerniFischerKaufmann2019262_91-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoerniFischerKaufmann2019262-91">[90]</a></sup>

Jung continued to publish books until the end of his life, including _Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies_ (1959), which analyzed the archetypal meaning and possible psychological significance of the reported observations of [UFOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO "UFO").<sup id="cite_ref-92"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-92">[91]</a></sup> In 1961, he wrote his last work, a contribution to _[Man and His Symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_and_His_Symbols "Man and His Symbols")_ entitled "Approaching the Unconscious" (published posthumously in 1964).<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHoerniFischerKaufmann2019262_91-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoerniFischerKaufmann2019262-91">[90]</a></sup> Jung died on 6 June 1961 at Küsnacht after a short illness.<sup id="cite_ref-hayman2001_41-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-hayman2001-41">[40]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 450">: 450 </span></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-93"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-93">[92]</a></sup> He had been beset by [circulatory diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease "Cardiovascular disease").<sup id="cite_ref-94"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-94">[93]</a></sup>

## Thought\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Thought")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Jung_Family.jpg/220px-Jung_Family.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jung_Family.jpg)

Jung's family c.1895: l to r. father Paul, sister Gertrud, mother Emilie and Carl

Jung's thought derived from the classical education he received at school and from early family influences, which on the maternal side were a combination of [Reformed Protestant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism "Calvinism") academic theology with an interest in occult phenomena. On his father's side was a dedication to academic discipline emanating from his grandfather, the physician, scientist and first Basel Professor of Medicine, [Karl Gustav Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Gustav_Jung "Karl Gustav Jung"), a one time student activist and convert from Catholicism to Swiss Reformed Protestantism. Family lore suggested there was at least a social connection to the German [polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath "Polymath"), [Johann Wolfgang Goethe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_Goethe "Johann Wolfgang Goethe"), through the latter's niece, Lotte Kestner, known as "Lottchen" who was a frequent visitor in Jung senior's household.<sup id="cite_ref-96"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-96">[95]</a></sup>

Carl Jung, the practicing clinician, writer and founder of analytical psychology, had, through his marriage, the economic security to pursue interests in other intellectual topics of the moment. His early celebrity as a research scientist through the Word Association Test, led to the start of a prolific correspondence and world-wide travel. It opened academic as well as social avenues, supported by his explorations into [anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology "Anthropology"), [quantum physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_physics "Quantum physics"), [vitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism "Vitalism"), [Eastern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_philosophy "Eastern philosophy") and [Western philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_philosophy "Western philosophy"). He delved into [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology"), [alchemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy "Alchemy"), [astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology "Astrology"), and sociology, as well as literature and the arts. Jung's interest in philosophy and spiritual subjects led many to label him as a mystic, although his preference was to be seen as a man of science. Jung, unlike Freud, was deeply knowledgeable about philosophical concepts and sought links between epistemology and emergent theories of psychology.<sup id="cite_ref-97"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-97">[96]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Lachmanpage258_98-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-Lachmanpage258-98">[97]</a></sup>

### Key concepts\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Key concepts")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/C._G._Jung_institute.jpg/220px-C._G._Jung_institute.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:C._G._Jung_institute.jpg)

C. G. Jung Institute, [Küsnacht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCsnacht "Küsnacht"), Switzerland

Within the field of [analytical psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_psychology "Analytical psychology"), a brief survey of major concepts developed by Jung include (alphabetical):<sup id="cite_ref-99"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-99">[98]</a></sup>

-   **[Anima and animus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima_and_animus "Anima and animus")**—(archetype) the contrasexual aspect of a person's psyche. In a woman's psyche, her inner personal masculine is conceived both as a complex and an archetypal image; comparably in a man's psyche, his inner personal feminine is conceived both as a complex and an archetypal image.
-   **[Archetype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes "Jungian archetypes")**—a concept "borrowed" from [anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology "Anthropology") to denote supposedly universal and recurring mental images or themes. Jung's descriptions of archetypes varied over time.
-   **[Archetypal images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes "Jungian archetypes")**—universal symbols that can mediate opposites in the psyche, often found in religious art, mythology, and fairy tales across cultures.
-   **[Collective unconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious "Collective unconscious")**—aspects of unconsciousness experienced by all people in different cultures.
-   **[Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_(psychology) "Complex (psychology)")**—the repressed organisation of images and experiences that governs perception and behaviour.
-   **[Extraversion and introversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion "Extraversion and introversion")**—personality traits of degrees of openness or reserve contributing to [psychological type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_type "Psychological type").<sup id="cite_ref-100"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-100">[99]</a></sup>
-   **[Individuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuation "Individuation")**—the process of fulfilment of each individual "which negates neither the conscious or unconscious position but does justice to them both".<sup id="cite_ref-101"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-101">[100]</a></sup>
-   **[Interpersonal relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship "Interpersonal relationship")**\- The way people relate to others is a reflection of the way they relate to their own selves. This may also be extended to relations with the natural environment.
-   **[Persona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(psychology) "Persona (psychology)")**—element of the personality that arises "for reasons of adaptation or personal convenience"—the "masks" one puts on in various situations.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_102-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-:0-102">[101]</a></sup>
-   **[Psychological types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Types "Psychological Types")**—a framework for consciously orienting psychotherapists to patients, by raising to consciousness particular modes of personality, differentiation between analyst and patient.
-   **[Shadow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_(psychology) "Shadow (psychology)")**—(archetype) the repressed, therefore unknown, aspects of the personality including those often considered to be negative.
-   **[Self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_in_Jungian_psychology "Self in Jungian psychology")**—(archetype) the central overarching concept governing the individuation process, as symbolised by mandalas, the union of male and female, totality, and unity. Jung viewed it as the psyche's central archetype.
-   **[Synchronicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity "Synchronicity")**—an acausal principle as a basis for the apparently random concurrence of phenomena.<sup id="cite_ref-103"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-103">[102]</a></sup>

### Collective unconscious\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Collective unconscious")\]

Since the establishment of [psychoanalytic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalytic_theory "Psychoanalytic theory"), the notion and meaning of individuals having a [_personal_ unconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_unconscious "Personal unconscious") has gradually come to be commonly accepted. This was popularised by both Freud and Jung. Whereas an individual's personal unconscious is made up of thoughts and emotions which have, at some time, been experienced or held in mind, but which have been repressed or forgotten, in contrast, the _collective_ unconscious is neither acquired by activities within an individual's life, nor a container of things that are thoughts, memories or ideas which are capable of being conscious during one's life. The contents of it were never naturally "known" through physical or cognitive experience and then forgotten.

The collective unconscious consists of universal heritable elements common to all humans, distinct from other species.<sup id="cite_ref-104"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-104">[103]</a></sup> However, this does not necessarily imply a genetic cause. It encapsulates fields of evolutionary biology, history of civilization, ethnology, brain and nervous system development, and general psychological development.<sup id="cite_ref-CW9_1_90_92_118_105-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-CW9_1_90_92_118-105">[104]</a></sup> Considering its composition in practical physiological and psychological terms, "it consists of pre-existent forms, the archetypes, which can only become conscious secondarily and which give definite form to certain psychic contents."<sup id="cite_ref-CW9_1_90_92_118_105-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-CW9_1_90_92_118-105">[104]</a></sup> Jung writes about causal factors in personal psychology, as stemming from, influenced by an abstraction of the impersonal physical layer, the common and universal physiology among all humans.<sup id="cite_ref-CW9_1_91_106-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-CW9_1_91-106">[105]</a></sup> Jung considers that science would hardly deny the existence and basic nature of "instincts", existing as a whole set of motivating urges. The collective unconscious acts as the frame where science can distinguish individual motivating urges, thought to be universal across all individuals of the human species, while instincts are present in all species. Jung contends, "the hypothesis of the collective unconscious is, therefore, no more daring than to assume there are instincts."<sup id="cite_ref-CW9_1_90_92_118_105-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-CW9_1_90_92_118-105">[104]</a></sup>

#### Archetype\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Archetype")\]

Common archetypal motifs: Devourer, Great/Benevolent Mother, Wise Old Man, Hero/Self

The archetype is a concept "borrowed" from [anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology "Anthropology") to denote a process of nature. Jung's definitions of archetypes varied over time and have been the subject of debate as to their usefulness. [Archetypal images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes "Jungian archetypes"), also referred to as [motifs in mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif-Index_of_Folk-Literature "Motif-Index of Folk-Literature"),<sup id="cite_ref-107"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-107">[b]</a></sup> are universal symbols that can mediate opposites in the psyche, are often found in religious art, mythology and fairy tales across cultures. Jung saw archetypes as pre-configurations in nature that give rise to repeating, understandable, describable experiences. In addition the concept takes into account the passage of time and of patterns resulting from transformation.<sup id="cite_ref-108"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-108">[106]</a></sup> Archetypes are said to exist independently of any current event, or its effect. They are said to exert influence both across all domains of experience and throughout the stages of each individual's unique development. Being in part based on heritable physiology, they are thought to have "existed" since humans became a differentiated species. They have been deduced through the development of storytelling over tens of thousands of years, indicating repeating patterns of individual and group experience, behaviors, and effects across the planet, apparently displaying common themes.<sup id="cite_ref-CW9_1_90_92_118_105-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-CW9_1_90_92_118-105">[104]</a></sup>

The concept did not originate with Jung but with [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato") who first conceived of primordial patterns. Later contributions came from [Adolf Bastian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Bastian "Adolf Bastian"), and [Hermann Usener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Usener "Hermann Usener") among others.<sup id="cite_ref-CW9_1_153_109-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-CW9_1_153-109">[107]</a></sup> In the first half of the twentieth century it proved impossible to objectively isolate and categorize the notion of an archetype within a materialist frame. According to Jung, there are "as many archetypes as there are typical situations in life",<sup id="cite_ref-CW9_1_99_110-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-CW9_1_99-110">[108]</a></sup> and he asserted that they have a dynamic mutual influence on one another. Their alleged presence could be extracted from thousand-year-old narratives, from comparative religion and mythology.<sup id="cite_ref-CW9_1_89_110_115_111-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-CW9_1_89_110_115-111">[109]</a></sup> Jung elaborated many archetypes in "_The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious_" and in "_Aion: Researches into the Phenomenology of the Self_". Examples of archetypes might be the shadow, the hero, the self, anima, animus, mother, father, child, and trickster.

#### Shadow\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Shadow")\]

The _shadow_ exists as part of the unconscious mind and is composed of the traits individuals instinctively or consciously resist identifying as their own and would rather ignore, typically: repressed ideas, weaknesses, desires, instincts, and shortcomings. Much of the shadow comes as a result of an individual's adaptation to cultural norms and expectations.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_102-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-:0-102">[101]</a></sup> Thus, this archetype not only consists of all the things deemed unacceptable by society but also those that are not aligned with one's own personal morals and values.

Jung argues that the _shadow_ plays a distinctive role in balancing one's overall psyche, the counter-balancing to consciousness—"where there is light, there must also be shadow". Without a well-developed _shadow_ (often "shadow work", "integrating one's shadow"), an individual can become shallow and extremely preoccupied with the opinions of others; that is, a walking [_persona_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(psychology) "Persona (psychology)").<sup id="cite_ref-:0_102-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-:0-102">[101]</a></sup> Not wanting to look at their shadows directly, Jung argues, often results in [psychological projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection "Psychological projection"). Individuals project imagined attitudes onto others without awareness. The qualities an individual may hate (or love) in another, may be manifestly present in the individual, who does not see the external, material truth.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_102-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-:0-102">[101]</a></sup> In order to truly grow as an individual, Jung believed that both the [_persona_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(psychology) "Persona (psychology)") and _[shadow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_(psychology) "Shadow (psychology)")_ should be balanced.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_102-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-:0-102">[101]</a></sup>

The shadow can appear in dreams or visions, often taking the form of a dark, wild, exotic figure.<sup id="cite_ref-112"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-112">[110]</a></sup>

### Extraversion and introversion\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Extraversion and introversion")\]

Jung was one of the first people to define introversion and extraversion in a psychological context. In Jung's _Psychological Types_, he theorizes that each person falls into one of two categories: the introvert or the extravert. Jung compares these two psychological types to ancient archetypes, [Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo "Apollo") and [Dionysus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus "Dionysus"). The introvert is likened to Apollo, who shines a light on understanding. The introvert is focused on the internal world of reflection, dreaming, and vision. Thoughtful and insightful, the introvert can sometimes be uninterested in joining the activities of others. The extravert is associated with Dionysus, interested in joining the activities of the world. The extravert is focused on the outside world of objects, sensory perception, and action. Energetic and lively, the extravert may lose their sense of self in the intoxication of Dionysian pursuits.<sup id="cite_ref-113"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-113">[111]</a></sup> Jungian introversion and extraversion is quite different from the modern idea of introversion and extraversion.<sup id="cite_ref-114"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-114">[112]</a></sup> Modern theories often stay true to behaviourist means of describing such a trait (sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness, etc.), whereas Jungian introversion and extraversion are expressed as a perspective: introverts interpret the world _subjectively_, whereas extraverts interpret the world _objectively_.<sup id="cite_ref-celebritytypes1_115-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-celebritytypes1-115">[113]</a></sup>

### Persona\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Persona")\]

In his psychological theory—which is not necessarily linked to a particular theory of [social structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_structure "Social structure")—the _persona_ appears as a consciously created personality or identity, fashioned out of part of the collective psyche through [socialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization "Socialization"), [acculturation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acculturation "Acculturation") and experience.<sup id="cite_ref-116"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-116">[114]</a></sup> Jung applied the term _[persona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona "Persona")_, explicitly because, in Latin, it means both _personality_ and the _masks_ worn by Roman actors of the [classical period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity "Classical antiquity"), expressive of the individual roles played.

The _persona_, he argues, is a mask for the "collective psyche", a mask that 'pretends' individuality, so that both self and others believe in that identity, even if it is really no more than a well-played _role_ through which the collective psyche is expressed. Jung regarded the "persona-mask" as a complicated system which _mediates_ between individual consciousness and the social community: it is "a compromise between the individual and society as to what a man should appear to be".<sup id="cite_ref-117"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-117">[115]</a></sup> But he also makes it quite explicit that it is, in substance, a _character mask_ in the classical sense known to theatre, with its double function: both intended to make a certain impression on others, and to hide (part of) the true nature of the individual.<sup id="cite_ref-118"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-118">[116]</a></sup> The therapist then aims to assist the [individuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuation "Individuation") process through which the client (re)gains their "own self"—by liberating the self, both from the deceptive cover of the _persona_, and from the power of unconscious impulses.

Jung has become enormously influential in management theory; not just because managers and executives have to create an appropriate "management persona" (a corporate mask) and a persuasive identity,<sup id="cite_ref-119"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-119">[117]</a></sup> but also because they have to evaluate _what sort of people_ the workers are, to manage them (for example, using [personality tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_test "Personality test") and [peer reviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review "Peer review")).<sup id="cite_ref-120"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-120">[118]</a></sup>

Jung's work on himself and his patients convinced him that life has a spiritual purpose beyond material goals.<sup id="cite_ref-121"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-121">[119]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-122"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-122">[120]</a></sup> The main task for people, he believed, is to discover and fulfill their deep, innate potential. Based on his study of [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity"), [Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism "Hinduism"), [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism "Buddhism"), [Gnosticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism "Gnosticism"), [Taoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism "Taoism"), and other traditions, Jung believed this journey of transformation, which he called [individuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuation "Individuation"), is at the mystical heart of all religions. It is a journey to meet the [self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self "Self") and at the same time to meet the [Divine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divinity "Divinity").<sup id="cite_ref-123"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-123">[121]</a></sup> Unlike Freud's atheistic worldview, Jung's [pantheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheism "Pantheism") may have led him to believe that spiritual experience was essential to well-being, as he specifically identifies individual human life with the universe as a whole.<sup id="cite_ref-124"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-124">[122]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-125"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-125">[123]</a></sup>

In 1959, Jung was asked by host [John Freeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Freeman_(British_politician) "John Freeman (British politician)") on the BBC interview program _[Face to Face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_to_Face_(British_TV_programme) "Face to Face (British TV programme)")_ whether he believed in God, to which Jung answered, "I do not need to believe. I _know_."<sup id="cite_ref-bbc_126-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-bbc-126">[124]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-127"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-127">[125]</a></sup> Jung's ideas on religion counterbalance Freudian skepticism. Jung's idea of religion as a practical road to individuation is still treated in modern textbooks on the [psychology of religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology_of_religion "Psychology of religion"), though his ideas have been criticized.<sup id="cite_ref-128"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-128">[126]</a></sup>

Jung recommended spirituality as a cure for alcoholism, and is considered to have had an indirect role in establishing [Alcoholics Anonymous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous "Alcoholics Anonymous").<sup id="cite_ref-129"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-129">[127]</a></sup> Jung once treated an American patient ([Rowland Hazard III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowland_Hazard_III "Rowland Hazard III")), who had chronic alcoholism. After working with the patient for some time and achieving no significant progress, Jung told the man that his alcoholic condition was near to hopeless, save only the possibility of a spiritual experience. Jung noted that, occasionally, such experiences had been known to reform alcoholics when all other options had failed. Hazard took Jung's advice seriously and set about seeking a personal, spiritual experience. He returned to the United States and joined a Christian [evangelical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism") movement known as the [Oxford Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Group "Oxford Group"). He told other alcoholics what Jung had told him about the importance of a spiritual experience. One of the alcoholics he brought into the Oxford Group was [Ebby Thacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebby_Thacher "Ebby Thacher"), a long-time friend and drinking buddy of [Bill Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Griffith_Wilson "William Griffith Wilson"), later co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. Thacher told Wilson about the Oxford Group, and, through them, Wilson became aware of Hazard's experience with Jung. The influence of Jung thus indirectly found its way into the formation of Alcoholics Anonymous, the original [twelve-step program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-step_program "Twelve-step program").

The above claims are documented in the letters of Jung and Bill Wilson.<sup id="cite_ref-130"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-130">[128]</a></sup> Though the detail is disputed by some historians, Jung discussed an Oxford Group member, who may have been the same person, in talks given around 1940. The remarks were distributed privately in transcript form, from shorthand taken by an attender (Jung reportedly approved the transcript), and later recorded in his _Collected Works_, "For instance, when a member of the Oxford Group comes to me in order to get treatment, I say, 'You are in the Oxford Group; so long as you are there, you settle your affair with the Oxford Group. I can't do it better than Jesus.<sup id="cite_ref-131"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-131">[129]</a></sup> Jung goes on to state he has seen similar cures among [Roman Catholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholics "Roman Catholics"). The 12 step program of Alcoholics Anonymous has a psychological backdrop, involving the human ego and dichotomy between the conscious and unconscious mind.<sup id="cite_ref-132"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-132">[130]</a></sup>

### Inquiries into the paranormal\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Inquiries into the paranormal")\]

Jung had an apparent interest in the paranormal and occult. For decades he attended [seances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seance "Seance") and claimed to have witnessed "parapsychic phenomena". Initially, he attributed these to psychological causes, even delivering a 1919 lecture in England for the Society for Psychical Research on "The Psychological Foundations for the belief in spirits".<sup id="cite_ref-Jung1997_133-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-Jung1997-133">[131]</a></sup> However, he began to "doubt whether an exclusively psychological approach can do justice to the phenomena in question"<sup id="cite_ref-Jung1997_133-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-Jung1997-133">[131]</a></sup> and stated that "the spirit hypothesis yields better results".<sup id="cite_ref-Carl_Gustav_Jung_1997_7_134-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-Carl_Gustav_Jung_1997_7-134">[132]</a></sup> But he retained some skepticism toward his own postulation, as he could not find material evidence of the existence of spirits.<sup id="cite_ref-Carl_Gustav_Jung_1997_7_134-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-Carl_Gustav_Jung_1997_7-134">[132]</a></sup>

Jung's ideas about the paranormal culminated in "[synchronicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity "Synchronicity")".<sup id="cite_ref-135"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-135">[133]</a></sup> This is the idea that certain coincidences manifest in the world, have exceptionally intense meaning to observers. Such coincidences have great effect on the observer from multiple cumulative aspects: from the immediate personal relevance of the coincidence to the observer; from the peculiarities of (the nature of, the character, novelty, curiosity of) any such coincidence; from the sheer improbability of the coincidence, having no apparent causal link (hence Jung's essay subtitle "An Acausal Connecting Principle"). Despite his own experiments failing to confirm the phenomenon<sup id="cite_ref-ShermerLinse2002_136-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-ShermerLinse2002-136">[134]</a></sup> he held on to the idea as an explanation for apparent [ESP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrasensory_perception "Extrasensory perception").<sup id="cite_ref-Jung2013_137-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-Jung2013-137">[135]</a></sup> In addition, he proposed it as a functional explanation for how the [I-Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-Ching "I-Ching") worked, although he was never clear about how synchronicity worked.<sup id="cite_ref-138"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-138">[136]</a></sup>

### Interpretation of quantum mechanics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Interpretation of quantum mechanics")\]

Jung influenced one philosophical interpretation (not the science) of quantum physics with the concept of [synchronicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity "Synchronicity") regarding some events as [non-causal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality "Causality"). That idea influenced the physicist [Wolfgang Pauli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Pauli "Wolfgang Pauli") (with whom, via a letter correspondence, Jung developed the notion of _[unus mundus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unus_mundus "Unus mundus")_ in connection with the notion of nonlocality) and some other [physicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_physics "Quantum physics").<sup id="cite_ref-139"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-139">[137]</a></sup>

### Alchemy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Alchemy")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Michael_Maier_Atalanta_Fugiens_Emblem_21.jpeg/220px-Michael_Maier_Atalanta_Fugiens_Emblem_21.jpeg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Michael_Maier_Atalanta_Fugiens_Emblem_21.jpeg)

The mythic alchemical philosopher's stone as pictured in _[Atalanta Fugiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta_Fugiens "Atalanta Fugiens")_ Emblem 21

Jung's acquaintance with alchemy came between 1928 and 1930, when he was introduced to a manuscript of _[The Secret of the Golden Flower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_of_the_Golden_Flower "The Secret of the Golden Flower")_, translated by [Richard Wilhelm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wilhelm_(sinologist) "Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)").<sup id="cite_ref-140"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-140">[138]</a></sup> The work and writings of Jung from the 1930s onwards shifted to a focus on the [psychological significance of alchemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy#Psychology "Alchemy").<sup id="cite_ref-141"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-141">[139]</a></sup>

In 1944 Jung published _[Psychology and Alchemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology_and_Alchemy "Psychology and Alchemy")_, in which he analyzed the alchemical symbols and came to the conclusion that there is a direct relationship between them and the psychoanalytical process.<sup id="cite_ref-142"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-142">[c]</a></sup> He argued that the alchemical process was the transformation of the impure soul (lead) to perfected soul (gold), and a metaphor for the individuation process.<sup id="cite_ref-jungbio1_30-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-jungbio1-30">[29]</a></sup>

In 1963 _[Mysterium Coniunctionis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysterium_Coniunctionis "Mysterium Coniunctionis")_ first appeared in English as part of _[The Collected Works of C. G. Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Collected_Works_of_C._G._Jung "The Collected Works of C. G. Jung")_. _Mysterium Coniunctionis_ was Jung's last major book and focused on the "_Mysterium Coniunctionis_" archetype, known as the [sacred marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_marriage "Sacred marriage") between sun and moon. Jung argued that the stages of the alchemists, the blackening, the whitening, the reddening, and the yellowing, could be taken as symbolic of individuation—his chosen term for personal growth (75).

### Art therapy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Art therapy")\]

Jung proposed that art can be used to alleviate or contain feelings of trauma, fear, or anxiety and also to repair, restore and heal.<sup id="cite_ref-art-therapy_23-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-art-therapy-23">[22]</a></sup> In his work with patients and his own personal explorations, Jung wrote that art expression and images found in dreams could help recover from trauma and emotional distress. At times of emotional distress, he often drew, painted, or made objects and constructions which he recognized as more than recreational.<sup id="cite_ref-art-therapy_23-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-art-therapy-23">[22]</a></sup>

### Dance/movement therapy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=33 "Edit section: Dance/movement therapy")\]

[Dance/movement therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance/movement_therapy "Dance/movement therapy") as active imagination was created by Jung and [Toni Wolff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toni_Wolff "Toni Wolff") in 1916<sup id="cite_ref-143"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-143">[140]</a></sup> and practiced by [Tina Keller-Jenny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Keller-Jenny "Tina Keller-Jenny") and other analysts, but remained largely unknown until the 1950s when it was rediscovered by [Marian Chace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_Chace "Marian Chace") and therapist Mary Whitehouse. Whitehouse, after studying with [Martha Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Graham "Martha Graham") and [Mary Wigman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Wigman "Mary Wigman"), became a dancer and teacher of modern dance,<sup id="cite_ref-144"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-144">[141]</a></sup> as well as Swiss dancer [Trudy Schoop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trudi_Schoop "Trudi Schoop") in 1963, who is considered one of the founders of dance/movement therapy in the US.

### Political views\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=34 "Edit section: Political views")\]

#### The state\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=35 "Edit section: The state")\]

Jung stressed the importance of [individual rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights "Natural and legal rights") in a person's relation to the state and society. He saw that the state was treated as "a quasi-animate personality from whom everything is expected" but that this personality was "only camouflage for those individuals who know how to manipulate it",<sup id="cite_ref-145"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-145">[142]</a></sup> and referred to the state as a form of slavery.<sup id="cite_ref-146"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-146">[143]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-147"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-147">[144]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Jung_2006_23–24_148-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-Jung_2006_23%E2%80%9324-148">[145]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-149"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-149">[146]</a></sup> He also thought that the state "swallowed up \[people's\] religious forces",<sup id="cite_ref-150"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-150">[147]</a></sup> and therefore that the state had "taken the place of God"—making it comparable to a religion in which "state slavery is a form of worship".<sup id="cite_ref-Jung_2006_23–24_148-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-Jung_2006_23%E2%80%9324-148">[145]</a></sup> Jung observed that "stage acts of \[the\] state" are comparable to religious displays:

> Brass bands, flags, banners, parades and monster demonstrations are no different in principle from ecclesiastical processions, cannonades and fire to scare off demons.<sup id="cite_ref-151"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-151">[148]</a></sup>

From Jung's perspective, this replacement of God with the state in a mass society leads to the dislocation of the religious drive and results in the same [fanaticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanaticism "Fanaticism") of the church-states of the Dark Ages—wherein the more the state is 'worshipped', the more freedom and morality are suppressed;<sup id="cite_ref-152"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-152">[149]</a></sup> this ultimately leaves the individual psychically undeveloped with extreme feelings of marginalization.<sup id="cite_ref-153"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-153">[150]</a></sup>

#### Service to the Allies during World War II\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=36 "Edit section: Service to the Allies during World War II")\]

Jung was in contact with [Allen Dulles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Dulles "Allen Dulles") of the [Office of Strategic Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Strategic_Services "Office of Strategic Services") (predecessor of the [Central Intelligence Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency "Central Intelligence Agency")) and provided valuable intelligence on the psychological condition of [Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler "Hitler"). Dulles referred to Jung as "Agent 488" and offered the following description of his service: "Nobody will probably ever know how much Professor Jung contributed to the Allied Cause during the war, by seeing people who were connected somehow with the other side". Jung's service to the Allied cause through the OSS remained classified after the war.<sup id="cite_ref-154"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-154">[151]</a></sup>

### Relationship to Nazism and antisemitism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=37 "Edit section: Relationship to Nazism and antisemitism")\]

In "The State of Psychotherapy Today",<sup id="cite_ref-155"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-155">[152]</a></sup> published in 1934 in the _Zentralblatt für Psychotherapie_, Jung wrote: "The [Aryan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan_race "Aryan race") unconscious has a greater potential than the Jewish unconscious" and "The Jew, who is something of a nomad, has never yet created a cultural form of his own and as far as we can see never will".<sup id="cite_ref-156"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-156">[153]</a></sup> [Andrew Samuels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Samuels "Andrew Samuels") argues that his remarks on the "Aryan unconscious" and the "corrosive character" of Freud's "Jewish gospel"<sup id="cite_ref-157"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-157">[154]</a></sup> demonstrate an antisemitism "fundamental to the structure of Jung's thought" but also argues that there is a "pioneering nature of Jung's contributions" and that "his intuition of the importance of exploring difference remains intact."<sup id="cite_ref-158"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-158">[155]</a></sup>

In 1933, after the Nazis gained power in Germany, Jung became the president of the new [International General Medical Society for Psychotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_General_Medical_Society_for_Psychotherapy "International General Medical Society for Psychotherapy") (_Allgemeine Ärztliche Gesellschaft für Psychotherapie_), a professional body which aimed to have affiliated organizations in different countries.<sup id="cite_ref-159"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-159">[156]</a></sup> The German affiliated organization, the Deutsche Allgemeine Ärztliche Gesellschaft für Psychotherapie, led by [Matthias Göring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_G%C3%B6ring "Matthias Göring"), an [Adlerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Adler "Alfred Adler") psychotherapist<sup id="cite_ref-160"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-160">[157]</a></sup> and a cousin of the prominent Nazi [Hermann Göring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_G%C3%B6ring "Hermann Göring"), excluded Jews. In 1933, the society's _Zentralblatt für Psychotherapie_ journal published a statement endorsing Nazi positions<sup id="cite_ref-161"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-161">[158]</a></sup> and Hitler's book _[Mein Kampf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mein_Kampf "Mein Kampf")_.<sup id="cite_ref-162"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-162">[159]</a></sup> In 1934, Jung wrote in a Swiss publication, the _[Neue Zürcher Zeitung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neue_Z%C3%BCrcher_Zeitung "Neue Zürcher Zeitung")_, that he experienced "great surprise and disappointment"<sup id="cite_ref-163"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-163">[160]</a></sup> when the _Zentralblatt_ associated his name with the pro-Nazi statement. He did not end his relationship with the _Zentralblatt_ at this time, but he did arrange the appointment of a new managing editor, [Carl Alfred Meier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Alfred_Meier "Carl Alfred Meier") of Switzerland. For the next few years, the _Zentralblatt_ under Jung and Meier maintained a position distinct from that of the Nazis, in that it continued to acknowledge contributions of Jewish doctors to psychotherapy.<sup id="cite_ref-Jaffe_p83_164-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-Jaffe_p83-164">[161]</a></sup> In the face of energetic German attempts to Nazify the international body, Jung resigned from its presidency in 1939,<sup id="cite_ref-Jaffe_p83_164-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-Jaffe_p83-164">[161]</a></sup> the year the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War") started.

The International Society's constitution permitted individual doctors to join it directly, rather than through one of the national affiliated societies, a provision to which Jung drew attention in a circular in 1934.<sup id="cite_ref-165"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-165">[162]</a></sup> This implied that German Jewish doctors could maintain their professional status as individual members of the international body, even though they were excluded from the German affiliate, as well as from other German medical societies operating under the Nazis.<sup id="cite_ref-166"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-166">[163]</a></sup> Jung went on to say "the main point is to get a young and insecure science into a place of safety during an earthquake".<sup id="cite_ref-167"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-167">[164]</a></sup>

Scholar [Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Hayim_Yerushalmi "Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi") believed that Jung's antisemitism may have contributed to the schism from Freud and his circle of psychoanalysts, who were predominently Jews.<sup id="cite_ref-168"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-168">[165]</a></sup>

Jung's interest in [European mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_mythology "European mythology") and [folk psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_psychology "Folk psychology") was shared by the [Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany").<sup id="cite_ref-169"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-169">[166]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGrossman1979_170-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrossman1979-170">[167]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-theguardian_65-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-theguardian-65">[64]</a></sup> [Richard Noll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Noll "Richard Noll") describes Jung's own reaction to this connection:

> Jung clearly identifies himself with the spirit of German [Volkstumsbewegung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lkisch_movement "Völkisch movement") throughout this period and well into the 1920s and 1930s, until the horrors of Nazism finally compelled him to reframe these [neopagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neopagan "Neopagan") metaphors in a negative light in his 1936 essay on [Wotan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wotan "Wotan").<sup id="cite_ref-171"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-171">[168]</a></sup>

Various statements made by Jung in the 1930s have been cited as evidence of both contempt for Nazism and sympathy for Nazism.<sup id="cite_ref-Clark,_R.W_1980_pp._492_172-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-Clark,_R.W_1980_pp._492-172">[169]</a></sup> In the 1936 essay "Wotan", Jung described the influence of [Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler") on Germany as "one man who is obviously 'possessed' has infected a whole nation to such an extent that everything is set in motion and has started rolling on its course towards perdition."<sup id="cite_ref-173"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-173">[170]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-174"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-174">[171]</a></sup> He would later say, during a lengthy interview with [H.

You know you could never talk to this man; because there is nobody there ... It is not an individual; it is an entire nation.

In an interview in 1949 Carl Jung said,

> It must be clear to anyone who has read any of my books that I have never been a Nazi sympathizer and I never have been anti-Semitic, and no amount of misquotation, mistranslation, or rearrangement of what I have written can alter the record of my true point of view. Nearly every one of these passages has been tampered with, either by malice or by ignorance. Furthermore, my friendly relations with a large group of Jewish colleagues and patients over a period of many years in itself disproves the charge of anti-Semitism.<sup id="cite_ref-177"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-177">[174]</a></sup>

### Views on homosexuality\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=38 "Edit section: Views on homosexuality")\]

Jung addressed homosexuality in his published writings, in one comment specifying that homosexuality should not be a concern of legal authorities nor be considered a crime. He also stated that homosexuality does not reduce the value of a person as a member of society. Jung also said that homosexuality is a result of psychological immaturity, but only if one's sexuality is not an aspect of their constitutional characteristics.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="This passage needs to be better explained.

### Psychedelics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=39 "Edit section: Psychedelics")\]

Jung's theories are considered to be a useful therapeutic framework for the analysis of unconscious phenomena that become manifest in the acute psychedelic state.<sup id="cite_ref-179"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-179">[176]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-carhart_180-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-carhart-180">[177]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-entropic_181-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-entropic-181">[178]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-182"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-182">[179]</a></sup> This view is based on correspondence Jung had with researchers involved in psychedelic research in the 1950s, as well as more recent neuroimaging research where subjects who are administered psychedelic compounds seem to have archetypal religious experiences of "unity" and "ego dissolution" associated with reduced activity in the default mode network.<sup id="cite_ref-carhart_180-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-carhart-180">[177]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-entropic_181-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-entropic-181">[178]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-auto_183-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-auto-183">[180]</a></sup>

This research has led to a re-evaluation of Jung's work, and particularly the visions detailed in _[The Red Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Book_(Jung) "The Red Book (Jung)")_, in the context of contemporary psychedelic, evolutionary and developmental neuroscience. For example, in a chapter entitled 'Integrating the Archaic and the Modern: The Red Book, Visual Cognitive Modalities and the Neuroscience of Altered States of Consciousness', in the 2020 volume _Jung's Red Book for Our Time: Searching for Soul Under Postmodern Conditions, Volume 4_, it is argued Jung was a pioneer who explored uncharted "cognitive domains" that are alien to Western modes of thought. While such domains of experience are not part of mainstream Western culture and thought, they are central to various Indigenous cultures who use psychedelics such as [Iboga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabernanthe_iboga "Tabernanthe iboga") and [Ayahuasca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca "Ayahuasca") during rituals to alter consciousness. As the author writes: "Jung seems to have been dealing with modes of consciousness alien to mainstream Western thought, exploring the terrain of uncharted cognitive domains. I argue that science is beginning to catch up with Jung who was a pioneer whose insights contribute a great deal to our emerging understanding of human consciousness."<sup id="cite_ref-184"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-184">[181]</a></sup> In this analysis Jung's paintings of his visions in _[The Red Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Book_(Jung) "The Red Book (Jung)")_ were compared to the paintings of Ayahuasca visions by the Peruvian shaman [Pablo Amaringo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Amaringo "Pablo Amaringo").<sup id="cite_ref-185"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-185">[182]</a></sup>

Commenting on research that was being undertaken during the 1950s, Jung wrote the following in a letter to Betty Eisner, a psychologist who was involved in LSD research at the University of California: "Experiments along the line of mescaline and related drugs are certainly most interesting since such drugs lay bare a level of the unconscious that is otherwise accessible only under peculiar psychic conditions. It is a fact that you get certain perceptions and experiences of things appearing either in mystical states or in the analysis of unconscious phenomena."<sup id="cite_ref-186"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-186">[183]</a></sup>

An account of Jung and psychedelics, as well as the importance of Jungian psychology to psychedelic-assisted therapies, is outlined in Scott Hill's 2013 book _Confrontation with the Unconscious: Jungian Depth Psychology and Psychedelic Experience_.<sup id="cite_ref-187"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-187">[184]</a></sup> A 2021 article discusses Jung's attitude towards psychedelics, as well as the applicability of his ideas to current research.<sup id="cite_ref-auto_183-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-auto-183">[180]</a></sup> As the author writes Jung's '...legitimate reservations about the clinical use of psychedelics are no longer relevant as the field has progressed significantly, devising robust clinical and experimental protocols for psychedelic assisted therapies. That said Jung's concept of individuation—that is the integration of the archaic unconscious with consciousness—seems extremely pertinent to modern psychedelic research.' <sup id="cite_ref-auto_183-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-auto-183">[180]</a></sup> The author also uses work in evolutionary and psychedelic neuroscience, and specifically the latter's ability to make manifest ancient subcortical brain systems, to illuminate Jung's concept of an archaic collective unconscious that evolved prior to the ego complex and the uniquely human default mode network.<sup id="cite_ref-auto_183-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-auto-183">[180]</a></sup>

## Legacy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Jung&action=edit&section=40 "Edit section: Legacy")\]

The [Myers–Briggs Type Indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator "Myers–Briggs Type Indicator") (MBTI), a [psychometric instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_psychology "Personality psychology") mostly popular with non-psychologists, as well as the concepts of [socionics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socionics "Socionics"), were developed from Jung's model of [psychological types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_types "Psychological types"). The MBTI is considered [pseudoscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscience "Pseudoscience")<sup id="cite_ref-188"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-188">[185]</a></sup> and is not widely accepted by researchers in the field of psychology.<sup id="cite_ref-189"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-189">[186]</a></sup>

Jung saw the human psyche as "by nature religious" and made this idea a principal focus of his explorations. Jung is one of the best known contemporary contributors to [dream analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_interpretation "Dream interpretation") and symbolization. His influence on popular psychology, the "psychologization of religion", [spirituality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality "Spirituality") and the [New Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age "New Age") movement has been immense. A _[Review of General Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_of_General_Psychology "Review of General Psychology")_ survey, published in 2002, ranked Jung as the 23rd most cited psychologist of the 20th century. The list however focused on U.S. journals and was made by the psychology department of [Arkansas State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_State_University "Arkansas State University").<sup id="cite_ref-190"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-190">[187]</a></sup>

Although psychoanalysis is still studied in the humanities, a 2008 study in _The Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association_ found that psychology departments and textbooks treat it as "desiccated and dead".<sup id="cite_ref-191"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-191">[188]</a></sup> Similarly, Alan Stone noted, "As academic psychology becomes more 'scientific' and psychiatry more biological, psychoanalysis is being brushed aside."<sup id="cite_ref-192"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-192">[189]</a></sup>

-   [Federico Fellini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Fellini "Federico Fellini") brought to the screen exuberant imagery shaped by his encounter with Jung's ideas, especially Jungian [dream interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_interpretation "Dream interpretation").

He was an Arabist, but the family money ran out for his studies. Relief came from a family legacy, however, a condition of the will was that it should only be offered to a family member who intended to study theology and become a pastor. Paul Jung, therefore, had his career determined by a will, not his will. See p.20.

87.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_ref-88 "Jump up")** "When I visited the ancient pagoda at Turukalukundram \[_sic_\], southern India, a local pundit explained to me that the old temples were purposely covered on the outside, from top to bottom, with obscene sculptures, in order to remind ordinary people of their sexuality. The spirit, he said, was a great danger, because _Yama_, the god of death, would instantly carry off these people (the "imperfecti") if they trod the spiritual path directly, without preparation. The erotic sculptures were meant to remind them of their _dharma_ (law), which bids them fulfil their ordinary lives. Only when they have fulfilled their dharma can they tread the spiritual path. The obscenities were intended to arouse the erotic curiosity of visitors to the temples, so that they should not forget their dharma; otherwise they would not fulfil it. Only the man who was qualified by his _karma_ (the fate earned through works in previous existences), and who was destined for the life of the spirit, could ignore this injunction with impunity, for to him these obscenities mean nothing. That was also why the two seductresses stood at the entrance of the temple, luring the people to fulfil their dharma, because only in this way could the ordinary man attain to higher spiritual development. And since the temple represented the whole world, all human activities were portrayed in it; and because most people are always thinking of sex anyway, the great majority of the temple sculptures were of an erotic nature. For this reason too, he said, the _lingam_ (phallus) stands in the sacred cavity of the _adyton_ (Holy of Holies), in the _garbha griha_ (house of the womb). This pundit was a Tantrist (scholastic; tantra = 'book')." -- C. G. Jung, from Segal, Rober A. (1992). _The Gnostic Jung_. New Jersey: Princeton University Press. p. 86.
