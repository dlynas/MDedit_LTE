## Reading on the Necessity of Violence/Threat of Force for Social Movements?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/qa50d0/reading_on_the_necessity_of_violencethreat_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/qa50d0/reading_on_the_necessity_of_violencethreat_of/)

> Hey folks, looking for reading that touches on the theory of the necessity/threat of/use of violence in rights movements with multiple examples grounded in history. I realize many books could fit this, so something that gives a broader overview is appreciated, rather than something highly specific.
> 
> I basically end up having the same conversations over and over with friends and acquaintances, who are typically neoliberal and think only pacifist resistance is ever warranted \*or\* effective.
> 
> Also looking for any critiques of incrementalism for actual social change and progress.

	There's a bit in James C. Scott's "Two Cheers for Anarchism" where he made the case that the major progressive achievements over the last century or so have only come about through the threat of riots and violence.

* 🟩 **[brentan1954](https://www.reddit.com/user/brentan1954)** ⬆️ 5 _(2021-10-17 16:25:53)_

	I've been surprised that the morality of a situation has had so much power. Maybe it was mostly a 20th century thing. It showed itself too in the recent case of George Floyd so it is alive to some extent. But there are times when morality holds no power to shame the oppressor, such as in WW2, and the only answer is return violence with violence.

	* 🟨 **[InfiniteBourdieu](https://www.reddit.com/user/InfiniteBourdieu)** ⬆️ 0 _(2021-10-18 12:35:40)_

		It isn't just the morality of a situation though. When you're engaging with an armed oppressor on their ground (i.e. that of violence) you're going to inherently be coming from a position of weakness: the state is so much more powerful than armed resistance groups within civil society. Even in WWII, if the Jews took up arms agains the Nazis it wouldn't have mattered, they still would have been crushed. Nonviolence doesn't hold a moral advantage over violence, it holds a tactical one.

			They aren't being crushed anymore, though, and that's the result of violence.

			* 🟦 **[InfiniteBourdieu](https://www.reddit.com/user/InfiniteBourdieu)** ⬆️ 1 _(2021-10-18 12:57:01)_

				Are they not? Police violence is still endemic in America—the protests haven't really done much to change that, violent or otherwise. I'm struggling to think of anytime in recent history that violence has brought about lasting political/social change.

	Ask them: Do they believe the current system isn't violent? Do they think that capitalism was not born smeared, in mud and horrors? "Conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder, in short, force, played the greatest part." It is "written in the annals of history, in letters of blood and fire." But I am preaching to the quire.

	Andreas Malm's recent book, _How to Blow Up a Pipeline_(2021) presents a good argument for activism in an ecological and anti-capitalist direction. Since it somewhat skirts around the whole "revolutionary warfare" narrative that many people think of, along with pictures of Trotsky on the back of a train, it is a good entry into radical action against capital. _Breaking Things at Work_ by Gavin Mueller also touches upon the subversion of capital in the workplace, not necessarily, but not dismissive of, sabotage. Another great entry into violence that doesn't harm people. That said, _Workers and Capital_ by Tronti is perhaps the best at understanding the attack _on_ capital.

	_Riot. Strike. Riot._(2019) by Joshua Clover is also a good entry into contemporary uprisings, rooted in things like the massive protests we have seen in Europe following the Eurocrisis. Jodi Dean ties the spontaneity of the crowd—we miss you, Rosa—into the movement very well with _Crowds and Party_, a call to help organise the movements, and not let them fizzle out in squares and streets. Maintaining the spontaneity.

	For the classics, there are three: Marx, Luxemburg and Lenin; ranked after the greatness of the minds.

		Thank you for the recs! I'm particularly interested in the first two you mentioned, but the others also sound intriguing. I have read Marx, but a long time ago. Been meaning to reread.
		
		Also, yeah, totally agree; I mention this often but it doesn't quite sink in.

	I found it interesting to read the history of 'The Weatherman Underground'. After they lost some of their own in an accidental explosion, and after Fred Hampton was murdered by the FBI, they changed tactics. The remaining membership still kept doing symbolic political bombings to effect change, but they now focused on property destruction and not harming anybody in the process.

	It's easy to just call them pacifists and then go at them with cherry picked or cherry picking texts that don't get at some critical issues. There is a difference between "pacifism"/"peaceful protest" and serious nonviolence. It's worth considering that serious nonviolence is something that is done when people think that violence is actually, in a way, called for. This doesn't mean you won't end up advocating violence, but you're making it too easy for yourself by using your liberal friends' "pacifism" as your straw man. And doing a great service to serious nonviolence, as well as too great a service to the vast illusions of violence/force.

	* 🟨 **[sapphoandhercrew](https://www.reddit.com/user/sapphoandhercrew) (OP)** ⬆️ 6 _(2021-10-17 21:03:55)_

		Totally fair - but they're 100% not approaching it from a position of radical nonviolence to strategically amplify systemic violence; not even on the radar. It's a largely reflexive defense of the status quo.

		* 🟧 **[ravia](https://www.reddit.com/user/ravia)** ⬆️ 3 _(2021-10-17 21:09:06)_

			You are so right in this. I'd just strongly suggest you work out some preliminaries of serious nonviolence, and in addition, broach the basic logics of antiforce, as this is very imortant.

	You should look into Gene Sharp. While most of the other answers here present theoretical defenses of violence, that doesn't really matter unless violence empirically works in achieving social change. Sharp is considered one of the primary founders of nonviolence/civil resistance studies, and draws from a huge number of historical cases to make the argument that nonviolent tactics are strategically superior to nonviolent ones in achieving social change. If you want a very broad overview, his three-volume work *The Politics of Nonviolent Action* might be up your alley, otherwise you could look at his single volume work *Waging Nonviolent Struggle* (or something like that) that covers many of the same themes.

	What you're talking about as the "threat of violence" is called the radical flank effect in the literature, and [here's](https://doi.org/10.17813/1086-671X-20-4-427) a good (and I think relatively conclusive) article that proves it doesn't actually work.

		Thank you! Looking forward to reading this and learning more about him.
		
		Also, the threat of violence doesn't work (as opposed to non-violence or actual violence)? Guess it's in the article

		* 🟧 **[InfiniteBourdieu](https://www.reddit.com/user/InfiniteBourdieu)** ⬆️ 1 _(2021-10-20 21:03:08)_

			For sure!
			
			By threat of violence not working I mean that in instances where there was a demand for something advocated in a nonviolent manner, the threat of radical (potentially violent) action happening in support of the movement was detrimental to the cause.

				That seems surprising to me and hard to isolate, especially given the many violent, extrajudicial factions of resistance movements that existed alongside nonviolent, civil ones, like the Indian independence movement and civil rights in the U.S.
