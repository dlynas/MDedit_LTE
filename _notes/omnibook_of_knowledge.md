	I like the overarching concept, and the only issue is that; with any publication, there will be some kind of bias.  It's partially why many individuals don't approve of Wikipedia, even though it is now far more controlled and overseen by experts in each field of topic than it used to be.

	To be the most effective "omnibook" you would have to capture all information that's been produced, as it has been produced, by it's producer.  In other words, you're looking for the equivalence of Google and the wayback machine combined, without a promotional algorithm.
