## Are you guys familiar with Donald Hoffman's work?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/10ob1pw/are_you_guys_familiar_with_donald_hoffmans_work/](https://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/10ob1pw/are_you_guys_familiar_with_donald_hoffmans_work/)

> From what I understood he suggests this idea that consciousness doesn't arise from the "real" world, from space-time or any other model that we use to describe the universe. That, if you take Darwin's evolutionary theory seriously, the best models we currently have to simulate evolution (for example, to test through computer simulation how natural selection "selects" the species who survive through generations) prove that all your wakeful, living experiences not only aren't the "real" universe that is actually out there but that they're not even this "limited lens" into reality. That they're actually a completely separate thing from reality/the universe itself. 
> 
> This is really wtf for me because nowadays we would normally presume that they're related to some level (like how when we say that we only see a certain spectrum of all the light that is out there, or of all the sounds that can be heard) but he's saying that that's not the case, that all our notions of physics result from consciousness, and they're just our subjective, fabricated way of making sense of them.
> 
> He says a lot of other stuff but to keep it short he sort of culminates into this theory of conscious entities, where in reality all along it's not the universe that generates us, it's us, the conscious entities, that generate the universe. Even Einstein's work (matter and energy, space and time) those commonly accepted notions are just a result of consciousness.
> 
> I feel that this must be deeply related to Taoism (this plays a lot with duality/non-duality imo) but I haven't managed to connect the dots fully. He also backs up the idea of everything being just the present moment, which we're all aware of in this sub.
> 
> Personally, I resonate a lot with what he talks about and I think this is really big stuff be it from a scientific or religous/spiritual viewpoint.

	Nothing new, philosophically. 

	In Platonism, the physical reality is a warped and corrupted reflection of the perfect and eternal world. In Kabbalah, much the same. In Buddhism, the separation of the elements of physical reality is an illusion. Even in Taoism, the Tao that can be named is not the eternal Tao.

		All true. It's my opinion that Lao Tzu was the wisest of that era  -  the Axial Age  -  in regards to the other greats of that time:  Buddha, Confucius, and Socrates and Plato.
		The reason for my opinion is that Lao Tzu formed no religion, teaching, nor political system. He left China the Tao De Ching, only because he was begged to leave them something, by a guard at the Great Wall; before he left them in their idiocy for good. 
		There's even a tale that Confucius did once get to meet Lao Tzu, and afterwards, when asked his thoughts of the man, he replied, "The Tiger has finally met the Dragon."

		I've been thinking about this, and it seems to me as the Tao is kinda the opposite of the Platonic ideal world...? If I understand correctly, the ideal world consists of perfect concepts like circles, and then in the real world those are imperfect representations of the circle.
		
		But concepts are exactly those things that can be defined, i.e. named, so the Tao is the part of reality that is beyond the ideals. When you forget all concepts, only the Tao remains. 
		
		I don't know if this interpretation makes sense...

			That's quite true.

	I think Hoffman is a synthesis of past philosophy and his work builds not upon philosophy, but on science.  If you read Behave, by Robery Sapolsky, you will see aspects of our organic mechanism that drives our emotions, thoughts and actions.  Then, for me, Hoffman brings a unifying focus to the human condition.

	Others can explain better than I, but essentially my take is that we are evolved to create simplified memes based on narrow perception abilities which we then edit, project and  believe in.  I call the human organism a belief engine.  None of it is real, because it cannot be.  No description is fully accurate because our very words are simply religious thinking, they only work if you believe in them.  

	This is true of all symbolic language I think.  Hold no words sacred, the greater truth is in the spaces before words and belief.

		This is why I'm grateful that my native tongue is American Jive. No formality, and the Spirit is behind the words expressed, which come straight up to the front. In Jive, sometimes two negatives means the subject is fuckin' negative. You will know if you're paying attention. Yep.

	This is a pretty common theme in philosophy, especially since the Matrix movies came out.   It seems to me it is much more in alignment with western philosophy than eastern. On the other hand, there is the story in the Chuang Tzu about the man who wasn't sure whether he was a man dreaming about a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming about a man.

	Pretty interesting interview, I particularly enjoyed how it‚Äôs basically the science behind non duality. That was my takeaway anyhow

	Maybe he‚Äôs wrong. Just saying. Even Einstein, Tesla, and Newton (think alchemy) were wrong at lease a time or two or three.

	Hmm I need to listen again, it's been a while. I think I've only heard him on Sam Harris, Lex Fridman, and Tom Bilyeu.  

	I think that's a fairly good description from what I remember‚Äì‚ÄìI suspect you really have to get down to the mathematics of it to appreciate the elegance of what he's doing. Sam Harris was always pointing out that, according to physics, reality CAN'T be as we perceive it. Hoffman always acknowledged this but suggested his work might lead to a more concrete understanding of consciousness as fundamental‚Äì‚Äìperhaps a mathematical model to explain how it precedes spacetime etc.  

	He does say rationality provides an exception, a window by which we might divine the actual working of things. Obviously though math exists in a purely rigid conceptual space. It has no qualitative properties to enjoy/experience unless we use it to model something more phenomenological‚Äì‚Äìlike a model, a map, a spectrum of spicyness, of pain, of love.  

	As math, or tautological reasoning, seem to function independent of perception, he would probably say 'root consciousness,' rather than 'conscious entities' is the fundamental field out of which he's proposing reality arises. I think there's a key difference there which distinguishes him from the common perception of idealism. Conscious entities, as far as we know them, rely on all this other stuff like spacetime, matter, neurons, memory, and so on.

	If I follow his work I do indeed arrive at a conclusion I've managed to weave into a somewhat Taoist philosophy: the math can only be half the equation. Philosophically, we have to recognize that what is 'real' cannot be limited to what is material (or, in the Hoffman conversation, what is empirical). Reality divorced from experience doesn't exist. A finite and structured perception (and this 'illusion' it generates) is the only apparatus by which something can be experienced at all. If consciousness precedes spacetime just like math, this seems sensible and delightful. If it doesn't, consciousness remains a mystery on two levels rather than just one.  

	Hoffman and potentially others who argue consciousness is fundamental (panpsychists etc) must ask only one ontological question: where did those fundamental things comes from. Others must explain THOSE things, then still satisfy how it could have emerged within spacetime and resulted in this subjective nature David Chalmers calls the 'hard problem.'  

	I actually did an essay/youtube on math and modeling, how experience exists in this space between narrative and math, between concept and material. It seems without either, we'd have no way of describing anything, must less experiencing life firsthand. It drew me towards a lot of advaita, Taoism, interdependence. Nothing can be described as it is, actually‚Äì‚Äìjust by what it DOES. And everything it does can only be described according to our sensory apparatus‚Äì‚Äìor SOME sensory apparatus, supposedly.  

	At the base of it, if you strip all description away, you get only mathematical formulas describing entities or properties with no distinction whatsoever. X and Y and Z are all the same. You need experience, perception‚Äì‚ÄìILLUSION‚Äì‚Äìto distinguish them.
