A **reserve currency** is a [foreign currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_currency "Foreign currency") that is held in significant quantities by [central banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank "Central bank") or other [monetary authorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_authority "Monetary authority") as part of their [foreign exchange reserves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_reserves "Foreign exchange reserves"). The reserve currency can be used in international transactions, international investments and all aspects of the global economy. It is often considered a [hard currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_currency "Hard currency") or [safe-haven currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe-haven_currency "Safe-haven currency").

The United Kingdom's [pound sterling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling "Pound sterling") was the primary reserve currency of much of the world in the 19th century and first half of the 20th century.<sup id="cite_ref-Schenk_2009_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-Schenk_2009-1">[1]</a></sup> However, by the middle of the 20th century, the [United States dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar "United States dollar") had become the world's dominant reserve currency.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS" title="Wikipedia:NOTRS"><span title="source not independent of the subject (November 2023)">better&nbsp;source&nbsp;needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

## History\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reserve_currency&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")\]

Reserve currencies have come and gone with the evolution of the world’s geopolitical order. International currencies in the past have (excluding those discussed below) included the [Greek drachma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_drachma "Ancient drachma"), coined in the fifth century B.C.E., the Roman [denarii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius "Denarius"), the Byzantine [solidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidus_(coin) "Solidus (coin)") and Islamic [dinar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_dinar "Gold dinar") of the middle-ages and the [French franc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_franc "French franc").

The Venetian [ducat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducat "Ducat") and the Florentine [florin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florin "Florin") became the gold-based currency of choice between Europe and the Arab world from the 13th to 16th centuries, since gold was easier than silver to mint in standard sizes and transport over long distances. It was the [Spanish silver dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_dollar "Spanish dollar"), however, which created the first true global reserve currency recognized in Europe, Asia and the Americas from the 16th to 19th centuries due to abundant silver supplies from [Spanish America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_America "Spanish America").<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

While the [Dutch guilder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_guilder#History "Dutch guilder") was a reserve currency of somewhat lesser scope, used between Europe and the territories of the [Dutch colonial empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_colonial_empire "Dutch colonial empire") from the 17th to 18th centuries, it was also a [silver standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_standard "Silver standard") currency fed with the output of Spanish-American mines flowing through the [Spanish Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Netherlands "Spanish Netherlands"). The Dutch, through the _Amsterdam Wisselbank_ (the [Bank of Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Amsterdam "Bank of Amsterdam")), were also the first to establish a reserve currency whose monetary unit was stabilized using practices familiar to modern [central banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_banking "Central banking") (as opposed to the [Spanish dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_dollar "Spanish dollar") stabilized through American mine output and Spanish fiat) and which can be considered as the precursor to modern-day [monetary policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy "Monetary policy"). <sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-The_Euro_at_Ten_5-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-The_Euro_at_Ten-5">[5]</a></sup>

It was therefore the Dutch which served as the model for [bank money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_money "Bank money") and reserve currencies stabilized by central banks, with the establishment of [Bank of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England "Bank of England") in 1694 and the [Bank of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_France "Bank of France") in the 19th century. The British [pound sterling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling "Pound sterling"), in particular, was poised to dislodge the Spanish dollar's hegemony as the rest of the world transitioned to the [gold standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard "Gold standard") in the last quarter of the 19th century. At that point, the UK was the primary exporter of manufactured goods and services, and over 60% of world trade was invoiced in pounds sterling. British banks were also expanding overseas; London was the world centre for [insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance "Insurance") and [commodity markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_market "Commodity market") and British capital was the leading source of foreign investment around the world; sterling soon became the standard currency used for international commercial transactions.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

Attempts were made in the [interwar period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interwar_period "Interwar period") to restore the gold standard. The British [Gold Standard Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Standard_Act_1925 "Gold Standard Act 1925") reintroduced the gold bullion standard in 1925,<sup id="cite_ref-winnie_7-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-winnie-7">[7]</a></sup> followed by many other countries. This led to relative stability, followed by [deflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation "Deflation"), but because the onset of the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression") and other factors, global trade greatly declined and the gold standard fell. [Speculative attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_attack "Speculative attack") on the pound forced Britain entirely off the gold standard in 1931.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/WhiteandKeynes.jpg/170px-WhiteandKeynes.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WhiteandKeynes.jpg)

[John Maynard Keynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes "John Maynard Keynes") (right) and [Harry Dexter White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Dexter_White "Harry Dexter White") helped to draft the provisions of the post-war financial system. Here, they meet at the inaugural meeting of the [International Monetary Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund"), 1946.

After [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), the international financial system was governed by a formal agreement, the [Bretton Woods system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system "Bretton Woods system"). Under this system, the [United States dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar "United States dollar") (USD) was placed deliberately as the anchor of the system, with the US government guaranteeing other central banks that they could sell their US dollar reserves at a fixed rate for gold.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the system suffered setbacks ostensibly due to problems pointed out by the [Triffin dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triffin_dilemma "Triffin dilemma")—the conflict of economic interests that arises between short-term domestic objectives and long-term international objectives when a national currency also serves as a world reserve currency.

Additionally, in 1971 [President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States") [Richard Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon "Richard Nixon") [suspended the convertibility of the USD to gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock "Nixon shock"), thus creating a fully [fiat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money "Fiat money") global reserve currency system. However, gold has persisted as a significant reserve asset since the collapse of the classical gold standard.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

Following the [2020 economic recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Economic_Recession "2020 Economic Recession"), the [IMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund") opined about the emergence of "A New Bretton Woods Moment" which could imply the need for a new global reserve currency system. (see below: [§ Calls for an alternative reserve currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#Calls_for_an_alternative_reserve_currency))<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>

## Global currency reserves\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reserve_currency&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Global currency reserves")\]

The IMF publishes the aggregated _Currency Composition of Foreign Exchange Reserves_ (COFER) each quarter.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> The reserves of the individual reporting countries and institutions are confidential.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> Thus the following table is a limited view about the global currency reserves that only deals with allocated (i.e. reported) reserves:

## Theory\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reserve_currency&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Theory")\]

Economists debate whether a single reserve currency will always dominate the global economy.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Many have recently argued that one currency will almost always dominate due to [network externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_externalities "Network externalities") (sometimes called "the network effect"), especially in the field of invoicing trade and denominating foreign debt securities, meaning that there are strong incentives to conform to the choice that dominates the marketplace. The argument is that, in the absence of sufficiently large shocks, a currency that dominates the marketplace will not lose much ground to challengers.

However, some economists, such as [Barry Eichengreen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Eichengreen "Barry Eichengreen"), argue that this is not as true when it comes to the denomination of official reserves because the network externalities are not strong. As long as the currency's market is sufficiently liquid, the benefits of reserve diversification are strong, as it insures against large capital losses. The implication is that the world may well soon begin to move away from a financial system dominated uniquely by the US dollar. In the first half of the 20th century, multiple currencies did share the status as primary reserve currencies. Although the British Sterling was the largest currency, both the French franc and the German mark shared large portions of the market until the First World War, after which the mark was replaced by the dollar. Since the Second World War, the dollar has dominated official reserves, but this is likely a reflection of the unusual domination of the American economy during this period, as well as official discouragement of reserve status from the potential rivals, Germany and Japan.

The top reserve currency is generally selected by the banking community for the strength and stability of the economy in which it is used. Thus, as a currency becomes less stable, or its economy becomes less dominant, bankers may over time abandon it for a currency issued by a larger or more stable economy. This can take a relatively long time, as recognition is important in determining a reserve currency. For example, it took many years after the United States overtook the United Kingdom as the world's largest economy before the dollar overtook the pound sterling as the dominant global reserve currency.<sup id="cite_ref-Schenk_2009_1-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-Schenk_2009-1">[1]</a></sup> In 1944, when the US dollar was chosen as the world reference currency at Bretton Woods, it was only the second currency in global reserves.<sup id="cite_ref-Schenk_2009_1-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-Schenk_2009-1">[1]</a></sup>

The [G8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8 "G8") also frequently issues public statements as to [exchange rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rates "Exchange rates"). In the past due to the [Plaza Accord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza_Accord "Plaza Accord"), its predecessor bodies could directly manipulate rates to reverse large [trade deficits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_deficit "Trade deficit").

## Major reserve currencies\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reserve_currency&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Major reserve currencies")\]

Distribution of global reserve currencies

### United States dollar\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reserve_currency&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: United States dollar")\]

The [United States dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar "United States dollar") is the most widely held currency in the allocated reserves. As of the fourth quarter of 2022, the USD accounted for 58.36% of official foreign exchange reserves.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> This makes it somewhat easier for the United States to run higher trade deficits with greatly postponed economic ramifications or even postponing a [currency crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_crisis "Currency crisis"). Central bank US dollar reserves, however, are small compared to private holdings of such debt. If non-United States holders of dollar-denominated assets decided to shift holdings to assets denominated in other currencies, then there could be serious consequences for the US economy. The decline of the pound sterling took place gradually over time, and the markets involved adjusted accordingly.<sup id="cite_ref-Schenk_2009_1-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-Schenk_2009-1">[1]</a></sup>

However, the US dollar remains the preferred reserve currency because of its stability along with assets such as [United States Treasury security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security "United States Treasury security") that have both scale and liquidity.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers"><span title="source dated 2010 (November 2023)">needs update</span></a></i>]</sup>

The US dollar's position in global reserves is often questioned because of the growing share of unallocated reserves, and because of the doubt regarding dollar stability in the long term.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> However, in the aftermath of the 2008 to 2010 financial crisis, the dollar's share in the world's foreign-exchange trades rose slightly from 85% in 2010 to 87% in 2013.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS" title="Wikipedia:NOTRS"><span title="opinion blog (May 2023)">better&nbsp;source&nbsp;needed</span></a></i>]</sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers"><span title="The date of the event predicted near this tag has passed. (May 2023)">needs update</span></a></i>]</sup>

The dollar's role as the undisputed reserve currency of the world allows the United States to impose unilateral sanctions against actions performed between other countries, for example the American fine against [BNP Paribas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNP_Paribas "BNP Paribas") for violations of U.S. sanctions that were not laws of France or the other countries involved in the transactions.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> In 2014, China and Russia signed a 150 billion yuan [central bank liquidity swap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank_liquidity_swap "Central bank liquidity swap") line agreement to get around European and American sanctions on their behaviors.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS" title="Wikipedia:NOTRS"><span title="Yahoo news, is there no expert secondary sources?

### Euro\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reserve_currency&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Euro")\]

The [euro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro "Euro") is currently the second most commonly held reserve currency, representing about 20% of international foreign currency reserves. After World War II and the [rebuilding of the German economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirtschaftswunder "Wirtschaftswunder"), the [German mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Mark "Deutsche Mark") gained the status of the second most important reserve currency after the US dollar. When the euro was [introduced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_of_the_euro "Introduction of the euro") on 1 January 1999, replacing the mark, [French franc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_franc "French franc") and ten other European currencies, it inherited the status of a major reserve currency from the mark. Since then, its contribution to official reserves has risen continually as banks seek to diversify their reserves, and trade in the [eurozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone "Eurozone") continues to expand.<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>

After the [euro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro "Euro")'s share of global official foreign exchange reserves approached 25% as of year-end 2006 (vs 65% for the [U.S. dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._dollar "U.S. dollar"); see table above), some experts have predicted that the euro could replace the dollar as the world's primary reserve currency. See [Alan Greenspan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Greenspan "Alan Greenspan"), 2007;<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> and Frankel, Chinn (2006) who explained how it could happen by 2020.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> However, as of 2022 none of this has come to fruition due to the [European debt crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_debt_crisis "European debt crisis") which engulfed the [PIIGS countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIGS_(economics) "PIGS (economics)") from 2009 to 2014. Instead the euro's stability and future existence was put into doubt, and its share of global reserves was cut to 19% by year-end 2015 (vs 66% for the USD). As of year-end 2020 these figures stand at 21% for EUR and 59% for USD.

### Pound sterling\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reserve_currency&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Pound sterling")\]

The United Kingdom's [pound sterling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling "Pound sterling") was the primary reserve currency of much of the world in the 19th century and first half of the 20th century.<sup id="cite_ref-Schenk_2009_1-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-Schenk_2009-1">[1]</a></sup> That status ended when the UK almost bankrupted itself fighting [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I")<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> and [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II")<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> and its place was taken by the United States dollar.

In the 1950s, 55% of global reserves were still held in sterling; but the share was 10% lower within 20 years.<sup id="cite_ref-Schenk_2009_1-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-Schenk_2009-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup>

The establishment of the U.S. [Federal Reserve System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System "Federal Reserve System") in 1913 and the economic vacuum following the World Wars facilitated the emergence of the United States as an economic superpower.<sup id="cite_ref-FDS-H-05_34-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-FDS-H-05-34">[34]</a></sup>

As of 30 September 2021, the pound sterling represented the fourth largest proportion (by USD equivalent value) of foreign currency reserves and 4.78% of those reserves.<sup id="cite_ref-IMFCOFER_35-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-IMFCOFER-35">[35]</a></sup>

### Japanese yen\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reserve_currency&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Japanese yen")\]

Japan's [yen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yen "Yen") is part of the [International Monetary Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund")'s (IMF) [special drawing rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_drawing_rights "Special drawing rights") (SDR) valuation. The SDR currency value is determined daily by the IMF, based on the exchange rates of the currencies making up the basket, as quoted at noon at the London market. The valuation basket is reviewed and adjusted every five years.<sup id="cite_ref-imff_36-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-imff-36">[36]</a></sup>

The SDR Values and yen conversion for government procurement are used by the [Japan External Trade Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_External_Trade_Organization "Japan External Trade Organization") for Japan's official procurement in [international trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade "International trade").<sup id="cite_ref-jetro_37-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-jetro-37">[37]</a></sup>

### Chinese renminbi\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reserve_currency&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Chinese renminbi")\]

The currency of China is the renminbi; the [yuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_(currency) "Yuan (currency)") is its primary unit

The Chinese renminbi officially became a supplementary forex reserve asset on 1 October 2016.<sup id="cite_ref-home_Thei_38-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-home_Thei-38">[38]</a></sup> It represents 10.92% of the IMF's [Special Drawing Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Drawing_Rights "Special Drawing Rights") (SDR) currency basket.<sup id="cite_ref-IMF_39-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-IMF-39">[39]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> The Chinese renmimbi is the third reserve currency after the U.S. dollar and euro within the basket of currencies in the SDR.<sup id="cite_ref-IMF_39-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-IMF-39">[39]</a></sup> (As shown in the [table above](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#Global_currency_reserves), the renmimbi is the fifth largest component of international currency reserves.)

### Canadian dollar\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reserve_currency&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Canadian dollar")\]

A number of central banks (and commercial banks) keep [Canadian dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollars "Canadian dollars") as a reserve currency. In the economy of the Americas, the Canadian dollar plays a similar role to that played by the [Australian dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar "Australian dollar") (AUD) in the [Asia-Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific "Asia-Pacific") region. The Canadian dollar (as a regional reserve currency for banking) has been an important part of the British, French and Dutch Caribbean states' economies and finance systems since the 1950s.<sup id="cite_ref-bankofcanada_41-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-bankofcanada-41">[41]</a></sup> The Canadian dollar is also held by many central banks in Central America and South America. It is held in Latin America because of [remittances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remittance "Remittance") and international trade in the region.<sup id="cite_ref-bankofcanada_41-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-bankofcanada-41">[41]</a></sup>

Because Canada's primary foreign-trade relationship is with the United States, Canadian consumers, economists, and many businesses primarily define and value the Canadian dollar in terms of the United States dollar. Thus, by observing how the Canadian dollar floats in terms of the US dollar, foreign-exchange economists can indirectly observe internal behaviours and patterns in the US economy that could not be seen by direct observation. Also, because it is considered a [petrodollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrocurrency "Petrocurrency"), the Canadian dollar has only fully evolved into a global reserve currency since the 1970s, when it was floated against all other world currencies.

The Canadian dollar, from 2013 to 2017, was ranked fifth among foreign currency reserves in the world, overtaking Australian Dollar, but is then being overtaken by Chinese Yuan.<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup>

### Swiss franc\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reserve_currency&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Swiss franc")\]

The [Swiss franc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_franc "Swiss franc"), despite gaining ground among the world's foreign-currency reserves<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> and being often used in denominating foreign loans,<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup> cannot be considered as a world reserve currency, since the share of all foreign exchange reserves held in Swiss francs has historically been well below 0.5%. The daily trading market turnover of the franc, however, ranked fifth, or about 3.4%, among all currencies in a 2007 survey by the [Bank for International Settlements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_for_International_Settlements "Bank for International Settlements").<sup id="cite_ref-Triennial-2007_45-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-Triennial-2007-45">[45]</a></sup>

## Calls for an alternative reserve currency\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reserve_currency&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Calls for an alternative reserve currency")\]

[John Maynard Keynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes "John Maynard Keynes") proposed the [bancor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bancor "Bancor"), a supranational currency to be used as unit of account in international trade, as reserve currency under the [Bretton Woods Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_Conference "Bretton Woods Conference") of 1945. The bancor was rejected in favor of the [U.S. dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._dollar "U.S. dollar").

A report released by the [United Nations Conference on Trade and Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Conference_on_Trade_and_Development "United Nations Conference on Trade and Development") in 2010, called for abandoning the U.S. dollar as the single major reserve currency. The report states that the new reserve system should not be based on a single currency or even multiple national currencies but instead permit the emission of international liquidity to create a more stable global financial system.<sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup>

Countries such as Russia and China, central banks, and economic analysts and groups, such as the [Gulf Cooperation Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Cooperation_Council "Gulf Cooperation Council"), have expressed a desire to see an independent new currency replace the dollar as the reserve currency. However, it is recognized that the US dollar remains the strongest reserve currency.<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup>

On 10 July 2009, Russian President Medvedev proposed a new '[World currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_currency "World currency")' at the G8 meeting in London as an alternative reserve currency to replace the dollar.<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup>

At the beginning of the 21st century, gold and [crude oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crude_oil "Crude oil") were still priced in dollars, which helps export inflation and has brought complaints about [OPEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC "OPEC")'s policies of managing [oil quotas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_quota#Crude_oil "Production quota") to maintain dollar [price stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_stability "Price stability").<sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup>

Due to the [Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "Russian invasion of Ukraine") and international sanctions, Russia has used the [United Arab Emirates dirham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates_dirham "United Arab Emirates dirham") as a neutral currency when selling oil to India.<sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup>

### Special drawing rights\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reserve_currency&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Special drawing rights")\]

Some have proposed the use of the [International Monetary Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund")'s (IMF) [special drawing rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_drawing_rights "Special drawing rights") (SDRs) as a reserve. The value of SDRs are calculated from a basket determined by the IMF of key international currencies, which as of 2016 consisted of the [United States dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar "United States dollar"), [euro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro "Euro"), [renminbi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi "Renminbi"), [yen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yen "Yen"), and [pound sterling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling "Pound sterling").

Ahead of a [G20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20 "G20") summit in 2009, China distributed a paper that proposed using SDRs for clearing international payments and eventually as a reserve currency to replace the U.S. dollar.<sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup>

On 3 September 2009, the [United Nations Conference on Trade and Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Conference_on_Trade_and_Development "United Nations Conference on Trade and Development") (UNCTAD) issued a report calling for a new reserve currency based on the SDR, managed by a new global reserve bank.<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup> The IMF released a report in February 2011, stating that using SDRs "could help stabilize the global financial system."<sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup> The SDR itself is only a minuscule fraction of global currency reserves.<sup id="cite_ref-fore_LetC_58-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-fore_LetC-58">[58]</a></sup>

### Cryptocurrencies\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reserve_currency&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Cryptocurrencies")\]

According to some experts, digital [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency "Cryptocurrency") could potentially replace fiat currencies as a possible global reserve currency.<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup>
