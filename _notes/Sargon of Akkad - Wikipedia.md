**Sargon of Akkad** (; [Akkadian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_language "Akkadian language"): 𒊬𒊒𒄀, <small>romanized:&nbsp;</small> _Šarrugi_),<sup id="cite_ref-Sargon_inscriptions_3-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-Sargon_inscriptions-3">[3]</a></sup> also known as **Sargon the Great**,<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> was the first ruler of the [Akkadian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_Empire "Akkadian Empire"), known for his conquests of the [Sumerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer "Sumer") [city-states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_of_the_ancient_Near_East "List of cities of the ancient Near East") in the 24th to 23rd centuries BC.<sup id="cite_ref-chronology_2-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-chronology-2">[2]</a></sup> He is sometimes identified as the first person in [recorded history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recorded_history "Recorded history") to rule over an [empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire "Empire").

He was the founder of the "Sargonic" or "Old Akkadian" dynasty, which ruled for about a century after his death until the [Gutian conquest of Sumer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutian_rule_in_Mesopotamia "Gutian rule in Mesopotamia").<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> The [Sumerian King List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_King_List "Sumerian King List") makes him the [cup-bearer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup-bearer "Cup-bearer") to King [Ur-Zababa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ur-Zababa "Ur-Zababa") of [Kish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kish_(Sumer) "Kish (Sumer)").<sup id="cite_ref-urlThe_History_of_the_Ancient_World:_From_the_Earliest_Accounts_to_the_Fall_of_Rome_-_Susan_Wise_Bauer_-_Google_Książki_6-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-urlThe_History_of_the_Ancient_World:_From_the_Earliest_Accounts_to_the_Fall_of_Rome_-_Susan_Wise_Bauer_-_Google_Ksi%C4%85%C5%BCki-6">[6]</a></sup>

His empire is thought to have included most of [Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia "Mesopotamia"), parts of the [Levant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant "Levant"), and incursions into [Hurrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurrians "Hurrians") and [Elamite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elam "Elam") territory, ruling from his (archaeologically as yet unidentified) capital, [Akkad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkad_(city) "Akkad (city)").

Sargon appears as a legendary figure in [Neo-Assyrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Assyrian_Empire "Neo-Assyrian Empire") literature of the 8th to 7th centuries BC. Tablets with fragments of a _Sargon Birth Legend_ were found in the [Library of Ashurbanipal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Ashurbanipal "Library of Ashurbanipal").<sup id="cite_ref-westenholz_7-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-westenholz-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

## Name

"King Sargon" (𒊬𒊒𒄀 𒈗 _Šar-ru-gi lugal_) on the [Victory stele of Sargon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sargon_of_Akkad_and_dignitaries.jpg "File:Sargon of Akkad and dignitaries.jpg").<sup id="cite_ref-Victory_stele_of_Sargon_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-Victory_stele_of_Sargon-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-AOA_10-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-AOA-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-LN93-94_11-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-LN93-94-11">[11]</a></sup>

The [Akkadian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_language "Akkadian language") name is normalized as either _Šarru-ukīn_ or _Šarru-kēn_. The name's cuneiform spelling is variously [LUGAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LUGAL "LUGAL")\-_ú-kin_, _šar-ru-gen_<sub>6</sub>, _šar-ru-ki-in_, _šar-ru-um-ki-in_.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> In [Old Babylonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Babylonian_dynasty "First Babylonian dynasty") tablets relating the legends of Sargon, his name is transcribed as <small><span title="cuneiform text" lang="und-Xsux">𒊬𒊒𒌝𒄀𒅔</span></small> (_Šar-ru-um-ki-in_).<sup id="cite_ref-The_Sumerian_Sargon_Legend_13-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-The_Sumerian_Sargon_Legend-13">[13]</a></sup> In Late Assyrian references, the name is mostly spelled as LUGAL-GI.NA or LUGAL-GIN, i.e. identical to the name of the Neo-Assyrian king [Sargon II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_II "Sargon II").<sup id="cite_ref-Frahm_14-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-Frahm-14">[14]</a></sup> The spelling _Sargon_ is derived from the single mention of the name (in reference to [Sargon II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_II "Sargon II")) in the [Hebrew Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible "Hebrew Bible"), as סַרְגוֹן, in [Isaiah 20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_20 "Isaiah 20"):1.

The first element in the name is _[šarru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0arru "Šarru")_, the Akkadian (East Semitic) for "king" (c.f. Hebrew _śar_ [שַׂר](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%A8#Etymology_2 "wikt:שר")). The second element is derived from the verb _kīnum_ "to confirm, establish" (related to Hebrew _kūn_ כּוּן).<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

A possible interpretation of the reading _Šarru-ukīn_ is "the king has established (stability)" or "he \[the god\] has established the king". Such a name would however be unusual; other names in _\-ukīn_ always include both a subject and an object, as in _Šamaš-šuma-ukīn_ "[Shamash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamash "Shamash") has established an heir".<sup id="cite_ref-Frahm_14-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-Frahm-14">[14]</a></sup> There is some debate over whether the name was an adopted regnal name or a birth name.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> The reading _Šarru-kēn_ has been interpreted adjectivally, as "the king is established; legitimate", expanded as a phrase _šarrum ki(e)num_.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>

The terms "Pre-Sargonic" and "Post-Sargonic" were used in Assyriology based on the [chronologies of Nabonidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabonidus_Chronicle "Nabonidus Chronicle") before the historical existence of Sargon of Akkad was confirmed. The form _Šarru-ukīn_ was known from the Assyrian Sargon Legend discovered in 1867 in [Library of Ashurbanipal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Ashurbanipal "Library of Ashurbanipal") at Nineveh. A contemporary reference to Sargon thought to have been found on the cylinder seal of Ibni-sharru, a high-ranking official serving under Sargon. [Joachim Menant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_Menant "Joachim Menant") published a description of this seal in 1877, reading the king's name as _Shegani-shar-lukh_, and did not yet identify it with "Sargon the Elder" (who was identified with the Old Assyrian king [Sargon I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_I "Sargon I")).<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> In 1883, the British Museum acquired the "mace-head of Shar-Gani-sharri", a votive gift deposited at the temple of Shamash in [Sippar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sippar "Sippar"). This "Shar-Gani" was identified with the Sargon of Agade of Assyrian legend.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> The identification of "Shar-Gani-sharri" with Sargon was recognised as mistaken in the 1910s. Shar-Gani-sharri ([Shar-Kali-Sharri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shar-Kali-Sharri "Shar-Kali-Sharri")) is, in fact, Sargon's great-grandson, the successor of [Naram-Sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naram-Sin_of_Akkad "Naram-Sin of Akkad").<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>

It is not entirely clear whether the Neo-Assyrian king [Sargon II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_II "Sargon II") was directly named for Sargon of Akkad, as there is some uncertainty whether his name should be rendered _Šarru-ukīn_ or as _Šarru-kēn(u)_.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

## Chronology

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Empire_akkad.svg/330px-Empire_akkad.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Empire_akkad.svg)

Map of the approximate extent of the [Akkadian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_Empire "Akkadian Empire") during the reign of Sargon's grandson, [Naram-Sin of Akkad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naram-Sin_of_Akkad "Naram-Sin of Akkad")

Primary sources pertaining to Sargon are sparse; the main near-contemporary reference is that in the various versions of the _[Sumerian King List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_King_List "Sumerian King List")_. Here, Sargon is mentioned as the son of a gardener, former cup-bearer of [Ur-Zababa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ur-Zababa "Ur-Zababa") of [Kish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kish_(Sumer) "Kish (Sumer)"). He usurped the kingship from [Lugal-zage-si](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugal-zage-si "Lugal-zage-si") of [Uruk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruk "Uruk") and took it to his own city of [Akkad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkad_(city) "Akkad (city)"). The later (early 2nd millennium BC) Weidner chronicle has Sargon ruling directly after Ur-Zababa and does not mention Lugal-zage-si.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> Various copies of the king list give the duration of his reign as either 40 or 54–56 years.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> Only a few contemporary inscriptions relating to Sargon exist, though there are a number of Old Babylonian period texts that purport to be copies of earlier inscriptions of Sargon.<sup id="cite_ref-CDLI-Found_Texts_25-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-CDLI-Found_Texts-25">[25]</a></sup>

In absolute years, his reign would correspond to c. 2334–2279 BC in the [middle chronology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_chronology "Middle chronology").<sup id="cite_ref-chronology_2-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-chronology-2">[2]</a></sup> His successors until the [Gutian conquest of Sumer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutian_dynasty_of_Sumer "Gutian dynasty of Sumer") are also known as the "Sargonic Dynasty" and their rule as the "Sargonic Period" of Mesopotamian history.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Frayne10_27-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-Frayne10-27">[27]</a></sup>

Foster (1982) argued that the reading of 55 years as the duration of Sargon's reign was, in fact, a corruption of an original interpretation of 37 years. An older version of the king list gives Sargon's reign as lasting for 40 years.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>

[Thorkild Jacobsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorkild_Jacobsen "Thorkild Jacobsen") marked the clause about Sargon's father being a gardener as a [lacuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacuna_(manuscripts) "Lacuna (manuscripts)"), indicating his uncertainty about its meaning.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>

The claim that Sargon was the original founder of Akkad has been called into question with the discovery of an inscription mentioning the place and dated to the first year of [Enshakushanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshakushanna "Enshakushanna"), who almost certainly preceded him.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> The _Weidner Chronicle_ ([ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_Chronicles "Babylonian Chronicles") 19:51) states that it was Sargon who "built Babylon in front of Akkad".<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> The _[Chronicle of Early Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicle_of_Early_Kings "Chronicle of Early Kings")_ (ABC 20:18–19) likewise states that late in his reign, Sargon "dug up the soil of the pit of Babylon, and made a counterpart of Babylon next to Agade".<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> Van de Mieroop suggested that those two chronicles may refer to the much later Assyrian king, [Sargon II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_II "Sargon II") of the [Neo-Assyrian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Assyrian_Empire "Neo-Assyrian Empire"), rather than to Sargon of Akkad.<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup>

### Year names

While various copies of the Sumerian king list and later Babylonian chronicles credit Sargon with a reign length ranging from 34 to 56 years, dated documents have been found for only four different year-names of his actual reign. The names of these four years describe his campaigns against Elam, Mari, [Simurrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simurrum "Simurrum"), and Uru'a/Arawa (in western Elam).<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup>

#### Conquest of Sumer

In the inscription, Sargon styles himself "Sargon, king of Akkad, overseer (_mashkim_) of Inanna, king of Kish, anointed (_guda_) of Anu, king of the land \[Mesopotamia\], governor (_ensi_) of Enlil". It celebrates the conquest of [Uruk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruk "Uruk") and the defeat of [Lugalzagesi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugalzagesi "Lugalzagesi"), whom Sargon brought "in a collar to the gate of Enlil":<sup id="cite_ref-Nippur_inscription_44-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-Nippur_inscription-44">[44]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup>

#### Conquests of Elam and Marhashi

Sargon also claims in his inscriptions that he is "Sargon, king of the world, conqueror of [Elam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elam "Elam") and [Parahshum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parahshum "Parahshum")", the two major polities to the east of Sumer.<sup id="cite_ref-Frayne10_27-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-Frayne10-27">[27]</a></sup> He also names various rulers of the east whom he vanquished, such as "[Luh-uh-ish-an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luh-ishan "Luh-ishan"), son of Hishibrasini, king of Elam, king of Elam" or "Sidga'u, general of Parahshum", who later also appears in an inscription by [Rimush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimush "Rimush").<sup id="cite_ref-Frayne10_27-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-Frayne10-27">[27]</a></sup>

Sargon triumphed over 34 cities in total. Ships from [Meluhha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meluhha "Meluhha"), [Magan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majan_(civilization) "Majan (civilization)") and [Dilmun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilmun "Dilmun"), rode at anchor in his capital of Akkad.<sup id="cite_ref-SCHO_50-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-SCHO-50">[50]</a></sup>

He entertained a court or standing army of 5,400 men who "ate bread daily before him".<sup id="cite_ref-Nippur_inscription_44-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-Nippur_inscription-44">[44]</a></sup>

## Later literary composition on Sargon

A group of four Babylonian texts, summarized as "Sargon Epos" or _Res Gestae Sargonis_, shows Sargon as a military commander asking the advice of many subordinates before going on campaigns. The narrative of _Sargon, the Conquering Hero,_ is set at Sargon's court, in a situation of crisis. Sargon addresses his warriors, praising the virtue of heroism, and a lecture by a courtier on the glory achieved by a champion of the army, a narrative relating a campaign of Sargon's into the far land of _Uta-raspashtim_, including an account of a "darkening of the Sun" and the conquest of the land of _Simurrum_, and a concluding oration by Sargon listing his conquests.<sup id="cite_ref-Westenholz1997_52-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-Westenholz1997-52">[52]</a></sup>

The narrative of _[King of Battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Battle "King of Battle")_ relates Sargon's campaign against the Anatolian city of [Purushanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purushanda "Purushanda") in order to protect his merchants. Versions of this narrative in both [Hittite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hittite_language "Hittite language") and Akkadian have been found. The Hittite version is extant in six fragments, the Akkadian version is known from several manuscripts found at Amarna, Assur, and Nineveh.<sup id="cite_ref-Westenholz1997_52-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-Westenholz1997-52">[52]</a></sup> The narrative is anachronistic, portraying Sargon in a 19th-century milieu.<sup id="cite_ref-Old_Akkadian_53-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-Old_Akkadian-53">[53]</a></sup> The same text mentions that Sargon crossed the Sea of the West ([Mediterranean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea")) and ended up in Kuppara, which some authors have interpreted as the Akkadian word for [Keftiu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keftiu "Keftiu"), an ancient locale usually associated with [Crete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crete "Crete") or [Cyprus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus "Cyprus").<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup>

Famine and war threatened Sargon's empire during the latter years of his reign. The _Chronicle of Early Kings_ reports that revolts broke out throughout the area under the last years of his overlordship:

> Afterward in his \[Sargon's\] old age all the lands revolted against him, and they besieged him in Akkad; and Sargon went onward to battle and defeated them; he accomplished their overthrow, and their widespreading host he destroyed. Afterward he attacked the land of [Subartu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subartu "Subartu") in his might, and they submitted to his arms, and Sargon settled that revolt, and defeated them; he accomplished their overthrow, and their widespreading host he destroyed, and he brought their possessions into Akkad. The soil from the trenches of Babylon he removed, and the boundaries of Akkad he made like those of Babylon. But because of the evil which he had committed, the great lord Marduk was angry, and he destroyed his people by famine. From the rising of the sun unto the setting of the sun they opposed him and gave him no rest.<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup>

[A. Leo Oppenheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._Leo_Oppenheim "A. Leo Oppenheim") translates the last sentence as "From the East to the West he \[i.e. Marduk\] alienated (them) from him and inflicted upon (him as punishment) that he could not rest (in his grave)."<sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup>

Shortly after securing Sumer, Sargon embarked on a series of campaigns to subjugate the entire [Fertile Crescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertile_Crescent "Fertile Crescent"). According to the _[Chronicle of Early Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicle_of_Early_Kings "Chronicle of Early Kings")_, a later Babylonian historiographical text:

> \[Sargon\] had neither rival nor equal. His splendor, over the lands it diffused. He crossed the sea in the east. In the eleventh year he conquered the western land to its farthest point. He brought it under one authority. He set up his statues there and ferried the west's booty across on barges. He stationed his court officials at intervals of five double hours and ruled in unity the tribes of the lands. He marched to [Kazallu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazallu "Kazallu") and turned Kazallu into a ruin heap, so that there was not even a perch for a bird left.<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup> and <sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup>

In the east, Sargon defeated four leaders of [Elam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elam "Elam"), led by the king of [Awan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awan_dynasty "Awan dynasty"). Their cities were sacked; the governors, viceroys, and kings of [Susa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susa "Susa"), [Waraḫše](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marhasi "Marhasi"), and neighboring districts became vassals of Akkad.<sup id="cite_ref-61"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup>

Sargon became the subject of legendary narratives describing his rise to power from humble origins and his conquest of Mesopotamia in later Assyrian and Babylonian literature. Apart from these secondary, and partly legendary, accounts, there are many inscriptions due to Sargon himself, although the majority of these are known only from much later copies.<sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup> The [Louvre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre "Louvre") has fragments of two Sargonic victory steles recovered from [Susa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susa "Susa") (where they were presumably transported from Mesopotamia in the [12th century BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutruk-Nakhunte "Shutruk-Nakhunte")).<sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup>

#### Sumerian legend

The [Sumerian-language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_language "Sumerian language") _Sargon legend_ contains a legendary account of Sargon's rise to power. It is an older version of the previously known Assyrian legend, discovered in 1974 in [Nippur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippur "Nippur") and first edited in 1983.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Sumerian_Sargon_Legend_13-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-The_Sumerian_Sargon_Legend-13">[13]</a></sup> Subsequent scholoarship questioned if the two fragments were actually a join, or were even from two different texts. The initial translation has also been questioned.<sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup>

The extant versions are incomplete, but the surviving two fragments name Sargon's father as La'ibum. After a [lacuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacuna_(manuscripts) "Lacuna (manuscripts)"), the text skips to [Ur-Zababa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ur-Zababa "Ur-Zababa"), king of [Kish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kish_(Sumer) "Kish (Sumer)"), who awakens after a dream, the contents of which are not revealed on the surviving portion of the tablet. For unknown reasons, Ur-Zababa appoints Sargon as his [cup-bearer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup-bearer "Cup-bearer"). Soon after this, Ur-Zababa invites Sargon to his chambers to discuss a dream of Sargon's, involving the favor of the goddess [Inanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inanna "Inanna") and the drowning of Ur-Zababa by the goddess in a river of blood.<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup> Deeply frightened, Ur-Zababa orders Sargon murdered by the hands of Beliš-tikal, the chief smith, but Inanna prevents it, demanding that Sargon stop at the gates because of his being "polluted with blood". When Sargon returns to Ur-Zababa, the king becomes frightened again and decides to send Sargon to king [Lugal-zage-si](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugal-zage-si "Lugal-zage-si") of [Uruk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruk "Uruk") with a message on a clay tablet asking him to slay Sargon.<sup id="cite_ref-66"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> The legend breaks off at this point; presumably, the missing sections described how Sargon becomes king.<sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup>

Illustration of the Assyrian Sargon legend (1913): The young Sargon, working as a gardener, is visited by Ishtar "surrounded by a cloud of doves".

A Neo-Assyrian text from the 7th century BC purporting to be Sargon's autobiography asserts that the great king was the illegitimate son of a priestess. Only the beginning of the text (the first two columns) is known, from the fragments of three manuscripts. The first fragments were discovered as early as 1850.<sup id="cite_ref-Westenholz1997_52-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-Westenholz1997-52">[52]</a></sup> Sargon's birth and his early childhood are described thus:

> My mother was a high priestess, my father I knew not. The brothers of my father loved the hills. My city is [Azupiranu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azupiranu "Azupiranu"), which is situated on the banks of the Euphrates. My high priestess mother conceived me, in secret she bore me. She set me in a basket of rushes, with bitumen she sealed my lid. She cast me into the river which rose over me. The river bore me up and carried me to Akki, the drawer of water. Akki, the drawer of water, took me as his son and reared me. Akki, the drawer of water, appointed me as his gardener. While I was a gardener, [Ishtar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishtar "Ishtar") granted me her love, and for four and ... years I exercised kingship.

Similarities between the Sargon Birth Legend and other infant birth exposures in ancient literature, including [Moses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses "Moses"), [Karna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karna "Karna"), and [Oedipus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus "Oedipus"), were noted by psychoanalyst [Otto Rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Rank "Otto Rank") in his 1909 book _[The Myth of the Birth of the Hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_the_Birth_of_the_Hero "The Myth of the Birth of the Hero")_.<sup id="cite_ref-69"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> The legend was also studied in detail by Brian Lewis, and compared with many different examples of the infant birth exposure motif found in Eurasian folktales. He discusses a possible archetype form, giving particular attention to the Sargon legend and the account of the birth of [Moses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses "Moses").<sup id="cite_ref-westenholz_7-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-westenholz-7">[7]</a></sup> [Joseph Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell "Joseph Campbell") has also made such comparisons.<sup id="cite_ref-70"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup>

Sargon is also one of the many suggestions for the identity or inspiration for the biblical [Nimrod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimrod "Nimrod"). Ewing William (1910) suggested Sargon based on his unification of the Babylonians and the Neo-Assyrian birth legend.<sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> Yigal Levin (2002) suggested that Nimrod was a recollection of Sargon and his grandson Naram-Sin, with the name "Nimrod" derived from the latter.<sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup>

Sargon was regarded as a model by Mesopotamian kings for some two millennia after his death. The Assyrian and Babylonian kings who based their empires in Mesopotamia saw themselves as the heirs of Sargon's empire. Sargon may indeed have introduced the notion of "empire" as understood in the later Assyrian period; the Neo-Assyrian _Sargon Text_, written in the first person, has Sargon challenging later rulers to "govern the black-headed people" (i.e. the [indigenous population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer#Origin_of_name "Sumer") of Mesopotamia) as he did.<sup id="cite_ref-84"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup> An important source for "Sargonic heroes" in oral tradition in the later Bronze Age is a [Middle Hittite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Hittite "Middle Hittite") (15th century BC) record of a Hurro-Hittite song, which calls upon Sargon and his immediate successors as "deified kings" (<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingir" title="Dingir">d</a></sup>_šarrena_).<sup id="cite_ref-85"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup>

Sargon shared his name with two later Mesopotamian kings. [Sargon I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_I "Sargon I") was a king of the [Old Assyrian period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Assyrian_period "Old Assyrian period") presumably named after Sargon of Akkad. [Sargon II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_II "Sargon II") was a Neo-Assyrian king named after Sargon of Akkad; it is this king whose name was rendered _Sargon_ (סַרְגוֹן) in the Hebrew Bible ([Isaiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah "Isaiah") 20:1).

Neo-Babylonian king [Nabonidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabonidus "Nabonidus") showed great interest in the history of the Sargonid dynasty and even conducted excavations of Sargon's palaces and those of his successors.<sup id="cite_ref-86"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup>

The fanciful adventure film _[The Scorpion King: Rise of a Warrior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scorpion_King:_Rise_of_a_Warrior "The Scorpion King: Rise of a Warrior")_ (2008) imagines Sargon of Akkad as a murderous army commander wielding [black magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_magic "Black magic").

American Rock Group [They Might Be Giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/They_Might_Be_Giants "They Might Be Giants") refer to Sargon of Akkad in the track "The Mesopotamians" on their 2007 album [The Else](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Else "The Else"), along with [Hammurabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammurabi "Hammurabi"), [Ashurbanipal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashurbanipal "Ashurbanipal") and [Gilgamesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh "Gilgamesh").

The _Return of Rome_ expansion pack for the video game _[Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires_II:_Definitive_Edition "Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition")_ features a campaign called "Sargon of Akkad", which depicts his conquest of Sumer and the rise of the Akkadian Empire.

## Notes

1.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_ref-titles_1-0 "Jump up")** "King of Akkad, Kish, and Sumer" is a translation of the Akkadian phrase "LUGAL _Ag-ga-dè_<sup>KI</sup>, LUGAL KIŠ, LUGAL KALAM.MA<sup>KI</sup>". See Peter Panitschek, _Lugal – šarru – βασιλεύς: Formen der Monarchie im Alten Vorderasien von der Uruk-Zeik bis zum Hellenismus_ (2008), [p. 138](https://books.google.com/books?id=kFB6Pt3E5eYC&pg=PA138). KALAM.MA, meaning "land, country", is the old Sumerian name of the cultivated part of Mesopotamia (Sumer). See Esther Flückiger-Hawker, _Urnamma of Ur in Sumerian Literary Tradition_ (1999), [p. 138](https://books.google.com/books?id=XY3x7Skg47wC&pg=PA328).

An accession date of Sargon of 2334 BC assumes: (1) a Sargonic dynasty of 180 years (fall of Akkad 2154 BC), (2) a [Gutian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutian_dynasty_of_Sumer "Gutian dynasty of Sumer") interregnum of 42 years and (3) the Middle Chronology accession year of Ur-Nammu (2112 BC).

Perhaps the Yari-muta of the Tel el‑Amarna tablets, now (I think) Armūthia, south of Killis."

Stephanie Dalley, [Sargon of Agade in literature](http://www.aakkl.helsinki.fi/melammu/database/gen_html/a0000616.php): "The episode of dreams which Joseph interpreted for Pharaoh in Genesis 37 bears a notable resemblance to Sargon’s interpretation of the dreams of the king of Kish in the Sumerian Legend of Sargon, the same legend contains the motif of the messenger who carries a letter which orders his own death, comparable to the story of Uriah in 2 Samuel 11 (and of Bellerophon in Iliad 6). The episode in the Akkadian Legend of Sargon’s Birth, in which Sargon as an infant was concealed and abandoned in a boat, resembles the story of the baby Moses in Exodus 2. The Sumerian story was popular in the early second millennium, and the Akkadian legend may originally have introduced it. Cuneiform scribes were trained with such works for many centuries. They enjoyed new popularity in the late eighth century when Sargon II of Assyria sought to associate himself with his famous namesake."

83.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#cite_ref-83 "Jump up")** Sargon is the earliest known ruler with a Semitic name for whom anything approaching a historical context is recorded. There are, however, older references to rulers bearing Semitic names, notably the pre-Sargonic king Meskiang-nunna of Ur by his queen Gan-saman, mentioned in an inscription on a bowl found at Ur. In addition, the names of some pre-Sargonic rulers of Kish in the Sumerian king list have been interpreted as having Semitic etymologies, which might extend the Semitic presence in the Near East to the 29th or 30th century. See J. N. Postgate, _Languages of Iraq, Ancient and Modern. British School of Archaeology in Iraq_ (2007).

I ascended the upper mountains; I burst through the lower mountains. The country of the sea I besieged three times; Dilmun I captured. Unto the great Dur-ilu I went up, I ... I altered ... Whatsoever king shall be exalted after me, ... Let him rule, let him govern the black-headed peoples; mighty mountains with axes of bronze let him destroy; let him ascend the upper mountains, let him break through the lower mountains; the country of the sea let him besiege three times; Dilmun let him capture; To great Dur-ilu let him go up."
