Just in case anyone reading this is thinking about debating a crackpot on a famous podcast. Here are some important tips for how to debate from a former debater and coach.

Replying to @KevinZollman

A big part is that debating is an entirely distinct skill. A great scientist with all the facts on their side could easily appear to lose a debate against a crackpot if they weren’t skilled at the format.



1\. I don't care that you are an expert. You have not prepped for the debate. In college, we scouted. A lot. Knowing the subject matter is not enough, you need to know what your opponent is going to say and prepare specifically for that.

2\. Prepping is not just scouting, but also preparing what you will say in response. Framing your argument is super important and thinking through what you'll say is critical. Plan for way more than you think you need because you never know what direction it will go.

3\. Your expertise will leave you in the heat of the moment. You will get tongue tied or forget an important point. The more you're basically scripted the better. (But for a public debate, don't be wooden)

4\. Defense doesn't win championships. If you let your opponent define the terms of debate and you are just responding, you can't win. There will always be some crack that they can pry open. Instead, you need to define the terms and put them on the defensive from the start.

5\. For any given thing your opponent might say there are a lot of responses. Don't just go with the first one that occurs to you. Or even the intellectually deepest one. Go for the one that is easiest for you to win. ...

... Novice debaters always had to get trained out of this. "I pushed this argument because it was right." You're right about a lot of things. Go for the argument you are winning, even if you're right about other things.

6\. Avoid distractions and reframing. Your opponent, if they are smart, will always try to reframe the debate in a way that they can win. Don't let them do that, even if you think you can win the reframed debate. Control the conversation.

Maybe that's enough for now. But, I'll make this offer: if you are on the side of science and are going to debate someone in a public forum, reach out. I might be able to help.

Great thread and suggestions. Just 1 more: know who will "judge" your debate. What's the criteria to win for them (know your audience)? You may win the debate but lose the secondary audience (who you are trying to persuade to your side which could be the press or general public). x.com/KevinZollman/s…

Sean Please weigh in on the RFK/Govt vac guy debate or is it more of a continuum thing

public debates: the "infotainment" of truth-seeking?

I once attended a creation v evolution debate between Michael Shermer and some creationist. Shermer was smug as hell even as he got absolutely destroyed. I was perhaps one of the rare folks who was legitimately wrestling with the topic. Shermer set me back a long time on that day

I was wondering why this topic is trending. I think the audience point is a good one. Knowing who is listening to Rogan is probably the most important element. Many competitive debates are won by appealing to a judge tendency the other team doesn't know or account for.

"Debate" seems too formal? I've watched only a few episodes of Rogan but it seems likely it would've been more of a discussion, two people with differing views talking to each other.

This entire thread misses the point that exchanges recording for internet viewing are archived forever. The debate isn’t a contest. It’s an archive of information you can come back and consult, others can clip and expand upon / refute. 1/n

Trump comes to mind when reading this. Sounds trivial but profound consequences when the left tries engaging reasonably with right wing outlets
