Read the report - the US media reporting on this is unsurprisingly selective. On every page of the report are caveats, qualifications & disclaimers. Report is, self-admittedly, based on circumstantial evidence & calls for the Israelis to stop their Gaza campaign. /1

SRSG on Sexual Violence in Conflict Pramila Patten says "I must stress that my mission was neither intended nor mandated to be investigative in nature" and that she didn't speak to any victims of sexual violence during her visit to #Israel despite making a call for victims to x.com/Raminho/status…

It specifies how much it was unable to verify, instances of misinfo (“mischaracterizing grazing gunshot wounds…as targeted genital mutilation using knives”) & the lack of forensic evidence; most of info sourced was from Israeli institutions.

I’m personally confused about the “clear and convincing evidence” she mentions regarding sexual violences of Israeli hostages - testimonies aren’t evidence, let alone ‘clear & convincing’, so what does that mean?

The report also doesn’t specify who it spoke to but, again, does say that it sourced most of its information from Israeli institutions - there has been no independent investigation because Israel has also not allowed it.

As it’s been said again & again, instances of sexual violence on Oct 7 are possible; what’s being contested is: was it \*systematic\* sexual violence, who did it (fighter factions? Civilians? Gazan gangs?) & the lack of forensic evidence.

At the core of this is how allegations of sexual violence have been reported on: propagandistically and through a lens that makes sexual violence exceptional, lending it to be weaponized in a genocidal campaign that positions the people being bombed as ‘human animals’.

Consider how little coverage (see: nearly none) has been dedicated to documented & alleged instances of sexual violence against detained children, women & men by the Israeli, both in Gaza & the West Bank. The Israeli allegations play a function that US news media sees through.

(by “sees through” I mean they see that function through)

One of the biggest problems in the report is lack of specificity of methodology, witnesses, etc. Par for the course often for these initial reports but when there is an ongoing genocide and these allegations are used to justify the slaughter, care & specificity are obligatory.

Lastly, we see almost every single day, the sexual humiliation that Israeli soldiers engage in, in Gaza. They gloat about it. This, in addition sexual violence against Palestinian prisoners, isn’t worthy of any US news media discourse bc it doesn’t serve Israeli & US interests.

Unfortunately it has already been picked up as truth written in stone by some accounts. I'm very nervous about how this is going to be used to ramp up (idk what that could even look like atp) violence in Gaza.

buried on page 15 in its 23 page "report", the UN's Pramila Patten admits that all her information comes directly from the Israeli regime, and that it blocks UN agencies with an actual investigative mandate from doing independent investigations into their propaganda claims

Circumstantial information. Not evidence.

So another case of Israel says “trust me bro-it happened”. And repeated by main stream media as fact. Reminds me of the 40 beheaded babies crap
