## The Israeli military says it has dismissed two officers and reprimanded others for their roles in drone strikes in Gaza that killed seven aid workers with World Central Kitchen. 

The findings are the result of an unusually swift investigation by the military into Monday's killings, which have caused global outrage and strained relations between Israel and even its closest allies. 

U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday and demanded more protection of civilians and aid workers in the Gaza Strip, threatening for the first time that Israel's actions could lead to loss of U.S. support, though the White House did not specify if that could include ending arms transfers.

Israel now says it will open more Gaza aid routes, including the northern Erez border crossing, as most of the population of Gaza suffers from malnutrition in what aid groups are calling a "man-made famine." 

Many Palestinians say Israel's speedy response to international pressure shows that the U.S. and other Western powers could have done much more over the last six months to prevent suffering in Gaza, where more than 33,000 have been killed since October 7. 

"It took over 33k â€¦ killed and over a million on brink of starvation for Biden to make a phone call with even a hint of using leverage," analyst Yousef Munayyer said on social media Friday.
