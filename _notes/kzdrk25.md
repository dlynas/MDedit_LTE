> I was just thinking about the books that had a profound effect on how I think, and how I see the world.
> 
> ‘The Selfish Gene’ by Richard Dawkins, which I read when I was a teenager showed me that nature was not only beautiful, but explainable through the scientific method.
> 
> ‘The case against reality’ by Donald Hoffman, helped me see a way of marrying scientific enquiry with subjective experience.
> 
> ‘Elementary forms of religious life’ - Emile Durkheim gave me a (as an atheist/agnostic) a deeper respect for religion.
> 
> ‘The Panama Papers’ by Frederick and Bastien Obermayer showed me how rigged modern European society is in favour of the super rich. As well as how great investigative journalism works behind the scenes.

	Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain.    

	If you are an introvert, read it. Actually did change my life as an introvert working at a very extraverted organization. Eased an ocean of anxiety and self-doubt. ✌🏼

		Yes, this was going to be my answer! At the time I read this, I was only a few years out of college and working for a very extroverted, micro-managing boss who I’m pretty sure didn’t like me simply because I was introverted. This book brought to the forefront for me what I think I had felt all along, but couldn’t quite crystallize in my mind: introversion is not a bad thing or a disorder or abnormal, and in fact gives us unique skills that the extroverts who run stuff just don’t have. 
		
		I’ve actually ended up mostly working in fields designed for extroverts (sales, event planning) and I find that my introvert qualities like introspection and desire to observe people have helped enormously. I once took a personality test when interviewing for a sales job and the hiring manager told me the results said I wouldn’t be a good salesperson, that I should be an accountant instead. She asked how I could account for that. I kinda shrugged and told her she had my sales numbers from my previous job on her resume and she could verify them with my previous job, but that just because my personality “didn’t fit” the stereotype of a salesperson didn’t mean I wouldn’t be successful. Thankfully she hired me and I was able to prove that I was right!

		I remember when this book came out, it was all over my Facebook feed. I am genuinely happy for the validation that it has brought introverts. 
		
		But also at the same time, the book has ushered in an era of thoroughly insufferable conspicuous introversion and superiority complex. There was a marked to shift to flamboyantly using introversion as an excuse to be an absolutely shitty human being with a form of aggressively  anti-social attitude.  Basically  people who make their introversion their entire identity. That sort populates or even dominates online spaces like reddit. 
		
		In sum, I haven't read the book so obviously I am not judging it. But one thing that's crystal clear to me is that, regardless of what the book actually says, what a lot of people took away from it is that introversion is basically a superior form of being. And they behave accordingly. 
		
		In some ways it's become like veganism. How do you know someone is an introvert? Don't worry, they will tell you.

			I was with you til the vegan part. :) I know plenty of vegans and vegetarians who don’t talk about it.
