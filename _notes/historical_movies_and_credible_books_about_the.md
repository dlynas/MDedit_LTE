## Historical movies and credible books about the Middle East during the 20th century

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/aoinnz/historical_movies_and_credible_books_about_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/aoinnz/historical_movies_and_credible_books_about_the/)

> I want to learn more about pan-Arab nationalism and Islamism after watching Lawrence of Arabia and reading up on the subject online.  I know movies are not a good source of information of course, but I enjoy them nevertheless. What are some good movies and books (like primary or in depth sources- I'm not scared) about the subject?

	Lawrence in Arabia: War, Deceit, Imperial Folly, and the Making of the Modern Middle East

	One of my favourite, very well written book that takes the reader on a journey from the pre-start of WW1 to the establishment of Palestine, Syria, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. While the title says Lawrence in Arabia, by the end of the book you'll realise that Lawrence is a small cog in a grand story.

		I absolutely second Making of the Modern Middle East. Took a course on the middle East and the book does a good job of making some of the political decisions / culture / turmoil respectfully accessible. We also had the cool experience of both a Yemen refugee woman and Saudi abroad woman in the same class explaining their side of things.

	Thanks so much for this post. I saw Lawrence of Arabia in a huge, Cinemascope theater back when it was re-released in the late 1980s and it started my lifelong love of the Middle East and Islamic Culture in general. I ended up with an undergraduate degree in Middle Eastern History. While I don't use the degree much anymore, I do keep up with the current events and love reading histories and biographies pertaining to the Middle East, Northern Africa, Islamic history, Central Asia, etc. I look forward to seeing all the recommendations from others. I'm sure A LOT of new books and authors have published since my schooling in the 1990s.

	&amp;#x200B;

	Some of the books I read in college:

	A History of the Arab Peoples by Albert Hourani

	"Like Hidden Fire" and "The Great Game" by Peter Hopkirk.

	Orientalism by Edward W. Said

	A History of the Middle East by Peter Mansfield

	A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East by David Fromkin

	&amp;#x200B;

	edit: formatting

	* 🟨 **[Ratertheman](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ratertheman)** ⬆️ 12 _(2019-02-08 22:55:34)_

		I’d recommend anyone wanting to study the Middle East to read Orientalism. It has spawned a lot of debate and the concept of Orientalism is something to keep in mind while studying the Middle East. It applies to many academic disciplines. 

* 🟩 **[Robopengy](https://www.reddit.com/user/Robopengy)** ⬆️ 48 _(2019-02-08 14:08:52)_

	Tamim Ansary’s “Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World through Islamic Eyes” and Eugene Rogan’s “The Arabs” are both great 

	Edit: For more about the Middle East during the First World War there’s also “The Fall of the Ottomans: The Great War in the Middle East” also by Eugene Rogan and “The Ottoman Endgame: War, Revolution, and the Making of the Modern Middle East, 1908-1923” by Sean McMeekin

	**A Peace To End All Peace** by David Fromkin is a phenomenal study of how the modern Arab world was born out of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and its division by the French and Brits and whoever else following World War 1. 

	It was one of Dan Carlin’s sources in his series on WW1.

	Oh boy. Here we go. This is my area of expertise; BA in MENA studies, Arabic speaker, spent significant time in Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen. I am assuming English is the best language? That rules out several sources but below please find my (not at all exhaustive) list of books for people who want to know how we got to this insane mess.

	The first three deal with the foundation of movements - Arab nationalism, Zionism, and Islamism - that informed how the 20th century's history played out in the region. I believe they are all translations, but of high quality.

	*BOOKS*

	The Arab Awakening by George Antonious

	The Zionist Reader (because Zionism and Israel played a major role in 20th century mideast history and you should know the groundwork)

	Milestones by Sayyid Qutb

	Now we get to straight history - not primary source, but based on them. These books do a great job of explaining the complicated machinations of outside powers as well as provide a decent overview of regional history. My focus has until recently been Israel/Palestine and that likely colors the list.

	A Peace To End All Peace by David Fromkin

	One Palestine; Complete by T. Segev

	The Iron Wall by Avi Shlaim

	The Great War for Civilization by Robert Fisk

	Pity the Nation by Robert Fisk

	A Line In The Sand by J. Barre

	Lawrence in Arabia by .... I forgot his name.

	All that Remains by Rashid Khalidi

	I Shall Not Hate by Izz a-Din abu'l Aish

	Now to add: read biographies of Lawrence, Lloyd George, Herzl, Nasser, the Assad family, Feisal, Churchill, Ben Gurion, Arafat, and Woodrow Wilson. These will help explain a lot about the main players in the drama.

	*FICTION, ETC*

	The Cairo Trilogy by Naguib Mahfouz

	The Butterfly's Wings by Mahmoud Darwish

	Any poetry by Nizar Qabbani

	Old New Land by Theodore Herzl (if only to show how naive he was about the ease of colonizing Palestine)

	*MOVIES*

	Salt of this Sea

	Waltz with Bashir

	Paradise Now

	Gallipoli

	Battle of Algiers

		Commenting to add my westernized experience and education where I had taken a handful of course regarding the Middle East. I would also suggest:
		
		* [Sources in the History of the Modern Middle East by Akram Fouad Khater](https://www.worldcat.org/title/sources-in-the-history-of-the-modern-middle-east/oclc/984449038&amp;referer=brief_results) \- Primary sources to help give you the various views of people living and shaping history at the time. If I'm not mistaken, this offers M.E. sources for/against Pan-Arabism
		* [A History of the Modern Middle East by William L Cleveland; Martin Bunton](https://www.worldcat.org/title/history-of-the-modern-middle-east/oclc/1041025259?referer=br&amp;ht=edition) \- General overview of the Modern Middle East.
		* [The Coup: 1953, The CIA, and The Roots of Modern U.S.-Iranian Relations by Ervand Abrahamian](https://www.worldcat.org/title/coup-1953-the-cia-and-the-roots-of-modern-us-iranian-relations/oclc/921239485) \- Gives a good historical example of how a nation uses its intelligence agency to shape geopolitics in their favor.
		* Books by Tom Segev are highly regarded.
		
		I also read something focused on Egypt but I can't remember the names. I'm a horrible history major.
		
		I know a few good contemporary, or turn of the 21st-century films and documentaries like [678](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMc7YDCIORQ), so I can't suggest much beyond your aforementioned Waltz with Bashir, and the more African-Arab Battle of Algiers which shows 20th-century colonialism fighting a guerrilla revolt.
		
		* [The Gatekeepers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdMjr8cuEy8) Isreal's Intelligence Agency, Shin Bet during the 6-Day War with Egypt, Syria, and Jordan.

	* 🟨 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 3 _(2019-02-08 18:18:42)_

		Yup, "Lion of the Desert" is a great film. "King of the Sands" is another good film about the history and unification of Saudis over the Arab desert.

	Bitter Lake by Adam Curtis is a pretty good take. 

	* 🟨 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 12 _(2019-02-08 15:37:03)_

		I like and watch Curtis, but let’s please remember that this is solely his opinion, and not one that is uncontroversial. The things he says about Libya for instance are a bit far fetched. He has a tendency of denying individual agency to his structuralist theories of the world order.  
		
		Always watch his material with a jaundiced eye. 

	* 🟨 **[abump96](https://www.reddit.com/user/abump96)** ⬆️ 1 _(2019-02-09 04:19:22)_

	A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini (sp?) is an incredible book about three generations of girls in Afghanistan basically all the way through the 20th century.

			I managed to devour it in a short amount of time but even 10 years later I would still say it's the most depressing book I have ever read. And when I think about how strong the Taliban is now since US withdrawal I become even more depressed thinking about what would have become of the characters.

	This isnt relevant but theres a documentary called Tickling Giants on the death of freedom expression in Egypt during these past few years (because of the current dictatorship thats happening) through the eyes of one of Egypts most controversial and popular satirical news reporter, Bassem Yousef. I wholeheartedly recommend it, its incredibly captivating and struck some personal notes for me.

	Mostly scholarly texts, but some lit. as well. Someone mentioned below, but Khaled Hosseini is an excellent author,  as is Naguib Mahfouz, as for the latter I'd recommend the Cairo trilogy. I'll do my best to get back to you with some primary sources and scholarly work on pan-arabism/other. I'd also recommend Dexter Filkins' "forever war", wherein he documents as a journalist his time spent in Afghanistan and 'post-war' Iraq.

			Is Iran not in the Middle East? The history of the Iranian revolution also has a lot to say about the British and American involvement in the Middle East as well as the rise of Islamic fundamentalists in government, which op seemed to ask for. And it will help inform the current political environment if you know about Iran’s history as well as the Arab nations’. 

			* 🟦 **[ImSoBasic](https://www.reddit.com/user/ImSoBasic)** ⬆️ 4 _(2019-02-08 18:04:47)_

				It has very little to do with pan-Arab nationalism, though, and this seems to be the main thrust of the question.

				* 🟪 **[K-Zoro](https://www.reddit.com/user/K-Zoro)** ⬆️ 2 _(2019-02-08 19:05:56)_

					But not the only thrust. 

			* 🟦 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 2 _(2019-02-08 19:44:47)_

				OP specifically says that they want to learn about Pan-Arab Nationalism and Islamism which, while Persepolis is a great book, it does not really cover.

	This is a slightly outside choice, but "See No Evil" by Robert Baer. Baer was in the CIA, stationed in the Lebanon during the 1980s, and has some good insights into the role Iran played in pushing ideology on the region. He also finds Washington's tone-deaf approach to foreign policy highly problematic, so he's unlikely to have the some kind of misty eyed, patriotic wankery that his former boss, Duane "Dewey" Clarridge had in his memoir.   

	Baer's second book, "Sleeping with the Devil", was the basis for the film Syriana. It's also worth a read, about Saudi oil. Late 20th century focus though.

	Containing Arab Nationalism by Salim Yaqub is a very good book on the subject. However, I’ll just advise you that this is an academic text so it can be difficult to read. If memory serves me correctly, it mostly focuses on the Eisenhower administrations attempts to contain Arab Nationalism which was promoted by Nasser. It is also has a lot of insight on the Cold War in the Middle East.

	Arabian Sands and The Marsh Arabs by Wilfred Thesiger are fascinating accounts of time spent with Bedouin and the marsh-dwelling people of Southern Iraq respectively. They're very personal and tightly focused on the people he encountered rather than bigger picture, but they give real texture to mid-20th century history of the region.

	Samarkand by Amin Maalouf is a novel that takes place half in medieval Persia and half in the 20th century when Persia is being preyed upon by the West. I'm not sure how accurate it is but I thought it was a good starting point for finding out more.

	Naguib Mahfouz on 20th century Egypt is fantastic - the Egyptian Charles Dickens.

	Step 1) be incredibly suspicious of nationalist propaganda narratives, as they can be incredibly dishonest or omit a lot of information--or even more tricky, convince you that certain things are myths created by opposing propaganda. In the case of pan-Arab nationalism, it's incredibly difficult due to the competing "champions" of that nationalism at various points in time, as well as the fact that people who might look like "impartial" observers like the British were often very pro-Arab nationalism (like T.E. Lawrence and his associates) even though parts of the ideology were vehemently against British colonialism.  

	2) Seek sources from dedicated historians, especially ones well-associated with a society during the time period you're interested in. For example, if you want to read about ideology and movements in Iraq between WWI-WWII (a major center of pan-Arab ideology) a couple fantastic English sources are comprehensive critics of nationalist ideology like Elie Kedourie and Hanna Batatu (whose work extends past WWII). Be forewarned that T.E. Lawrence's romanticism does not tend to be celebrated in such accounts. There are, of course, countless other sources and various books constantly in the making, but it's doubtful you'll get the details.  

	3) Read about the geopolitical background during certain events as well as the details of important related wars. For example, earlier in the 19th century the fall of the Ottoman Empire was a seismic event. During WWII, the Allied defeat of the Germans at El Alamein was a critical turning point in the balance of power in the region (accordingly, pan-Arab elites aligned with the Germans against the British suffered a severe setback).

	Check out anything by Bernard Lewis. It'll be a very long read but fascinating and informative. I learned a lot of surprising stuff from him.

	* 🟨 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 6 _(2019-02-08 15:46:25)_

		Lewis' "The Crisis of Islam." A slim but damning book about how the Brits and the French divided up the Middle East after WWI with zero thought about religious, lingual or tribal allegiances, e.g. .dividing the Kurds among three countries. Hence Osama bin Laden's call to arms: Remember 1918. 

	* 🟨 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 3 _(2019-02-08 17:14:21)_

		Bernard Lewis was a known orientalist and has a very biased and skewed view of the Middle East. Read up on Edward Said's "Oreintalism" where he takes Bernard to task. Nasty man.

		* 🟧 **[racms](https://www.reddit.com/user/racms)** ⬆️ 1 _(2019-02-08 21:12:04)_

	For religious reasons, the middle east has never been a hotbed of filmmaking. AFAIK for awhile Egypt had a film industry for awhile (maybe the 1950's and 60s?) but it kind of petered out - probably because most of the world watches American movies. 

	I only *know* of these Egyptian films - they were basically not subtitled and distributed in the US. THink they were mostly musicals and romantic films and don't know if there were any historical epics

	Iran had a burst of great filmmaking but they are more 'art films' and not sure if that's what you're looking for.

	One really great film I can strongly recommend but that is only tangentially 'historical' is "Turtles Can Fly" about the plight of Kurdish children and abuses Kurds were subject to as a powerless minority in Iraq/Turkey. 

	Its possible that there have been some decent TV productions like mini series about big historical events. These things more get distributed on DVD or foreign language TV stations  and get no publicity in the US. This is definitely true for China and Korea - there may be something similar in the middle east.

	This is an awesome post. I’m actually writing my senior thesis right now on the US-Saudi relationship in the 1950s, so Arab Nationalism is a main theme. I highly recommend Containing Arab Nationalism by Salim Yaqub. This is actually my advisor’s book and it’s great. It covers how Eisenhower and John Foster Dulles were worried about Arab Nationalism leading Arab states to turn towards the Soviet Union instead of the West. Their main solution came in the form of the Eisenhower Doctrine which is the main focus of this book. You’ll learn a ton about US-Mid East relations during the period as well as a ton about Arab Nationalism.

	One of my favorite authors on the Mid East in general is James Gelvin. He’s a historian at UCLA and his book on the Modern Middle East as well as the one about Israel/Palestine are both phenomenal. 

	ALSO. You have to read the Corpse Washer by Sinan Antoon. Antoon is a professor at NYU who grew up in Iraq and came to the US sometime around the outbreak of the Gulf War. The Corpse Washer is a novel about a family in US-occupied Iraq. Though it’s a novel, you learn a ton about Iraq and the Mid East in general. I’ve got a couple other books from him that I’m excited to read but haven’t yet. Seriously though, read the Corpse Washer. Phenomenal. 

	Other good ones: William Cleveland’s book on the modern Mid East, Albert Hourani’s History of the Arab Peoples, Eugene Rogan’s books... those are all more general and sweeping histories. The Lemon Tree by Sandy Tolan is a great narrative nonfiction about Israel/Palestine.

	I highly recommend finding historical fiction set in the Middle East... preferably written by someone who knows the region. Such a great way to learn, especially if you like novels. I often like to take a great from straight up history reading and read some fiction... but it’s great to still get some nonfiction out of fiction. 

	As for Islamism, you’ve gotta watch Adam Curtis’ documentary “The Power is Nightmares.” The first part, especially, is a great primer on modern Islamism - the first part, especially, as it focuses on Sayyid Qutb who is one of the main thinkers behind the ideology. Here is a link to the documentary: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dTg4qnyUGxg

	As for a great primary source on Islamism, check out Qutb’s Milestones. It’s essentially an Islamist manifesto. Here’s a link to it: https://www.kalamullah.com/Books/Milestones%20Special%20Edition.pdf

	Hope this helps!

	I read "The House of Saud", which mainly talks about Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.  But it's a good introduction to the history of the region and the culture and thought of the region.

	There's a good history podcast which is a little more accessible. It's called the [Ottoman History Podcast ](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLnNvdW5kY2xvdWQuY29tL3VzZXJzL3NvdW5kY2xvdWQ6dXNlcnM6NjY1Mjk5MC9zb3VuZHMucnNz)

	The Promise is amazing - its all about Gaza in the present day, and in the past. Plus it has Claire Foy and Christian Cooke in it: https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-promise

	Theeb is a brilliant and hugely under seen film about a Bedouin tribe in a remote corner of the Ottoman Empire in 1916, who encounter a lost British soldier. I would say it is apolitical and is very much focused more on the intimate than the broad picture of the global region but it is highly insightful and just a really good watch.

	I really appreciated Robert Lacey's 'The Kingdom: Arabia and the house of Saud', about the rise of Saudi Arabia (including bits of the rest of the peninsula) in the first half of the century.

	The State of Africa by Martin Meredith examines all the countries in the African continent and goes over their revolutions, new governments, corruption....

	It's focused more on the continent than the Middle Eastern region but it includes North African and Middle Eastern countries. One of the first chapters talks about Egypt. Honestly, it's a good examination of the formation of countries we don't learn enough about but instead just call 'poor' and 'undeveloped' and 'shitholes' without context.

	Empire of Sand: How Britain Made the Middle East by Walter Reid is an excellent intro read. Very easy to get through but it covers a lot of the basics on not only Islam but the introduction of Zionism and Israel into the region and how that has effected the stability of the region. Looking into the colonial empires (Britain and France mainly) and how they shaped the region is a really interesting subject.

	From Beirut to Jerusalem

	Book by Thomas Friedman

	It does talk about Isreal and it concentrates a bit more on the countries and geography of the middle east than Islam itself.. but still a very interesting and well-written look at the culture and history of the region.

	Hourani and Bernard Lewis are good authors to start with. Peter Manfield's A History of the Middle East is good.

	John Calvert did a good biography on Sayyid Qutb who is a very important figure when talking about the evolution of Islamism in the 20th Century. 

	I have lists of other authors and articles that are good to look at, especially when discussing the rise of Islamism. I'll edit them in later but you might not be able to get them unless you have access to academic databases.

	I read this a few years ago.

	Iirc the conculsion was that they were unwilling to accept any change because everything was already perfect in islamic culture. They would use egg timers instead of adopting clocks was one example i remember.

	Colonizing Egypt by Timothy Mitchell and Orientalism are the two books which most come to mind when looking into the cultural history of the Middle East/Western perceptions of the Middle East.

	Before going any further, you need to read Edward Said; orientalism 

	Films such as Lawrence of Arabia fit in with the wider western perspective of the Middle East &amp; it’s citizens being backward compared to those in the west. Ive found these views are prominent in most of the literature about the Middle East post description de l’egypte

	There was a mini-series in the Fall called *The Little Drummer Girl* about a British woman who tries to infiltrate a Palestinian terrorist cell in the 1970s, based on a book by John le Carré. (There also was a movie made from it in the 1980s starring Diane Keaton.) I'm not sure how the mini-series was received, but the book got great reviews.

		Its a good film, but i believe many Pakistanis didnt like how there leader was shown in a negative light. And i think Sikhs just dont like him.   And this was probably because of stuff he said or did.
