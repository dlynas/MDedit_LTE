### Risk aversion\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Risk aversion")\]

After getting his Ph.D. from [M.I.T.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.I.T. "M.I.T.") in 1967, Stiglitz co-authored one of his first papers with [Michael Rothschild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Rothschild "Michael Rothschild") for the Journal of Economic Theory in 1970.<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> Stiglitz and Rothschild built upon works by economists such as [Robert Solow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Solow "Robert Solow") on the concept of [risk aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_aversion_(psychology) "Risk aversion (psychology)").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (May 2020)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Stiglitz and Rothschild showed three plausible definitions of a variable X being 'more variable' than a variable Y were all equivalent – Y being equal to X plus noise, every risk-averse agent preferring Y to X, and Y having more weight in its tails, and that none of these were always consistent with X having a higher statistical variance than Y – a commonly used definition at the time. In a second paper, they analyzed the theoretical consequences of risk aversion in various circumstances, such as an individual's savings decisions and a firm's production decisions.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

### Henry George theorem\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Henry George theorem")\]

Stiglitz made early contributions to a theory of public finance stating that an optimal supply of local [public goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_goods "Public goods") can be funded entirely through [capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_capture "Value capture") of the [land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_(economics) "Land (economics)") [rents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_rent "Economic rent") generated by those goods (when population distributions are optimal). Stiglitz dubbed this the '[Henry George theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_George_theorem "Henry George theorem")' in reference to the radical [classical economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_economist "Classical economist") [Henry George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_George "Henry George") who famously advocated for [land value tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax "Land value tax"). The explanation behind Stiglitz's finding is that rivalry for public goods takes place geographically, so competition for access to any beneficial public good will increase land values by at least as much as its outlay cost. Furthermore, Stiglitz shows that a [single tax on rents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism "Georgism") is necessary to provide the optimal supply of local public investment. Stiglitz also shows how the theorem could be used to find the optimal size of a city or firm.<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup>

### Information asymmetry\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Information asymmetry")\]

Stiglitz's most famous research was on [screening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(economics) "Screening (economics)"), a technique used by one economic agent to extract otherwise private information from another. It was for this contribution to the theory of [information asymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry "Information asymmetry") that he shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics<sup id="cite_ref-NOBEL1_3-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-NOBEL1-3">[3]</a></sup> with [George A. Akerlof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_A._Akerlof "George A. Akerlof") and [A. Michael Spence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._Michael_Spence "A. Michael Spence") in 2001 "for laying the foundations for [the theory of markets with asymmetric information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry "Information asymmetry")".

Much of Stiglitz's work on [information economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_economics "Information economics") demonstrates situations in which incomplete information prevents markets from achieving social efficiency. His paper with [Andrew Weiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Weiss_(economist) "Andrew Weiss (economist)") showed that if banks use interest rates to infer information about borrowers' types (adverse selection effect), or to encourage their actions following borrowing (incentive effect), then credit will be rationed below the optimal level, even in a competitive market.<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> Stiglitz and [Rothschild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Rothschild "Michael Rothschild") showed that in an insurance market, firms have an incentive to undermine a 'pooling equilibrium', where all agents are offered the same full-insurance policy, by offering cheaper partial insurance that would only be attractive to the low-risk types, meaning that a competitive market can only achieve partial coverage of agents.<sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup> Stiglitz and [Grossman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanford_J._Grossman "Sanford J. Grossman") showed that trivially small information acquisition costs prevent financial markets from achieving complete informational efficiency, since agents will have an incentive to free-ride on others' information acquisition, and acquire this information indirectly by observing market prices.<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup>

### Monopolistic competition\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Monopolistic competition")\]

Stiglitz, together with [Avinash Dixit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avinash_Dixit "Avinash Dixit"), created a tractable model of [monopolistic competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixit%E2%80%93Stiglitz_model "Dixit–Stiglitz model") that was an alternative to traditional [perfect-competition models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition "Perfect competition") of [general equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_equilibrium_theory "General equilibrium theory"). They showed that in the presence of increasing returns to scale, the entry of firms is socially too small.<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> The model was extended to show that when consumers have a preference for diversity, entry can be socially too large. The modeling approach was used by [Paul Krugman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krugman "Paul Krugman") in his analysis of the non-comparative advantage trading patterns.<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup>

### Shapiro–Stiglitz efficiency wage model\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Shapiro–Stiglitz efficiency wage model")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Efficiency_wage_Shapiro_Stiglitz.svg/330px-Efficiency_wage_Shapiro_Stiglitz.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Efficiency_wage_Shapiro_Stiglitz.svg)

In the [Shapiro–Stiglitz model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro%E2%80%93Stiglitz_model "Shapiro–Stiglitz model") of efficiency wages, workers are paid at a level that dissuades shirking. This prevents wages from dropping to market clearing levels. Full employment cannot be achieved because workers would shirk if they were not threatened with the possibility of unemployment. Because of this, the curve for the no-shirking condition (labeled NSC) goes to infinity at full employment.

Stiglitz also did research on [efficiency wages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_wages "Efficiency wages"), and helped create what became known as the "Shapiro–Stiglitz model" to explain why there is unemployment even in equilibrium, why wages are not bid down sufficiently by job seekers (in the absence of minimum wages) so that everyone who wants a job finds one, and to question whether the [neoclassical paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_economics "Neoclassical economics") could explain [involuntary unemployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_unemployment "Involuntary unemployment").<sup id="cite_ref-SHAPIROSTGLTZARTCL_50-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-SHAPIROSTGLTZARTCL-50">[50]</a></sup> An answer to these puzzles was proposed by [Shapiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Shapiro "Carl Shapiro") and Stiglitz in 1984: "Unemployment is driven by the information structure of employment".<sup id="cite_ref-SHAPIROSTGLTZARTCL_50-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-SHAPIROSTGLTZARTCL-50">[50]</a></sup> Two basic observations undergird their analysis:

1.  Unlike other forms of capital, humans can choose their level of effort.
2.  It is costly for firms to determine how much effort workers are exerting.

Some key implications of this model are:<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-SHAPIROSTGLTZMATH_52-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-SHAPIROSTGLTZMATH-52">[52]</a></sup>

1.  Wages do not fall enough during recessions to prevent unemployment from rising. If the demand for labour falls, this lowers wages. But because wages have fallen, the probability of 'shirking' (workers not exerting effort) has risen. If employment levels are to be maintained, through a sufficient lowering of wages, workers will be less productive than before through the shirking effect. As a consequence, in the model, wages do not fall enough to maintain employment levels at the previous state, because firms want to avoid excessive shirking by their workers. So, unemployment must rise during recessions, because wages are kept 'too high'.
2.  Possible corollary: Wage sluggishness. Moving from one private cost of hiring (w∗) to another private cost of hiring (w∗∗) will require each firm to repeatedly re-optimize wages in response to shifting [unemployment rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment "Unemployment"). Firms cannot cut wages until unemployment rises sufficiently (a coordination problem).

The outcome is never [Pareto efficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency "Pareto efficiency").

1.  Each firm employs too few workers, because the cost of employing too many workers would be faced by the firm alone, while the cost of unemployment is shared by the firm and its competitors, indeed it is shared by all firms that pay taxes in the country. This means that firms do not "internalize" the "external" cost of unemployment – they do not factor how large-scale unemployment harms society when assessing their own costs. This leads to a negative externality as marginal social cost exceeds the firm's marginal cost (MSC = Firm's Private Marginal Cost + Marginal External Cost of increased social unemployment)<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="The text near this tag may need clarification or removal of jargon. (January 2010)">clarification needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
2.  There are also [positive externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality "Externality"): each firm increases the asset value of unemployment for all other firms when they hire during recessions. By creating hypercompetitive labor markets, all firms (the winners when laborers compete) experience an increase in value. However, this effect of increased valuation is very unapparent, because the first problem (the negative externality of sub-optimal hiring) clearly dominates since the 'natural rate of unemployment' is always too high.

### Practical implications of Stiglitz's theories\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Practical implications of Stiglitz's theories")\]

The practical implications of Stiglitz's work in [political economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_economy "Political economy") and their [economic policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy "Economic policy") implications have been subject to debate.<sup id="cite_ref-DISENSUS_53-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-DISENSUS-53">[53]</a></sup> Stiglitz himself has evolved his political-economic discourse over time.<sup id="cite_ref-DEBATE2_54-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-DEBATE2-54">[54]</a></sup>

> Once incomplete and imperfect information is introduced, Chicago-school defenders of the market system cannot sustain descriptive claims of the Pareto efficiency of the real world. Thus, Stiglitz's use of rational-expectations equilibrium assumptions to achieve a more realistic understanding of capitalism than is usual among rational-expectations theorists leads, paradoxically, to the conclusion that capitalism deviates from the model in a way that justifies state action – socialism – as a remedy.<sup id="cite_ref-BOETTKE_55-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-BOETTKE-55">[55]</a></sup>

> The effect of Stiglitz's influence is to make economics even more presumptively interventionist than Samuelson preferred. Samuelson treated market failure as an exception to the general rule of efficient markets. But the Greenwald-Stiglitz theorem posits market failure as the norm, establishing "that government could potentially almost always improve upon the market's resource allocation." And the Sappington-Stiglitz theorem "establishes that an ideal government could do better running an enterprise itself than it could through privatization"<sup id="cite_ref-SAPPINGTON_56-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-SAPPINGTON-56">[56]</a></sup>

As David L. Prychitko discusses in his "critique" to _Whither Socialism?_, he thought that Stiglitz seems generally correct,<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

[Néstor Kirchner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%A9stor_Kirchner "Néstor Kirchner") (_right_) with Joseph Stiglitz

Stiglitz joined the [Clinton Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Bill_Clinton "Presidency of Bill Clinton") in 1993,<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> serving first as a member during 1993–1995, and was then appointed Chairman of the [Council of Economic Advisers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Economic_Advisers "Council of Economic Advisers") on June 28, 1995.<sup id="cite_ref-NOBEL1_3-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-NOBEL1-3">[3]</a></sup>

Stiglitz always had a poor relationship with Treasury Secretary [Lawrence Summers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers "Lawrence Summers").<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup> In 2000, Summers successfully petitioned for Stiglitz's removal, supposedly in exchange for World Bank President [James Wolfensohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wolfensohn "James Wolfensohn")'s re-appointment – an exchange that Wolfensohn denies took place. Whether Summers ever made such a blunt demand is questionable – Wolfensohn claims he would "have told him to \*\*\* himself".<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup>

Stiglitz resigned from the World Bank in January 2000, a month before his term expired.<sup id="cite_ref-DANGEROUS_61-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-DANGEROUS-61">[61]</a></sup> The [Bank's president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank"), James Wolfensohn, announced Stiglitz's resignation in November 1999 and also announced that Stiglitz would stay on as Special Advisor to the President, and would chair the search committee for a successor.

> Joseph E. Stiglitz said today \[Nov. 24, 1999\] that he would resign as the World Bank's chief economist after using the position for nearly three years to raise pointed questions about the effectiveness of conventional approaches to helping poor countries.<sup id="cite_ref-RESIGN_62-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-RESIGN-62">[62]</a></sup>

In this role, he continued criticism of the IMF, and, by implication, the US Treasury Department. In April 2000, in an article for _[The New Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Republic "The New Republic")_, he wrote:

> They'll say the IMF is arrogant. They'll say the IMF doesn't really listen to the developing countries it is supposed to help. They'll say the IMF is secretive and insulated from democratic accountability. They'll say the IMF's economic 'remedies' often make things worse – turning slowdowns into recessions and recessions into depressions. And they'll have a point. I was chief economist at the World Bank from 1996 until last November, during the gravest global economic crisis in a half-century. I saw how the IMF, in tandem with the U.S. Treasury Department, responded. And I was appalled.

Stiglitz's protector-of-sorts at the World Bank, Wolfensohn, had privately empathised with Stiglitz's views, but was worried for his second term, which Summers had threatened to veto.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (October 2008)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director of the IMF, called a special staff meeting and informed the gathering that Wolfensohn had agreed to fire Stiglitz.

### Greek debt crisis\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Greek debt crisis")\]

In 2010, Stiglitz acted as an advisor to the [Greek government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Greece "Government of Greece") during the [Greek debt crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_debt_crisis "Greek debt crisis"). He appeared on [Bloomberg TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Television "Bloomberg Television") for an interview on the risks of Greece defaulting, in which he stated that he was very confident that Greece would not default. He went on to say that Greece was under "speculative attack" and though it had "short-term liquidity problems ... and would benefit from Solidarity Bonds", the country was "on track to meet its obligations".<sup id="cite_ref-68"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup>

The next day, during a BBC interview, Stiglitz stated that "there's no problem of Greece or Spain meeting their interest payments". He argued nonetheless, that it would be desirable and needed for all of Europe to make a clear statement of belief in social solidarity and that they "stand behind Greece". Confronted with the statement: "Greece's difficulty is that the magnitude of debt is far greater than the capacity of the economy to service", Stiglitz replied, "That's rather absurd".<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

### Scotland\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Scotland")\]

Since March 2012, Stiglitz has been a member of the [Scottish Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government "Scottish Government")'s Fiscal Commission Working Group, which oversees the work to establish a fiscal and macroeconomic framework for an [independent Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence "Scottish independence") on behalf of the Scottish [Council of Economic Advisers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Economic_Advisers_(Scotland) "Council of Economic Advisers (Scotland)"). Together with Professors [Andrew Hughes Hallett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Hughes_Hallett "Andrew Hughes Hallett"), Sir [James Mirrlees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mirrlees "James Mirrlees") and [Frances Ruane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Ruane "Frances Ruane"), Stiglitz will "advise on the establishment of a credible Fiscal Commission which entrenches financial responsibility and ensures market confidence".<sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup>

## Economic views\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Economic views")\]

### Market efficiency\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Market efficiency")\]

For Stiglitz, [there is no such thing as an invisible hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand#Joseph_E._Stiglitz "Invisible hand"), in the sense that free markets lead to efficiency as if guided by unseen forces.<sup id="cite_ref-NOTTHERE_77-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-NOTTHERE-77">[77]</a></sup> According to Stiglitz:<sup id="cite_ref-HAND1_78-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-HAND1-78">[78]</a></sup>

> Whenever there are "[externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality "Externality")" – where the actions of an individual have impacts on others for which they do not pay or for which they are not compensated – markets will not work well. But recent research has shown that these externalities are pervasive, whenever there is imperfect information or imperfect risk markets – that is always. The real debate today is about finding the right balance between the market and government. Both are needed. They can each complement each other. This balance will differ from time to time and place to place.

In an interview in 2007, Stiglitz explained further:<sup id="cite_ref-PACT_79-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-PACT-79">[79]</a></sup>

> The theories that I (and others) helped develop explained why unfettered markets often not only do not lead to social justice, but do not even produce efficient outcomes. Interestingly, there has been no intellectual challenge to the refutation of Adam Smith's invisible hand: individuals and firms, in the pursuit of their [self-interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-interest "Self-interest"), are not necessarily, or in general, led as if by an invisible hand, to economic efficiency.

The preceding claim is based on Stiglitz's 1986 paper, "Externalities in Economies with Imperfect Information and [Incomplete Markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_Markets "Incomplete Markets")",<sup id="cite_ref-GrSt1986_80-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-GrSt1986-80">[80]</a></sup> which describes a general methodology to deal with externalities and for calculating [optimal corrective taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_tax "Optimal tax") in a general equilibrium context.

Problems of information are central to understanding not only market economics but also political economy, and in the last section of this lecture, I explore some of the implications of information imperfections for political processes.

### Support for anti-austerity movement in Spain\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Support for anti-austerity movement in Spain")\]

On July 25, 2011, Stiglitz participated in the "I Foro Social del 15M" organized in [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid "Madrid") (Spain) expressing his support for the [anti-austerity movement in Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-austerity_movement_in_Spain "Anti-austerity movement in Spain").<sup id="cite_ref-15M_SPEECH_38-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-15M_SPEECH-38">[38]</a></sup> During an informal speech, he made a brief review of some of the problems in Europe and in the United States, the serious unemployment rate and the situation in Greece. "This is an opportunity for economic contribution social measures", argued Stiglitz, who made a speech about the way authorities are handling the political exit to the crisis. He encouraged those present to respond to the ideas with good ideas. "This does not work, you have to change it", he said.

### Criticism of rating agencies\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Criticism of rating agencies")\]

Stiglitz has been critical of [rating agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_(credit_rating_agencies) "Big Three (credit rating agencies)"), describing them as the "key culprit" in the financial crisis, noting "they were the party that performed the alchemy that converted the securities from F-rated to A-rated. The banks could not have done what they did without the complicity of the rating agencies."<sup id="cite_ref-Neate1_83-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-Neate1-83">[83]</a></sup>

Stiglitz co-authored a paper with [Peter Orszag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Orszag "Peter Orszag") in 2002 titled "Implications of the New Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Risk-Based Capital Standard" where they stated "on the basis of historical experience, the risk to the government from a potential default on GSE debt is effectively zero." However, "the risk-based capital standard ... may fail to reflect the probability of another Great Depression-like scenario."<sup id="cite_ref-fanniemae_84-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-fanniemae-84">[84]</a></sup>

### Criticism of Trans-Pacific Partnership and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Criticism of Trans-Pacific Partnership and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership")\]

Stiglitz warned that the [Trans-Pacific Partnership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership "Trans-Pacific Partnership") (TPP) presented "grave risks" and it "serves the interests of the wealthiest."<sup id="cite_ref-85"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-NYT-20140315_86-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-NYT-20140315-86">[86]</a></sup>

Stiglitz also opposed the [Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_Trade_and_Investment_Partnership "Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership") (TTIP) trade deal between the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union") (EU) and the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), and has argued that the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") should consider [its withdrawal from the EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union") in [the 2016 referendum on the matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum "2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum") if TTIP passes, saying that "the [strictures](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stricture "wikt:stricture") imposed by TTIP would be sufficiently averse to the functioning of government that it would make me think over again about whether membership of the EU was a good idea".<sup id="cite_ref-87"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-88"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-88">[88]</a></sup>

### Regulation\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Regulation")\]

Stiglitz argues that relying solely on business self-interest as the means of achieving the well-being of society and [economic efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency "Economic efficiency") is misleading, and that instead "What is needed is stronger norms, clearer understandings of what is acceptable – and what is not – and stronger laws and regulations to ensure that those that do not behave in ways that are consistent with these norms are held accountable".<sup id="cite_ref-89"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup>

### Land value tax (Georgism)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Land value tax (Georgism)")\]

Stiglitz argues that [land value tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax "Land value tax") would improve the efficiency and equity of agricultural economies. Stiglitz believes that societies should rely on a generalized [Henry George principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism "Georgism") to finance public goods, protect natural resources, improve land use, and reduce the burden of rents and taxes on the poor while increasing productive capital formation. Stiglitz advocates taxing "natural resource rents at as close to 100 percent as possible" and that a corollary of this principle is that polluters should be taxed for "activities that generate negative externalities."<sup id="cite_ref-90"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup> Stiglitz therefore asserts that land value taxation is even better than its famous advocate [Henry George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_George "Henry George") thought.<sup id="cite_ref-91"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-91">[91]</a></sup>

### Views on the eurozone\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Views on the eurozone")\]

In a September 2016 interview Stiglitz stated that "the cost of keeping the Eurozone together probably exceeds the cost of breaking it up."<sup id="cite_ref-92"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup>

### Views on free trade\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Views on free trade")\]

#### Advice for the eurozone countries\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Advice for the eurozone countries")\]

In the 1990s, he wrote that "countries in North America and Europe should eliminate all tariffs and quotas (protectionist measures)".<sup id="cite_ref-93"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-93">[93]</a></sup> He now advises the [eurozone countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone "Eurozone") to control their trade balance with Germany by means of export/[import certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Import_certificates "Import certificates") or "trade chits" (a protectionist measure).<sup id="cite_ref-94"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-95"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-96"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup>

Citing Keynesian theory, he explains that trade surpluses are harmful: "[John Maynard Keynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes "John Maynard Keynes") pointed out that surpluses lead to weak global aggregate demand – countries running surpluses exert a "negative externality" on trading partners. Indeed, Keynes believed it was surplus countries, far more than those in deficit, that posed a threat to global prosperity; he went so far as to advocate a tax on surplus countries".<sup id="cite_ref-:0_97-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-:0-97">[97]</a></sup> From the beginning of 1930, Keynes stopped believing in free trade, denounced the theory of [comparative advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage "Comparative advantage") (the basis of free trade) and adhered to protectionism.<sup id="cite_ref-J.M._Keynes,_free_trade_and_protectionism_98-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-J.M._Keynes,_free_trade_and_protectionism-98">[98]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-National_Self-Sufficiency_99-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-National_Self-Sufficiency-99">[99]</a></sup>

Stiglitz writes: "Germany's surplus means that the rest of Europe is in deficit. And the fact that these countries import more than they export contributes to the weakness of their economies". He thinks that surplus countries are getting richer at the expense of deficit countries. He notes that the euro is the cause of this deficit and that as the trade deficit declines GDP would rise and unemployment would fall: "The euro system means that Germany's exchange rate cannot increase compared to other euro area members. If the exchange rate were to rise, Germany would have more difficulty exporting and its economic model, based on strong exports, would cease. At the same time, the rest of Europe would export more, GDP would rise and unemployment would fall".<sup id="cite_ref-:0_97-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-:0-97">[97]</a></sup>

He also thinks that the rest of the world should impose a carbon-adjustment tax (a protectionist measure) on American exports that do not comply with global standard.<sup id="cite_ref-100"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-100">[100]</a></sup>

Joseph Stiglitz

Contrary to Keynesian theory and these analyses on the eurozone, he argues that the United States should not rebalance the trade account, and that the country can no longer apply protectionist measures to protect or recreate the well-paying manufacturing jobs, saying: "The very Americans who have been among the losers of globalization stand to be among the losers of a reversal of globalization. History cannot be put into reverse".<sup id="cite_ref-:1_101-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-:1-101">[101]</a></sup>

On the other hand, he admits that as trade deficit declines, "GDP would rise and unemployment would fall", further stating: "...the fact that these countries are importing more than they are exporting contributes to their weak economies."<sup id="cite_ref-:0_97-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-:0-97">[97]</a></sup> He also notes that trade deficit is correlated with loss of manufacturing jobs: the increase in the "value of the dollar will lead to larger trade deficits and fewer manufacturing jobs".<sup id="cite_ref-:4_102-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-:4-102">[102]</a></sup>

Contrary to most economics historians who argue that tariffs played only a minor if any role in the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression"),<sup id="cite_ref-103"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-103">[103]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-104"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-104">[104]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-105"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-105">[105]</a></sup> Stiglitz, to convince the United States not to use protectionist policies, says that tariffs would be harmful to the United States economy today because it contributed to the Great Depression: "Following that, U.S. exports fell by some 50 percent—contributing to our Great Depression".<sup id="cite_ref-:1_101-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-:1-101">[101]</a></sup>

He denounces the "trickle-down" policies of liberalism and [neoliberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism "Neoliberalism") (_[laissez-faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire "Laissez-faire")_)<sup id="cite_ref-106"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-106">[106]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-107"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-107">[107]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:2_108-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-:2-108">[108]</a></sup> However, he calls for lowering trade barriers and promoting free trade (policy of deregulation of foreign trade which is part of the _laissez-faire_ economic model).<sup id="cite_ref-109"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-109">[109]</a></sup>

According to him, it is not China (which has a large trade surplus) that makes "trade war", but the United States (which has a large trade deficit).<sup id="cite_ref-:1_101-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-:1-101">[101]</a></sup> He advises China to take sanctions against the United States<sup id="cite_ref-:1_101-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-:1-101">[101]</a></sup> 'where it hurts economically and politically' if the US tries to raise tariffs to protect its industry, saying: "For example, cutbacks in purchases by China will lead to more unemployment in congressional districts that are vulnerable, influential, or both.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_101-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-:1-101">[101]</a></sup> ... China can retaliate anywhere it chooses, such as by using trade restrictions to target jobs in the congressional districts of those who support US tariffs.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_108-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-:2-108">[108]</a></sup> ... China may be more effective in targeting its retaliation to cause acute political pain. ... It's anybody's guess who can stand the pain better. Will it be the US, where ordinary citizens have already suffered for so long, or China, which, despite troubled times, has managed to generate growth in excess of 6%?<sup id="cite_ref-:3_110-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-:3-110">[110]</a></sup>"

Stiglitz does not want the United States to stop free trade. According to him, if China limits globalization, it will not hurt them, but if the United States stops with the process of free trade, it will be harmful. About China, according to him, if China depends less on [economic globalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_globalization "Economic globalization"), it will not be negative for the country.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_101-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-:1-101">[101]</a></sup> He writes that the decline in exports from China to the U.S. may not "hurt them more than it hurt us" because "China's government has far more control over the country's economy than our government has over ours; and it is moving from export dependence to a model of growth driven by domestic demand." Regarding the United States, he writes the opposite and advice to apply the opposite of the Keynesian theory of trade deficits seen earlier:<sup id="cite_ref-:0_97-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-:0-97">[97]</a></sup> "Walking away from globalization may reduce our imports, but it will also reduce exports in tandem. And, almost surely, jobs will be destroyed faster than they will be created: there may even be fewer net manufacturing jobs". "\[The\] erection of barriers to trade and the movement of people and ideas more likely than not will be one in which the U.S. almost surely will lose."<sup id="cite_ref-:1_101-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-:1-101">[101]</a></sup>

In early 2017, he wrote that "the American middle class is indeed the loser of [globalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization "Globalization")" (the diminution of international trade regulations as well as tariffs, taxes) and "China, with its large emerging middle class, is among the big beneficiaries of globalization". "Thanks to globalisation, in terms of purchasing-power parity, China actually has already become the largest economy in the world in September 2015".<sup id="cite_ref-:1_101-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-:1-101">[101]</a></sup> However, contrary to what he wrote earlier, he later argued in February 2017 that the fall in wages and the disappearance of well-paid jobs in the United States, are not due to free trade or globalisation, but rather are inevitable collateral damage to the march of economic progress and technological innovation: "The United States can only push for advanced manufacturing, which requires higher skill sets and employs fewer people. Rising inequality, meanwhile, will continue ...".<sup id="cite_ref-:2_108-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-:2-108">[108]</a></sup> In addition, on December 5, 2017, contrary to what he wrote earlier, he wrote that the drop in wages in the United States is due to the actions of multinational companies rather than the globalisation and the trade account imbalances between countries caused by free trade: "It was an agenda written by and for large multinational companies, at the expense of workers".<sup id="cite_ref-:4_102-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-:4-102">[102]</a></sup>

In 2016, he said he believes that the economic situation of the United States is critical: "As the economists Anne Case and [Angus Deaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Deaton "Angus Deaton") showed in their study published in December 2015, life expectancy among middle-age white Americans is declining, as rates of suicides, drug use, and alcoholism increase. A year later, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that life expectancy for the country as a whole has declined for the first time in more than 20 years."<sup id="cite_ref-:2_108-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-:2-108">[108]</a></sup> ... With the incomes of the bottom 90% having stagnated for close to a third of a century (and declining for a significant proportion), the health data simply confirmed that things were not going well for swaths of the country".<sup id="cite_ref-:3_110-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-:3-110">[110]</a></sup>

### Green economy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Green economy")\]

Stiglitz has called for a transition to a [green economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_economy "Green economy").<sup id="cite_ref-111"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-111">[111]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-112"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-112">[112]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-113"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-113">[113]</a></sup> He supported the [Green New Deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_New_Deal "Green New Deal"). In 2019, he wrote that "The Green New Deal would stimulate demand, ensuring that all available resources were used; and the transition to the green economy would likely usher in a new boom. Trump's focus on the industries of the past, like coal, is strangling the much more sensible move to wind and solar power. More jobs by far will be created in [renewable energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy "Renewable energy") than will be lost in coal."<sup id="cite_ref-Climate_change-Stiglitz_114-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-Climate_change-Stiglitz-114">[114]</a></sup> Stiglitz described the [climate crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_crisis "Climate crisis") as humanity's [World War III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_III "World War III").<sup id="cite_ref-Climate_change-Stiglitz_114-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-Climate_change-Stiglitz-114">[114]</a></sup>

### Views on taxation\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Views on taxation")\]

Stiglitz maintained the super-rich should pay taxes up to 70% to help deal with increasing inequality. Stiglitz stated a worldwide income tax rate of 70% on biggest earners "would clearly make sense". Stiglitz maintained society would become more egalitarian and cohesive. Stiglitz said a wealth taxes on fortunes acquired during many generations would have a larger influence. Stiglitz maintains most billionaires acquired much of their wealth through luck. He maintains [Elizabeth Warren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren "Elizabeth Warren") proposing a 2% tax for people with assets of over $50 million and 3% on those with over $1 billion was "very reasonable" and would raise significant revenues that could improve some United States problems.<sup id="cite_ref-115"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-115">[115]</a></sup>

## Books\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Books")\]

Along with his technical economic publications (over 300 technical articles), Stiglitz is the author of books on issues from patent law to abuses in international trade.

### \[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Whither Socialism? (1994)")\]

_[Whither Socialism?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whither_Socialism%3F "Whither Socialism?")_ is based on Stiglitz's Wicksell Lectures, presented at the [Stockholm School of Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_School_of_Economics "Stockholm School of Economics") in 1990 and presents a summary of [information economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_economics "Information economics") and the theory of markets with imperfect information and imperfect competition, as well as being a critique of both free market and market socialist approaches (see Roemer critique, op. cit.). Stiglitz explains how the [neoclassical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_economics "Neoclassical economics"), or [Walrasian model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walrasian_model "Walrasian model") ("Walrasian economics" refers to the result of the process which has given birth to a formal representation of [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith "Adam Smith")'s notion of the "invisible hand", along the lines put forward by [Léon Walras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9on_Walras "Léon Walras") and encapsulated in the general equilibrium model of [Arrow–Debreu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%E2%80%93Debreu_model "Arrow–Debreu model")), may have wrongly encouraged the belief that [market socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_socialism "Market socialism") could work. Stiglitz proposes an alternative model, based on the [information economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_economics "Information economics") established by the Greenwald–Stiglitz theorems.

One of the reasons Stiglitz sees for the critical failing in the standard [neoclassical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_economics "Neoclassical economics"), on which [market socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_socialism "Market socialism") was built, is its failure to consider the problems that arise from lack of perfect information and from the costs of acquiring information. He also identifies problems arising from its assumptions concerning completeness.<sup id="cite_ref-ZAPIA_116-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-ZAPIA-116">[116]</a></sup>

### _Globalization and Its Discontents_ (2002)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Globalization and Its Discontents (2002)")\]

In _[Globalization and Its Discontents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization_and_Its_Discontents "Globalization and Its Discontents")_, Stiglitz argues that what are often called "developing economies" are, in fact, not developing at all, and puts much of the blame on the IMF.

Stiglitz stresses: "Recent advances in economic theory" (in part referring to his own work) "have shown that whenever information is imperfect and markets are incomplete, which is to say always, and especially in developing countries, then the invisible hand works most imperfectly." As a result, Stiglitz continues, governments can improve the outcome by well-chosen interventions. Stiglitz argues that when families and firms seek to buy too little compared to what the economy can produce, governments can fight recessions and depressions by using expansionary monetary and fiscal policies to spur the demand for goods and services. At the microeconomic level, governments can regulate banks and other financial institutions to keep them sound. They can also use tax policy to steer investment into more productive industries and trade policies to allow new industries to mature to the point at which they can survive foreign competition. And governments can use a variety of devices, ranging from job creation to manpower training to welfare assistance, to put unemployed labor back to work and cushion human hardship.

Stiglitz argues that the IMF has done great damage through the economic policies it has prescribed that countries must follow in order to qualify for IMF loans, or for loans from banks and other private-sector lenders that look to the IMF to indicate whether a borrower is creditworthy. The organization and its officials, he argues, have ignored the implications of incomplete information, inadequate markets, and unworkable institutions – all of which are especially characteristic of newly developing countries. As a result, Stiglitz argues, the IMF has often called for policies that conform to textbook economics but do not make sense for the countries to which the IMF is recommending them. Stiglitz seeks to show that these policies have been disastrous for the countries that have followed them.

### _The Roaring Nineties_ (2003)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=33 "Edit section: The Roaring Nineties (2003)")\]

_The Roaring Nineties_ is Stiglitz's analysis of the boom and bust of the 1990s. Presented from an insider's point of view, firstly as chair of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors, and later as chief economist of the World Bank, it continues his argument on how misplaced faith in free-market ideology led to the global economic issues of today, with a perceptive focus on US policies.

### _Fair Trade for All_ (2005)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=35 "Edit section: Fair Trade for All (2005)")\]

In _Fair Trade for All_, authors Stiglitz and [Andrew Charlton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Charlton_(politician) "Andrew Charlton (politician)") argue that it is important to make the trading world more development friendly.<sup id="cite_ref-117"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-117">[117]</a></sup> The idea is put forth that the present regime of tariffs and agricultural subsidies is dominated by the interests of former colonial powers and needs to change. The removal of the bias toward the developed world will be beneficial to both developing and developed nations. The developing world is in need of assistance, and this can only be achieved when developed nations abandon mercantilist based priorities and work towards a more liberal world trade regime.<sup id="cite_ref-118"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-118">[118]</a></sup>

### _Making Globalization Work_ (2006)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=36 "Edit section: Making Globalization Work (2006)")\]

_[Making Globalization Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_Globalization_Work "Making Globalization Work")_ surveys the inequities of the global economy, and the mechanisms by which developed countries exert an excessive influence over developing nations. Dr. Stiglitz argues that through tariffs, subsidies, an over-complex patent system and pollution, the world is being both economically and politically destabilised. Stiglitz argues that strong, transparent institutions are needed to address these problems. He shows how an examination of incomplete markets can make corrective government policies desirable.

Stiglitz is an exception to the general pro-globalisation view of professional economists, according to economist [Martin Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Wolf "Martin Wolf").<sup id="cite_ref-preface_119-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-preface-119">[119]</a></sup> Stiglitz argues that economic opportunities are not widely enough available, that financial crises are too costly and too frequent, and that the rich countries have done too little to address these problems. _Making Globalization Work_<sup id="cite_ref-120"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-120">[120]</a></sup> has sold more than two million copies.

### _Stability with Growth_ (2006)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=37 "Edit section: Stability with Growth (2006)")\]

In _Stability with Growth: Macroeconomics, Liberalization and Development_, Stiglitz, [José Antonio Ocampo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Antonio_Ocampo "José Antonio Ocampo") (United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, until 2007), Shari Spiegel (managing director, Initiative for Policy Dialogue – IPD), [Ricardo Ffrench-Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo_Ffrench-Davis "Ricardo Ffrench-Davis") (Main Adviser, Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean – [ECLAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECLAC "ECLAC")) and [Deepak Nayyar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepak_Nayyar "Deepak Nayyar") (Vice Chancellor, University of Delhi) discuss the current debates on macroeconomics, capital market liberalization and development, and develop a new framework within which one can assess alternative policies. They explain their belief that the [Washington Consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Consensus "Washington Consensus") has advocated narrow goals for development (with a focus on price stability) and prescribed too few policy instruments (emphasizing monetary and fiscal policies), and places unwarranted faith in the role of markets. The new framework focuses on real stability and long-term sustainable and equitable growth, offers a variety of non-standard ways to stabilize the economy and promote growth, and accepts that market imperfections necessitate government interventions. Policy-makers have pursued stabilization goals with little concern for growth consequences, while trying to increase growth through structural reforms focused on improving economic efficiency. Moreover, structural policies, such as capital market liberalization, have had major consequences for economic stability. This book challenges these policies by arguing that stabilization policy has important consequences for long-term growth and has often been implemented with adverse consequences. The first part of the book introduces the key questions and looks at the objectives of economic policy from different perspectives. The third part presents a similar analysis for capital market liberalization.

### _The Three Trillion Dollar War_ (2008)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=38 "Edit section: The Three Trillion Dollar War (2008)")\]

_[The Three Trillion Dollar War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Trillion_Dollar_War "The Three Trillion Dollar War")_ (co-authored with [Linda Bilmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Bilmes "Linda Bilmes")) examines the full cost of the Iraq War, including many hidden costs. The book also discusses the extent to which these costs will be imposed for many years to come, paying special attention to the enormous expenditures that will be required to care for very large numbers of wounded veterans. Stiglitz was openly critical of George W. Bush at the time the book was released.<sup id="cite_ref-121"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-121">[121]</a></sup>

### _Freefall_ (2010)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=39 "Edit section: Freefall (2010)")\]

In _Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy_, Stiglitz discusses the causes of the 2008 recession/depression and goes on to propose reforms needed to avoid a repetition of a similar crisis, advocating government intervention and regulation in a number of areas. Among the policy-makers he criticises are George W. Bush, Larry Summers, and Barack Obama.<sup id="cite_ref-122"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-122">[122]</a></sup>

### _The Price of Inequality_ (2012)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=40 "Edit section: The Price of Inequality (2012)")\]

From the jacket: As those at the top continue to enjoy the best health care, education, and benefits of wealth, they often fail to realize that, as Joseph E. Stiglitz highlights, "their fate is bound up with how the other 99 percent live ... It does not have to be this way. In _[The Price of Inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Price_of_Inequality "The Price of Inequality")_ Stiglitz lays out a comprehensive agenda to create a more dynamic economy and fairer and more equal society"

The book received the [Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Center_for_Justice_and_Human_Rights "Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights") 2013 Book Award, given annually to the book that "most faithfully and forcefully reflects Robert Kennedy's purposes – his concern for the poor and the powerless, his struggle for honest and even-handed justice, his conviction that a decent society must assure all young people a fair chance, and his faith that a free democracy can act to remedy disparities of power and opportunity."<sup id="cite_ref-123"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-123">[123]</a></sup>

### _Creating a Learning Society: A New Approach to Growth, Development, and Social Progress_ (2014)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=41 "Edit section: Creating a Learning Society: A New Approach to Growth, Development, and Social Progress (2014)")\]

_Creating a Learning Society_ (co-authored with Bruce C. Greenwald) casts light on the significance of this insight for economic theory and policy. Taking as a starting point Kenneth J. Arrow's 1962 paper "Learning by Doing", they explain why the production of knowledge differs from that of other goods and why market economies alone typically do not produce and transmit knowledge efficiently. Closing knowledge gaps and helping laggards learn are central to growth and development. But creating a learning society is equally crucial if we are to sustain improved living standards in advanced countries.

### _The Great Divide: Unequal Societies and What We Can Do About Them_ (2015)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=42 "Edit section: The Great Divide: Unequal Societies and What We Can Do About Them (2015)")\]

From the jacket: In _The Great Divide_, Joseph E. Stiglitz expands on the diagnosis he offered in his best-selling book _The Price of Inequality_ and suggests ways to counter America's growing problem. Stiglitz argues that inequality is a choice – the cumulative result of unjust policies and misguided priorities.

### _The Euro: How a Common Currency Threatens the Future of Europe_ (2016)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=43 "Edit section: The Euro: How a Common Currency Threatens the Future of Europe (2016)")\]

From the description: "Stiglitz dismantles the prevailing consensus around what ails Europe, demolishing the champions of austerity while offering a series of plans that can rescue the continent--and the world--from further devastation." According to book review aggregator [Literary Hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_Hub "Literary Hub"), it received pan reviews.<sup id="cite_ref-124"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-124">[124]</a></sup>

### _People, Power and Profits: Progressive Capitalism for an Age of Discontent_ (2019)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=44 "Edit section: People, Power and Profits: Progressive Capitalism for an Age of Discontent (2019)")\]

From the jacket: Stiglitz shows how a middle-class life can once again be attainable by all. An authoritive account of the predictable dangers of free market fundamentalism and the foundatioins of progressive capitalism, _People, Power, and Profits_ shows us an America in crisis, but also lights a path through this challenging time.

### _Measuring What Counts: The Global Movement for Well-Being_ (2019)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=45 "Edit section: Measuring What Counts: The Global Movement for Well-Being (2019)")\]

Stiglitz and his co-authors point out that the interrelated crises of environmental degradation and human suffering of our current age demonstrate that "something is fundamentally wrong with the way we assess economic performance and social progress." They argue that using GDP as the chief measure of our economic health does not provide an accurate assessment of the economy or the state of the world and the people living in it.<sup id="cite_ref-125"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-125">[125]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-126"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-126">[126]</a></sup>

## Papers and conferences\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Stiglitz&action=edit&section=46 "Edit section: Papers and conferences")\]

Stiglitz wrote a series of papers and held a series of conferences explaining how such information uncertainties may have influence on everything from unemployment to lending shortages. As the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the first term of the Clinton Administration and former chief economist at the [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank"), Stiglitz was able to put some of his views into action. For example, he was an outspoken critic of quickly opening up financial markets in developing countries. These markets rely on access to good financial data and sound bankruptcy laws, but he argued that many of these countries did not have the regulatory institutions needed to ensure that the markets would operate soundly.

In July 2020, Stiglitz alongside Hamid Rashid, the chief of Global Economic Monitoring at the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, published a report, pointing out that the [quantitative easing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing "Quantitative easing") policy implemented by the US after the [2008 financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Financial_Crisis "2008 Financial Crisis"), had "basically exported a debt bubble to developing countries".<sup id="cite_ref-127"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-127">[127]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-128"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz#cite_note-128">[128]</a></sup>

"Tribal warfare in economics a thing of the past". _The Australian Financial Review_. Fairfax Media. [Bloomberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P. "Bloomberg L.P."). Look on the Wikipedia pages of economists Joseph Stiglitz and Greg Mankiw or any of a number of prominent economists. On the sidebar on the right, you'll see an entry for "school or tradition". Both Stiglitz and Mankiw are listed as "New Keynesian". That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Stiglitz and Mankiw's research is in totally different areas. Stiglitz did work on asymmetric information, efficiency wages, land taxes and a host of other microeconomic phenomena ... Nor are their policy positions even remotely similar – Stiglitz is a hero to the left, while Mankiw is a small-government conservative. In fact, Mankiw did important research on some models called "New Keynesian". Stiglitz did not.
