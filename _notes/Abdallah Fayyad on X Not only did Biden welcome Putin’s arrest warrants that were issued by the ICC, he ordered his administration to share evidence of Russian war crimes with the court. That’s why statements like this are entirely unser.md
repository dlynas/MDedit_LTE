Not only did Biden welcome Putin’s arrest warrants that were issued by the ICC, he ordered his administration to share evidence of Russian war crimes with the court. That’s why statements like this are entirely unserious.

'We've been really clear about the ICC investigation, we don't support it, we we don't believe that they have the jurisdiction,' White House @PressSec Karine Jean-Pierre after reports Israeli officials fear the Hague-based court could soon issue arrest warrants over Gaza war



For the first time in the history of its creation, the ICC is wrong? Is the ICC anti-semitic? Hmmm. I thought the whole raison d'être for a World Court was built on the premise of protecting the Jewish people??

It is interesting that the US claims to have jurisdiction over Julian Assange for exposing US war crimes when he essentially has nothing to do with the US and was not in the US, but it also has the Hague Invasion Act.

"entirely unserious" I can say the same about yours. Facts. Proof. "Because I said so hasn't worked to prove SHIT to me, since I was a teenager", and I started thinking on my own. YOU are stating something as fact. Prove it, or shoo.
