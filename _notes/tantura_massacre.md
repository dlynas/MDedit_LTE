	I decided to look up more about this massacre and found this Wikipedia link: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantura_massacre

	This part really stuck out to me immediately:

	"The massacre occurred following Tantura's surrender, a village of roughly 1,500 people in 1945 located near Haifa. The victims were buried in a mass grave,

	which today serves as a car park for the nearby Tel Dor beach."

	There is a CAR PARK on top of a fucking MASS GRAVE.

		That's just one our of tens of villages where the same tragedies occurred. It's just that Tantura and Deir Yassin are the two that have the most historic documents about and the two that were focused on by new-age Israeli historians who try to unbury Israel's genocidal past.
		
		And yes, turning mass-graves into parking lots is more common in Israel than any sane human would like to believe. You'll even hear several Israeli politicians and army officials saying that they will turn Gaza into a big parking lot, but most people don't understand that they mean it literally.

		That part is by far and away the least disturbing to me. History happens, life carries on, and the fields of war are so often forgotten. As a Brit, it is completely unremarkable if skeletons and swords, piles of bones, or whatever are uncovered when building roads or houses or car parks or whatever. We have 4000 years of history, a LOT of people have lived, fought, and died here.
		
		The disturbing thing to me is that these people clearly see nothing wrong with what they did. All these decades of hindsight and they still laugh and smile and think it was all just good fun. They're _sick_, and should face the death penalty. I wouldn't even allow them an appeal, the cavalier attitude here combined with the things they did, they don't deserve to live on the same planet as me any more.

					It’s true though. Not defending these animals, but I worked law enforcement for a few years and there were many times me and my co workers were at really horrific crime scenes and someone would make a small joke and we’d all laugh. Wasn’t even funny, and I know none of those guys found the crime scenes anything other than terrible, just something about the moment would amplify all emotions.

					He was saying the guy was a savage, it sounded like he disagreed with what the man was doing but felt like he could do nothing about it because "war is war" and it was forbidden to speak about. Truly interesting to say with a smile, if it were a trauma response it would make sense. Either that or some of them are prone to psychopathy.

	"The Tantura massacre took place on the night of 22–23 May 1948 during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Around 40–200 Palestinian Arab villagers from Tantura were massacred by the Alexandroni Brigade, which was part of what became the Israeli Defense Force. The massacre occurred following Tantura's surrender, a village of roughly 1,500 people in 1945 located near Haifa. The victims were buried in a mass grave, which today serves as a car park for the nearby Tel Dor beach."

		Perplexity: 
		
		Based on the information provided in the search results, the Tantura massacre refers to the killing of a large number of Palestinian civilians by Israeli forces in the village of Tantura in May 1948, around the time of Israel's establishment. Key details that emerge:
		
		- On May 22-23, 1948, the Israeli military's Alexandroni Brigade captured the Palestinian coastal village of Tantura, which had a population of around 1,500 at the time[2][3]. 
		
		- After the village surrendered, Israeli soldiers allegedly killed between 40-250 unarmed Palestinian civilians, mostly men[1][2][3][10]. The bodies were buried in mass graves[3].
		
		- Teddy Katz, an Israeli graduate student, wrote a thesis in 1998 detailing the massacre based on oral history interviews with both Palestinian survivors and Israeli veterans[1][3][18]. When his findings were published, he was sued for libel by Alexandroni Brigade veterans. Under pressure, Katz signed a retraction and his degree was revoked[1][3][10].
		
		- In 2022, the Israeli documentary film "Tantura" by Alon Schwarz included taped confessions from Israeli veterans confirming they witnessed summary executions of Palestinians after the battle ended[1][3][14]. The film reignited debate about the massacre in Israel.
		
		- A 2023 investigation by Forensic Architecture, using historical maps, aerial photos, and witness testimony, identified four potential mass grave sites in Tantura containing the remains of those killed, including underneath a current-day beach resort parking lot[12][13].
		
		So in summary, while still controversial, significant evidence from Palestinian survivors, Israeli veterans, historical records and forensic analysis points to a massacre of dozens to hundreds of surrendered Palestinian civilians by Israeli forces in Tantura in May 1948, with the bodies buried in mass graves, some of which are now beneath Israeli recreational areas. The incident was long suppressed within Israel but is gaining more acknowledgement in recent years[1][3][10][12][13].

				They did that to Arab Jews, too. You need to understand that European Jews (ashkenazis), viewed spehardic jews as lesser. They probably still do, because over the past 70+ years they've done their best to eradicate, and erase, sephardic culture and traditions.

				* 🟪 **[Dream--Brother](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dream--Brother)** ⬆️ 83 _(2024-04-13 15:36:58)_

					They still do. My ex-girlfriend's family was Sephardic and it took them a long time to find a temple where they felt safe and welcomed, because there were no sephardic temples nearby and they were treated like scum at the closest ones. They ended up going to a temple in the city, about a 30 minute drive, because there was nowhere closer that seemed to be okay with their presence. This was early 90s. Thankfully they found a pretty progressive,  welcoming Temple that became their home away from home for the next 30 years, and they made good, reql lifelong friends and relationships there. But hearing about their struggle, after their parents (my ex's grandparents) had come to America to escape the ostracism of being Sephardic in southern Europe... just sad and absurd. Thankfully, her very religious grandmother got to spend her final years at a Temple that loved her and welcomed her with open arms.
					
					I learned a whole lot about Judaism in that relationship, but I learned even more about the struggles Sephardim have been through even/especially at the hands of other Jewish sects. As a 2nd-Gen Irish American, it was far, far too similar to my grandmother's broken heart over the situation between Protestants and Catholics in Ireland (although that was less a religious dispute and more of a cultural one). Grandma would always say, "We're all God's children, all of us and every one." I'm not religious, but I wish more religious folk would remember/believe that.

	I just can't understand someone finding joy in the memories of them and their friends murdering people in the most brutal ways and raping children. All of the monsters in this video should be chucked off a cliff to the rocky waters below. 

	I've spoken to veterans before. And you can always tell which of them are genuine good people that were forced into a conflict they did not want. The vets I've spoken to were from the Vietnam War and my class was lucky enough to speak with a vet who served in WW2. The man who served in Vietnam stood out to me the most because you could tell that he still carried the emotional and mental pain from that war, he was from a very poor black family and got drafted so there was nothing he could do. 

	He was just a regular guy who was forced to fight in a war he didn't want and kill people he didn't even know, and it stayed with him for the rest of his life. These are not men in this video, these are monsters undeserving of any sympathies or love or care.

		My grandfather is a Vietnam Veteran.
		
		He never talks about it. I’m under the impression that he pretends it never happened to him. But once I had the guts to ask about it, what it was like. 
		
		He told me that he was only 19 years old and had just started in a trade school. When he was drafted, at first he was actually excited to do his duty to America. In his words, “I was young, it was like a game to me. When I got there, it wasn’t one.”
		
		Then he told me a story about one of his first nights on the field. Said him and his troop were wading through these swampy rice fields to get to some enemies on the other side and a huge water buffalo came out of no where. It charged at them, so my grandpa shot it. 
		
		But then the owner of the rice field came out and started screaming at them, because it had turned out to be that man’s water buffalo. My grandfather said he felt terrible because he wondered how integral the animal could’ve been to that guy’s livelihood. But then another person in his troop shot the man, and my grandpa just had to keep moving with everyone. He was innocent; just rightfully pissed his only water buffalo was shot.  
		
		He said that’s when he really realized what he had been roped into. He ended up nearly dying of an unidentified illness during his deployment, so he was sent home early, and he considers himself lucky for it despite how awful it was to nearly die like that.

For instance, there was an attempted mass poisoning of the German water supply after the war, the plan failed but it would have been devastating. The truth is that everyone is capable of evil, which is more disturbing than just the Nazis doing it.

	For those of you who don’t know, Tantura is a Palestinian/Arab village. These men who are laughing about rape and mass murder are Israelis.

	>The Tantura massacre took place on the night of 22–23 May 1948 during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Around 40–200 Palestinian Arab villagers from Tantura were massacred by the Alexandroni Brigade, which was part of what became the Israeli Defense Force. The massacre occurred following Tantura's surrender, a village of roughly 1,500 people in 1945 located near Haifa. The victims were buried in a mass grave, which today serves as a car park for the nearby Tel Dor beach.

	>Oral testimonies by surviving Palestinians were met by skepticism. A corroborative 1998 thesis by an Israeli Haifa University graduate Theodore Katz, who interviewed survivors, was also met with denial. In a 2022 Israeli documentary film called Tantura, several Israeli veterans interviewed said they had witnessed a massacre at Tantura after the village had surrendered. In 2023, Forensic Architecture published its commissioned investigation of the area and concluded that there were three potential gravesites in the area of the Tel Dor beach that were connected to a massacre. After the massacre, women and children were transported to Furaydis. Male survivors were placed into prison camps, later leaving Israel through prisoner exchanges followed by their families.”

But soon, he was stripped of his degrees and was publicly shamed as a fraudulent traitor. Decades later, incendiary new evidence emerges to corroborate Teddy's initial findings, not just vindicating him, but raising profound questions about how Israelis — and we all — deal with the darker chapters of history.
