## Infinite Jest predicted the West's current predicament so well

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/davidfosterwallace/comments/1am6b8e/infinite_jest_predicted_the_wests_current/](https://www.reddit.com/r/davidfosterwallace/comments/1am6b8e/infinite_jest_predicted_the_wests_current/)

> Even ten years ago, DFW was a staple of reading in literate circles. Nowadays, he seems to be almost disappeared. I can‚Äôt find his books in Italy as easily as before, and we were on the forefront in translating his opus (I first encountered Infinite Jest in a beautiful Italian translation). The thing is, we are basically living in the future predicted by him in Infinite Jest. Drowned in cheap entertainment and endless distractions, lost among endless artificial stimuli (what difference is there between Interlace and socials and streaming services?). A world of adult children, conditioned to seek for pleasure and nothing else, while the world around us burns in many different ways. Marathe was right even if he was a terrorist and Steeply, dead wrong. David always had America in mind while writing, but the entire West is in thrall the same way because the modern West is just a colony of America. There is no samizdat, no killer cartouche, but that was just a narrative expedient to push his thesis to the extreme. On top of all that, mental illnesses are rising at a very fast rate. Autism, anxiety, depression‚Ä¶ We are also addicted to everything, from food to porn. That also was nailed by Infinite Jest: addiction is not a question of substances in themselves, but a very illness which can express itself in a wide range of shapes. I think David was a genius and was also getting closer to properly get spirituality, meditation, the Higher Power he wrote about. Had he lived, maybe with the help of a different combination of meds, he would be a very different person today, but also a reactionary of some sort. Sadly, he never found a way to transcend his own mind, which in the end killed him. The Pale King especially almost grasped the solution he was searching for desperately in the last years of his life. That book, even in its unfinished status, is one of staggering lucidity.

		The Pale King, to me, is a bit like The Silmarillion. What we got is so good at making you very, very sad that its author could not complete it as he wanted. In the case of The Silmarillion, Tolkien had in mind something of the size of Lord of the Rings; the edited book is a meagre 400 pages long. Both works raised the bar too high. The Pale King's story was going to be more intricate than Infinite Jest, according to the notes, with an overarching sinister plot that would never quite coalesce but always lurking at the margins of the story and some characters with strange mental powers. At least The Pale King is untouched by hands other than DFW's very. He was trying to change his style, curbing its excesses and focusing more on details and realistic characterizations (that trajectory started with Infinite Jest itself though, with the half-way house part) than verbal pyrotechnics, and in some places he succeeded: there is one chapter in particular which in my opinion is one of the best things he ever wrote. And yet, obviously, like with Tolkien, one can't avoid asking himself "what if..."

		Pale King is unfinished and you can tell. Just a heads up. Also if it‚Äôs useful, the Pale King is about the loss of satisfaction and the dangers of living in a world where the convenience of pleasure supersedes an individuals willpower to become great at anything through patience and struggle.

	I agree mostly with the sentiment of this post. I think the culture in the west has never been more fearful of the unknown, perhaps the nature of mankind itself, and how to actually cope in what appears to be an ever increasing disillusionment and pervasive nihilism. These addictions, the apathy and overall superficiality seem largely to serve as coping methods in response to ever growing complexities of the world and the constant reaffirmation via social media. 

	DFW unfortunately self deleted which probably did little to prove the points he was making as an utility to those who don‚Äôt consider self deletion to be an option. It seems many of the great thinkers who predicted these more tragic outcomes have also met with less than outstanding outcomes themselves. I‚Äôve been reading Nietzsche which just like DFW does a great job at defining the problems, yet struggles to find adequate solutions. Thus spoke Zarathustra was imo his attempt at defining a new spiritual code for western man, but like other writers these ideas border on the line of esoteric and difficult to understand or apply. 

	Another more extreme case was Ted Kazinsky‚Äôs manifesto which was basically spot on in its predictions, but of course we know how not well that ended. Perhaps the point each one of these writers is getting at contains a mote simplistic solution such as being comfortable within one‚Äôs self, not looking to the greater outside world to be the example of a functioning system, rather becoming that in yourself through personal experiences and growth. The tendency towards self isolation is a double edge blade. On the one hand people need to learn to overcome loneliness and be whole within themselves, but once that is accomplished to also realize that no human is truly able to function in isolation. 

	The ego has a self grandiose tendency to think itself unique and higher on the basis of logic and reason, but in this we also lose a sense of empathy for other humans which may lead to destructive tendencies. The truth is not everyone will grow to accept the truths of the world in their lifetime, but that is their decision on the basis of freewill either ignorant or blissful. 

	It also does not mean that many others do not resonate and feel exactly the way you might and perhaps feel stifled to express that openly. The point is that losing hope may just as well be part of the process of evolution because those who are driven by Hope are often led by malfeasance and bad actors. 

	What if nihilism in its current modern day form was the true test of our generation, not war, not climate catastrophe, or politics? What if it was true that faith and culture can no longer sustain us as a species and that it is now our task to recreate a new paradigm learning from the failures of the old? I don‚Äôt have the answer exactly, but this is where I am personally headed in my own journey.  Food for thought. Perhaps that adds some insight to the topic.

		The only viable solution is the removal of the Ego illusion, the false identity, because what we are as individuals is just a mass of memories, emotions and perceptions superimposed on undifferentiated consciousness (which could be called with many different names \[all of them inadequate\] like God, Kingdom of Heaven, Buddha-nature, Emptiness, Brahman...).  We appropriate this mass and call it "I". From there, suffering springs forth, because we become individuals separated from others and from the world of objects, alone, miserable, unable to communicate (DFW greatest fear, that he wasn't able to communicate with others despite wanting so much to convey genuine feelings - possibly the origin of Hal Incandenza's, who, on the contrary, is able to communicate as well as Wallace and people understand what he says, but is empty inside \[at the chronological start of the novel\]). The West has been trodding on a path of nihilism for centuries, since it started to focus on this "I". All the great modern Western minds perceived that original problem in a way or another (I think, for instance, of possibly the greatest writer to ever have had put a mark on paper, Marcel Proust) I think Wallace also came to understand this. He was so tired of his mind, his usual, trite, suffocating patterns of thinking, he wanted out; and "wanting out" is always a good sign - it's the people who are comfortable with existence as it appears to the senses without feeling that Matrix-ian "splinter in the mind" who are in thrall and may be called ill. DFW's mind wasn't just an instrument as it should be, it possessed him. Because he was so smart a man, it was the best instruments he had but also the worst master one could imagine. In time, he rightly got that somehow concentration is the key to the whole riddle. But he never arrived at the point of projecting that concentration on the "inside" in order to ask himself, "who AM I really?" Yet I think the seeds were all there, ready to germinate. His mind, finally unleashed, killed him before.
		
		Nietschze's situation was altogether different. Like so many Western philosophers from Descartes onward (or maybe even from late Medieval Scholastic philosophy onward) he tried to found a solution to the "wanting out" by building an entire philosophical system on the founding blocks of other philosophers, a creation of his mind, which even if it may make an interesting reading it's always a wrong move, because that way you get even more trapped in the "I". So there can be as many philosophies as the number of individuals in the world and all of them are both wrong and right at the same time. Wallace was different, he never embraced another philosophical system after the infatuation with Wittgenstein in his youth faded, neither he tried to devise one of his own.

			From an eastern perspective I can see your point, but the west is not the east and therefor it‚Äôs really not feasible to operate outside an I frame work as you put it. It would be akin to speaking different languages. Western philosophers are working within the framework of the west because that is where they originate and the audience they speak to. If your conclusion is that the western framework is in fact inevitably doomed as a result of not accepting these Hindu and Buddhist philosophies the future looks bleak for all life forms. Few are able to find common ground these days and perhaps that will in fact be the unraveling of modern societies east and west. They are all now connected and intertwined. I‚Äôm pretty sure DFW and Nietzsche understood this to be true.

			* üü¶ **[deleted] (OP)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1 _(2024-02-09 16:56:02)_

				I kind of disagree, but I am going to explain why. The West started in the East. Philosophy started in today's Turkey, at Miletus, during the Achaemenids (Persian) domination. Greek philosophers themselves were more similar, in many respects, to Orientals thinkers that modern philosophers, as they promoted lifestyles, not just mental constructs. Platonism, the big bang of our civilization - which includes Aristotelianism, despite the many efforts in the past centuries to picture Aristotle as a rebel  - was an offshoot of the Pythagoreans with the additions of many other flavours, of which little of certain remains, but enough to see striking similarities to what was taught back then in the East. On top of all that, Christianity, what would become the normative religion of our society for two millennia, is in itself an Eastern religion. That was the ancient past, but it happened again and again. Even modern continental philosophy was sparkled by a renewed contact with Oriental scriptures. German idealists were pretty much inspired by the Upanishads which were starting to circulate in the West at that time (in terrible translations, but hey, better than nothing).  Nietzsche would not exist without Schopenhauer. I may suggest a great book I've read recently, The Shape of the Ancient World\*, which puts these matters in perspective, though is quite long and dense. We are not speaking of two worlds here.
				
				But I think the truth is beyond any single religion or philosophy. One must go beyond the mind to find it. There is no reason to reject anything, the way I see it. And I think DFW would have arrived more or less there.
				
				\*The Shape of Ancient Civilization, sorry.

					I agree it‚Äôs not two world and can understand the parallels between east and west historically and culturally speaking. However a certain sense pertaining to a modernist viewpoint has now completely engulfed much of the west and is currently making itself known in eastern thinking countries. 
					
					I will check out the book you recommended, but without that background what is interesting to me is the way by which even modern cultures that formed over the course of antiquity both east and west are unable to avoid the similar affects of modernity. China is a great example. Also Japan and even parts of India that were once divorced from modern financial and industrial force are slowly capitulating towards these ideals. 
					
					As an American, therefore a descendant of the western Christian model I have witnessed an unwillingness to accept anything less than the dominant global viewpoint despite its many flaws. For one example America and other western cultures have outsourced much of its workforce which has led to very large wealth disparities. The decision to do this was largely guided by a certain type of western philosophy that may or may not have failed to consider the longer term results of civil discourse. 
					
					This is one real life example that exposes the results of an every man for himself based modern society, but the point is that it is difficult to say that it‚Äôs uniquely a Christian ideology as many other cultures now model themselves similarly. 
					
					Where I agree on the thought processes that brought modern culture into existence over thousands of years , it still fails to present viable alternatives to the current trajectory. I believe Nietzsche and other modern thinkers became astutely aware of this and attempted to prescribe their own solutions. Whether their work was at all helpful to remains tbd imo.

					It‚Äôs been on my to do list for a while. The statement ‚ÄúThe West started in the East‚Äù is a profound statement even if at first it seems paradoxical.¬†
					
					The origins lie further back than the scientific revolution at Miletus. Narratives from Hittite and Babylonian mythology profoundly influenced Greek mythology which was the precursor to a scientific or philosophical view of the cosmos.¬†

		You might enjoy psychoanalyst‚Äôs, Don Carveth‚Äôs, work on superego, conscience and concern for others. Of course his work is geared towards psychoanalyst, but I‚Äôve studied it for a year as a singe mother who has a long history of self abusive behaviors (started waking up to this behavior after it became very clear I was trying to annihilate myself).

		If you want a thinker who fully understood the problem but managed to have a full and fulfilling life look into Jung - a lot of people are turned off by his spirituality/mysticism, but I think that's exactly what allowed him to avoid the horrible end that others couldn't.

			Very much a fan of Jung however the point I was making when it came David Foster Wallace was that I feel like in many ways his suicide cast a sort of ‚Äú don‚Äôt try this at home kids‚Äù around his intellectual endeavors. Of course he suffered with mental issues for many years and so from a rational standpoint there is probably a trade off  between genius and what‚Äôs considered abnormality. Perhaps it‚Äôs true that if you stare into the abyss long enough it begins to stare back at you, but still this begs the question. If to be an intelligent, self aware and thoughtful person, a writer with prestige achieving much more than any average person could and you still end up taking your own life, seriously what is the point of all this? 
			Jung and Watts do a far better job of answering that question. DFW never seemed to get beyond a certain point no matter how much he was able to think and write. This is also just my observation without obviously knowing the entire story intimately. Im sure there is more to it.

				Oh yeah I see what you're saying. In my personal experience I eventually realized that the ideas and theories weren't the cause of my disposition towards life - they were merely a justification of it. Life was dead and meaningless for me because I ran from it and I ran from it by forming an overly rational worldview that sucked all the life out of everything. Long story short, in my case, the answer was accepting impermenance/death, and since this fear was behind my drive for overly analyzing and rationalizing everything, once I got over that I was able to stop thinking so much and get out of my head and live. 
				
				I know there are plenty of other causes, but this one seems very common among people who end up wandering into the same field of ideas as people like DFW(even for people who don't take it as deep or as far as him). I wrote a short story a while back with a quote that summed it up, something like: "Some people are so afraid of death that they make their life as small and meaningless as possible, simply so that death has less to take from them."

		I think Brave New World deserves some credit for being the first thing(that I'm aware of) to predict that, instead of using force and surveillance to control populations, it would be much easier and more practical to make the people "enjoy their servitude" via the same kind of mindless entertainment OP is talking about. Though to be fair I think it's a lot more haphazard and un-orchestrated IRL than what Huxley depicts - the world kinda just fell into this and people at the top clumsily take advantage of it, but it wasn't some master plan that was intentionally implemented by some group. Or maybe it was, guess if they were capable of that they'd be pretty good at hiding it.

	I think he's not read so much anymore because since his death, the new sincerity aesthetic he was associated with, which had vitality in the context of the "end of history" and feels a bit toothless now that it's clear history has not really ended, has come and gone. His work has also been pretty much incorperated into the western literary canon and is widely read in academic settings. And further, the gen x/millenial audiences that were captivated by his work have grown older and are not so much connected to the pulse of modern culture anymore. I think gen z has had a much different experience of the world because they have only ever known the kind of world Infinite Jest explores where Wallace and his contemporaries were living through its creation. I think gen z has certainly had to deal with the negative aspects of an increasingly overstimulated world in which the internet is always trying to shape people through content consumption and surveillance, but I think they've also responded to those problems in creative ways that have have been born out of their experience. Some of the morally conservative threads of his work have not aged particularly well either, not to mention that his history with Mary Karr has really damaged his legacy and, at the very least, revealed undercurrents in his work that are hard to be uncritical of. 

	If anything, I think his tragic suicide only demonstrates that the understanding he had of sadness in contemporary American life really wasn't adequate. He had an excellent understanding of the ways we distract ourselves from the problems of our lives and the way that consumerist culture reinforces our participation in it by enabling the worst parts of ourselves, but I don't think he was accurate to say that these "addictions" themselves are the reason we are unhappy and that the key to a happy life is to find some deeper purpose or whatever. I think he was inadequate in addressing the way that western soceity forces a model of reality upon us, and that all of these distractions are sort of pseudo-escapes from dominant narratives that ultimately serve to strengthen it. Though he felt that he was getting in touch with something more real, the asceticism and piety he adopted is the same kind of illusion meant to capture any form of resistance as something with can exist within capitalist soceity without promoting any kind of actual change.

	For what its worth, I also think his reading of postmodernism is seriously incoherent, which is not entirely his fault. During his lifetime, post-structuralism was only beginning to be taught in the English speaking world, where it was shoehorned in with literary studies and fused with the concept of postmodernism as a discussion relevant to the humanities. I think this lead him, and many others, to interpret it as something that it wasn't. The claim that post-modernists rejected all forms of meaning and purpose and simply adopted this ironic posturing against everything is just an oversimplification of what those thinkers wanted to do. Maybe Baudrillard felt that way to some extent, but generally, what they attempted to address was that these things are socially constructed, and therefore people should be able to examine these things and construct a way of being in the world that allows people to break out of rigid beliefs about themselves and the world they live in. In this context, David Foster Wallace's literary and philosophical project is actually quite reactionary because the kind of "post-postmodernism"/new-sincerity thing promotes a structure of feeling which claims to be universal but is just as phony as the soceity Wallace wants to critique. I do think there were some limitations to those ways of thinking, but I generally feel like the postmodernism he fought against wasn't real, or was real only in the sense that its misinterpretation and appropriation by western literary circles allowed it to be real. Of course, all he's really doing is rehashing the pitfalls of Dostoevsky's similar reactionary viewpoints with the aesthetic veneer of the literary experimentalists he works to critique at the same time that he appropriates them.

	He is still one of my favorite authors and I think his work is beautiful and provides many profound insights. But for how brilliant and touching he could be, I also think his work has significant problems that prevent me from feeling like he was really the end-all-be-all of contemporary literature.

						Again, you are using ad hominem. Why are you attacking me? Don't you see that attacking me does not gives force to your stance? Re-read the first five lines of the above post and  ask yourself what is the use of being so worked up with a stranger on reddit.
						
						I will answer your actual points, since you tried to move from ad hominem to real argumentations. I don't personally trust psychiatry very much, but there are substances, different than those DFW took, which one can try and antidepressants themselves do work sometimes, even if their real mechanism of action is unknown, as the chemical imbalance theory was more of a catchy line to sell them like candies in the '90s. DFW went into withdrawal, basically, because he stopped abruptly a MAOI. That precipitated a cascade of side effects. Psychiatrists do prefer to call it "discontinuation crisis". It's really withdrawal.
						
						As for the second point, I am not promoting relativism. If you think so, you have not really read my previous posts. I am just saying that before jumping on any bandwagon one must think with his own mind. When you read something online, you don't have to take it automatically as the Truth and, from there, build your own version of things and cling to it. You see, that is how reddit works: many tiny echo chambers where real discussions are not possible because if you enter a specific subreddit and post something that criticizes that subreddit's object, you get downvoted to oblivion. Furthermore, nowhere I have said that David Foster Wallace is my role model or anything like that. I have read that DFW was a person with many obscure traits (though that he used to beat his wife, escaped me, honestly - I only know about his relationship with that writer in the '90). I still wouldn't judge him. I have no right to judge anyone, I am not potentially better than him or anyone else. On the other hand notice how fast you assumed a defensive stance by writing that "at least I do good works in my community and don't listen to people who beats women". Good for you, man, but why exactly did you feel the need to put that out front like I accused you or something? In my experience, every  single time I did the same as you here, either online or in person, was because I had passed judgements on someone else, and when one does that he is always on the lookout. You know, "do not judge if you don't want to be judged" is indeed a part of the foundations of the Western world.

				If we must discard an idea because of the flaws of its creator, then we probably have to get rid of all human knowlege. Or do only some flaws count in this calculus?

							Lol man I know that, but that still doesn‚Äôt respond to what I just said. How is that pointing out the absurdity of my ideas. If anything, your comment strengthens what I just said.

								The statement at issue is: "Yeah and what did David foster Wallace do lmao? Beat his wife and commit suicide. Not sure we should be taking this guys social commentary or advice with any seriousness."
								
								My response: "if we must discard an idea because of the flaws of its creator, then we probably have to get rid of all human knowlege. Or do only some flaws count in this calculus?"
								
								If you really don't understand how that shows the absurbidty of your Neo-Puritanical logic-- and in fact strengthens your argument, then I see no point in trying further. Best wishes.

								A person doesn't need to be a good person to teach you something. If that was the case we would never learn anything. 
								Many of the greats of literature and philosophy are in fact very morally questionable. But do we not read Kant or Hume because they were racist? Do we not read Aristotle because he defended slavery as an institution? Heidegger was a literal member of the Nazi party. Does that mean we can safely ignore Being and Time, a staple of existentialism? Schopenhauer was known to stalk women. Does that mean the thinkers who were influenced by him are simply mistaken? Nietzsche was a raging incel. Does that inherently devalue the quality of his work? 
								
								Think about who taught us right from wrong in the first place. Parents, family, teachers. Were these people perfect? No, in fact for many of us these people were deeply flawed. Yet they still taught us right from wrong. You don't need to be a good person to have an impact, to do quality work, to write a thought-provoking novel or to teach someone a lesson.
								
								So the idea that we can dismiss DFW's work due to his misogyny and abuse allegations, or that anyone who likes DFW in spite of these facts is just a simpleton "looking up to a woman beater" is very much an ad hominem attack. You don't actually critique his work, you just say his work is bad because he is bad. That's lazy.
								
								Why did you ask me to explain without sounding smug when your initial comment was guilty of that? Also what's the point in doing good for your community if you're just gonna humble brag on Reddit about it?
