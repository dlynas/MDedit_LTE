## How can we transition our global economic system towards sustainable development models that prioritize resource efficiency, ecological preservation, and social well-being?

In other words, **exponential global GDP growth** that's coupled to a **linear materials economy**. This is why we get ocean dead zones, species extinction, etc.

	Read Henry George. 

	One line summary: don't tax productivity, tax natural resource usage. This includes the obvious things like natural gas, oil, or mineral extraction, as well as monopolistic land use.

	Taxing natural resources extremely highly but not taxing sales at all, for example, will incentivize companies to use the least amount of resources possible to generate the most revenue possible => increased efficiency.

		Very elegant.

	Have you read 'Donut Economics' by kate raworth? I won't try to surmise since I haven't, but I've listened to Kate speak on a podcast about her alternative framing of a successful model for social and sustainable economics

	It's going to require the end of capitalism. I don't know what will replace it or whether it'll be better or worse, but capitalism prioritizes the pursuit of profit over the needs of human beings and interprets anything other than continuous economic growth as a crisis. It's not sustainable, so the question isn't when capitalism will collapse, it's how.

	The rich  minority controls our society and has the power of wealth and a monopoly on the use of legal violence. The only power available to the rest of us that can challenge this is the power of numbers, but we can't use this power because we're disorganized and deeply divided. The rich-owned media and political system promote culture wars and other divisions to keep us fighting amongst each other instead of fighting them. They maintain control by making sure we don't see the primary conflict as rich vs poor, but instead black vs white, urban vs rural, gay vs straight, Democrat vs Republican. We all have the same basic human needs and it is critical to the rich that we not realize this fact, unite around it, and reorganize society accordingly.

			Although we can all imagine such a scenario going sideways, [u/rustoof](https://www.reddit.com/user/rustoof) makes an interesting point.
			
			> You can't committee your way out of this shit.
			
			Politicians up for reelection are beholden to wealthy, corporate donors. They're nervous to do anything unpopular, even if it's a necessary step to ensure the survival of our species.
			
			With hereditary monarchs you are always rolling the dice. Will they be a sadistic tyrant, or a benevolent leader? Adding in a *genuine* belief that sustainability is a must, a fear that failure means damnation, would help. In general, people should not get to vote on whether we destroy the planet or not. Politicians shouldn't have the power to sell away our grandchildren futures. The concept of a benevolent, fanatical monarch isn't a bad one (even if fantastical).
			
			**EDIT:** Forgot the "not" after "in general, people should..."

			It's not possible for humans to take on that level of power and control.  They would inevitably either resign from the position, be assassinated, or be corrupted.

			* 🟦 **[InfernalOrgasm](https://www.reddit.com/user/InfernalOrgasm)** ⬆️ 3 _(2023-08-06 12:27:01)_

				Exactly this. Power doesn't corrupt, it's just that only corrupt power stays in power. Non-corrupt power will always naturally resign when not needed.

			I don't care if it's a man or woman. From a practical standpoint the founder of a dynasty is usually some form of warlord so it will likely be a man, but I see no reason why it couldn't be a woman.

					I don't like neutral they/them pronouns in my writing and didn't see any particular reason to say he. I don't see why italicizing the same subject of the same sentence that is internally consistent in its references is really necessary.

							Seriously? What is so confusing about strict primogeniture without regard to sex?

								Here's what was confusing at first.
								
								You even said that from a practical standpoint a man would likely be the ruler, but instead of just saying "he," you made an effort to change it and say "she."
								
								Hard to believe you don't care if its a man or a woman when you emphasise a woman but say its usually a man.

								* ⬜️ **[rustoof](https://www.reddit.com/user/rustoof)** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-08-08 18:20:09)_

									I don't man. If I'm talking about a hypothetical person who has no reason to be assigned a gender I assume I write or say "she" somewhere between 33 and 50 percent of the time. It's not like I keep track.
									
									The warlord aspect was a later musing. I of course would be more than happy to offer my sword to a female warlord too.

		Regardless, usa has 25% global gdp, china 18%, india 10%.
