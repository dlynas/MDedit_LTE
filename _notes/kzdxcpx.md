> I was just thinking about the books that had a profound effect on how I think, and how I see the world.
> 
> ‘The Selfish Gene’ by Richard Dawkins, which I read when I was a teenager showed me that nature was not only beautiful, but explainable through the scientific method.
> 
> ‘The case against reality’ by Donald Hoffman, helped me see a way of marrying scientific enquiry with subjective experience.
> 
> ‘Elementary forms of religious life’ - Emile Durkheim gave me a (as an atheist/agnostic) a deeper respect for religion.
> 
> ‘The Panama Papers’ by Frederick and Bastien Obermayer showed me how rigged modern European society is in favour of the super rich. As well as how great investigative journalism works behind the scenes.

	Power by Shahida Arabi.

	It is about people who suffered narcissistic abuse and how to deal with the horrible aftermath. It is a series of essays drawing from the literature on narcissistic abuse and its survivors. 

	The confusion, self-esteem issues, and doubt of my own memories I had been under for so long were no longer signs of something wrong with me. That was something my abuser told me until I believed it. These were normal responses to the things I went through.
