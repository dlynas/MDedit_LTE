While much of the NYT "mass Hamas rape" report relies on innuendo, it also purports to contain several credible eyewitness testimonies. One was delivered by a survivor of the Nova electronic music festival named Raz Cohen, who also happens to be an Israeli special forces vet who trains Congolese soldiers. Since his first interview on October 9, Cohen has altered his testimony several times. Cohen told the NYT he personally witnessed a white van filled with Hamas militants pull up a mile from the Nova music festival, gather over a woman, and gang rape her: "I saw the men standing in a half circle around her. One penetrates her. She screams. I still remember her voice, screams without words.” He said they then butchered the woman with knives. When Cohen was interviewed on October 9 about the attack on the music festival, however, he did not mention any act of sexual assault committed by Hamas militants. See here: [twitter.com/i24NEWS\_EN/sta](https://x.com/i24NEWS_EN/status/1711377634381509018) And here: [tiktok.com/@lior.shapira9](https://t.co/xP9DJS7AbI) A day later, Cohen began to introduce vague suggestions of sexual assault into his testimony, but did not indicate that he witnessed any such acts taking place. “The terrorists captured women and hurt them in any way possible, and when they were done with them, they started butchering them in front of their friends,” Cohen told an Israeli publication: [ashkelnayes.co.il/%D7%97%D7%A8%D](https://t.co/hhP9sTti0R) Cohen was also interviewed by Canada's CBC on October 10, but was not quoted about witnessing any rape: [ici.radio-canada.ca/rci/en/news/20](https://t.co/NdjCpiNiJC) The same day, Cohen offered lurid new details to PBS, claiming that "the terrorists" not only slaughtered women after raping them on October 7, but engaged in necrophilia as well: “The terrorists, people from Gaza, raped girls. And after they raped them, they killed them, murdered them with knives, or the opposite, killed — and after they raped, they — they did that.” [pbs.org/newshour/show/](https://t.co/cQAtNjpOc0) Testimony he provided to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on October 11 differed slightly, and remained vague: "We see from there a lot of people and girls screaming and murdered by knives. And the girls, the terrorists rape them," he stated abruptly and without apparent emotion. [tiktok.com/@abcnewsaus/vi](https://t.co/KWs4DImQcR) By this point, no Israeli media had reported that any rapes occurred on October 7. Cohen quickly fell off the media's radar. He would not be heard from for over two months, when the Israeli government launched an international propaganda campaign accusing Hamas of mass rape in a transparent bid to maintain international support for its genocidal military assault on Gaza. At this point, when the NY Times' Jeffrey

interviewed Cohen, likely reaching him with assistance from the Israeli government, the "IDF" special forces soldier summoned for the first time a vivid account of a shocking gang rape on October 7. How and why did Cohen's story transform so dramatically over time, providing explosive new details at a moment of political urgency for the army in which he served? Was it plausible that a group of hardened Hamas commandoes suddenly paused their surprise attack, which was focused on taking as many captives as quickly as possible, stood in a circle and gang raped a woman, one after another, while Israeli forces mobilized to attack them? Why did Hamas militants use knives to kill their victims, as Cohen alleged, when they carried rifles and grenades? Why did he drop his earlier allegation of necrophilia when speaking to the Times? And why did he mention seeing "a lot of people and girls" being raped to the ABC on October 11, but alter his testimony to refer specifically to a single female victim when interviewed by the Times? Perhaps most importantly, why did Cohen's friend, Shoam Gueta, who took shelter with him on October 7, not describe witnessing a gang rape when interviewed by the Times? The Times must have been so determined to validate a propaganda campaign by the criminally mendacious Israeli government that it dispensed with all skepticism, and did not even bother vetting the supposed eyewitnesses. In the hours and days ahead, I will continue to dissect the dubious testimonies that form that basis of the paper's "investigation."

A 24-year-old accountant only identified as "Sapir" is described by the NY Times as "one of the Israeli police’s key witnesses." Yet one of Sapir's key claims undermines the rest of her unbelievably lurid testimony. According to the Times, "she saw three other women raped and

The New York Times appears to have relied on the same credibility-deprived witness as CNN: a supposed paramedic from Israeli Air Force Special Tactics rescue unit 669 identified only as "G" by the latter network. In the Times, "G" claims (as he did to CNN) that he "had found the
