## “Cynicism is a form of obedience.” —Cornelius Eady

James Baldwin in conversation with Nikki Giovanni. From Soul! (1971).

"I'm pretty pessimistic there.
No, I think you're pretty realistic.
I think you're pretty cool.
No, I think you're pretty clear.
But pessimists are silent.
Pessimists are people who have no hope for themselves
or others.
Pessimists are also people who think
that the human race beneath their notice
they're better than other human beings."
