## “Celebrity idolization represents a manifestation of worship of the bourgeois class, with celebrities serving as prominent advocates for their interests.
They often appropriate progressive ideologies to dilute any challenge to their social status. We’ve become obsessed with the lives of exploiters, capitalists, and individuals famous solely for their fame, prioritizing their existence over our own, oblivious to the detrimental effects of glorifying their lifestyles. I have no interest in your escapism, your thrill, or the superficial rewards of celebrity worship. Celebrity culture is a product of capitalism that we should be dismantling now” - words by @therevolutionarygirrl__
