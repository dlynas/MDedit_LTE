On this day, 4 April, 1968, civil rights leader Martin Luther King was assassinated as he stood on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee.

Though widely recognised for his work within the civil rights movement, King also held democratic socialist beliefs and engaged with the class struggle within America.

In his final book, Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community? King wrote: “Capitalism has often left a gap of superfluous wealth and abject poverty [and] has created conditions permitting necessities to be taken from the many to give luxuries to the few.”
