BREAKING: Anat Schwartz, one of the principal authors of the NYT "mass rape" atrocity propaganda hoax, not only expressed support for genocidal mass murder of Palestinians right before they gave her that job, but also served in the Israeli military's intelligence service

so the NYT hired a person from the entertainment business with zero journalistic experience, who expressed explicit genocidal racism against Palestinians shortly before, is related to another author of the piece, and served in Israeli military intelligence

oh my god. One of the three authors of the New York Times' "mass rape" atrocity propaganda hoax is Anat Schwartz. She liked posts calling for Gaza to be turned into a "slaughterhouse". This the person the NYT hired to write about Palestinians and frame them as sub-human monsters

Anat Schwartz also believes the 40 beheaded babies hoax and called on fabricating atrocity propaganda for Western audiences. And then the New York Times hired her to be one of the main authors of the "mass rape" hoax. This is the most deranged thing I have ever seen

then when I exposed this Anat Schwartz first deleted her account, then scrubbed it of all evidence. But it's too late, I have it all and it's confirmed by others who saw it before she took it down. The NYT has concocted the biggest hoax since Judith Miller

BREAKING: After being exposed as a genocidal maniac who wants to "turn Gaza into a slaughterhouse", "Holocaust Palestinians", "violate any norm" and calling Palestinians "human animals", the New York Times' Anat Schwartz has scrubbed and locked her account. But it's too late now x.com/zei\_squirrel/sâ€¦

again, the New York Times must immediately retract this shoddy depraved widely debunked atrocity propaganda hoax still being used by the Israeli regime to launder the ongoing Gaza genocide which was its explicit purpose, and fire Jeffrey Gettleman, Adam Sella and Anat Schwartz

then the NYT must profusely apologize for the masses of Palestinians they helped mass murder in the "Gaza slaughterhouse" by allowing genocidal racist fanatical Zionist propagandists who served in Israeli military intelligence to dehumanize them with an atrocity propaganda hoax

even more confirmation that Anat Schwartz and her relative Adam Sella are intentionally working as propagandists for the Israeli regime masquerading as objective, neutral New York Times "reporters". Again, this is Judith Miller on steroids. What the fuck

Replying to @TalulaSha

Ynet asks the photographer of "the woman in the black dress" how @nytimes reached her. She explains the rationale of the Israeli journalists Adam Sella & Anat Schwartz: "They called me again and again and explained how important it is to Israeli hasbara." ynet.co.il/laisha/article

that photographer who Anat Schwartz and her relative Adam Sella kept badgering and told "please, tell us what we want to hear, it's important for Israeli hasbara \[propaganda\]", was responsible for the main hoax the entire NYT piece was framed around:

Quote



the sister of a woman cited in the New York Times piece by Jeffrey Gettleman as evidence of "mass rapes" on October 7th has just come out and said "there is no proof that there was rape." Gettleman intentionally begins his piece with a graphic description of the mentioned video
