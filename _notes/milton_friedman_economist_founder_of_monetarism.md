	Friedman also held many views that were unorthodox for a Republican in the 1970’s and 80’s.  He generally opposed American intervention overseas, supported drug/prostitution legalization, and supported same sex marriage.  He was ideologically a libertarian, though not an an-cap like his contemporary Murray Rothbard or the big-“L” Libertarian Party.

			Yeah, Friedman in fact described himself as a “liberal,” which to him meant maximizing personal freedom (in terms of both social and economic issues) and not “progressive” as it does to most Americans.

				He was progressive in the way that many of these issues he held such as same sex marriage, was illegal due to government law, and repealing that law, gettting rid of government in everyday life, is exactly what libertarians believe in. Doesnt matter the issues were progressive, but government restricting it was the true concern to him.

					God I love this comment. It's weird when people put modern standards on people even a few decades back.  Classical Liberalism is pretty much the foundational principles of the country, the things we should all agree on yet not necessarily on how to handle them.  Government should be used when absolutely necessary,  and personal rights to autonomy, property, etc should be paramount.  Whether it's seen as progressive then, or now, or before then is irrelevant. If your argument against gay marriage is one based on your personal religious beliefs they have no place in civics. Legalization of drugs and prostitution are still pretty wildly "progressive" values, and the fact that they're shared essentially by only the more extreme left and the libertarian all the way to ancap right,  shows that at its core there is a personal autonomy question at play. 
					
					If a person ought be secure in their person, papers and effects such as the 4th outlines, the choice to change your mental state is fundamental.  This is a right we trampled and then we recognized, upon repealing prohibition... but only for the one good drug that was more culturally ingrained (that's definitely not as or more dangerous and insidious than any others). These things are taken for granted too often, and each person's right to be against same sex marriage ought be respected, just as others rights to have one should. If we can understand the 2nd amendment how can we not extend that balance of safety/comfort and freedom to what seem honestly trivial in comparison?

						Classical liberalism means protecting the rights of property owners, which included the right to own other people as slaves for the first 90 years in this country. The liberal rights are never universal. Friedman is clearly showing this here, as he rejoices in the fact that the “illegal” workers don’t have rights. 
						
						If we are to all “agree on these foundational principles,” our agreement should be in that they are severely lacking and we should seek to build a society with better principles.

								There is no such thing as miracles. 
								So much so that today Chile faces an epidemic of suicide among the elderly because they lack political programs to make basic care for people in their twilight years affordable. 
								The benefits of that strong economy are not distributed among the Chileans, why do you think every once in a while they make French protests look tame? 
								
								The concept of HDI was created precisely because the economy is far from being an indicator of how well a country is faring. US being one of the most powerful in the world and not even providing drinkable water to all its citizens is the go to textbook example. 
								
								A strong economy means nothing if most citizens can't reap the benefits of it.

		Because he was an economist first and had political beliefs second. American intervention overseas is mostly expensive and benefits a small group of US arms manufacturers. Drug and prostitution legalization would improve GDP and the health of those involved, and likewise the outcomes for families with same sex marriage improves their outcomes.

				I'd say the racist propaganda was the most effective yes. Cocaine for example was claimed to affect blacks differently.  It made them hypersexual to the point of being rapists, murderous violent and superhuman essentially. It was said that .32 caliber rounds wouldn't be enough to take down a "cocainized black", so particularly in the south whole departments changed police service pistols to. 38 to compensate.

			That's not really the kind of exploitation people are talking about. Like, we know they are taking jobs literally no one else will do. To the point where in states where they've gone really harsh with expelling immigrants there were seasons where farmers' entire crops literally rotted in the fields because they couldn't get anyone to pick them. Immigrants live in the fields and migrate across the country with the picking season (as different crops ripen at different times, in different climates across the harvest season, they move with the crops), so for big chunks of the year they don't technically have homes, just temporary barrack-type living quarters. It's a rough, very specific life almost no American citizens are able to do. 
			
			So it's a strange warping of the market that I'd label exploitation and gives an odd example of global/nation-specific Capitalism failing as a concept. We need them. They are worth more than they are being paid, because it has caused huge upsets when we don't have them. We can't actually pay them what they are worth, because part of that worth is based on their low pay, so we do everything we can to make sure they don't understand how much they are worth. It's really the only strategy we have. That's sort of where the exploitation comes in. 
			
			As an example, say one state kicks all the illegal immigrants out right before apple season, or god help them, asparagus season. The crops can only be picked by human hands. They rot in the field, prices of fruit go up, people grumble. The problem is, NEXT season those farmers are either out of business, or start farming something else they have invented machines to pick, and go into debt buying those machines. Federal bailout money for the farmers is everywhere. Grocery stores either start getting their fruit and vegetables from Mexico and the money moves out of the US, as does the USA's control over their food supply, or states more friendly to immigrants start farming asparagus and make lots of money. There has been huge upset, the economy is negatively effected, politics between nations may be negatively effected, an entire state takes a massive hit and needs economic bailout money from the Federal government and my tax dollars. 
			
			Instead of the money going to your state for grants and new jobs it goes to prop up a state halfway across the country who hates immigrants. The migrants that have moved to another state picking asparagus are paid exactly the same, despite the fact that their presence or absence has cost the US billions. They are technically worth those billions, because we only lost that money because we needed them but they weren't there, but they won't get any of those billions. They can't be allowed to know that worth and are kept as ignorant and frightened of deportation as possible, which is easy with a combination of the language barrier, the lack of public education where they grew up, and the extreme isolation they are kept in, in the barracks in the fields- sometimes only getting a chance for a ride to get groceries from town once every two weeks, sometimes not permitted to go in person at all and are expected to give the farmer a grocery list and some money, and often forbidden cell phones. So, a bit of exploitation.

				The alternatives are, to him, (1) shut the border down, and stop these people from taking jobs they want, or (2) give them public benefits and put regulations on their employers such that either there are no longer any jobs or the net benefit to the country is a negative.

				He'd be right if one didn't consider the fact that a sucessful enough company can manipulate those laws and preferences to make more money.
				
				It is only a valid argument if the system of businesses and the system of rules those businesses have to follow are completely decoupled. Which in the real world is never the case, at least under the form of capitalism we have today, perhaps under any form of capitalism. If money is a proxy for power, and corportations exist to make money, it is really difficult for them not to have power over the organisations enforcing and making the rules.

					The paradox of having the power to not let anyone abuse of it is always going to be an issue under any system, unless one day we can have an immortal, incorruptible and benevolent leader. Until then, only the education and vigilance of the masses can protect us from the hands of abusive rulers. The separation of powers is an attempt to address the tendency of concentrated power to corrupt, at the cost of some inefficiency.

			I would use his logic to state that Slavery is a net good to the economic masters. Employees are a cost, they are a liability. Slaves are assets. You can sell them, you can breed them and sell their offspring. AND you get valuable work out of them at whatever it costs to keep them fed and alive.

	I'm an economist. I have a great amount of respect for Milton Friedman's contributions to the study of economics. His book *A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960* alone (joint with Anna Schwartz) is an epic achievement. He developed some ground-breaking macroeconomic theory that forms the cornerstone of many modern macro models. His Nobel is well deserved. 

	But he was also so out to lunch on so many things. He moved heavily into the realm of political thought in the 1970s, and seemed to base much of his political thinking on antiquated economic theory that had been discarded or significantly improved upon in the discipline beginning around the 1950s (e.g., game theory, the economics of information, market imperfections, etc.).

	So on behalf of all economists, let me say that Friedman's political views--such as those he outlined in this video--are not at all representative of the field of economics as a whole. Sure, you'll find some economists who think this way. But it is not the prevailing way of thinking, and in particular you should not take the fact that he was a luminary in the field of economics as having any bearing on the validity of his *political* views.

		Would you be willing to answer a rather blunt question?  My intention is not to make this personal or rude in anyway. I guess I just always considered economists as essentially cheerleaders of capitalism. Never giving a proper respect for the massive damage it is doing to human life, dignity or the environment.  I don't know the field other than an intro college class and what I've glean from life/learning.  The whole economic system, from my perspective, seems completely unsustainable and designed for inequality.  Does the field of economics, in your opinion, grapple with these subjects?  Do they have any input or methods of addressing them?  Don't feel obligated to respond. I understand it is a big question and you may not have time. If you commit any time I promise I will read and reflect on what you said. My goal is to learn about an area I don't know much about.

			Economics is really the study of how people (individuals and groups) balance interests and make choices. I think calling economists cheerleaders of capitalism is a bit like calling anthropologists cheerleaders of phrenology or calling doctors cheerleaders of lobotomies. The opinions and perspectives change over time, and absolutely influence real world outcomes, but the field itself is significantly more nuanced.
			
			Another way to look at this is that Karl Marx was doing (among other things) a whole lot of economic thought, obviously with the same kind of critiques of the system you’re mentioning here.

			I am an economist. Would you say a political scientist that studies American politics is a cheerleader for our inherently dysfunctional system or someone that is studying the reality we live in?
			
			Macroeconomists use economic models to forecast the economy. There is no cheerleading involved, it is simply modeling the world we live in and using that to predict the future world. 
			
			I think generally, economists believe that markets are an efficient way to distribute resources (as in the way to generate the most economic growth), however, most economists also consider the distributional effects of policy (who is benefitting). 
			
			Friedman is an ideological extreme, as OP mentioned. 
			
			There are also recognized market failures, when the market doesn’t deliver optimal outcomes. The costs of smoking aren’t internalized in the price of cigarettes, so the government should take action to tax it to discourage the consumption.

			I’m not OP, and I’m only a PhD student, but I’ll take a stab at your questions. Please don’t crucify me lol. 
			
			Friedman is part of this class of neoclassical economists that arose after WWII. Their motivating philosophy was basically that markets are efficient and the government should intervene as little as possible. Sort of the “cheerleaders” you describe. I think, and I think others would agree with me, that the field no longer holds this view, at least not as stringently. Indeed, many economists today try to tackle these difficult questions of income inequality, healthcare, etc. Part of the problem is that figuring out the causes of things can be quite difficult, and then, if you can ascertain the cause with some confidence, creating policy that doesn’t lead to some unintended consequences is *also* difficult. 
			
			For me personally, I study environmental econ because I want to help tackle that side of problem. I would not describe myself as a cheerleader of market-based economies, but I haven’t yet encountered a system to replace it. There is discussion about a “circular economy” or a “sustainable-growth economy”, but I haven’t seen a practical way to implement those things.

			In essence, economics is the study of the market, just as physics/chemistry/biology is to nature. Models are designed to explain why the market is working this way and what brings what. There’s no perfect model to describe/predict the market, just as there’s no single equation to describe everything in the universe (well, not yet). Even if there is, people will still do irrational things and fuck things up. At least there are a lot of things we now know not to do because of the study of economics (e.g. don’t over-print your fiat money to try to boost your weak-ass economy). It can only provide assistance and short-term guidance, not long-term solutions.

			Very few economists that I know would consider illegal immigration preferable to legal immigration, as Friedman evidently did. I'll outline a few reasons. First and foremost, there are moral problems with that. Having a class of people who contribute to a society but do not get to share equally in the benefits and protections of that society is morally wrong.
			
			Second, even ignoring the moral implications, giving immigrants a stake in the benefits of society is likely to increase attachment and make them contribute more to it, both economically and socially.
			
			Third, there is very little evidence of widespread abuse of social programs by legal immigrants. So the whole premise of Friedman's argument, which is that legal immigrants are worse than illegal ones because they come in and leech off the social welfare system is simply not true as a whole. Certainly there are individual cases where it happens, but as a group, the evidence I've seen suggest that immigrants do *less* of this kind of thing than non-immigrants, not more.

				Friedman wasn't making a moral argument. In fact, he called it a paradox, probably in part because of the moral implications. 
				
				>giving immigrants a stake in the benefits of society is likely to increase attachment and make them contribute more to it
				
				If they crossed the border illegally, I'd argue they already have a pretty big stake. 
				
				>Third, there is very little evidence of widespread abuse of social programs by legal immigrants. So the whole premise of Friedman's argument, which is that legal immigrants are worse than illegal ones because they come in and leech off the social welfare system
				
				Maybe he was making this argument, but I don't think so. For one, is it really "abusing" the welfare state if you're working a minimum wage job and supporting a family, like many illegal immigrants are? Then there's social security, among other social institutions that illegal immigrants pay into but will never use.

				I mean that's not really what he's saying? He is clearly against all those social safety nets provided by the state and thus what he is saying is that workers who will do jobs others don't want to and thus contribute to the country without taking anything from the state are preferably to those that won't. He would probably say the same about the average American.

			The jobs themselves are not "unworkable" by nature - it's because no employer is going to pay a US citizen a legal wage for the same job when they can pay someone else under the table significantly less. Therefor, no one is going to work it because it's unfair. 
			
			Definitely not the same as "oh hey guys no one here wants to work those jobs because they are lazy. So thank god we got these illegal immigrants here"

	Not sure why you all think he's wrong.

	Illegal immigration is the importation of a slave class. The people who whine about food prices exploding if we don't bring the southerners in are arguing for a slave class.

	If the slave class works, and gets no welfare or SS, yes, the country benefits. 

	But if they do get benefits,  now it's a net loss for the country,  unless you are counting on ways to allow them to vote, because statistically,  they lean left.

	Then you're importing a new voter base.

	All of the above can be true, and there really isn't a counter argument that will fly.

	Cynical r's like the labor, democrats think it's a path to permanent rule.

	BS. I've stated this before. Illegal immigration depresses low end wages. Some businesses love this because it lowers their costs. They don't have to pay taxes or provide healthcare. They push their healthcare services to the local hospital system. Their children also go to local schools and in some states like Arizona qualify for in state college tuition. These benefits are surely not without cost. So just how much does illegal labor really cost? Let's pay Americans fair wages!

	When you bring cheap foreign labor, because its like subsidizing their salaries, it discourage their employers to invest in tools and machinery that would increase labor productivity. Its the path to de-industrialization.

	It’s just not true though. An illegal immigrant often can’t get any of these “jobs that other people are unwilling to do”. Sometimes they can, sure. But usually they end up living in illegal immigrant enclaves within cities where they remain unemployed, unbanked, untaxed and unnoticed. Sometimes, in the worst cases they end up recruited into sex and drug trafficking. 

	Cleary being classified as illegal certainly isn’t deterring people from attempting to cross our border. So if it isn’t having the desired effect of deterrence, I would argue that it’s probably beneficial to just not classify them as illegal to begin with. Give them a job right from the moment they enter the country, similar to the old days of Ellis Island. We need people to rebuild our roads, bridges, railroads, water and power grid. We need people to pick crops and work the slaughterhouses. Give them work and places to live and pay legal rent and legal taxes. 

	And while you’re at it, do the same thing for our homeless population.
