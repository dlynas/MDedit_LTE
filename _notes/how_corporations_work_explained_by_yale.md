	There are a lot of people in the comments talking about how Wolff doesn’t understand economics are completely missing the point. Even in such cases where shareholders are truly just investing needed capitol into the company, no one ever talks about it in terms of workers investing their labor into the company. If a company faces changes, no one hires consultants to figure out which shareholders should just be forced to take losses, it’s the workers who are let go. The point he’s making isn’t that this isn’t the way things are, it’s that the way things are is unjust.

					I point this out to people a lot. I have family that are very successful but will tell you they are poor and taxes are to blame. These people own a company where, on average, they do $6M in revenue at 15% profit on their worst year in 35 years of ownership to 40% on their best year. Their average employee pay $15 per hour. They walk away with $2m and say how bad the economy is while paying their employees $35k-$40K per year. Like bro, you took home 60 years' worth of pay in one year compared to your employees. While being on vacation 30 out of 45 calendar days. I think you will be fine.

					I don't get how many people in the comments can't understand this. NO ONE IS AGAINST STOCKS AND SHARES AS A CONCEPT. In fact plenty of socialists think that workers should be given shares in the company they work for. The issue is billionaires buying stocks and not having any input into the company beyond that, and raking in millions and millions for no work at all. That is the issue. Nothing else

			This. The "losses" that the shareholders take just mean they cant buy another mansion or maybe they have to hold off on another luxury car. Poor poor shareholders, losing so much. Meanwhile, someone who is one missed paycheck away from not being able to pay a basic necessity like rent will be fired so that the shareholders can minimize their own losses as if they are in any danger of homelessness or starvation. They would rather others suffer than have the off chance they have to downsize their multimillion dollar home.

				They write off their losses at tax time so they don’t have to pay as much tax as the middle class.

				* 🟪 **[WaitForItTheMongols](https://www.reddit.com/user/WaitForItTheMongols)** ⬆️ 18 _(2024-01-17 09:29:17)_

					That's not how write offs work.
					
					Say you make $10k this year, you invest it, and the investment evaporates.
					
					Tax time comes around, government says "I see here you made $10k, you owe us $2k of that as tax", the write off says "well but I also LOST $10k, so no net income". So you don't pay tax on the money that's gone.
					
					Someone who loses $10k shouldn't have to pay tax and lose $12k. While someone who still has $10k (or at least spent that $10k on something they got use out of) makes sense to pay their tax and have a net gain of $8k.
					
					Nobody wants to have losses to write off. You don't want to lose $10k in order to save $2k of tax. But the point is that we don't want to tax people for money that disappeared.
					
					Meanwhile, you're comparing them to the middle class which is also not really valid, since most of the middle class has some form of 401k or retirement plan or other investments and therefore should be using all the same means to account for making their tax burden accurate.

					* 🟥 **[Getyourownwaffle](https://www.reddit.com/user/Getyourownwaffle)** ⬆️ 9 _(2024-01-17 10:07:54)_

						None of that is true.  
						
						You make 10k.  That money is taxed as it comes to you.  You invest what is left, around 6k.  That money is not taxed anymore, until you sell what you invested.  Then let's say you make 2K on that investment. The original 6K is free for you to take, but the other 2k is taxed at the capital gains rate.
						
						Now if you invested that 6k and then sold it for a loss of 4k, then you get to take the loss at the capital gains rate too.  But nothing happens on the tax side until the gains or losses are actually realized.

				You do realize that there are plenty of people who aren’t multimillionaires that invest in the stock market right? It’s not just rich people trying to buy their third mansion. 
				
				You all are consistently missing the point of the people criticizing wolf. It’s not about a bunch of people being apologists for rich people but simply explaining the system and why it works like it does. What I don’t understand is why you and those that agree with you don’t like the current economic system itself. If it were properly regulated and we had taxes that allowed the government to siphon excess wealth off the top to redistribute it to lower economic classes via food stamps, tax credits, and assistance programs would you still hate the system itself? If not maybe the problem isn’t capitalism but the way it’s currently implemented.

		And he's right. We're just all brainwashed to believe, even if we claim otherwise, that those who have access to capital now somehow did something to deserve it other than being born with that access in some way. 
		
		The story of your access to capital and your family's access to capital is worth looking at. The story of why a very similar family not far from you does not have that access to capital is also worth looking at.

		First the shareholders absolutely take losses.  Dividends are only paid when there is profit and original investments often disappear as a stock price lowers.  T is a gamble.
		Second, the workers are paid regardless of the company profits.  No rush is taken by the employees.
		There is nothing stopping the workers from purchasing shares and receiving the same dividend.
		Workers make a deal, they trade labor for a set monetary rate.  Worker works, company paid the rate, after that, neither party owes the other, they are even. Labor is not an investment, it's a trade.
		More importantly, in a capitalist system there is nothing stopping a company like proposed (workers entitled to all profits) from existing.

		* 🟧 **[IntelligentBid87](https://www.reddit.com/user/IntelligentBid87)** ⬆️ 18 _(2024-01-17 09:30:41)_

			You seem to think everything is equitable. Rich people can gamble and lose more because they have more. "Poor people can also gamble" is not a reasonable statement. Yes labor is trade, but if all you have to offer is your labor, you have to take what you can get. Most often the trade for workers is coming from a place of weakness. That's why minimum wages exist or companies, with their extreme leverage, could pay people even less and they'd be forced to take it. Forcing people to take a shitty trade or starve is not the same as a billionaire risking and losing millions.

			Except for the fact, of course, that their share of the value they generate is, by design, low enough to prevent them from doing precisely that. The working class is paid precisely such that it can renew its potential for labor and sell it to the owning class again the next day.

			Note: This only applies to the US. I have no idea how it works elsewhere. 
			
			While I mostly agree with you, I think the devil is in the minutia. There are lots of small things that are not only unfair, but also go against common sense. The clearest example: Captains gains taxed at a 21% rate, as long as they're not speculative (one year ownership). It's flat, even if you make 10 million a year (afaik, please correct if I'm wrong...). 
			
			Meanwhile, for a self-employed worker (much riskier position than that of a shareholder) IRS + SE can top 40%, 50% if state taxes.  Source: I'm both an investor and SMB.  Surely, the system should reward those *starting* the businesses as much as those *investing in* them?

		On the contrary, he points out one of the fundamental flaws of modern capitalism that goes against the fundamental concept of how economics work and the purpose an economy serves. Thats why western economies are in a constant crisis, real income is in decline and their role in fulfilling social needs is in decline. Most people, like yourself, have no idea about macroeconomics and confuse finances with economics and macroeconomics, ending up defending whatever the status quo is, because they know nothing better.

		It does not. The point is perfectly valid. Many people in our current system profit tremendously off existing wealth. Often which they did not earn. They inherited, and even if they themselves have done quite well, they have done well by virtue of winning the birth lottery, not by virtue of their own labors, skills, or merit. 
		
		The system is fundamentally unjust and the primary aim of our economic system as it stands is to suck wealth out of the bottom and shift it to the top. 
		
		Many people will talk of issues like taxing the rich as "redistribution of wealth" like it's some toxic concept, but of course this is exactly what has been happening in mass for the past 50+ years, except all the wealth is being redistributed upwards. 
		
		The system we live in is fundamentally broken and unjust. It sucks the efforts of the many for the benefits of the few.

							The machines? The building? the first wages? who is buying them at the start? and what if the company needs to make an investment?
							
							That is why capital is needed and stock markets exists.. and they are allowed to earn profits on that, since 1. they could have used that money for other purposes right now (a holiday idk) --> it has a time value on it (inflation, risk free interest rate etc.),  2. the company can fail, and their money is at risk (the risk premium).
							
							Legit, you can question the morality of the amount the stockholders are earning or how little the workers are working. What you cannot question though is that capital and shareholders/debtholders are needed. So: there is a need and shareholders see it fulfilled = which makes the dividends earned...

While an investor may give lots of money to a company, they are doing so on the understanding that the laborers of that company will continue to make that which will earn the company enough money that the investor will profit from their investment.

			That’s not true, your buying those shares from the original shareholder allows them to recoup their investment, reduce or eliminate their risk exposure to that company, and reallocate their money to other investments or spend it.
			
			If you’re buying shares from someone else who did that, or just trading public shares on the market, you’re contributing to finding the true value of that company based on expected future returns. That action (along with others buying and selling) helps the company raise new capital by determining the true value of its equity.
			
			On a small enough scale, it’s the same thing whether you’re buying stock in Microsoft or buying the single ownership share of your uncle’s pizzeria so that he can retire and you can take over the business. You’re taking on the business risk so that someone else can reallocate their resources to something else.

			You aren't -- the person who originally purchased the share is the one that put money into the company. What you're doing is buying their right to future returns from the company.
			
			This is a basic function of allowing investors to sell their interest in a company; if there were no way to get your money back out of the company without the company giving it back to you, then either:
			
			* Companies would have to 'buy back' shares from investors and re-sell them, which would churn up a whole lot of effort and time to get the same outcome
			* Companies would be forced to pay MUCH higher dividends, because the investor's original capital is sunk for forever, so the return on investment would have to be CRAZY good to make up for the loss of liquidity.
			
			If the second thing were true, then basically companies would be forced to exploit employees much more -- which is the opposite of what people are trying to accomplish.

The corporation’s share on the market is already sold/traded in times of IPO or issues new shares, that’s when they get the cash. Unless you are buying those shares before it hits the market, which most investors don’t, then your dollars doesn’t enrich the corporation. Whether the shares goes up/down or more shares traded or not, does not affect the cash flow of the corporation. Bags of money don’t enter the loading dock of the corporation.

	I'm surprised people are defending the late stage capitalism we are in now.

	50 years ago, mom &amp; pop stores were on every street. Common people had ownership.

	These were mostly closed due to places like Blockbuster, Best Buy, Walmart. Then, along came Amazon and Apple which closed the rest. This happened in non-retail as well like farming. Things are cleaner and safer and bigger, but we are truly the working class now.

	Sure, some of us have shares, but when you see how many shares the rich have you realize the scope of caplitalism (e.g. you may have 1,000 shares which is alot, while Elon has 400,000,000 shares in that one company plus shares in other companies).

	For example, I worked in a small 100-person tech company generating $250 million dollars annually. This was bought/owned by a parent company. All of the revenue was siphoned off to the parent company while we argued about giving people a 5% raise every year.

	Workers of these companies generate tremendous wealth and enjoy very little of it.

	What he’s describing is a cherry picked scenario to point out a flaw in capitalism (ie people who produce no value but extract value thru dividends). While this definitely occurs, it certainly ignores people like retail investors, pensions, entrepreneurs, etc… who all create value thru their own work and use their earnings to invest in businesses for growth potential. 

	He only talks about the upsides of capital investment but doesn’t mention any of the downside, which is losing your entire investment (something that happens quite often).

	This is definitely the case in the US where companies pay the absolute minimum for maximum output from workers (by pay, that also includes benefits and perks). The days of companies looking after their human capital and employees staying for a lifetime are long gone as the relationship is purely transactional.

	While it does take some skill to know which companies to invest in, else take a loss, it is infinitely better being the shareholder with money to invest since you are the publicly traded company’s priority. I feel like this attitude among companies has only gotten worse through the pandemic and inflation (ex. Boeing is a prime recent example). This is really creating inequality between the workers struggling to stay afloat (including the middle class) and those that are comfortable getting even more rich. There needs to be some correction.

	For those who want to go down the rabbit hole, this is called the Labor Theory of Value. Originally proposed by Adam Smith and later further developed by Karl Marx the theory states that the value of a good or service is determined by the total amount of labor required to produce it. There's plenty of criticism of it, the "great contradiction" (that the most labor intensive industries don't create the most valuable products) is even noted by Marx himself.

	Fundamentally though, whether or not Marx was completely correct about value, this resonates today because it highlights a core flaw in capitalism which is "Rentierism." The more individuals devoting capital and time to being Rentiers (collecting dividends, rent, etc) and not actually being creators and innovators - the less value is being created in the economy.  This leads to plenty of problems, I would say Boeing being an easy to highlight and recent example of this.

Eventually people get to a tipping point where they can't keep up with this economic demand from the top and an economic recession occurs. And the cycle continues and it's mostly the working class that suffers from recessions of course.

	It really depends on the company though. He's not wrong and the wealth gap is rapidly growing. The company I work for is publicly traded and yes the top investors (shareholders) are private equity firms (making money for someone else), executive of the company (they own under 10% of the total shares), anonymous investors (exactly who he describes) and the rest are employees and likely Joe Q Public looking for a way to make money. 

	We get, as a part of our compensation, RSU's (restricted share units) and general options as a part of our compensation. There are conditions attached (generally when they vest) and are issued at the value at that time. We also get opportunities to purchase general stocks at a discount from time to time. 

	He is not wrong in that the wealthy control the market and have the purchasing power. My piddly options (when the vest several years down the road) have allowed me to pay off credit cards, do some reno's, etc and thats only if they are in the positive.

Grandma gives a person their shares (inferring the person is a moocher who is getting undeserved gain) and 2. A person steals money to then buy stock (outright saying that a person is benefiting from ill begotten means).

	Now, perhaps he makes some interesting points, but I only half listened from there on out. I don’t know what the percentage of shares are for those two groups (the first, probably a good amount, the second I doubt very much at all) but He completely ignored how many people in the country also get these dividends. They buy them, usually with their retirement accounts, or benefit from them through pensions.

	I understand theres a problem in the amount of wealth the 1% have ( as of 2021 54% of stock owned), but his framing here isn’t talking about how best to ensure more people can benefit from the system, he is attacking the system. And thats dishonest.
