## (Michael Forster) Hegel's Theory of Truth as ‚ÄúEnduring Communal Consensus‚Äù

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/hegel/comments/1au2sym/michael_forster_hegels_theory_of_truth_as/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hegel/comments/1au2sym/michael_forster_hegels_theory_of_truth_as/)

> I have been reading a book by Michael Forster called Hegel's Idea of the The Phenomenology of the Spirit.
> 
> As we all know, there are countless interpretations of Hegel, including some that believe Hegel's Absolute Idealism is a post-kantian non-metaphysical (in the strict sense), epistemological attempt to reconcile transcendental, subjective idealism with objectivity.
> 
> This guy, Michael Forster, is really interesting and lucid but his interpretation of Hegel's theory of truth simply sounds too fucking much for me.
> 
> He says that truth for Hegel is that in which a certain national tradition agrees (communal consensus) and that is both a necessary and sufficient condition for it to be truth. Something can't be true as long as there isn't enduring communal consensus and something must be true if the is such enduring communal consensus. 
>      He offers some hasty counter-arguments to some hasty critiques of this theory but to me, even if he speaks about the "torch of wisdom" of a certain nation, it sounds like a form of a radical historicism, which ends up reminding me more of cultural relativist like Herder ‚Äî whom the author loves to reference all the time as an inspiration of Hegel and about whom he has written books and translate the Gesamtwerk ‚Äî than a rationalist like Hegel.
> 
> I mean Hegel inaugurates historicism but in my view he does so not in the sense the "the historical is the true" but in the sense that history and historical development of thought is the precondition of knowledge to be acquired and evalutated through the dialectical or the scientific method. History may be integral to the unravelling of such a process and communal consensus may be a strong indicator for its validity but claiming that "enduring communal consensus is both the necessary and sufficient condition for truth" sounds absurd to me.

	I'm unfamiliar with Forster but this sounds remarkably similar to the early Habbermas' conception of political truth as that which would be arrived at by consensus in an ideal democratic political arrangement. Bohman's *Jurgen Habermas* has some discussion about this position if you're interested in looking into it further, but I gawk at Habermas' proposal in the same manner you do with Forster's

		I mean, I think of a theory that prioritizes consensus and recognition in ethics and politics in a kind of communicative historicism way easier than in the domain of knowledge. It has a democratic vibe to it. But man, even political consensus needs to be grounded in valid, correspondence knowledge to even have the slightest normative grounding...

	Forster's conception of what is truth for Hegel appears to be widely idiosyncratic (in respect to what more traditional and metaphysical interpretations have tended to say) ‚Äîas you correctly stated it‚Äî portraying him as a defender of some sort of radical historicism and, with that of course, with some version of cultural relativism. 

	You hit the nail when you say that even though Hegel inaugurates historicism in the western philosophical tradition, that doesn't mean that Hegel is defending some sort of relativistic conception of truth, as if we could have as many truths as communities existed in a certain historical epoch or as if the only criterion by means of which we could determine something to be true was a de facto criterion without any type of normative constrain. That leaves unanswered the fundamental question about what are the authoritative reasons, the principles or grounds that enable a certain community to conceive of something as a piece of knowledge or as a true statement or as an obligatory practice, etc. Furthermore, how could a community of speakers distinguish between the appearance of knowledge and knowledge itself if they only had at their disposal the "continued communal consensus" as a form of knowing? This is ridiculous, but for how many years does that consensus needs to hold? How spread must it be? My point is that that idea reduces philosophy, at least Hegel's, to some form of "trascendental sociology" or whatever you want to call it and if we look at his mature system, nothing could be further from the case. My impression is that Forster leaves Hegel not only in an very exotic position but also in one that is tremendously difficult to defend. Take, for instance, what Hegel says on the Logic about the subject proper of Logic itself (here we have a particularly insightful case):

	"Accordingly, logic is to be understood as the system of pure reason, as the

	realm of pure thought. This realm is truth unveiled, truth as it is in and for

	itself. It can therefore be said that this content is the exposition of God as he is in his eternal essence before the creation of nature and of a finite spirit." p29, The Science of Logic, translated by George di Giovanni. 

	As you can see, for Hegel, truth as it is in and for itself is not inherently related to history, at least not superficially.  

	Now, after saying that all that, I think that Forster, nevertheless, is onto something. How could anything be true if it wasn't, at least minimally, conceived to be truth by a certain community of speakers? If we follow Hegel in his position, then a normative claim must be recognized to count as authoritative and that implies that history plays a crucial role in Hegel's system. Moreover, the role that history plays is not only that of being the "stage" inside of which truth reveals itself because if normative claims are intimately related to practices of recognition, then the rules or orientations of those very same practices must have some import on what we are to count as truth or authoritative or whatever. Now the question becomes what are the normative constrains that a community of speakers must have and what are the right practices that they must engage in, so that they could correctly claim something that they consider to be true is, in fact, true? That's the Hegelian path in my opinion. One in which history and metaphysics become necessarily intertwined. 

	Best regards.

		Thank you for this comment. You took the time to unravel some arguments I didn't really take the time to unravel myself, knowing intuitively that I can bring them forth if I wanted and there no point in arguing for something quite obvious as this. 
		
		I like your remark about Forster's insight ‚Äî even though exaggerated ‚Äî about the socio-historical conditions of knowledge and how recognition (a social condition) is also a epistemological precondition for knowledge as well. It's part of Hegel's historical dialectical development of shapes of consciousness within history, not irrelevant to it. 
		     I would totally agree that Forster gets the idea about the historicity of knowledge but tips too much on the historicism end. I intend to continue the book to the History and Historicism in Hegel chapter  (I don't have time for more as I'm writing a paper) precisely because I don't think his exaggeration is entirely misguided and it can be fruitful if read by a critical distance.

			I fully concur with your assessment. Forster's interpretation of Hegel's stance on truth is not without merit, given Hegel's emphasis on history's central role in his philosophy. However, Forster does not adequately define the normative and historical constraints necessary for a historical consensus to be authentically regarded as 'truth'. Additionally, for a way of life to be deemed not just 'politically stable' but also 'reflectively' so, its institutional framework must be defensible both philosophically and from a 'common sense' perspective. This implies that the adherents of a certain way of life should be capable, under certain conditions, of justifying the rationality of their institutional and historical milieu. Consequently, this necessitates that such a way of life is free from internal contradictions that renders it unstable, in addition to allowing individuals to identify themselves with the universal, in the sense of having a certain structure that allows individual agents to act in ways that promote both the individual and the universal good.
			
			There's much more to discuss, but overall, I believe Forster's book is commendable. Reading it, I initially felt frustrated by his apparent underestimation of Hegel's rationalism, fearing he lacked philosophical restraint. However, if you manage to relate your perspective with his in a productive or critical way as you said, Forster's work becomes an invaluable resource for elucidating the historicist aspects of Hegel's philosophy.  
			
			
			Best regards.
			
			PS: there was a recent article by Mark Alznauer titled "Untrue Concepts in Hegel's Logic". There he deals with the question of truth in Hegel's system. I can't recommend it enough.

	Just my take on this great issue, and I hope it's somehow helpful:

	This is close to what C. S. Peirce claims.  I think it is partially correct. 

	**If** one is a deflationist about truth like Wittgenstein and Ayer, in the sense that "P is true" is basically equivalent to "P," then we only ever have belief. So objectivity is a matter of going about choosing our beliefs in the proper way. This propriety is of course normative and basically derives from the Enlightenment ideal of autonomy. Popper's description of science as a "second order" tradition is maybe the best expression of what this amounts to. 

	**On the other hand**, representationalism (truth as correspondence) makes sense when we are contrasting imagination with perception. But representationalism is meaningless when, like Kant, we put reality completely out of reach, beyond all possible experience. Correspondence is lost in such a context. We might note that even ordinary objects are "interpretations" in some sense, as in features of a form of life which are not the only way to organize or articulate the scene. 

	>Something can't be true as long as there isn't enduring communal consensus and something must be true if the is such enduring communal consensus.¬†

	I think you dig out Hegel's optimism here, which is pretty hard for us nowadays to embrace. Peirce talked instead of an explicitly normative "consensus at infinity." At what beliefs would the ideal inquiry (the ideal scientific community) eventually arrive ? I think the point is to avoid a confusing Kantian dualism and a messy theory of truthmakers.  If we only have belief, and inquiry is the fixation of belief, then scientific inquiry is an ideal method or approach to establishing beliefs --and such beliefs are simultaneously an organization of the world's intelligible aspect, its "form."

		Well, to be honest, I think it's possible that people didn't really understand a philosopher ‚Äî especially a incredibly obscure philosopher ‚Äî properly in their time, and I find fruitful various attempts at interpretation.
		
		The thing about Forster though is that he completely historicizes Hegel to the extent that he becomes too naive, romantic and irrecognizable (in the bad sense).

	Forster doesn't mean cultural relativism by "enduring communal consensus". You're missing the importance of the *enduring* part here. You can have consensus about anything just like you can believe anything to be true, but not all beliefs can last. The form of truth for Hegel is the form of life given personality, i. e. that which is self-sustaining and self-perpetuating and achieves an equilibrium between universality and individuality.¬†He would argue many forms of life are inherently unsustainable, that is: individuals fail to recognize themselves in the universal consensus (e. g. because they're slaves, because they're subjects of an emperor, because they're enlightened rationalists living in a society based on religious dogma) and so the consensus can't endure and must be replaced by a new consensus.

	The point is to know the form of truth, not that what is now consensus will necessarily endure.

		I understand the concept of endurance in this context but when you do completely away with correspondence theory of truth inevitably problems will arise.
		
		People believed in the geocentric model for at least 2000 years. Does this count as endurance? If there is no correspondence in truth, then do we have any reason to believe something is true today if we know that it is possible that it will be refuted 2000 years from now?

			I think Hegel's answer here would be to bite the bullet and say that as all empirical things are finite and contingent, so too is our knowledge of them Our knowledge of the natural world will never be complete and maybe an enduring consensus will never be achievable there.
			
			We can have complete knowledge of another domain though - that of concepts, and we can achieve certainty that our concepts are the only ones possible and that they are not arbitrary constructs, which were some of the most pressing concerns of philosophers after Descartes. It is in this regard that the correspondence theory of truth fails as it does not have anything meaningful to say regarding how our fundamental concepts of being, thinghood, properties, substance, causality, necessity, objectivity, etc. are to be validated and made intelligible. There is nothing for the concept of a "thing" to correspond to and yet the concept of a "thing" is not at all nonsensical. Further, it is conceivable that we can (and do) have an enduring communal consensus on what it means to be a "thing".
			
			Hegel's rationalism is in that concepts for him are true in and for themselves, not merely as relatively true in correspondence with something out there, and indeed that conceptual truth is the absolute truth (as opposed to e. g. empricism or scientific naturalism for whom the absolute standard of truth is to be found in what is non-conceptual, in observable nature).

				I see your point and it's interesting, but it has to relinquish every kind of knowledge except maybe ethical-political theory and conceptual analysis. 
				
				I think Hegel was more ambitious than that. However I will keep this thesis in mind while continuing my journey in the Hegel Studies...

					I see it as securing a foundation for finite knowledge, rather than doing away with it. It's not a problem that contingency exists in the world when you can make sense of contingency in the first place. As far as we know there is no greater significance to the fact that there are 10,000 species of birds - it's a fact of the world that merely has some determinate being and nothing more; it's a *real* thing but not a completely *actualized* thing, not "true" in the fullest sense of the world. What is absolute must also be able to contain what is not absolute within it (i. e. your system needs to account for what cannot be accounted for), necessity must appear contingently (e. g. the ideal laws of physics become actual in the empirical world as just so many distinct material events), God can't be separate from the world as that would impose a limit on them, they must be infinite being *immanent* in finite being (e. g. in the community of believers who by sustaining themselves as a community realize God's infinite being in the world), universality cannot negate individuality (e. g. the ideal state must allow for all distinct individualities to realize themselves as fully as possible), and so on and so forth.

	Wrong and cringe. Does Hegel holds the Logic to the truth criterion of communal consensus? Also, for Hegel communities are alway going to be constituted through contradiction. This sort of pragmatist misappropriation of Hegel is beneath critique. Next!
