The Aperture of Experience

Lessons in Creating an Enduring Image from Ancient Greece

“The hero, then, is not Time, but Timelessness.”\-Henry Miller, Tropic of Cancer 

Introduction

Every representational work of fine art is tasked with depicting some

 thing 

 at some

 time

.Since the age of Einstein, time has been subject to collapsing or distending, ultimately shovedinto a little corner where we say,

 it’s just a perceptual phenomenon, a side effect of being 

. Andthanks to Einstein, even if we require a physical measurement, time is tied to things in the realmeasurement called spacetime. Therefore, the volume occupied by objects is equally subject tocollapsing or distending. These are the ways in which physicists describe the world, but they arealso how ancient Greek art depicted reality.Greek sculptors exercised their creativity in playing with the perceptual bubble of experience by deviating gracefully from the literal and natural in a stylized, symbolic, andimmensely human way. The result of this creativity is to open the aperture of experience to themodern viewer. We still find ourselves appreciating Greek sculpture, despite the chasm of timethat separates us. There is something deeper than age, history or skill that draws us tocontemplate these statues and reliefs. If we consider the subject of all representational art, thedepiction of some

 thing 

 at some

 time,

 the Greeks figured out how to reach any viewer, how toencapsulate their human experience in stasis for any human to encounter. Shouldn’t this be themotive of every representational artist today?It would seem artists educated in a postmodern world are under the impression that theRenaissance, being a common educational starting point for the painter, has already instilled inWestern Art all the worthwhile ideas of picture making. As if Michelangelo‘s interpretation of Greek humanism (see Appendix D) is under-written in anything made today. As painters, weassume Michelangelo’s interpretation of Green humanism is under-written in our art, like abirthright. Or, as postmodernists, we throw the baby out with the bathwater and reject all thingsGreek.The reasons for rejection are valid. Art after the Renaissance has already attemptedand, in my opinion, failed to interpret Greek sculpture. I will not be championing any of theseattempts. There will be no feminized idealism (Baroque painting), no virtuous man for the peopleto measure themselves against (American Colonialism), no opulent testaments to the greatnessof a culture (Napoleon and French Neoclassicism), no weaponizing symbolism to suit imperialistends (The Third Reich). Nothing remotely neo-classical lies ahead. Instead, through aninvestigation and criticism of Greek sculptors’ handling of artistic elements such as pictorial time,current events, scale, symbolism, and allegory, I offer a wholly novel interpretation of Greek artmeant to stabilize the art of the contemporary world and allow the unique ideas of any fine artistto endure.1

On Time

The 21st century’s mania for literalness can be tempered by a rejection of the ‘snapshot’.Our enduring love affair with being able to capture the instantaneous imprisons us in the presentexperience instead of allowing the viewer to wade into the anticipation of the future or reflectionof the past. Would Michaelangelo’s

 David 

 be more legible if he was in the act of casting thestone? In order for the viewer to engage with the work, the artist must make room, must openthe aperture, to allow the viewer enough psychological space in time to enter the image. Thesnapshot is closed to experience, the present is infinitesimally small, it evaporates before it evenmaterializes.Throughout Greek art, time is treated as a pictorial tool. Time, being a singularly humanconcept, can be handled like all aspects of the human experience, symbolically. Likewise, theGreeks were fascinated by the perceptual variance of experience and played with how theydepicted the time expression of an image.

Symbolic Treatment of Time

In more illustrative art forms, like sequential art, the depiction of time is straightforward.One event follows the next in a cellular evolution. Spiderman climbs up the building and in thenext drawing he sees the Green Goblin and each drawing spells out this inevitable encounter.Considering sculpture from ancient Greece, time is not handled on the arrow. In some instancestime is vertical or, in the Classical period, there is a delightfulsuperposition of multiple times occurring in the same pictureplane. This symbolic and stylized stacking of events isrediscovered in the Renaissance, most admirably in theGates of Paradise by Ghiberti. Time spreads itself out withactions happening in modular time from background toforeground or from sky to horizon to ground.Depicting some

 thing 

 at some

 time

 means that timecan be handled creatively. To guide us in this creativity I havesegregated Greek tastes for time into four flavors: eternaltime, supernatural time, all time, and memorialized time.Eternal time is the static appeal of iconography, potent butnot enduring. The art we all laugh at, history painting, suffersfrom what I call memorialized time. We might think we’redepicting something meaningful, but if we memorialize time,if we say “I was here”, we have failed to widen the aperture of experience. The viewer will literallyscroll past our image like a picture of what we had for lunch. Successful modern painters of symbolically “all times” are Hopper, Wyth, and Hockney.2

Eternal Time

The permanence required in such a symbolic and literal treatment of nature makes thedepiction of time in either a sequential or vertical format somewhat inconsequential. Most Archaic sculpture, especially Stelae (gravestones), is concerned with depicting a sort of eternity(see Appendix B). Either time ceases to exist or it is a purely human construct accessible onlyby the depicted. Therefore, most depictions of humans seem to take place in their own world, aworld in which nothing is actively happening. In the Stone Frieze above we see warriors onhorseback. The length of the horses legs and scale of the riders suggests the symbolictreatment of scale. Horses are important and big. Yet, the linear march of time symbolicallyimprisons these riders to forever be riding forward into battle like a fossil embedded in a piece of amber.In this excellent example of the Severe style predicting the tastes of the classical (see Appendix C.I) we notice an evolution of time treatment. Possibly metaphorically, as the day3

proceeds in action from east to west, the Eastern pediment depicts the figures and actions in astatic, almost Archaic arrangement. The west, being the direction of the day’s progress, depictsthe changing taste for action and naturalism. This is a world still inaccessible to us. Yet, it feelsaccessible to someone with a God’s eye view (see Appendix A.II).In the east, Zeus is overseeing preparations for a chariot race. The proportions arenaturalistic but stiff, possibly canonized. The actions are frozen in the past or symbolically in atime that will always be. On the western pediment we see a more active scene. The grace andmotion of the centauromachy predict the Classical unfolded, not a coincidence given that thistemple would be completed at the birth of the true Classical period. Apollo gestures with thestylized pose of an athlete and the humans and centaurs are locked in a momentary battle.This grappling with the depiction of action shows the changing tastes typical of theSevere Style. Nonetheless, time spills out from a central point. The inheritance of the eternalsymbolism from previous eras and eastern cultures is still appreciable. Yet the coming Classicalera’s taste is on display: it will be timeless but not frozen, active but not ‘in action’.

 All Time

I’ve chosen one of my favorite worksof art to represent the prolific Classicalera of Greek sculpture (see AppendixD). Its delicate humanism andpsychological depth make this imageincredibly archival. The little human inthe foreground arrests us. Not because itis a little adult (with all the proportions of an adult and not a child, but, at the scaleof a child) but rather because it forcesour contact. This child has access to us,to our gaze. This particular sculpture isthe stele of a person, not a family. Yet,who is the deceased? In the symbolictreatment of time we can decipher this‘picture’.One interpretation is that the manand woman in profile are the deceased.They obviously coexist in the pictureplane together, belonging to the sameworld. The child would have survived,hence her ability to contact us, the living. And maybe, as I’ve always interpretedthe upper left figure, the messenger wassomeone who never was of this world.Maybe this figure, the one in partialprofile, is the present moment itself, the4
