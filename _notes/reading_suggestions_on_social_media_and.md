## Reading suggestions on social media and performative action.

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/18q9pzk/reading_suggestions_on_social_media_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/18q9pzk/reading_suggestions_on_social_media_and/)

> Basically the title. I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about the inherit performative nature of social media and how, it seems, most will either not acknowledge or do not understand that fact. I think I can define why this seems so obvious to me, but I have not been able to define the observation well enough to articulate it to someone else.
> 
> Does anyone have any reading suggestions that can me solidify and articulate this idea better for myself and for other people? Does anyone have any of their own thoughts that might help nail this down for me? 
> 
> Had some great reading suggestions and discussions from other posts like this, so I hope this is appropriate here. Thanks in advance

	Based on your interest in expanding the concept of the second definition (performative action as in people who virtue signal on social media posts, eg.), you‚Äôre kind of back into the first definition of the previous poster. I do agree that thanks to social media we are putting way, way more of ourselves out in public (or commercial platforms that feel public enough‚Ä¶), to perform ourselves as good people, or people of high status, or whatever. 

	  

	But for a lot of sociology and social psychology, even those intimate personal moments that were originally not recorded and posted were still thoroughly performative, in the sense of fulfilling social roles for others, as a way to satisfy psychological desires for belonging and living a meaningful life for ourselves, eg. being a committed yoga practitioner, faithful churchgoer, or doting grandchild, to use your examples.

	  

	As we‚Äôve inherited it from the linguistic turn in philosophy and social theory, the basic idea of performativity is that on top of saying things to each other that can be true or false (semantics), we say things to each other to try to persuade or command others, or otherwise express how one of us or the other belongs or doesn‚Äôt in a social grouping of some kind (pragmatics). In the past that might have meant simply being a member of a family, or a church, or part of a population of some geographic region, but nowadays it includes many, many more acquaintances and strangers, globally, for whom we perform online.

	  

	Here‚Äôs a some places to look for connections to the idea of performative action; some are more traditionally theoretical, others more directly related to social media. An interesting side note is that social media developed as a technology in the first place out of a generation of computer scientists who decided to try formalizing the philosophical conditions of speech act theory into software programming and interfaces (eg. the Winograd text below).

		So glad you made this connection between the definitions. Great point and great sources!

		Thank you for this, it is very helpful. Just to summarize your point for my own understanding, it seems like the very brief gist is that social roles all have an element of performance to them and that social media has expanded the groups that we perform these actions to (for?). 
		
		This does in some ways help me move past a blockage of understanding‚Äîthat the performative nature of social media is not necessarily mercenary. You mention virtue signaling at the top of your comment and it seems to me that the rest of the comment does a good job explaining that it is not necessarily virtue signaling. This is helpful because it seems unfair and preemptively judgmental to categorize something that seems so wide spread in that way. The idea that this is not a new phenomenon but one that, via technology, has spread from something already established makes what appears on its face to be self serving something deeper and more interesting. 
		
		Just rambling a bit at the end there, but I‚Äôm the student not the master, so it is what it is. Thanks again for your thorough post, was very helpful.
		
		Edit: four words

			To your first gist, yes I think that's about right. Our individual performances are based in the social roles that we strive to achieve or wind up in over the course of our lives, and that social tech acts as a historically specific (calculative, algorithmic, rationalized) medium for those performances. Performances may be archetypal in traditional settings (being in a family, or on a sports team, or at work), but can also involve novel kinds due to social media platform design, eg. engaging in reality TV like behavior for clicks, or being an edgelord posting inflammatory things to an anonymous forum. 
			
			That speaks to the second point maybe too -- by all means don't stop judging people who are clearly posting for surface, instrumental, or as you say mercenary purposes. But yeah, that it can be more subtle in the sense that a performance for clicks can also be a performance to say who you are or want to be at a given juncture in your life, which can fail or succeed based on how it's received by others.

		I am rarely exposed to group dynamics on or offline where what you describe here as pragmatic does not appear to be the dominant pattern.  Whether or not its wielder is aware, and typically it seems they are not, in that people I am exposed to usually appear to consider their perspective to be semantically honest, when usually they are simply pursuing status, even when it is obviously to the detriment of others.
		
		All of this seems moot when you consider that our individual semantics emerge from the probalistic modeling of our brains, which appear to be variably limited in their accuracy relative to context, experience, even health (something that has ups and downs), and obviously many other variables.  One person's truth may depict something 20% less accurately than another's, despite good faith, while a liar might just as well accidentally be 90% accurate.
		
		In a world too complex to measure indefinitely in totality, where one must be content with rudimentary degrees of temporary accuracy, where honesty is a feeble human intention, whether it is a performance or not doesn't necessarily mean it isn't honest.

			Sure, this is another way to approach things, privileging semantics and private minds expressing rationality over the pragmatics of social situation. Less critical theory than a formal-linguistic or cogsci perspective.

	Infocracy by Byung-Chul Han might be interesting. 

	You can also find papers on the topic of ‚Äúslacktivism‚Äù which pretty much describes what you seem to be looking for.

		Wow, what a great term. Someone was feeling cheeky when they came up with that one. Thanks for the suggestion.

	I feel like I'm being pedantic and nitpicky by asking "what do you mean by performative, though?" but I have to ask that question because people use "performative" in two different ways. 

	The first way comes from linguistics, and it means that your speech act performs an action. For example, if I say to you, "I promise I'll get you a cinnamon raisin bagel at the store," I have just made you a promise. And if I fail to get you a cinnamon raisin bagel at the store, I have broken that promise. If I say, "I apologize for not getting you a cinnamon raisin bagel at the store even though I promised to do that," I have - just by saying so - apologized. 

	This concept has been expanded by people like Derrida and Judith Butler to talk about the ways one performs one's role in society, and especially Butler's ideas of gender as performance. 

	The other way people use "performative" is as an insult that basically means: "this person is not doing any ACTUAL activism, they just want to look good by putting a Palestinian flag (or Black Lives Matter, or some other slogan) in their social media bio." 

	It can get confusing when one definition is "speech that inherently has real-world consequences," and the other definition is "speech that has no real-world consequences." 

	Anyway, you might be interested in Guy Debord's "The Society of the Spectacle."

		The second one is always what it means when somebody talks about performativity in the context of social media ‚Äúactivism‚Äù.

	You're getting a lot of good responses, but you should also look into theory regarding Capital. A lot of posturing &amp; fronting in general is typically a strategy to don the literal vestiges of an ideology or ideological framework in order to capitalize in some way. Both on an individual level (someone pretending to know a reference you're making in conversation), to rainbow capitalism, etc.

	Capitalist Realism by Mark Fisher is a book with a lot of fans and a lot of scrutiny but it honestly provides a lot of foundation for this exact phenomenon. It's also notable for its accessibility as a work of theory.
