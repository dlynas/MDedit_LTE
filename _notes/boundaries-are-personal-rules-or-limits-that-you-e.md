## Boundaries are personal rules or limits that you establish to protect your well-being and maintain healthy relationships.

However, our boundaries should not focus on controlling or dictating the behavior of others (left side). This isn’t the purpose of setting boundaries. 

Boundaries should focus on your own behavior and what you will or will not tolerate. They are about self-respect and self-care, not about trying to change or control others. On the right side are boundaries that reflect this understanding - they communicate your own needs, preferences, and limitations without attempting to dictate or control the behavior of others.

Take care of your mind and body. Love, Nawal ♥️
