## Anyone got any book recs on the Zapatistas or Rojavo Revolution?

> I‚Äôd love to read a lot more about existent anarchist societies, especially how they‚Äôre structured and how they defend themselves from authoritarian assault.

	Not an anarchy but for Rojava you can start by reading about Abdullah √ñcalan, one of the founders of the PKK. I would look into Sak√Æne Cansiz as well.

	You can check Stephan Bertram-Lee's interviews, they are an ex YPG fighter that was stationed at Rojava.

	I don‚Äôt know about the Zapatistas, but Rojava is definitely not anarchist.

	They are literally a government.

		I believe they call it Democratic Confederalism. Not anarchism, but way cooler than virtually any other systems of governance on the planet in the present day.

		From what I've heard on a podcast (on *The Final Straw* I believe) about Chiapas (take it with a grain of salt) the Zapatistas will throw your ass in jail for being intoxicated. If that's the case, then not anarchist in the slightest.

			It‚Äôs true. Alcohol and drug use are illegal in Zapatista territory.

	I did a half-dissertation on Rojava back in 2017. If I remember rightly one of the most accessible reads, and quite comprehensive for being such a little book, was called "To Dare Imagining." But it's probably a bit dated by now given we're more than half a decade on.

	Viva Zapata by Steinbeck is a really fun, interesting read if you want something more story based than theory based- lighter faire mostly about just how cool as fuck Zapata was. Steinbeck was a bit obsessed with him. Also a great movie starring Marlon Brando

	while both Chiapas and Rojava have characteristics that many anarchists would find agreeable (like autonomy from surrounding governments, semi-horizontal decision making, the prominence of women), neither example is anarchist. not because i'm some wannabe anarchist gatekeeper, but primarily because neither regime uses the label for itself. Chiapas might be a semi-autonomous federation of communes, but they are still beholden to the Mexican state. Rojava might have a government that proclaims itself a model of democratic confederalism, but they are still beholden (at various times) to surrounding states plus NATO.   

	just because there's something like more horizontal decision making and more local autonomy than what anarchists in the global north are accustomed to seeing doesn't make either example so awesome that their obvious drawbacks shouldn't be examined as critically as anarchists do with their own societies. and the local conditions of each example should definitely be taken into consideration; culturally specific forms of self-organization don't necessarily translate that well to other places.

		>still beholden ‚Ä¶ to NATO 
		
		They get limited support from the US, but when one of their main opponents is Turkey - one of the founding member of NATO - who imposes an economic blockade, continued efforts to impose international isolation, support of anti-Rojava Islamist Syrian Civil War parties (including ISIL at times), etc‚Ä¶ is it really fair to say that they‚Äôre ‚Äúbeholden‚Äù to NATO at large? The reality of their alliances and struggles seems more nuanced and complex that that.

	"Open Veins of Latin America" by Eduardo Galeano covers the Zapatistas a good bit. Though the book is a pan-Latin American survey of exploitation, Zapata gets a particularly large section.  

	  

	"Anarchism in Latin America" by √Ångel Cappelletti also devotes a large section to Mexico and Zapata, and should be considered canon reading for Latin American radicalism imo- so many amazing people to follow up on after reading!  

	  

	Good luck with your studies!
