Biden/Harris promised to raise the minimum wage to $15/hr, but then refused to do it after getting elected, so it's stayed at $7.25/hr. And now they have the audacity to ask for $20 - the equivalent of nearly 3 full hours of work - to help them get elected again?

Nobody is falling for this anymore. We know that Kamala could've overruled the parliamentarian's non-binding advice to get it passed when they had majorities, but she and Biden chose to pretend they're weak and powerless instead.

Replying to @PushBidenLeft

I recalled it was the republican senators preventing this. In addition to the parliamentary rules. Please tell the truth.



1) This almost certainly would have failed. Manchin, Sinema and probably other Dems would have voted against the bill, claiming protest against the executive usurping Senate privilege or whatever high sounding nonsense they could come up with.

"This could've failed" Well we'll never know, because Joe "You have to vote for him because ONLY HE can work with Congress to GET THINGS DONE" Biden intentionally chose to not even try, folding before he even got to the negotiating table, because he clearly never wanted to do it.

Can you send me the link to your first screenshot? I found the second screenshot article.

Sen. McConnell is resigning. The most important fact about his tenure? "...his status as a peerless practitioner of the dark art of money-driven politics, which served as the indispensable foundation for his hold on the Senate machinery,"

I vividly remember that day

How dare you bring facts into this

I don't understand why they fear Trump being elected again when the all powerful parlementarian is there to limit his powers as president? 

Leftist critique of POTUS - started with Trump, now on Biden. Bad things are still bad when Dems do them. Tracking how "nothing would fundamentally change."
